<p>Please note that unverifiable information may not be added to Wikipedia. You must cite a published book, journal, or reliable website as a source for the information. Something which other editors can find and obtain in order to ensure that the information is verifiable.</p>
<p>The charter has been published in many place for instance in Phoenix Magazine of the Concord of cosmic people, where it is published with mahendranaths signature, later in the Book Tantra magick by mandrake and if i remember it right also in the magazine sothis and later in the magazine azoth published by sothis/ weirdglow, i will not waste my time here trying to verify facts that are known to anybody acquainted with the life of dadaji.</p>
<p>In the original version of E.E.E. published by sothis weirdglow, 1983 and also in the compilation "Twilight yoga" 1984 dadaji states that he had passed on the Parampara to Lokanatha.</p>
<p>In fact he was not able to pass any Parampara to Kapilnath in the 90ies because he retired from any active function in 1978.</p>
<p>To belive that one can transfer parampara and then 10 years later take it away annull the retirement is not in accordance with the ancient precepts of Siddha Tradition and can safely be ignored.</p>
<p>In places where it matters, this is known, if you like you can "0wn" wikipedia it is definetly not the place where succession of an ancient sampradaya is decided.</p>
<p>The endeavour to censor any mentioning of Mahendranaths long friendship and connection with Sri Lokanath and the AMOOKOS as if it has not happened, and to edit out external links to shivashakti.com which contains a lot of valuable information from reliable scholarly sources about the Nath Tradition, is futile and will only degrade the quality of information presented in wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mahendranath clearly stated in multiple published locations that he had <i>not</i> passed on parampara in the Adinath sampradaya. He also made it clear that the International Nath Order was not a new order, but simply his original Western Nath Order renamed, the old leadership kicked out and a new leadership installed. Before you persist, you might want to read <a href="http://opendoor.nathorder.org/1989/07/25/letter-to-kapilnath-zonule-of-25-july-1989/" class="external text" title="http://opendoor.nathorder.org/1989/07/25/letter-to-kapilnath-zonule-of-25-july-1989/" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Out of respect for Lokanath this has not been added to Wikipedia. If you persist, it will have to be documented. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.41.150.146_4ce2.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.41.150.146">71.41.150.146</a> (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.41.150.146.html" title="User talk:71.41.150.146">talk</a>) 21:16, 6 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Traditionally, a guru can change his mind at any time before his death, regardless of what he has previously said. This happens all the time when an intended successor defies or disappoints the guru in some way. The documentation that this is the case here exists and is easily accessible. Is this what Lokanath wants? I know I don't and I don't think he does either. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.41.150.146_4ce2.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.41.150.146">71.41.150.146</a> (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.41.150.146.html" title="User talk:71.41.150.146">talk</a>) 21:31, 6 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dl>
<dd>Finally, no one is censoring links to Shivashakti.com. Wikipedia policy requires linking to the page which is most pertinent to the article. If you will look at the links on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nath.html" title="Nath">Nath</a> article, you will see that one of them is to shivashakti.com, to the page most specificly discussing the Nath sampradaya. (It's the second link). If there is a better page on the site to link to, feel free to substitute it. But please be aware that adding a link at the top of external links or moving a link to the top will almost always be reverted on Wikipedia. New links should be added at the end of the list. 71.41.150.146 21:52, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If dadaji says later in his life he hasn´t passed on the parampara he either was lying or suffered from alzheimer disease, he never had any executive function in the western nath order nor in AMOOKOS, and it was not founded by him, but by lokanath. His only function was that of a retired counsellor.</p>
<p>It is simply impossible to confer and then revoke parampar AND do that after parampar was executed already for 10 years, this has never happened in India, such a thing can only happens if degenerated westerners assume positions in indian traditions they are not educated enough or fit for, the way Dadaji acted is a shameful example of the all too common misappropriation of ancient indian traditions that is marked by power struggle and people lacking accumulation of punya.</p>
<p>In the Kali Yuga all the indian traditions have sadly become a playground for mental instable and morally degenerated new age cultists of diverse varieties, without any respect for the tradition they pretend to follow.</p>
<p>It is anyway a misrepresentation of Hinduism that such a prominent place is given to a sampradaya in wikipedia under the heading of hinduism, while it is only one of the minor western new age cults founded on a mixed bag of some "eastern" and western ideas.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, you've simply been misinformed. Parampara is only transferred at the time of mahasamadhi and not at any other time, regardless of any misguided piece of paper which was later retracted. Whoever is in favor at the time of death is the successor. Also, Lokanath founded AMOOKOS, not the Western Nath Order. It's all documented, both in print and in letters. Dadaji was completely lucid up to the time of his death, and this is attested to by several visitors as well as the Patels. Yes, he had health problems. No, he did not have mental afflictions. You've been led down the garden path by someone who wanted to supplant his guru before his guru had passed away. This greatly offended his guru and his guru gave him <i><b>the shrap</b></i>. Your assertion that this never happens in India is false, there's even a word for it. Indians know what <i>shrap</i> means, ask one. Sad and ugly, but that's all. 71.41.150.146 16:25, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for retirement, just as any retired worker may go back to work at any time, so can a guru come out of retirement. Shri Mahendranath came out of retirement in August 1985 and took active charge of trying to correct problems and misapprehension on the part of Lokanath. This included the writing of many letters, issuing of statements such as <i><a href="http://opendoor.nathorder.org/1985/08/21/from-the-dark-into-light/" class="external text" title="http://opendoor.nathorder.org/1985/08/21/from-the-dark-into-light/" rel="nofollow">From the Dark into Light</a></i>. He continued to take an active role managing the Western Nath Order, <a href="http://opendoor.nathorder.org/1987/04/18/from-a-letter-to-kapilnath-of-18-april-1987/" class="external text" title="http://opendoor.nathorder.org/1987/04/18/from-a-letter-to-kapilnath-of-18-april-1987/" rel="nofollow">renaming it</a> in 1987 and <a href="http://opendoor.nathorder.org/1989/07/18/the-ultimate-promulgation-pronunciamento-of-hh-shri-gurudev-mahendranath/" class="external text" title="http://opendoor.nathorder.org/1989/07/18/the-ultimate-promulgation-pronunciamento-of-hh-shri-gurudev-mahendranath/" rel="nofollow">appointing new leadership</a> in 1989, going back into retirement as part of that act. To do so was his right as a living guru, whose living current word always trumps his past statements and actions. 71.41.150.146 16:54, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You misunderstand the situation, it was not Lokanath that looked for a Guru, he already had his own experience,it was Dadaji that was desperate that Sri Lokanath would accept parampara as the "new aeon leader"(dadajis Phrase), he (lokanatha) did this reluctantly and only under the condition that he is and will be independent and the one that is solely responsible for the new promulgation and dadaji retires from offical function. Dadaji influence was present but never the main focus in the Promulgation.</p>
<p>That was the reason why at that moment when Dadji started behaving like he did, revoking stuff etc. not a single of 80+ Initiates accepted or understood his disloyalty and not a single member of AMOOKOS took any of what he said serious.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Their loss. 71.41.150.146 17:24, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dadaji was only <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parameshti_Guru_6570.html" title="Parameshti Guru">Parameshti Guru</a>, for us that received diksha from sri Lokanatha, since when is it Tradition that Parameshti Gurus word is more important than instruction of your own Guru? Please try to understand that Dadaji was always and still is of lesser importance for AMOOKOS and i would even say of much lesser knowledge and Attainment than Sri Lokanatha.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wonderful. Then if Dadaji gave Lokanath the shrap, you should cease claiming to be of Dadaji's lineage. You are students of Lokanath, and he no longer has the right to claim lineage from Dadaji as he was revoked, excommunicated, and disowned. Following someone who has rejected their own guru has its downside. 71.41.150.146 18:03, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Really you do not understand what Guru devotion is, without Guru devotion you will never become a real nath panthi. Guru is shiva and shakti in human form, he is the final authority and you follow his instruction...thats why we do not care whether Dadaji was ranting in Mehmdabad or a sack of rice fell down in china.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I understand it perfectly well, having devotion to my guru who maintained his devotion to Shri Mahendranath. All links in the chain are needed to claim transmission. Lokanath now rests on his "previous experience" and you depend only on that. I don't know who his previous guru was, Muktananda, maybe? Kenneth Grant? Maybe he should see if Kenny will take him back... 71.41.150.146 18:15, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not that i know that Lokanath was ever lacking anything or i was ever dependent on anyone.</p>
<p>Parampara is not personal it is transpersonal it originates with Adinath. It is independent of ego ranting and also of Charters painted with felt liners and cute cutouts.&#160;:) Something smaller fits into something that is greater never the other way around.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are completely inconsistent. Why would you want to claim Parampara from someone you have characterized with the words "the way Dadaji acted is a shameful example of the all too common misappropriation of ancient indian traditions and his actions have all the marks of a shameful impotent childish power struggle"? Either Dadaji was a true guru or he was not. If you say he was not, then Mike never got anything from him in the first place. If he was, then Mike behaved disgracefully toward him. You can pick one or the other, but you can't combine aspects of both without coming off as inconsistent and simply wanting a label to apply to yourself, whether or not it is valid and regardless of whether you are entitled to it. Talk about "misappropriation"! 71.41.150.146 18:40, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You are assuming stuff here, first that i wish to be consistent i never had that wish, i don´t think consistancy exists in real life, even dadaji wasn´t consistent in first declaring Lokanath to be the Maharaj the world leader of the new aeon and then turning against him, was he? Then you assume i belive in such a thing as a "true Guru" i do not do that.</p>
<p>Then you assume that to show respect, Lokanatha and the other iniitiates, must all off a sudden follow orders of a person who just taught them to follow "Svecchaacharya" the path of doing ones own will and who promised to never interfere and give orders? We did do that we have learned the Lesson we are "svecchachari" and have choosen freedom and you? you are what? you are maybe only part of the Pashu Brigade by becoming slaves of the impotent orders of an old man? That way Dadaji is a true Guru he has created a path for the Viras and Svecchachari and has also shown a path for the slaves and the servile pashus.</p>
<p>A lot of Nath Panthis are inconsistent and insane like that my little servile brother.</p>
<p>Please realise that&#160;: I never liked any of Dadajis pamphlets, why should that prevent me from studying with Sri Lokanath for 10 years? He reintroduced authentic teachings into the mediocre assorted ideas of Dadaji.</p>
<p>For you information Dadaji had the highest respect for me-that did not prevent me from being desinterested in Dadaji work.</p>
<p>If we are talking about Nath Sampradaya we are not talking about one or two petty incarnations, a true nath panthi is part of the Parampara a little longer than that, thats why it is so funny and ridiculos to try to revoke something that you cannot even give, diksha is remembering of what you already are. If you think it is otherwise we are not talking about the same thing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, whatever you say. This one says: <i><b>Guruless young nobodies rationalize furiously, but only devotion gives grace.</b></i> And you can quote me on that.&#160;:-) 71.41.150.146 19:10, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Who is young and guruless when nowadays you can get good and cheap gurus everywhere in the U.S.A.&#160;:) And the end of this discussion is that you still will try to keep the biogaraphy in wikipedia of dadaji clean from his 10 years of cooperation with AMOOKOS and concentrate on the 2 remaining years pretending that these 10 years did not happen so that he might appear as a consistent person with a consistent politically correct biography? Good Luck ....</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are welcome to create an article on AMOOKOS. This article, <i>Adinath Sampradaya</i>, is not the correct location for information on that organization. Mike's charter doesn't even use the word Adinath. That's a projection that Dadaji did his best to dispel. But do be aware that you won't be able to exclude cited information about Dadaji's repudiation of Mike from that article. Though if you phrase it very carefully so that no claims which might be contradicted are made, I'm sure no one will bother it. See <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> for more information about reasons why you might not want to create such an article. 71.41.150.146 19:36, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, another thing you might want to consider. Wikipedia does not allow linking to sites which violate registered copyrights. The charter itself is of course a copyrighted document, and the transfer of copyright by Shri Mahendranath is clearly documented and registered with both the U.S. Copyright Office and the U.S. Library of Congress. AMOOKOS may have the right to bandy about the piece of paper, but they don't have the right to republish it. The introduction of this restriction was intentional on the part of the author of the document, and for precisely this reason: to prevent false claims from those he had disowned. 71.41.150.146 19:51, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your statement is entirely incorrect whatever Lies or Amendments he later fabricates , Dadaji wrote in his introduction to E.E.E. in 1982 the following:</p>
<p>This document "Ectasy Equipoise Eternity" is intended to be an investigation of Indias ancient wisdom, Natha magick and outlook, and accounts of Shri Dattatreya, the naked Mahatma, and his amoral outlook and way of life which formend the base of all Natha Teaching.</p>
<p>All this ancient lineage i have by iniitiation transmitted to Michael Magee and i have given him the sanskrit name of Shri Lokanath as grand master of the new order for the new aeon. Those who are wise and without blindness will know the next step to take. Mahendranath Gurudev</p>
<p>Now you come and tell me this is not about Adinath Sampradaya? What other ancient lineage is he talking about could you please tell me that?</p>
<p>I am not interested in writing any article about AMOOKOS I only dislike the way this article misrepresents Hindu Tradition and the History of this Nath Parampara.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a distinction between Natha and Adinatha. Dadaji was both. He passed on only the Natha initation, not the Adinatha. The charter says Natha, and wherever he writes about the Western Nath Order he writes Natha. Only in the history sections does he write about Adinatha. Where he used the word Natha, he did not mean to imply Adinatha. That is specifically the misunderstanding that he tried to dispel. Mike and AMOOKOS had become so attached to the label "Adinath" that they could not or would not understand the logical distinction which Dadaji was trying to explain. 71.41.150.146 20:08, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now you are joking&#160;:) You know that Dadaji only received Iniitiation into the AdiNath Sampradaya and he had no other Nath Guru than sri Lokanath from U.P. If you insist that he has been holding Parampara for two different Nath Samparadayas i will no longer discuss with you this is ridiculous, nowhere is this mentionend at least in none of his letters or publications prior to his "revocation". If he later fabricated a story like this then his fall was deeper than i imagined.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I'm not joking. That's the core of the issue that upset Dadaji. His initation from Lokanath had two levels, the general Nath initation, which could be given to anyone, and the specific Adinath transmission, which could only be given to a Sanyasin. As Dadaji was made a Sanyasin, he received both. But as he never made anyone else Sanyasin, he only gave the general Nath component and never passed on the Adinath specific component. To be an Adinath, one must have received the Sannyas Mantra, which Dadaji never gave to either Mike or Lalita. Reread everything with this in mind and you will see that his writings are absolutely consistent with this. He only wrote about himself and his predecessors as Adinatha. He referred to his western initiates and their initiates only as Natha. 71.41.150.146 20:19, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>He has fabricated this later on as he was beginning to notice that he was not that important to us, but the fact remains only very few received the diksha that included a set of sanskrit mantras, but it definetly was transfered whether you belive it or not. Look at the text above he wrote ALL the Lineage i transfered.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dadaji didn't write the Sanskrit initiation. The initiation he gave was in English. Mike wrote the Sanskrit initiation, based on the misunderstanding that he had been made an Adinath. A copy of the Sanskrit initiation was sent to Dadaji, and he denied that that was what he had given. All his wording is consistent with this understanding. Like I said, reread his writings with this in mind. You will find that the distinction was there from the beginning. He simply never imagined that he needed to make it explicit. He wrote "Natha" on Mike's charter, and nowhere made him an Adinath. 71.41.150.146 20:29, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is a lot of evidence that this is not since it includes stuff that is garbled sanskrit nobody knows the meaning lokanath would definetly have choosen some intelligble correct sanskrit not mangled "shabar" stuff.</p>
<p>This is only now a matter of whom we belive, Dadaji is notorious for having invented other stuff and presenting it as a nath teaching, he has invented titles that do not exists like having been ordained a "Mahalama" i title that does not exist, and i have evidence that he has been lying also about some other facts and details while Lokanath always was truthful to me.</p>
<p>If this is another Parampara than Adinath to which of the twelfe panths does that Nath Sampradaya belong-all this is very ahmm inconsistent&#160;:)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are welcome to believe what you want. But if you would start with the assumption that Dadaji didn't lie about anything or change his story, you will find that there is an understanding of what he said earlier and what he said later which is completely consistent. Read through his letters on <i><a href="http://opendoor.nathorder.org/" class="external text" title="http://opendoor.nathorder.org/" rel="nofollow">The Open Door</a></i> starting from the earliest and read them with the assumption that what I say is true.

<p>but i am sorry he did copy too often from other (rubbish) books like for instance the morning of the magicians from louis pauwels where he stole all the nath shambala agarthi stories verbatim, presenting it as original Nath teaching and heproduced so many other blunders that i cannot belive in the truth of his later fabrications. He was living in a world of his own fantasies. i have to stop discussing for today , getting tired cya</p>

<dd>Well, then, you must be rather embarrassed to be claiming Adinath succession from such a person. Maybe it would be better if you didn't. Since I am sure you believe that Mike never lied or made anything up, you must turn to him for support and comfort. But not as an Adinath, because if his guru was a liar, he never received it. And if his guru was telling the truth, he also never received it. And from what you are saying, it doesn't matter, since you see Mike as a great man without any need for the support of someone you consider such a dubious guru. Wouldn't you all be better off without this Dadaji for whom you have no respect whatsoever? 71.41.150.146 21:22, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You understand very little of the vamachara sadhu way they are not interested in worldly ways they do things backwards and sideways and do not care about clean or unclean truth or lies some even have commitments to lie and steal and behave as if drunk.</p>
<p>One can also be easily led astray by this path if you loose true nonduality, then you become enmeshed in evil ways. I don´t know when and why dadaji lied or whether he was enlightened or fallen or both and frankly said i do not care in the least, because he was not my Guru. I have insisted on that while he was alive and i still insist on that now. This is a strict rule in all Parampara that your Guru is the sole Authority. Dadaji did try to break that rule and went on an ego trip and went "fishing Lokanaths disciples" from the beginning i never endorsed or liked that behaviour and Dadaji and Lokanatha knew my opinion. I see his later failed try to attain executive power in AMOOKOS matters as a continuation of this behaviour.</p>
<p>As a vamachari he was entitled to act insane and beyond rules, but as he taught svecchachara everybody was entitled to cleave their own way and ignore mad monkeys from mehmdabad.</p>
<p>I had a unique relationship with Dadaji, while i was not much interested in his writings and his person nor did i ever think he had any higher attainments his attitude to me was the opposite like i mentionend before. You cannot grasp behaviour like this, it seems impossible to people with Pashu mentality, so they have to censor or ignore such Information.</p>
<p>This also is a typical mad behaviour. Avadhoothas have three traits they either behave child like "bala" or Mad "unmatta" or like a ghost "pisachi" or they show 2 or all 3 of these temperaments. Dadaji was showing traits of unmatta.</p>
<p>Do not try to judge what happened with your limited human understanding especially with the more "pagal" mad sort of sadhu a purely intellectual attitude will be more of a hindrance then a help in grasping what really occured behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Concerning Parampara it is not that anyone can claim parampara, that has to be understood first , if you do not understand the transpersonal nature of parampara and think it is an outward title that is confered by one human person to another we are talking about two different things. Prampara is a spiritual power that contains all the knowledge and all the vidyas in the form of a seed and it is transmitted in an uninterrupted chain from Adinath to the human guru that is physical present. Parampara is like a flame the guru only the vessel, ego the oil and atma the wick, true Parampara is consuming the ego, it is not the other way around, that the ego can claim Parampara and brag about it , but Parampara claims the person whether that persons likes it or not doesn´t really matter, it is not the Gurus decision to confer Parampara it is Adinath who rules that process.</p>
<p>Your information that dadaji never used the term Adinath in Connection with AMOOKOS Diksha is wrong, it was one variety of several ways he used to adress the Iniitiates. In many of the Pamphlets and leaflets that Dadaji wrote, like: "Yoga Vidya of Immortality" and that where included in the grade papers the Iniitiate was commonly adressed with either "AMOOKOS-Adinath" as in he brochure "Yoga Vidya etc." ,"Nath" and sometimes also "Kaula Nath". These papers were printed around 1981 and you could only object that lokanath edited the mss. if you object that it was Lokanath who edited the papers, think about the fact that that he had no reason to do so , because not special meaning was associated with the term, no Iniitiate ever thought there is a difference whether he was adressed by Dadaji or Lokanath as Adinath, Nath, Kaula Nath or any other title, so why should anyone have an interest in editing the material, to include the term "AMOOKOS-Adinath"&#160;? Besides the utter non significance of this detail it is fact that dadaji was in possesion of all the grade papers and in constant contact with many if not all active Initiates, and he never complained about any undue addition or editing, all off a sudden out of the blue 10 years later.</p>
<p>When Dadaji didn´t seem to care for 10 years in which way we where adressed by HIM for 10 long years, and then all of a sudden this petty matter of a naming convention should become of main importance and be the cause for revocations of diksha etc&#160;? this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Of course like i said before no one of the AMOOKOS Iniitiates understood what Dadaji was talking about, and why he all of a sudden became as narrow minded to make a fuss about some naming convention that never meant anything special to any of us. All this was was only about one varity he himself adressed us with. This was irrational and showed that he was loosing his grip on reality. Why he later lied to the I.N.O. Members and pretended there were two sampradayas and he he never gave Adinath Diksha, and started spreading the lies that we claim sannyas diksha etc.(which title btw is given only in smarta Sampradaya of sri Shankara Bhagavatpada, never in nath panth but because dadjis knowledge was very limited he mixed up all kind of assorted titles and Names indiscriminately) i don´t know and frankly after 16 years have passed this has no impact and is of no importance to anyone except some weird new age indopagan cultist and thelemites. 84.130.108.30</p>

<dd><i>The Yoga Vidya of Immortality</i> is a historical document. It refers to Dadaji and his Adi-Nath predecessors. The AMOOKOS grade papers were written by Mike, not Dadaji. Dadaji was in fact against having grades in AMOOKOS and in fact never intended for there to be a diksha into AMOOKOS at all, only into WNO. You can please stop being insulting and making assumptions that I don't understand Vamachara. Regardless of whether the guru is mad or changes his mind, it is the responsibility of the chela to follow his lead. Even though Mike's students cannot be faulted for following Mike, he himself broke his connection with Dadaji. He can claim Parampara all he wants, but Dadaji repudiated it and made sure that it was documented. Y'all are on your own. Mike has his own reputation and it mystifies me why he or his followers would want to continue to lean on his soured relationship with Dadaji as some sort of credential. As you say, it is of no impact and no importance to anyone. 71.41.150.146 15:27, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I could give you examples and quote from many texts that where written by dadaji that are contained in the grade papers, that adresses the Iniitiate as AMOOKOS-Adinath. These papers where not written solely by Sri Lokanath but contained input from both.</p>
<p>It is not an insult to be unable to understand the behaviour patterns of Vamacharis they are goverenend by their own Laws and Traditions and very few outsiders can understand them. That you have problems with that is clear by the fact that you consider lies or or copying or stealing vices, while a vamachari feels free to indulge in these vices while his core enligtenend being remains untouched by it and is only discernible to his disciples.</p>

<p>You seem to really think that this topic could be consider important and interesting enough by anybody to actually read it? you are a funny guy... 84.130.108.30</p>
<p>additional information: Sanyas diksha is confered only in the renunciate tradition of the Dasnami Shaiva sadhus of the Smarta sampradaya of Adi Shankara and when Hindus are entering the fifth Ashrama in old age. Contrary to dadajis ideas neither AMOOKOS nor Sri Lokanath never claimend to be sanyasins. Dadaji did claim it though he never was a dasnami. Paramahamsa is a title of the Brahma renunciates and the Dasnami sampradaya Both titles where claimend by dadaji which are unknown in Nath Panth. He claimend to be the last of the uttara KAulas which is also a hoax ther are plenty of Uttara Kaulas around, He claimend to be the last Paramhamsa which is a hoax there are also a lot of Paramhamsas around. It is unlikely that he is the last adinath since all his other claims are hoaxes. The generic Term Sannyasin can be used to denote any renunciate, not so the term sannyas diksha.</p>
<p>About sannyas Mantra: sannyas mantra is the secret 4th pada of the gayatri, dadaji seems to be completly unaware that a swecchachari is beyond ashrama and entitled to recite the 4th pada, and so there is no need for sannyas diksha for a Kaula or Natha that follows swecchachara.84.130.98.66</p>
<p>I don´t know of any Nath Tradition which had the requirement that only a person that had received the sannyas diksha, a part of the orthodx brahmanical vedic path, could become an Iniitiate. 84.130.84.126</p>
