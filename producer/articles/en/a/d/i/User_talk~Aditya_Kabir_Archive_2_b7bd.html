<dd>I have taken this picture (Jazmin i.jpg) from an website which has in turn taken it from an unspecified DVD capture. Though this pictures generally are supposed to be "fair use", and there is no indication anywhere that this particular picture is not so, I have tried and included as much information as I can. Since I know little of the use of license tags, and reading the special page have helped little to that regard I expect my fellow wikipeadians to help me to keep the picture posted.

<p>Every image I checked (and I'll freely admit that I did not check every single one) was licensed as a film screenshot. That means that the image may be used "for identification and critical commentary on the film and its contents", not solely to identify and depict a person. The gallery was not even identifying the films, let alone using the images to provide critical commentary on them. It was solely a gallery of people, thus was violating the image licenses.

<p><a href="../../../b/j/b/User%7EBJBot_e625.html" title="User:BJBot">BJBot</a> has deleted two images I uploaded (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Image%7EChaltikanaam.gif_91da.html" title="Image:Chaltikanaam.gif">Image:Chaltikanaam.gif</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/n/Image%7EGangulybros01.jpg_1c6d.html" title="Image:Gangulybros01.jpg">Image:Gangulybros01.jpg</a>), along with all the painstaking work that went into rationalizing fair use and citing sources and authors, because they were lying about quite orphaned. Very unfortunate, because I was busy at the time and could not check on WP much, if at all.</p>
<p>They were not orphans to begin with, but rather was a part of the <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganguly_family_%28films%29.html" title="Ganguly family (films)">Ganguly family (films)</a> article. A certain user (<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrince_Godfather_a20b.html" title="User:Prince Godfather">User:Prince Godfather</a>) removed them from the article and reinstated a completely copyvio image gallery removed much earlier from the page. This amazing deed was reverted by another user, but it was too late for the two images I mentioned.</p>
<p>Please note, that this particular user has been accused of sockpuppetry, has broken all civility guidelines, contributes a great deal without any regard for verifiability or citation policies, practices vandalism, was blocked from WP once or twice, is engaged in quite a few edit wars... and has responded very unfavorably when I questioned his behavior about the images in discussion.</p>
<p>I am checking this user as much as I can, though without the tools available to admins it's quite an arduous task. But, whatever happens to this amazing user, I'd very much like to have those images back on Wikipedia. I have learned the ropes for fair use policies the hard way, and am weary of the task of reinstating the info and rationales that require.</p>
<p>It would be very helpful if you could tell me what do I have to do in getting those two images back along with the rationale and info back to the article I mentioned. Can anyone help, please? <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> 15:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Both images were deleted by <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisza13_4392.html" title="User:Misza13">User:Misza13</a>, an administrator on English Wikipedia, on 9 February 2007, with the reason being: <i>Unused unfree copyrighted image.

<p>Hi. That wasn't really necessary to write such epic stories about the images, the user who removed them etc. It's absolutely no big deal when an image gets deleted, because it can be restored just as easily.
