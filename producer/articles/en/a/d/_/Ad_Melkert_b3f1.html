<p>Melkert came from a middle class family in Gouderak. His father was a barber. Melkert attended a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman-Catholic_c94f.html" title="Roman-Catholic">Roman-Catholic</a> <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_the_Netherlands_7a4a.html" title="Education in the Netherlands">primary school</a> in <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moordrecht.html" title="Moordrecht">Moordrecht</a> until 1968. He continued to study at the public Coornhert Gymnasium in <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gouda.html" title="Gouda">Gouda</a>, specialising in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts.html" title="Arts">arts</a>. In the last year of his secondary education he took a job in the market of Gouderak, working for a greengrocer. He graduated in 1974, he continued to study <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_science.html" title="Political science">political science</a> at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Amsterdam_ff6b.html" title="University of Amsterdam">university of Amsterdam</a>. During this time he became active within the leftwing Christian <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politieke_Partij_Radikalen_e6d2.html" title="Politieke Partij Radikalen">PPR</a>, he served as a member of the board of the Political Youth Contact, the youth organization of the PPR between 1978 and 1980. In the same period he was also a member of the general board of the Dutch Branch of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Movement_310e.html" title="European Movement">European Movement</a>, the chairperson of the Council of European National Youth Committees and the chairperson of the Dutch Platform International Youth Work. In 1979 he was also elected into the party board of the PPR, he was third candidate on the PPR's list for the 1979 European Parliament Elections. He graduated in 1981. For his masters' thesis he received the prize of the Dutch Society for International Relations, for best thesis of 1981. His thesis concerned the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_the_Netherlands_8022.html" title="Foreign relations of the Netherlands">foreign policy</a> of the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands_cabinet_Den_Uyl_4ca2.html" title="Netherlands cabinet Den Uyl">Cabinet Den Uyl</a>.</p>
<p>In 1981 he became general secretary of the youth forum of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Community_a343.html" title="European Community">European Community</a> in Brussel. As such he attended an illegal youth conference in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a>, which was ruled by <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinochet.html" title="Pinochet">Pinochet</a>, where he met his wife, Mónica León Borquez. Meanwhile internal tensions within the PPR heightened: Melkert was a member of the so-called 'blues' or 'Godebald'-group, which favoured closer cooperation with the PvdA and the social-liberal <a href="../../../d/27/6/D%2766.html" title="D'66">D66</a>. In 1981 the conflict came to an end: the so-called 'reds', who favoured closer cooperation with the leftwing socialist <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifistisch_Socialistische_Partij_37e7.html" title="Pacifistisch Socialistische Partij">PSP</a> and the communist <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communistische_Partij_Nederland_de43.html" title="Communistische Partij Nederland">CPN</a>, and the 'greens', who favoured an independent green party, banded together and many blues left the party for the PvdA, including Melkert. In 1984 he became the director of Internal Affairs of <a href="../../../n/o/v/NOVIB_80cc.html" title="NOVIB">NOVIB</a>, the Dutch branch of <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxfam.html" title="Oxfam">Oxfam</a>, and moved to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hague_6158.html" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>. He also became a member of the board of the local PvdA branch. In 1986 he published a book about <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_development.html" title="International development">International development</a> in the Netherlands called "The Next Minister: Development Cooperation within the Cabinet, 1965-19?".</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_Melkert_b3f1.html" title="Edit section: Political Life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political Life</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_general_election%2C_1986.html" title="Dutch general election, 1986">1986</a> Melkert was elected into the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Tweede_Kamer_4d6b.html" title="Tweede Kamer">lower house of parliament</a>. In the first years he was the party's spokesperson on foreign affairs, development cooperation and environmental affairs.</p>
<p>In 1987 his daughter Amanda was born.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_general_election%2C_1989.html" title="Dutch general election, 1989">1989 elections</a> Melkert became the financial spokesperson of the PvdA, as such he was the party's primary spokesperson in the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_the_Netherlands_%28terminology%29_cce6.html#Algemene_Beschouwingen" title="Politics of the Netherlands (terminology)">debates on the national budget</a>. Between 1990 and 1994 he was vice-chairman of the parliaments committee on finance.</p>
<p>As MP Melkert also participated in several board of civil society organisations: he was a member of the board of advisors of the Foundation Communication Development Cooperation, he was the chairman of the Foundation Development Cooperation <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almere.html" title="Almere">Almere</a>-<a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Sudan_0a71.html" title="Port Sudan">Port Sudan</a>, and he was he vice-chairman of the Atlantic Committee. Furthermore he had a collumn in the <i>Gooi en Eemlander</i>, a local paper in the region of <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilversum.html" title="Hilversum">Hilversum</a> and Almere.</p>
<p>In 1992 his daughter Elvira was born.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_general_election%2C_1994.html" title="Dutch general election, 1994">1994</a>, Melker became the Minister of Social Affairs and Employment in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_cabinet_of_Wim_Kok_7af1.html" title="First cabinet of Wim Kok">First cabinet Kok</a>. As such he was responsible for one of the main goals of the cabinet: in the words of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_the_Netherlands_%28terminology%29_cce6.html#formateur" title="Politics of the Netherlands (terminology)">formateurs</a>, "Work, Work and Work". As minister he was known for his working ethos: he had bought a <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail_carrier.html" title="Mail carrier">mail carrier</a>'s <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cart.html" title="Cart">cart</a>, which he would fill with dossiers each Friday, returning to work on Monday having read all dossiers. His working ethos can also be seen in the high number of policies and laws he initiated as minister.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1995 he initiated a plan to employ 40,000 longtime unemployed people. Unemployed people would be offered a so-called 'Melkert-job,' which was subsidized by the national government. Often these people would work in the public sector, taking a job such as <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tram.html" title="Tram">tram</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Conductor_%28transportation%29.html" title="Conductor (transportation)">conductor</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a> <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janitor.html" title="Janitor">janitor</a>.</li>
<li>In 1995 Melkert also published the note "the other side of the Netherlands", in whih he proposed several plans to combat and prevent silent poverty and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_exclusion.html" title="Social exclusion">social exclusion</a>. This led to the 1997 law <i>Prevention and Combat of Poverty and Social Exclusion</i>. It changed the social security laws and the old age pensions laws, giving municipalities more ways to give the poorest special social benefits.</li>
<li>In the same year he also wrote the note "Flexibility and Certainty" in which he made proposals for the flexibilisation of the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_market.html" title="Labour market">labour market</a>.</li>
<li>In 1997 he published the note together with De Grave, the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_the_Netherlands_%28terminology%29_cce6.html#Staatssecretaris" title="Politics of the Netherlands (terminology)">staatssecretaris</a> of social affairs, called "Working on Security", in which the future of the social security system was researched, it included plans to reform the way old-age pensioned are financed.</li>
<li>In the same year he also iniated a plan for so-called "white maids" which made the hiring maids by individuals, without paying taxes or social benefits, no longer illegal. The plan was supposed to combat unemployment of the lower educated and combat the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Informal_economy.html" title="Informal economy">informal economy</a>.</li>
<li>In 1997 he united all employment laws, like the Youth Work law, and the so-called Job-pools into one Law Activation Working-Seeking which gave municipalities more possibilities to employ the longterm unemployed.</li>
</ul>
<p>As minister of Social Affairs he often came into conflict with the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Party_for_Freedom_and_Democracy_8056.html" title="People's Party for Freedom and Democracy">VVD</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_Finance_5200.html" title="Minister of Finance">Minister of Finance</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerrit_Zalm_3f6c.html" title="Gerrit Zalm">Zalm</a>.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_general_election%2C_1998.html" title="Dutch general election, 1998">1998 elections</a> in which he was the fifth candidate of the party, Melkert became <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_the_Netherlands_%28terminology%29_cce6.html#fractievoorzitter" title="Politics of the Netherlands (terminology)">chair of the parliamentary party</a> of the PvdA. He also served as chair of the parliament's committee on <a href="../../../a/i/v/AIVD_3bbd.html" title="AIVD">Information and Security Services</a>. During his period as chairman the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Party_discipline.html" title="Party discipline">party discipline</a> thightened. The PvdA got the image of an arrogant governing party. He was quoted in saying: "we don't need to debate this, we already have a majority". He came in conflict with popular MP PvdA Van Gijzel, over the spokespersonship over fraud in the construction sector, soon after Van Gijzel left parliament. Melkert also upheld a politics of marginalizing and isolating the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Party_%28Netherlands%29_89b1.html" title="Socialist Party (Netherlands)">Socialist Party</a>: the PvdA MPs were forbidden to co-sign or even vote for any SP motions. Nonetheless Melkert was seen as a competent politician, and was the "crown prince," supposed to succeed prime-minister <a href="../../../w/i/m/Wim_Kok_105b.html" title="Wim Kok">Wim Kok</a>. In December 2001 Kok officially retired as political leader of the PvdA and Melkert was appointed to succeed him.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_Melkert_b3f1.html" title="Edit section: Elections of 2002">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Elections of 2002</span></h4>
<p>Melkert became the PvdA's <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_the_Netherlands_%28terminology%29_cce6.html#Lijsttrekker" title="Politics of the Netherlands (terminology)">top candidate</a> for the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_general_election%2C_2002.html" title="Dutch general election, 2002">2002 elections</a>. It was generally expected that either he or the VVD leader Dijkstal would become the next prime minister, and that elections would revolve around the question whether the conservative liberal VVD or the PvdA would become the greatest party.</p>
<p>The elections went in an entirely different direction, when <a href="../../../p/i/m/Pim_Fortuyn_0d35.html" title="Pim Fortuyn">Pim Fortuyn</a>, the flamboyant populist entered the elections. Fortuyn, who campaigned on issues like migration, integration and the state of the public sector, concentrated his campaign on the PvdA, intent on showing that that party was responsible for what he called the "ruins of eight years of purple". In several televised debates between Fortuyn and Melkert it became obvious that Fortuyn was the better debater and more charismatic politician. In the now famous debate on the night that the results of the municipal elections were made public, Fortuyn and Melkert debated. Fortuyn, who just won the elections in <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotterdam.html" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> made a lively enthausiastic impression, while Melkert sat slumped behind the table. This image dominated the rest of the election campaign. A later debate on the program <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netwerk.html" title="Netwerk">Netwerk</a> was also very typical for the different style of Fortuyn and Melkert: in the one-on-one debate, Melkert responded to every question of the debate leader with a detailed plan, and every time Fortuyn proposed one his plans he said: "Footnotes! Professor." Implying that Fortuyn's plan weren't realistic and lacked detail. This however created an arrogant image of Melkert.</p>
<p>During the elections the competent career politician Melkert attempted to humanize his image: it was revealed that he liked cooking (he published a cookbook on his personal website), and that he was big fan of <a href="../../../f/e/y/Feyenoord.html" title="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a>. Nonetheless the image of a somewhat boring bureaucrat remained. In May 2006 Melkert told politician-turned-television maker <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Rosenm%C3%B6ller_b80f.html" title="Paul Rosenmöller">Paul Rosenmöller</a> that "he had hid too much in the tower of the governor", creating a paternalistic image, "something which did not appeal to the voter."</p>
<p>During the election campaign, on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_6.html" title="May 6">May 6</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> Fortuyn was killed by <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkert_van_der_Graaf_4a30.html" title="Volkert van der Graaf">Volkert van der G.</a>. Consequently small riots erupted in the Hague, were Melkert was at the time. He left the city in a hurry. Melkert began to receive death threats, and he and his family were forced to go into hiding for a short while.</p>
<p>Melkert's PvdA lost nearly half its seats in the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Tweede_Kamer_4d6b.html" title="Tweede Kamer">Tweede Kamer</a> and went from 45 (out of 150 seats) to 23. The party fell from first place to fifth. Melkert resigned as political leader on the evening of the elections, he was replaced by the former speaker of the second chamber, <a href="../../../j/e/l/Jeltje_van_Nieuwenhoven_3ada.html" title="Jeltje van Nieuwenhoven">Jeltje van Nieuwenhoven</a>. Melkert stayed in parliament for a short while. His last major debate in parliament was on the state of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>.</p>

<p>In November, 2002 Melkert was appointed executive director of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Bank_2c67.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>, on advice of the minister of Finance, Zalm. In April 2005 he was a serious candidate to become Administrator of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Development_Programme_b84e.html" title="United Nations Development Programme">United Nations Development Programme</a> (UNDP), but the post went to <a href="../../../k/e/m/Kemal_Dervi%C5%9F_58ea.html" title="Kemal Derviş">Kemal Derviş</a>.
