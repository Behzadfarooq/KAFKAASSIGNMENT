<p>IMO phrases like "there are many fake profiles" and "the ratio of men to women is very high" greatly understate the extent of the problems with AFF's alleged service. If the site was free or ad-supported, it would not be a big deal. But the system is designed so that users are lured into upgrading to a paid account in order to respond to messages from interested "women". Only then does it become obvious that 100% of the messages are fakes. (Not an exaggeration -- I used their service for an entire month, and 11/11 of the messages I received were scams.) AFF has an obvious business interest in tolerating this situation (while insisting that they don't), and this is as close to being a scam as possible without being overtly illegal. In particular, critical content keeps dissappearing from this wikipedia article, and there is only one party who stands to benefit from the false impression that AFF has "some problems" but is otherwise legitimate. That party is AFF itself.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with everything you say and have seen the same thing myself firsthand. The problem is that the situation is very hard to quantify and Wikipedia has a policy against original research. We need to find a way that we can emphasize these criticisms without being libelous. The problem is that as far as I know no one has ever done any scientific research on fake dating profiles. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex3917_53fc.html" title="User:Alex3917">Alex Krupp</a> 20:07, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I’m not a statistician or a scientist. I’m just a carpenter. However i suspect that a statistical analysis of census data for a given state or region and male/female member ratios (over time) might indicate some trends (contrary to real life, supply will equal demand).</p>
<pre>
However a more common sense question might be, why would these incredibly attractive women post profiles, in the first place.
</pre>
<p>If they want to meet men for casual sex they would only need to go grocery shopping, or any other public place, there are plenty of options. If they wanted to be discovered by talent scouts there are better ways, i'm sure. As private dancers/escorts AFF might be an option, but is this their real picture, one would well ask. Again you might well ask yourself ,are there really women out there that look like this that want to date me. In my case the answer is yes, but i met them by chance, i certainly did not meet them online.</p>

<p>If the gender ratios, which everyone agrees are correct, are in your favor..why not take a chance? The term "joc-poc" is not well defined, but, indiscriminate gay men (and other msm) might well consider their options.</p>

<p>...........edit.....................</p>
<p>I would strongly advise anyone considering paying for membership to reconsider. Many of the profiles on the site are out of date with people having not visited for months. I started to get more and more suspicous about how many of the profiles were real people and started comparing different profiles. Certain sentences and phrases started to appear in many profiles. In fact many of the profiles contain the same information but in a different order. Phrases such as 'I'm a god fearing women' appear a lot, and you have to ask realistically how many 'god fearing' women would be advertising themselves on a website for sex?! Of the 5 emails I received in my month as a member 4 of the profiles were supposedly suspended by AFF for misuse and the other one was asking me to send money to an address. Its my firm belief that AFF are mis-selling their site and make hugely exagerated claims about the number of active members etc. In effect they are committing fraud. I'm sure AFF will remove this post rather than substantiating their figures as any ethical company would do.</p>

<p>Hi, do you know these ads of adult friendfinder appearing on many websites? They claim the girls are from your city but the just take names from profiles and mix them with cities near you!!! I discovered this when I clicked on a ad with a girl which should be from my hometown but on the a.f.f. site loading she wasn't listed. I searched her nick on the web and found her a.f.f. profile which included her real hometown! Thousands of miles away on another continent! --194.95.33.142 09:57, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Does anyone have information on how they "localize" your hometown just by using your IP address or whatever they're using?</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's even funnier, just keep refreshing the ad. The names will always be different, but after a while, you'll see the photos start to repeat, with different names under them. ;) I'm not saying AFF is a total scam, but their ads and other methods to get you to pay for a premium account are mostly a scam. 213.224.83.4 19:35, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's always funny to see a fan of the Steelers living at a industrial zone near Amsterdam Airport. --80.127.21.134 08:07, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I can say that the claim that 100% of the messages are fake is not true. I have met several very attractive (IMO) women on the site. I also have female friends to whom I have recommended the site. I have met women, real women after having been messaged by them. All of this is not to say that I have never recieved a fake message or seen a fake profile. I have seen dozens of profiles that had well known porno stars pictures attached to it claiming that she was the way the woman in question looked. But I have to wonder if all of that is AFF's fault. One woman I met told me that she used to use a porno picture as the picture on her profile and that she had only recently changed it to just a normal (non nude) face picture of herself. And before anyone makes the claim, I don't work for AFF, but I am a gold member and I think it's worth it. It has been for me. Just attempting to restore a little objectivity to the discussion about the site. <a href="../../../p/i/h/User%7EPihanki_69c0.html" title="User:Pihanki">Pihanki</a> 00:17, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Always keep in mind that ANY advertisement, personal or commercial or political, may be a fraud, may be substantial or some combination of both. You have to use your critical faculties. You'll never find substance without taking a risk, whether it be a car or a stock or a person. We keep hearing of successful matches, including out own. Granted, this is only anecdotal evidence. Paid services are far less likely to be suspect because they are likely to maintain staff to provide some degree of monitoring.</p>
<p>I agree. Critical and rational analysis is what is required here, not diatribes from men who are angry because the woman who looked like Jessica Simpson on AFF turned out to be a fake. I think a big part of my success on the site has been due to my abilty to spot fakes and eliminate them from consideration. But that also requires critical analysis.<a href="../../../p/i/h/User%7EPihanki_69c0.html" title="User:Pihanki">Pihanki</a> 00:57, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<pre>
as a couple we have been  aff goldmembers for 2 yrs, it does work but caution is suggested .
with  busy profesional lifes  the service saves time and effort , you simply search  , e-mail and meet  
like any dating  game ,the  good  looking  , rich or great personalitys get more  responses. but a well put together  profile, current  pictures and a few visits to the chat room will pay dividends.
