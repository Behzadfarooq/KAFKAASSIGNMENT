	    <p>Unbalanced Support for the African American Student-athlete</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Student athletes are under constant pressure to do well both on the court and in the classroom. Yet the support for on the court performance and academic success vary substantially. The sports that this statement holds true for are football and basketball. Commonly referred to as money making sports, which is due to the amount of money brought in by the two respective sports. In football teams are given up to fifteen million dollars just to play in a BCS bowl game. In basketball the NCAA tournament brings in about a billion dollars alone. It also brings recognition to a school that has made it to the tournament. Stakes are so high potential student athletes along with current student athletes are looked at as a commodity. Twelve percent of the nation’s population is African American. Only six percent of all college campuses are African American. Despite those numbers African Americans comprise sixty percent of men’s basketball players and fifty-four percent of division one football players. Although all student athletes are used for four years, the majority of white student athletes take advantage of their free education with a graduation rate of sixty four percent. African American student athletes graduate at a rate of forty seven percent. The large discrepancy in graduation rates is non existent for African American female student athletes. African American female student athletes graduate at a rate of sixty two percent. That’s fourteen percent higher then that of their male counterpart. The problem is worse between the two sports. Football graduates forty four percent of their African American student athletes, while basketball graduates an even lower and more pathetic number of thirty six percent of its student athletes. The student athletes themselves get blamed for these alarmingly low graduation rates. College coaches overlook important factors when recruiting the best talent the country has to offer. We will focus on basketball because of the lower graduation rate, along with the fact that I am currently student athlete who plays basketball. Coaches from all division one schools look for the players their budget will allow them. In basketball African Americans are targeted by these schools, because of the idea that African American players are better then white players. Because of that race plays a part when choosing a new coach. Will the coach be able to get black players? Are commonly asked questions when choosing new head coach. Winning is the first thing on the agenda for the majority of college division one coaches. For two reasons, the first being that they are most likely former players themselves, and they still have a very competitive nature, and overall love for the game of basketball. Secondly winning determines how much money a coach may make and also determines the job security of a coach. With family in mind along with a coaches competitive nature coaches do whatever it they can too be successful above all else. This may mean that they overlook important factors concerning the academic success of players before they even reach college. Coaches and players alike both know that traditionally white student athletes do better academically then that of African American student athletes. There are a couple of reasons this may be true, and these reasons constantly go overlooked when actually looking for solutions to the problem. The majority of African American kids that have a chance to play at the division one level in football or basketball, have poor grades in high school. Coaches tend to focus on certain attributes that are necessary for success on the hoop court not the classroom. A 2.3 and an 890 on the SAT along with any other requirements a school may have will get a division one prospect as players are called into most division one programs. If a regular student received those grades and that test score junior college would be the most likely option, but because the student is 6’10” and can hit a jumper from fifteen feet those grades are more then acceptable. In order to figure out why kids’ grades may be like that one would have to look at socio economic issues that may be affecting the child. At least fifty percent of all division men’s basketball players came from impoverished homes. With poor study habits and very little interest due to lack of success in the classroom, along with lack of positive academic support from school and at home, these young African American males head off to predominately white colleges where academic success measures how successful you’ll be after school. This leaves the student athletes feeling inferior from the minute one steps foot on campus. African American student athletes are scrutinized by white students, black students who don’t play sports, coaches, media, and administration including the majority of the faculty. When I asked African American student athletes about how they felt when they first step foot on college campuses the response was the same from all eight interviewees. They felt that they didn’t belong and that everybody looked at them as if they were dumb and not legitimate students. Unexpectedly they enter into these institutions unprepared to learn and appreciate the value of a degree. African American student athletes do not control their own identity. Most stereotypes of black men are not positive. The majority of the student body is scared to get to know the young African American males because of assumptions made by the student. Instead of getting to know the athletes they make their own depiction of us which in most cases isn’t true. Coaches who over look the fact that a lot of these young African American men were not “good students” and in fact most of them hated school also come up with their own idea of person without looking at the possibility of their being any outside factors that may or may not have led the young men to be the way he is. Coaches label certain kids that don’t do what is asked of them academically. I never understood how one could get mad because a young man who didn’t have any study habits in high school doesn’t see the importance of study hall in college. Schools reward bad students with free educations based on their athletic ability, but get mad when they can’t perform in the classroom consistently or effectively. Young African American males become confused by this. Everybody on campus sees these young African American student athletes as basketball players. They are rewarded for their success on the court with new shoes and during the tournament play more per dium and gifts from sponsors of the NCAA tournament. Usually back at home the African American student athlete is the first to go to college in his family. On top of that he will be playing a sport that may get him to the pro division either the NBA or overseas. The majority of the time a player’s family has no interest in the academic side of college. With an emphasis from his head coach on winning along with his own personal reasons African American student athletes feel they have no choice but to try and make it to the league. Coach’s hold a players desire to go pro over the players head. Telling him such things as if you don’t go to class ill have to tell NBA teams when they call that you are irresponsible. To an African American from the inner city hearing that puts the coach in a category I like to call the gatekeepers. Gatekeepers are any institution trying to keep poor people of color down. In the inner city you have the police, poor education, real estate, poor health care, welfare agencies, banks, insurance companies, in some cases churches, and various other government agencies such as the FBI, and the DEA. When a coach tells a young African American student athlete from the inner city that he has the power to make or break ones dream of making it to the NBA based on your ability to perform in the classroom that usually doesn’t make sense to the player. African American players frequently ask the question “what does my school work have to do with me playing on the court?” Instead of focusing on ways to improve education they focus on ways to penalize the “bad students” they rewarded with free educations. Programs could care less if one cheats as long as the player doesn’t get caught. Coaches should be honest from the jump and tell kids that winning is the most important thing. Coaches tend to act like academics are the most important thing. All this does is leaves African American athletes with a false perception of what they are really brought to the school to do. Most kids growing up in the inner city are taught to “believe half of what you see, and none of what you hear.” That has to do with the distrust the black community has towards outside society and the United States government making promises that were never fulfilled. If somebody isn’t being honest or real with a young African American student athlete how is that student athlete supposed to take a person serious? African American kids are often angry and misunderstood. Most kids relieve their anger almost subconsciously through sports. When one is good at a sport it usually makes you feel better when you achieve some sort of success within ones respective sport. The anger itself usually comes from growing up with little, and seeing people more. The desire to have what African American entertainers, famous African American athletes, and neighborhood drug dealers have grows from the time they get to kindergarten. Kids get ridiculed for having little money and Kmart kickers; usually end up doing whatever it takes to make money when they get older. The lack of opportunities in the work place gives young African American males life choices to make before and during high school. In an article written by Rick Wormeli he talks about the development of a child by saying:</p>
<p>The ways we deal with conflict, relationships, and personal development as adults have direct connections to specific experiences we had between the ages of ten and fourteen. We can create a very positive future, then, when we provide careful and compassionate experiences for today’s young adolescents.</p>
<p>The young kid looks at his grandparents who are old but still have to put in long hours at work. He then sees his parents scrambling to make ends meet. When you’re young you tend to think short term. If you’re in sixth grade with Kmart kickers on and you got a couple of older cousins and some of your friends that are your age are hanging with them making money buying Jordan’s, and needing only food and shelter from their parents. You might not join them but it becomes a dilemma when one thinks about the six more years of public schooling and if there is a desire to make real money four more years of higher education. Consequences go out the window and whatever that person chooses he has to live with that decision for the rest of his life. The physiological effect that has on young kid is unimaginable. Wormeli goes on to say that “early adolescence is the last point of effective intervention before their reversible downward spiral toward self destruction that can occur if we do not provide developmentally responsive learning environments for these students.” A kid may start to feel like basketball is his only way out. None of these factors come into play when talking about solutions to the problem of African Americans and their alarmingly low graduation rates. When an African American student athlete does well in school it’s the exception not the rule. African American athletes are exploited and brought to college institutions to play their respective sport, not to do well in the classroom. A lot could be done to help the success of African American student athletes in the classrooms. The NCAA should implement school awareness programs in not only high schools but middle schools as well. All college coaches white and black should have to go through undoing racism workshops in order to get a grasp of what really happens in our society to people of color. Basketball academies that stress the importance of knowledge should be started for those who want and have the potential to make it to the next level out of high school or college. Just like the vocational schools for various occupations. There needs to be more community involvement by players already in college. The presence of positive role models will not only encourage young African American kids to want to succeed in the classroom, but it would also make the college student athletes feel more obligated to do well in the classrooms. Instead promoting community awareness, they tell African American student athletes they need to be the same people holding their communities down. Not knowing the young African American male is being pulled further away from his community in which he came from. Society is made up so few people will actually be successful and the rest foolishly chase after something they can’t have. With four hundred and fifty roster spots and most of them filled getting to the NBA according to the numbers is impossible yet it is the dream of every little black kid growing up in the inner city. Isn’t it ironic?</p>
