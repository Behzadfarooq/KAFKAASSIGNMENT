	    <p>This is a Essay about Lord of the Flys (LoF).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Defend and/or criticize Ralph’s actions as a leader? What were his motivations? Did he contribute to the tragedy in any way? Could he have acted to prevent any of the deaths? How do you define a good leader? What would you have done differentially? ________________________________________________________________________________________________ Ralph in the start of Lord of the Flies was a good leader. He brought together a group of kids who were broken up and scattered across the island. Ralph maintained the kids for a little while until Jack interfered. Simon and Ralph were building huts on the beach. They were building the third and final hut which was very dangerous and badly built. Most the bigguns helped with the first huts and very few bigguns helped with the second hut. Jack’s hunters were not helping because they were hunting. The hunters were also hunting when they should have been watching the fire. Jack before he actually separates from the tribe already acts like a sub tribe. The hunters do not see the rest of the tribe until the twice a day meetings and sleeping at the huts. Ralph should of limited Jack’s hunting time. Ralph should have been able to order the hunters around to make them maintain the fire, a few hunters hunt, and then a few hunters can help with building the huts. This is the very beginning to Ralph’s downfall in power. A group almost completely separated from the tribe ruled by a different person, Jack. I think Ralph’s motivations were keeping everyone fed, hydrated, and rescued. Ralph accomplished two but he failed to take control of the hunters to maintain the fire. The fire is one of their best chances of getting rescued but the hunters fail to keep it going. Ralph did contribute to the tragedy by not maintaining control. He was letting his power slip. If someone tells you to not to do it and then you do it again then nothing happens your going to continue doing usually. So Ralph was in charge but he never exercised his power. If he told the bigguns and hunters to listen the tribe could have gotten things done. If someone failed to do his duties they should have been punished. So he contributed to the tragedy by letting chaos control the tribe into a rebellion. If Ralph exercised his power when he was first put in power he could of maintained control throughout the whole book. Ralph could have prevented the two deaths by never letting the boys getting out of control. A good leader is a person who has fair and equal rights to all under his or her control. They exercise their power and prevent criminal/rebellious activity by doing it fairly and equally. The people who break the rules or laws should be having action taken upon to them with out any breaks in their sentence. Pleases the people with programs that benefit society. The leader should use time effectively and efficiently with out lacking quality in the project they are doing. If I was Ralph I would of have taken control and not allowed the boys slack around and do nothing. Keep the boys happy by have them not just hunt but have water ready, a group building things like huts, and fire roaring on the mountain. I would form the bigguns into five groups. One group to hunt, another to keep water coconuts filled a group building and maintaining the island, fire made and one group to have a day off. They would switch off each day for jobs. So Jack, Piggy, and Ralph would be satisfied by fulfilling the activities they enjoy.</p>
