<p>the recent product by mountain dew, Mountain Dew MDX, is doing it's Staysharp.tv promotion on this channel, but instead uses trivia from the episodes of the show that is currently on (Mostly Futurama, Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Metalocalypse from what i see.) should this be noted? <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChomperz_ac5f.html" title="User:Chomperz">Chomperz</a> 04:21, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I really don't see the point of including the complete schedule here.

<dd>No, they're absolutely right. Wikipedia is not for schedules, it's not supposed to replace tv.com or any other website/periodical devoted to tracking episodes. It's a freaking encyclopedia. The mission of Wikipedia is not to monopolize the information on the internet, it's function is simple and defined: a free encyclopedia. This does not in anyway entail or suggest that it should function as a way to track what shows are being shown by a channel. If you have any doubts, compare this article with other such articles on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwazzap_3d0f.html" title="User:Mwazzap">mwazzap</a> 08:25, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ohh, whats that? A schedule on the Toonami page. Hmmm...</p>
<p>Look, one of the biggest complants against Adult Swim is the changing schedule. Also, what the hell do you think that Wikipedia is if not a resource for infomation? As a free encyclopedia, Wikipedia goes well beyond the function of a normal encylopedia. One look at the type and depth of infomation here on this website can tell you that! As the schedule is a huge part of Adult Swim, it should be here on wikipedia and it needs to be kept up to date. If you don't want to do that, that's fine. I will take that responsibility. <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDposse_bcc1.html" title="User:Dposse">Dposse</a> 17:12, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Many major network pages on here included season schedules, so IMO if they get to keep schedules, then so does this one. However, it should only be updated for long term changes, not one time pilots or experiments.</p>
<p>Anyway, taking a page from the major network pages, I whipped up this:</p>

<p>As long as you are going to title the listing of shows "Past, Present, and Future" you may as well have the year dates listed in parenthesis after the show link. This way persons browsing the article entry will know which slot the show listed falls under. I put a few of them into place already, mostly for the 2004-2005 shows.</p>
<p>I fixed up the shows listing with some missing shows/movies, and added the broadcast years to the best of my knowledge. Due to the often chaotic nature of their scheduling, I only included the premiere years for the canceled and ended series (i.e. most of the anime). --SwordfishII 03:13, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Why "anime" and "non-anime" headers? Doesn't Adult Swim itself divide them into Adult Swim Action and Adult Swim Comedy, with different department heads et al.

<p>I challenge the notion that [adult swim] is actually aimed at adults. Nearly all of their programming is TV-14 (only recent re-grading has produced anything TV-MA). I think the primary audience is teens/college students. --<a href="../../../f/e/i/User%7EFeitclub_dad9.html" title="User:Feitclub"><i>feitclub</i></a> July 5, 2005 22:46 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Adult Swim (which is rated seperately from CN by Neilson) is the #1 cable network with adults 18-34. "Adult Swim makes it into its tenth week straight as #1 in total day delivery in key young adult demos, according to Nielsen Media Research. The block ranked #1 among ad-supported cable networks for total day delivery of adults 18-34, adults 18-24, men 18-34 and men 18-24." <a href="http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=771" class="external free" title="http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=771" rel="nofollow">http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=771</a></dd>
<dd>Those parental guidlines aren't for adults. Adults can watch a program of any rating. What makes a program geared toward an older audience isn't the level of violence or sex. --<a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESketchee_ce7e.html" title="User:Sketchee">Sketchee</a> July 6, 2005 04:08 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Indeed TV-14 may interest adults, but the point is that Cartoon Network has deliberately and openly admitted that it will not cross the line to "TV-MA" out of concern that the image would cause concern among parents and thus have negative market consequences for its daytime programming. (Comedy Central has less of a concern and freely runs TV-MA cartoons at night). The fact that Cartoon Network/Adult Swim are now to separate "networks" or "stations" has changed nothing in this regard. Furthermore, although CN/AS themselves have said nothing to the press to indicate any such plan, it is a well-established marketing strategy to advertise openly for one age group with the full knowledge and hope that such advertisements also appeal to the immediately lower age group. For example, it is common knowledge that "R-rated" movies widely appeal to teens of all ages-- teens who find little difficulty in gaining access to these films despite being younger than seventeen. Advertising of a type for adults, but rating of a type for teens... I believe I see why AS does not want to offend parents. Traditionally, the 18-34 male demographic is highly valued for marketing. I do not doubt that Adult Swim aims its programming largely or even primarily at this group. However, based on available evidence (Ratings, advertising style, programming choice) I propose that Adult Swim does not aim exclusively at adults. And therefore agree to the above challenge in a way, and recommend a change. -anon business dude</p>

<p>The article says that "The current bumps feature black "cards" with white text on them, which discuss everything from news about the programming to personal staff opinions on unrelated subjects." But I find that's not always the case, at least with some of the shows I watch. I don't actually watch many different shows on Adult Swim, but I do know that at least the two shows Futurama and Inu Yasha have different bumps; Inu Yasha's bumps seem to just be kinda random signs (and a bit of Japanese) against kinda random backgrounds, except for the one to signal the start of the show, which is the words 'Inu Yasha' sliding onto a blue background and then a little white dog in a cart at the bottom barking. I don't quite remember Futurama's bumps, but they definitely aren't the black cards with white text. StarPrincessLita 15:22, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was wondering if perhaps mention should be made of what seem to be a recent downturn in fan sentiment regarding the line-up? Several commentators have cited the lackluster response to premieres like Squidbillies and 12oz. mouse (several conversations have even centered on whether the latter is some sort of attempt at getting people to watch a show that is purposefully unfunny). There has also been an marked drop in viewers in the action/anime segment, with S-CRYED and to a lesser extent Samurai Champloo receiving less interest than, say, the spring 2005 lineup.</p>

<dd>Vanity material. The guy is a freakin' joke. He wants to be hired by Adult Swim without going through the turnerjobs.com website that 99.9% of people hired by the company have to/have had to/must go through. Actually, if you want to be technical, he'd be hired by Time Warner, then placed into their Cartoon Network division, then eventually filtered into a position for Adult Swim (like the Junior Writer position or Flash Animation position or whatever). But at any rate, it's just some dork with a beard trying to stand out in the crowd and hoping like Hell that it works enough to find him a job at Adult Swim as . . . well, I don't really know what he wants to do. If you look at his resume I'm guessing some sort of animator job.</dd>

<dd>At any rate, I deleted the links -- and I don't doubt he put them up himself in the first place. What a dweeb, and a LAZY dweeb at that. I can admire his iniative, but as one who wants to work for Adult Swim myself, and who has no "connections" inside -- thus being forced to whore out through the turnerjobs.com site and go up against hundreds, if not thousands of applications -- I think he's a douchebag for even trying this. I've stated as such to him in e-mail, and he took it as a joke. Go figure. I don't see any reason to put the links back in, unless he gets hired by them, in which case perhaps put them back in to show "hey, here's some dumbass who made himself stand out and be noticed by Adult Swim by ACTING like a dumbass."

Your lame attempt to be hired by Adult Swim without going through the Time Warner/turnerjobs.com website like the rest of the free world is pathetic, sad, and ignored by all.

<p>Why are you so upset by Charles McCarthy? If you want a job at Adult Swim too, maybe you should be friends with him and work together with him to get hired.

<p>I don't see the problem with this young lad's additions to the Adult Swim article. He doesn't erase anyone elses entries. His additions are not obtrusive. As far as validity to an encyclopedia entry, I think that there are quite a few things in this article that could be removed. Plus, how do we know that this didn't happen? I for one found his website very interesting and I wouldn't have found it without Wikipedia. If Wikipedia is truely about the desemination of information in the advancement of learning, I can't see why so many people are so violently opposed to this young man's entries.

They put fart noises in the Fullmetal Alchemist and Ghost in the Shell episodes, while playing the Mr. T, Chuck Norris, and Boo Boo Runs Wild cartoons. <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDposse_bcc1.html" title="User:Dposse">dposse</a> 03:40, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Right. Well, first off, sign your comments, kids. Three of these: "~". Pretty simple. Second, You don't have to capitalize the fist letter of every word. Or is that just the site censering your sadistic abuse of the caps lock? Whatever the case, if you don't understand proper use of capitalization, don't capitalize. When I was younger, I didn't. Third, Adult Swim is a proper block. The people behind it used to work on Toonami. Yeah. "Kids love it". I'll admit, the recent stuff isn't alwqays high quality, but it's not always "filthy" either.

<p>last night I was surfing the channels and saw an adult swim warning bumper, but instead of saying "Adult Swim may contain material that parents might not find suitable for viewers under 14" It sayed "Adult Swim may contain material that parents might not find suitable for viewers under <i>17</i>" Is this how it's going to be from now on?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, ever hour, except the 10:30 and 11:00 gap, it shows that bump. It only shows the "viewers under 17" bump if the procedeing hour airs a show that is rated "TV-MA." Otherwise, it still shows the "viewers under 14" bump.</li>

<p>On the <a href="http://www.adultswim.com/schedule/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.adultswim.com/schedule/index.html" rel="nofollow">schedule</a> at the Adult Swim website, there is an entry for "S Gun", with a note saying "Smoking Gun", for the weeks of October 23 and 30 (M-Th).

<p>If anything, Eureka Seven will become the first show to need the "American Cowboys" extra disclaimer back-to-back-to-back (3 in a row) assuming that they mark Ep. 28 with it. <a href="../../../h/e/e/User%7EHeeroyuy135_3f61.html" title="User:Heeroyuy135">Heeroyuy135</a> 04:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've added 2 tags to it recently: cleanup-laundry (list cleanup basically) and advert (for advertisement). The article has a few good starting paragraphs...then goes downhill. It has a current schedule and coming soon sections. Wikipedia isn't a TV guide, nor should it ever be. Plus there is a huge trivia section that needs to be cleaned as well. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 06:05, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>After <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">Fox</a> cancelled <i><a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a></i>, Adult Swim began airing reruns of the show on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_20.html" title="April 20">April 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. Being on a cable network, Adult Swim's edition of Family Guy was less censored. Unlike its days on Fox, Family Guy has had consistent time slots since, at either 11 p.m. or 11:30 p.m. Eastern time, with <i><a href="../../../f/u/t/Futurama.html" title="Futurama">Futurama</a></i> at the other slot (Fox moved Family Guy around to as many as 28 different time slots before officially canceling the show in 2002). That, along with the show being released on DVD at the same time, brought unexpected popularity to the series and eventually ended up convincing Fox to bring back the show<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>, which began re-airing in May 2005. Under a special agreement with Fox, Adult Swim airs the new episodes at least two weeks after they debut on Fox, but Fox must have advertising for Adult Swim during the show's airing on its network. Included in the same deal was <i>Family Guy</i> creator <a href="../../../s/e/t/Seth_MacFarlane_3735.html" title="Seth MacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a>'s new series, <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Dad%21_8413.html" title="American Dad!">American Dad!</a></i></li>

<li><i><a href="../../../f/u/t/Futurama.html" title="Futurama">Futurama</a></i> has also found new life in syndication on Adult Swim, enjoying high ratings as a benefit of also receiving a steady time slot. When it aired on Fox, <i>Futurama</i> was put in the virtually dead-air time of 7:00 p.m. The biggest drawback was that many televised sports (especially football) ran late into this programming block, so <i>Futurama</i> was constantly being pre-empted by sports; more often than not, the episode was completely skipped while other programming would air in their entirety later that night. The high ratings has also helped the show to get four direct-to-DVD movies greenlit and possibly new episodes<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>. The show will move to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy_Central_c9d4.html" title="Comedy Central">Comedy Central</a> once AS's rights to the show expire in 2008.</li>

<dd>We've discussed this already(look up). The schedule stays for two reasons. One, it's the central thing about adult swim. that's basically all they are. Second, this article isn't the first to have a schedule. Go look at the article for <a href="../../../t/o/o/Toonami.html" title="Toonami">Toonami</a>. The schedule has been there for a very long time, and no one has ever touched it.

<dd>I really hate to get into the whole "we can do it if that article does it" thing. People need to remember that we can't fix every problem at the same time. If something is a good idea, then it should be able to stand on it's own, not simply because we can find another article that does the same thing. It's a horrible loop, because you can't get it off article A because article B has it, but article B has it because article A has it. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 06:32, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
