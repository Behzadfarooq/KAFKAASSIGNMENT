<p>Hot Adult Contemporary was introduced in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> as a hybrid of <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_40.html" title="Top 40">Top 40</a> and <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldies.html" title="Oldies">oldies</a>-based Adult Contemporary. The format was designed to appeal to adults who liked pop music but also liked more era variety than Top 40 offered. The first Hot AC station was <a href="../../../w/w/m/WWMX_%28FM%29_b556.html" title="WWMX (FM)">WWMX</a> (Mix 106.5 - "Baltimore's Best Mix of the 60's, 70's and 80's"). New songs with sufficient adult appeal that weren't too soft were mixed with popular <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldies.html" title="Oldies">oldies</a> that weren't too old. By the early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> "Mix" stations appeared in most markets in the US. "Star" is another popular nickname, pioneered by <a href="../../../k/f/m/KFMB-FM_7f2a.html" title="KFMB-FM">Star 100.7</a> in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_36a0.html" title="San Diego">San Diego</a>, which is now known as <a href="../../../k/m/y/KMYI_c4f6.html" title="KMYI">Star 94.1</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Hot AC radio stations tend towards slightly harder <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock music</a>, such as <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenny_Kravitz_72d8.html" title="Lenny Kravitz">Lenny Kravitz</a> and <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerosmith.html" title="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>, and may occasionally play <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_music.html" title="Dance music">dance</a> hits, such as those by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paula_Abdul_c06c.html" title="Paula Abdul">Paula Abdul</a>, <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kylie_Minogue_fac0.html" title="Kylie Minogue">Kylie Minogue</a>, and <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nina_Sky_ff12.html" title="Nina Sky">Nina Sky</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a>'s more upbeat songs "Music" and "Ray Of Light" were big hits on Hot AC, but were not played on Soft AC stations, which are more likely to play her songs "I'll Remember", "Crazy For You", "Live To Tell" or "Take A Bow". Hot AC is slightly more <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_music.html" title="Alternative music">alternative</a> than Soft AC—<a href="../../../3/_/d/3_Doors_Down_fabd.html" title="3 Doors Down">3 Doors Down</a>'s "When I'm Gone" was a considerable Hot AC hit but is not played on Soft AC radio stations. All five of the hit singles from <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alanis_Morissette_39bf.html" title="Alanis Morissette">Alanis Morissette</a>'s <i><a href="../../../j/a/g/Jagged_Little_Pill_6cd8.html" title="Jagged Little Pill">Jagged Little Pill</a></i> are also staples of this format.</p>
<p>Some Hot AC stations have begun adding <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">rap/hip hop</a> music to their playlists to compete with <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_40_%28radio_format%29.html" title="Top 40 (radio format)">Top 40</a> stations, but play less <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">rap/hip hop</a> than their <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_40.html" title="Top 40">Top 40</a> counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Soft AC</b> is also known as "lite" music, and many radio stations across North America that play Soft AC refer to themselves as "lite" stations. <a href="http://www.chfi.com" class="external text" title="http://www.chfi.com" rel="nofollow">CHFI</a> is a good example. Other popular nicknames include "Magic", "Warm", "Sunny", and "<a href="../../../e/z/_/EZ_Rock_09ae.html" title="EZ Rock">EZ Rock</a>". The format can be seen as a more contemporary successor to the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_of_the_road.html" title="Middle of the road">Middle of the road</a> (MOR), <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beautiful_Music_74d3.html" title="Beautiful Music">Beautiful Music</a> or <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easy_Listening_9779.html" title="Easy Listening">Easy Listening</a> formats. The latter two were once common on FM radio. Sometimes, the margins blur between this genre and <a href="../../../s/o/f/Soft_rock.html" title="Soft rock">soft rock</a>. And a few "lite" stations, such as <a href="../../../w/l/t/WLTW_8df3.html" title="WLTW">WLTW</a>-FM in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <a href="../../../w/s/b/WSB-FM_b916.html" title="WSB-FM">WSB-FM</a> in <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta.html" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, <a href="../../../w/y/j/WYJB_af9e.html" title="WYJB">WYJB</a>-FM in <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albany%2C_New_York_1b4f.html" title="Albany, New York">Albany, New York</a>, and <a href="../../../w/j/j/WJJY_130b.html" title="WJJY">WJJY</a>-FM in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainerd%2C_Minnesota_86d6.html" title="Brainerd, Minnesota">Brainerd, Minnesota</a> have actually started to mix in more "Hot AC" songs into their playlist as well.</p>

<p><b>Urban AC</b> is a form of AC music that is geared towards adult <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a> audiences, and therefore, the artists that are played on these stations are most often African-American. The Urban AC stations are more similar to Soft AC than they are to Hot AC, and the music they play is predominantly <a href="../../../r/%26/b/R%26B_2a8f.html" title="R&amp;B">R&amp;B</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_music.html" title="Soul music">soul music</a>. This is reflected in many of the Urban AC radio stations' <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tagline.html" title="Tagline">taglines</a>, such as "Today's R&amp;B and Classic Soul", "The Best Variety of R&amp;B Hits and Oldies" and "(City/Region)'s R&amp;B Leader." Some popular nicknames for Urban AC stations include "Magic" (borrowed from Soft AC), "Mix" (borrowed from Hot AC), and "Kiss" (borrowed from <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top-40.html" title="Top-40">Top-40</a>).</p>
<p>A more elaborate form of Urban AC is the <b>Rhythmic Oldies</b> format, which focuses primarily on "Old School" R&amp;B/Soul hits from the 1960s to the 1990s, including <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motown.html" title="Motown">Motown</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disco.html" title="Disco">disco</a> hits. Often referred to in the past as "Jammin'" or "Groovin'" Oldies, the Rhythmic Oldies format was quite popular for a time in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, <a href="../../../k/k/b/KKBT_3f03.html" title="KKBT">KCMG-FM</a> "Mega 100" in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> pioneered the concept of "Jammin' Oldies," which involved creating a mass-appeal music mix that appealed to both white and black audiences. (See <a href="http://beradio.com/news/radio_kcmgfm_los_angeles/" class="external free" title="http://beradio.com/news/radio_kcmgfm_los_angeles/" rel="nofollow">http://beradio.com/news/radio_kcmgfm_los_angeles/</a> for a profile of KCMG in its heyday.) The "Jammin'"/"Groovin'" Oldies format subsequently spread nationwide, to stations like <a href="../../../w/w/p/WWPR_a134.html" title="WWPR">WTJM-FM</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <a href="../../../w/m/o/WMOJ_30b1.html" title="WMOJ">WMOJ</a> in <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati.html" title="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, and <a href="../../../w/m/g/WMGC_24e4.html" title="WMGC">WGRV-FM</a> in <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit.html" title="Detroit">Detroit</a> (all of which have since changed format). Many of these stations played white soul or disco artists such as <a href="../../../a/b/b/ABBA_de88.html" title="ABBA">ABBA</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bee_Gees_e35d.html" title="The Bee Gees">The Bee Gees</a> in addition to African-American artists. Many believe that what contributed the most to the death of the "Jammin' Oldies" stations was the fact that their playlists soon became very small and narrow, increasing listener "burnout" and dropping ratings within a few months after a promising ratings start. Rhythmic Oldies stations still exist today, but chiefly in markets with large African-American populations; the peak of the "Jammin' Oldies" approach has come and gone.</p>
<p>Usually embedded within the Urban Adult Contemporary is another format called <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiet_Storm_422f.html" title="Quiet Storm">Quiet Storm</a>. This format is most played during the evening beginning at 7:00 PM or 8:00 PM hours into late night. The Quiet Storm format plays on Urban Adult Contemporary format. The music that is played are strictly ballads and slow jams, mostly but not limited to Black and Latino artists. Popular artists played on the <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiet_Storm_422f.html" title="Quiet Storm">Quiet Storm</a> format are <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teena_Marie_e504.html" title="Teena Marie">Teena Marie</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Bofill_fc27.html" title="Angela Bofill">Angela Bofill</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Miki_Howard_313c.html" title="Miki Howard">Miki Howard</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regina_Belle_8bd0.html" title="Regina Belle">Regina Belle</a>, Howard Hewitt, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddie_Jackson_41a4.html" title="Freddie Jackson">Freddie Jackson</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Gill_900f.html" title="Johnny Gill">Johnny Gill</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Baker_3cea.html" title="Anita Baker">Anita Baker</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sade.html" title="Sade">Sade</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patti_LaBelle_cb41.html" title="Patti LaBelle">Patti LaBelle</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanessa_Williams_de6b.html" title="Vanessa Williams">Vanessa Williams</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/u/Dru_Hill_ac4c.html" title="Dru Hill">Dru Hill</a>, and <a href="../../../e/n/_/En_Vogue_55b2.html" title="En Vogue">En Vogue</a> among others.</p>

<p>Early radio stations played top-40 hits, theoretically regardless of genre although most were in the same genre until the mid-1970s when different forms of popular music started to target different demographic groups, such as <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disco.html" title="Disco">disco</a> vs. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_rock.html" title="Hard rock">hard rock</a>. This evolved into specialized radio stations only playing certain genres of music, and generally following the evolution of artists in those genres.</p>
<p>One big impetus for the development of the AC radio format was the fact that when rock and roll music first became popular in the mid-1950s, many more conservative radio stations wanted to continue to play current hit songs while shying away from rock. These stations also frequently included older, pre-rock-era <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_standards.html" title="Adult standards">adult standards</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_band.html" title="Big band">big band</a> titles to further appeal to adult listeners who had grown up with those songs. In those days, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_of_the_Road_4eaf.html" title="Middle of the Road">Middle of the Road</a> or "MOR" was the formatic term used to describe such stations, which included powerhouse broadcasters like <a href="../../../w/j/r/WJR_9adb.html" title="WJR">WJR</a> in Detroit, <a href="../../../w/g/n/WGN_%28AM%29_5fce.html" title="WGN (AM)">WGN</a> and <a href="../../../w/b/b/WBBM_%28AM%29_046d.html" title="WBBM (AM)">WBBM</a> in Chicago, <a href="../../../k/g/o/KGO_9cd2.html" title="KGO">KGO</a> in San Francisco, <a href="../../../w/b/b/WBBR_ae01.html" title="WBBR">WNEW-AM</a> in New York, and <a href="../../../k/m/o/KMOX_bdfc.html" title="KMOX">KMOX</a> in St. Louis. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_magazine.html" title="Billboard magazine">Billboard magazine</a> first published an <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Adult_Contemporary_Tracks_47e8.html" title="Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks">adult-contemporary music chart</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>, although it was not until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> that the chart took on the name "Adult Contemporary."</p>
<p>While most popular MOR stations were, like Top 40 stations of the day, on the AM dial, another big impetus for the evolution of the AC radio format was the popularity of easy listening or "<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beautiful_music.html" title="Beautiful music">beautiful music</a>" stations, stations with music specifically designed to be purely <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambient.html" title="Ambient">ambient</a>, listened to while at work or otherwise in the background. These stations were largely found on the FM dial alongside <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_classical_music.html" title="European classical music">classical music</a> stations because the music they played supposedly sounded better on FM. Whereas most easy listening music was instrumental, created by relatively unknown artists (except for occasional MOR vocal hits), and rarely purchased, AC was an attempt to create a similar "lite" format by choosing certain tracks (both hit singles and album cuts) of popular artists.</p>
<p>The growth of AC was also a natural result of the generation that first listened to the more "specialized" music of the mid-late 70s growing older and not being interested in the heavy metal, rap and hip-hop music that a new generation helped to dominate the top-40 charts (this effect has also altered the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldies.html" title="Oldies">Oldies</a> format; as there are now two kinds of Oldies stations, those who will not play songs from after the early 1970s vs. those who will play songs up to the early 1980s while still having occasional pre-1964 songs in rotation). Fans of harder rock music often derogatorily referred to AC stations in the early days of the format as "chicken rock."</p>
<p>The music video channel <a href="../../../v/h/1/VH1_84a4.html" title="VH1">VH1</a> began as an AC version of <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a>. Originally, it was strictly Soft AC, as it strove to appeal to people who were in their 30s and 40s during its early years in the mid <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. For similar reasons as explained above with radio, in the mid <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, it reformed itself as something closer to Hot AC, during which time it began to play videos by <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hootie_%26_The_Blowfish_f904.html" title="Hootie &amp; The Blowfish">Hootie &amp; The Blowfish</a>, the <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin_Blossoms_bfc6.html" title="Gin Blossoms">Gin Blossoms</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alanis_Morissette_39bf.html" title="Alanis Morissette">Alanis Morissette</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melissa_Etheridge_8b30.html" title="Melissa Etheridge">Melissa Etheridge</a>, the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_Doctors_da9e.html" title="Spin Doctors">Spin Doctors</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Grant_018d.html" title="Amy Grant">Amy Grant</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_of_Base_aad6.html" title="Ace of Base">Ace of Base</a>, and some other artists that were slightly harder rock or more avant garde than they had previously played.</p>
<p>Mainstream AC itself has evolved in a similar fashion over the years; traditional Soft AC artists like <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbra_Streisand_063e.html" title="Barbra Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a>, the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpenters.html" title="Carpenters">Carpenters</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Manilow_5266.html" title="Barry Manilow">Barry Manilow</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_%26_Tennille_7279.html" title="Captain &amp; Tennille">Captain &amp; Tennille</a> and <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olivia_Newton-John_14e9.html" title="Olivia Newton-John">Olivia Newton-John</a> found it harder to have hits (on AC as well as Top 40) as the 1980s wore on, and due to the influence of MTV, artists who were staples of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_Hit_Radio_c1f2.html" title="Contemporary Hit Radio">Contemporary Hit Radio</a> format, such as <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_Club_0c51.html" title="Culture Club">Culture Club</a>, <a href="../../../c/y/n/Cyndi_Lauper_8181.html" title="Cyndi Lauper">Cyndi Lauper</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tears_for_Fears_1a29.html" title="Tears for Fears">Tears for Fears</a>, and <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitney_Houston_e07e.html" title="Whitney Houston">Whitney Houston</a>, began crossing over to the AC charts with greater frequency.</p>
<p>In recent years, VH1 has moved away from its AC format by becoming willing to play artists such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destiny%27s_Child_6bfa.html" title="Destiny's Child">Destiny's Child</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/i/Eminem.html" title="Eminem">Eminem</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay-Z_fefb.html" title="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>, and <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snoop_Dogg_0d8a.html" title="Snoop Dogg">Snoop Dogg</a>, all usually AC no-no's, more and more often. With this addition of popular hip-hop, rap, and R&amp;B, VH1 (when it plays videos, which, to be sure, is on very rare occasions now) most closely resembles <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_40.html" title="Top 40">Top 40</a> radio now. Led by <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> powerhouse <a href="../../../c/h/u/CHUM-FM_7c19.html" title="CHUM-FM">CHUM-FM</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> Hot AC radio has also taken steps towards a similarly more diverse and <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_40.html" title="Top 40">Top 40</a>-inclusive musical position.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why more and more Hot AC stations are forced to change is that less and less new music fits their bill. Most new rock is too alternative for mainstream radio, including Hot AC, and only gets played on <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Rock_1bbd.html" title="Modern Rock">Modern Rock</a> radio; and most new pop is now influenced heavily by <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurodance.html" title="Eurodance">eurodance</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">hip hop</a>, in an attempt to become <a href="../../../c/l/u/Club.html" title="Club">club</a> and <a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhythmic.html" title="Rhythmic">rhythmic</a> crossover hits, if not featuring guest vocals from rappers. One example is that "<a href="../../../l/o/o/Look_What_You%27ve_Done_c6b3.html" title="Look What You've Done">Look What You've Done</a>" by <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_%28band%29.html" title="Jet (band)">Jet</a> is played on Hot AC stations, but other tracks like "<a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_Hard_Bitch_ab32.html" title="Cold Hard Bitch">Cold Hard Bitch</a>" are played on modern rock stations. Soft AC, however, which has never minded keeping songs in high rotation literally for years in some cases, and plays a larger amount of older music, especially classic R&amp;B, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_music.html" title="Soul music">soul</a>, and '60s and '70s music, than Hot AC, does not appear necessarily to be facing similar pressures to expand its format.</p>
<p>However, more and more recently, several Soft AC stations have begun to add more guitar-driven (but still relatively quiet) music into their playlists, such as "Broken" by Seether, "You And Me" by <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lifehouse.html" title="Lifehouse">Lifehouse</a>, "Here Without You" by <a href="../../../3/_/d/3_Doors_Down_fabd.html" title="3 Doors Down">3 Doors Down</a>, "Complicated" and "I'm With You" by <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avril_Lavigne_f30c.html" title="Avril Lavigne">Avril Lavigne</a>, "Wherever You Will Go" by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Calling_346d.html" title="The Calling">The Calling</a>, "My Immortal" by <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evanescence.html" title="Evanescence">Evanescence</a>, and "I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing" by <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerosmith.html" title="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>, somewhat resembling the Hot AC stations of the 1990s.</p>
<p>In this sense, the Soft AC format may soon be facing the demographic pressures that the <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> format faced in the 1960s and 1970s, the "<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Band_589a.html" title="Big Band">Big Band</a>" format faced in the 1980s and 1990s and that the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldies.html" title="Oldies">Oldies</a> format is starting to face today, with the result that one may see Soft AC less on over-the-air radio and more on <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite_radio.html" title="Satellite radio">satellite radio</a> systems in coming years. Much of the music and artists that was traditionally played on Soft AC stations has been relegated to the <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_Standards_5003.html" title="Adult Standards">Adult Standards</a> format, which is itself disappearing because of aging demographics. Some Soft AC stations have found a niche by incorporating more oldies into their playlists and are more open to playing softer songs that fit the "traditional" definition of AC. Examples include <a href="../../../w/l/t/WLTM-FM_98fc.html" title="WLTM-FM">WLTM-FM</a> in Atlanta (which added many oldies titles to its playlists after the death of oldies sister station <a href="../../../w/w/v/WWVA-FM_ed38.html" title="WWVA-FM">WLCL</a>) and the former <a href="../../../w/u/b/WUBA_95c9.html" title="WUBA">WSNI</a> in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>In the meantime, such artists as <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Lachey_c092.html" title="Nick Lachey">Nick Lachey</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Groban_1fa6.html" title="Josh Groban">Josh Groban</a> have become successful thanks to a ballad heavy sound. So, Adult Contemporary may likely not go anywhere since it is still prevalent on recording artists albums in almost every music style including <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_music.html" title="Dance music">dance music</a>. Another popular trend of remixing <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_music.html" title="Dance music">dance music</a> hits into Adult Contemporary ballads, mostly piano ballads but sometimes keyboard ballads is now all the rage, especially in the U.S. (for example, the "Candlelight Mix" versions of "Heaven" by <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_Sammy_e07f.html" title="DJ Sammy">DJ Sammy</a>, "Listen To Your Heart" by <a href="../../../d/2E/h/D.H.T._8601.html" title="D.H.T.">D.H.T.</a>, and "Everytime We Touch" by <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascada.html" title="Cascada">Cascada</a>).</p>
<p>Also in response to the pressure on Hot AC, a third kind of AC format has cropped up among American radio recently. The aforementioned Urban Adult Contemporary format (a term coined by <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Mayo_bc8d.html" title="Barry Mayo">Barry Mayo</a>) usually attracts a large number of <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Americans_0672.html" title="African Americans">African Americans</a> and sometimes <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_race.html" title="Caucasian race">Caucasian</a> listeners through playing a great deal of <a href="../../../r/%26/b/R%26B_2a8f.html" title="R&amp;B">R&amp;B</a> (without any form of rapping), <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_music.html" title="Gospel music">Gospel music</a>, Classic Soul and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_music.html" title="Dance music">Dance music</a> (including <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disco.html" title="Disco">disco</a>).</p>
<p>A fourth AC format, "Rhythmic AC", in addition to playing all the popular Hot and Soft AC music, past and present, places a heavy emphasis on <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disco.html" title="Disco">disco</a> as well as 1980s and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">'90s</a> dance hits, such as those by <a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_%28performer%29.html" title="Amber (performer)">Amber</a>, <a href="../../../c/%26/c/C%26C_Music_Factory_e695.html" title="C&amp;C Music Factory">C&amp;C Music Factory</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Box_%28band%29_b77b.html" title="Black Box (band)">Black Box</a>, and includes dance <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remixes.html" title="Remixes">remixes</a> of pop songs, such as the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_Solution_f2a3.html" title="Soul Solution">Soul Solution</a> Mix of <a href="../../../t/o/n/Toni_Braxton_1c73.html" title="Toni Braxton">Toni Braxton</a>'s "Unbreak My Heart". The format also occasionally features popular '80s and early '90s rap songs that were popular mainstream, rhythmic, or club hits. <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>'s <a href="../../../w/k/t/WKTU_fc14.html" title="WKTU">WKTU</a> and the now-defunct <a href="../../../w/w/f/WWFS_9820.html" title="WWFS">WNEW-FM</a> are examples of this evolving format. The rapidly growing <a href="../../../m/o/v/MOViN_80ef.html" title="MOViN">MOViN</a> format, pioneered at <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle.html" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>'s <a href="../../../k/q/m/KQMV_747e.html" title="KQMV">KQMV</a> and now in use at stations such as <a href="../../../k/m/v/KMVN_0ae8.html" title="KMVN">KMVN</a> Los Angeles, <a href="../../../w/m/v/WMVN_04fa.html" title="WMVN">WMVN</a> St. Louis, and <a href="../../../k/f/r/KFRC_333a.html" title="KFRC">KFRC</a> San Francisco, is another example of Rhythmic AC, and has spawned imitators such as <a href="../../../w/i/s/WISX_d151.html" title="WISX">WISX</a> in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>In its early years of existence, the <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smooth_Jazz_a879.html" title="Smooth Jazz">Smooth Jazz</a> format was considered to be a form of AC, although it was mainly instrumental, and bore a stronger resemblance to the Soft AC-styled music than it did to what purists call "real jazz." For many years, artists like <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Benson_5eb7.html" title="George Benson">George Benson</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_G_c3da.html" title="Kenny G">Kenny G</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Koz_dfdb.html" title="Dave Koz">Dave Koz</a> had crossover hits that were played on both Smooth Jazz and Soft AC stations. In addition, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Sanborn_dba6.html" title="David Sanborn">David Sanborn</a> had a saxophone solo on <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Taylor_04a3.html" title="James Taylor">James Taylor</a>'s remake of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvin_Gaye_d75e.html" title="Marvin Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a> classic, "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)"; and <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grover_Washington_Jr._27de.html" title="Grover Washington Jr.">Grover Washington Jr.</a> teamed up with <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Withers_862f.html" title="Bill Withers">Bill Withers</a> to perform a classic hit song, entitled "Just The Two Of Us." This song has gone on to become one of the most-played radio hits of all time, as it frequently shows up on Soft AC, Urban AC and Smooth Jazz playlists. <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Baker_3cea.html" title="Anita Baker">Anita Baker</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sade.html" title="Sade">Sade</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/t/Luther_Vandross_c8f2.html" title="Luther Vandross">Luther Vandross</a> are other examples of artists who appeal to Mainstream AC, Urban AC and Smooth Jazz listeners. Some Soft AC and Urban AC stations like to play Smooth Jazz on the weekends, in cities that currently do not have a full-time Smooth Jazz station. <a href="../../../w/r/r/WRRM_66e4.html" title="WRRM">Warm 98</a> in <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati%2C_Ohio_33af.html" title="Cincinnati, Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, <a href="../../../k/k/m/KKMJ_a9eb.html" title="KKMJ">Majic 95.5</a> in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin%2C_Texas_6b79.html" title="Austin, Texas">Austin, Texas</a>, WCSY-FM in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Haven%2C_Michigan_c7a2.html" title="South Haven, Michigan">South Haven, Michigan</a>, and <a href="../../../k/q/x/KQXT_0ebe.html" title="KQXT">Soft Rock 101.9</a> in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio%2C_Texas_74ae.html" title="San Antonio, Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a> are Soft AC stations that also play Smooth Jazz; and <a href="../../../w/b/a/WBAV_ceaa.html" title="WBAV">V101.9</a>, an Urban AC station in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte%2C_North_Carolina_1d79.html" title="Charlotte, North Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>, plays Smooth Jazz on the weekends as well.</p>
<p>In recent years it has become common for many AC stations (and Soft AC stations in particular) to switch to a format playing primarily or exclusively <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_song.html" title="Christmas song">Christmas songs</a> during November and December. While these tend mostly to be contemporary seasonal recordings by the same artists featured under the normal format, stations will also typically air vintage holiday tunes from older <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_Standards_5003.html" title="Adult Standards">Adult Standards</a> artists (such as <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nat_King_Cole_7fef.html" title="Nat King Cole">Nat King Cole</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bing_Crosby_1db0.html" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpenters.html" title="Carpenters">Carpenters</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Mathis_dbfc.html" title="Johnny Mathis">Johnny Mathis</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Williams_2da7.html" title="Andy Williams">Andy Williams</a>) who they would never play under ordinary circumstances. These Christmas music marathons typically start on <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving_%28United_States%29_7e49.html" title="Thanksgiving (United States)">Thanksgiving Day</a> (although some stations may start playing Christmas music well before the Thanksgiving weekend) and end at midnight on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_Day_0d60.html" title="Christmas Day">Christmas Day</a>, after which the stations resume their normal music fare on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_26.html" title="December 26">December 26</a>. The roots of this tradition can be traced all the way back to the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beautiful_Music_74d3.html" title="Beautiful Music">Beautiful Music</a> era of the 1960s and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">'70s</a>. However, this practice seems to have become even more common among mainstream AC stations since the events of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001.html" title="September 11, 2001">September 11, 2001</a>, with many stations promoting their Christmas music marathons as a sort of musical <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comfort_food.html" title="Comfort food">comfort food</a>.</p>
