<p>I'm being harassed by several users, which is nothing new. So far today, an admin actually <b>did something</b> in response to a complaint I posted (against <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbiteroftruth_4aad.html" title="User:Arbiteroftruth">User:Arbiteroftruth</a> who was posting personal attacks on several users' pages), which is more than I can say for any admin I have ever encountered on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Now, I once again ask the admins of Wikipedia, to <b>do something</b>. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a>, who somehow got elected to adminship, continues to threaten to indefinitely block me and says he will protect my talkpage if I continue to revert supposed "warnings" against my "vandalism." I have already proven, at length on <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi">User talk:Daduzi</a>, that I am right, and others are wrong. JzG continues to engage in personal attacks against User:Incorrect, vandalizes <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a>, and vandalizes my talkpage. Block him and warn him about wikistalking. <a href="../../../t/c/h/User%7ETchadienne_58ee.html" title="User:Tchadienne">Tchadienne</a> 18:24, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>JzG appears to be doing the best he can toward the goal of trying to get you to cease your blatant assumptions of bad faith and breaches of civility. I cannot say I envy him the job. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 18:32, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with Tchadienne, can some admin please do something? On <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Guardian_4cea.html" title="Talk:The Guardian">Talk:The Guardian</a>, there has been made a clear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_Guardian&amp;diff=67676259&amp;oldid=67671712" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_Guardian&amp;diff=67676259&amp;oldid=67671712" rel="nofollow">threat</a> to edit war, and to game the system w.r.t. 3RR. As for the rest, it is a content dispute; bring it to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> if you must; not here.

<dd>I don't know a great deal about the specifics of this incident, but just from your tone it's not difficult to see why users aren't rushing to assist you. In two short paragrahps, you've managed to accuse others of vandalizing articles and making personal attacks, insisted that you've <i>proven</i> yourself to be correct, insulted all Wikipedia admins (singling out JzG) as well as demanding that JzG be blocked. Have you considered that perhaps a less aggressive tone would lead to better results? <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAren%27t_I_Obscure__6bd1.html" title="User:Aren't I Obscure?">Aren't I Obscure?</a> 18:37, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tchadienne is intent on inserting a criticism section into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> based on the "fact" that an article castigating Mel Gibson for a drunken outburst is somehow antisemitism. Or something. His failure to persuade others of the merits of his case (essentially the result of a mixture of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and failure to cite any reliable sources) led him to edit war over an NPOV tag; per policy it's pretty clear that failure to persuade others of the merit of your case is not grounds for tagging an article. I have just blocked Tchadienne for 24h for removing {{wr}} from his talkpage, which is blatant <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Our interaction thus far is brief enough that an assertion of harrassment is risible.

<dd>Indeed - this bears all the hallmarks of a frustrated bearer of The Truth<sup>TM</sup>; as usual when the reliable sources fail to back The Truth<sup>TM</sup> the only possible solution is to use the sources we have and explain how they are reliable, honest they are, even if they are blogs. It's not so much that he doesn't take kindly to <i>threats</i>, it's that he doesn't take kindly to <i>being thwarted</i>, and apparently interprets anything that prevents him geting his way as a threat, thus alowing him (in his eyes) to ignore it. This busines sof The Guardian being antisemitic because it had a Jerusalem correspondent who was critical of the Israeli Government is pretty typical stuff; without wanting to venture into political debate I think it's not exactly a secret that some people accuse anybody who is not completely uncritical of Israel of being antisemitic rather than anti-Israeli Government, because antisemitism has such uniquely atrocious connotations. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 20:06, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Where did <i>that</i> come from? A tendentious editor has accused a long-established British newspaper of anti-semitism, despite its history of support for the existence of the state of Israel, because it had the temerity to publish reports critical of the Israeli government. No reliable sources have been presented to back the assertion that this paper is anti-semitic. The anti-semitism in question appears to be entirely restricted to the portrayal of comtemporary Israeli government policy. A barrow is being pushed, in other words. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:11, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all I want to say that as a long time collaborator of Tchadienne, my opinion may be biased, even if I hope it's not. That said, I know Tchadienne and I can tell what he isn't - a troll. In the wikiproject we both work on, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Chad_34b2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Chad">Wikipedia:WikiProject Chad</a>, I have never had to revert his edits, or introduce radical changes; and I have never had any problems reverting my friends if their edits did not comply with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> or <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (I edit also a lot on problematic articles concerning the Balkans, so this happens very often). And I believe that Tchadienne's concerns regarding the Guardian article were legitimate and founded, even if I must admit Tchadienne's solution, a criticism section, was not a great idea. I also know that Tchadienne often has a difficult character, and that he tends to over-react; but his dedition to NPOV is true and authentic. We need more editors like Tchadienne, not less, and as for these "quite a few bad ones", i.e. bad edits, I must be a bit strabic, because I seem to have strangely missed them. I'm afraid I have instead detected a certain <i>animus</i> by JzG against Tchadienne. Please remember what is said about controversial blocks at <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>: among them are <i>blocks of logged-in users with a substantial history of valid contributions, regardless of the reasoning for the block</i>. For this I feel the community should be lenient, and his block should be reduced in respect, among other things, for the quality work done in areas almost ignored by wikipedia. I won't reduce his block myself, because my action could be biased; but I feel all the same it should be reduced.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 23:31, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>24 hour blocks are no real punishment. They can be issued for the most useful logged-in editors when they temporarily lose their head, just to give them time to cool off. Using sock puppets to get around such a block says to me that that user has not yet cooled down enough. I think I would support unblocking the user 24 hours after he ends using sock puppets; until then, the longer block is entirely justifies, in my opinion. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugène van der Pijll</a> 23:40, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 24-hour block was not punishment. We don't block for punishment, we block to prevent disruption of the project, in this case to stop a user making problematic and disruptive edits for long enough for the other editors on the article(s) in question to come to some kind of agreement as to what to do. That's why block evasion - especially when it includes taunting the blocking admins - is unacceptable, and why sockpuppetry to evade a block is also unacceptable. In this case Tchadienne did both, as well as perhaps a bit of forum-shopping (I'm guessing it's no accident that we are seeing input here from people who are not often seen hereabouts). It's fine to have strong opinions, but edit-warring is not the way to persuade others of the merit of those opinions. Tchadienne has without question been around long enough to know that removing uncited content and starting a debate on Talk is not <i>vandalism</i> and blogs are explicitly not reliable sources. As a wise editor once said, if your edits do not meet with approval, instead of repeating the arguments only louder, <i>bring better arguments</i>. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 10:41, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Julie Burchill is <b>not</b> considered by most people, even those who like her, as an enyclopedic or reliable source. She says things to shock; arguably her tenure at the Guardian was good for the paper for that reason.</li>
<li>Regardless, Julie Burchill did <b>not</b> state in the reference given that she left because the Guardian was anti-Semitic. Neither did she say that anti-Zionism was the same as anti-Semitism.

She is being ambiguous, maybe deliberately, but this is a bit different from what you claimed above.</li>
<li>Whatever you think Julie Burchill might have meant in her ambiguous swan-song, criticism of Israel definitely does not equate to anti-Semitism. This isn't a POV dispute. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 19:10, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>When I first encountered this user I wondered whether he was someone who used multiple identities. I am glad that he now acknowledges that he has done so. I had an exchange with this user in April, over a controversial renaming of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charities_accused_of_ties_to_terrorism.html" title="Charities accused of ties to terrorism">charities accused of ties to terrorism</a> to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charities_with_ties_to_terrorism.html" title="Charities with ties to terrorism">charities with ties to terrorism</a>. I thought I was civil, but he complained about me on the administrator's noticeboard. A week or so later this user nominated the persona they were then using for administrator. He was asked whether he had any unresolved disputes, and how he resolved disputes. He didn't mention his recent dispute with me. So, I brought it up, and asked some questions. They didn't answer my questions. They accused me of personally attacking them. Their campaign for administratorship failed, but it was fairly close. After his campaign for administratorship failed they filed a reqquest for comment about my behavior. I opted to have an administrator move the request for comment to my user space -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_RfC_2006-4-17_1d94.html" title="User:Geo Swan/RfC 2006-4-17">User:Geo Swan/RfC 2006-4-17</a>. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 04:53, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Some ammount of community and off-topic networking will surely go on from time-to-time and should be overlooked, including perhaps some things of a sexual nature--I've been guilty of it too (not sexual though)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:The_Ungovernable_Force#Subhumans_Concert" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:The_Ungovernable_Force#Subhumans_Concert" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:The_Ungovernable_Force#KFC_Protest" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:The_Ungovernable_Force#KFC_Protest" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. But some of these users' talk pages seem to be devoted mostly to non-encyclopedic content and that should not be overlooked. Add in the possible legal ramifications for our site due to soliciting of minors and I think we have a good reason to stop this. I'm pretty sure Florida has laws against soliciting minors, isn't that where a lot of those Dateline busts happened recently? There are probably federal laws as well. If it continues, blocking may be in order. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 09:03, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I continue to press for expending more resources to protect children from predators (who pretend they are children), as well as combat trolls' "staged psychodramas" which pertain to that area.

<p>At the request of another user, I am adding a brief follow-up here. I blocked Brohanska simply because I am <i>absolutely convinced</i> the user was a troll. If people out there do not believe the user was trolling, we should discuss the matter with a view to unblocking the user. It would be profoundly inappropriate to block a user because the user was a homosexual. A thorough reading of this user's fairly short contribution history was sufficient to fully convince me that the user was simply trolling, however. As to the other users, I see <i>no</i> reason to believe anyone else should be blocked at this time (nor any significant evidence that <i>they</i> are trolls). Wikipedia does have a right (and an obligation) to prevent the solicitation of underage users where we become aware of it and I feel it is profoundly inappropriate to use Wikipedia to discuss BDSM in particular and pornography in general with eleven year-olds. Partly because the user is eleven, partly because that's not what the Wikipedia is for. However, any such discussion seemed to be limited to "Aboy bringing pain to a girl, pleasurable!?" Possible cause for concern given the ages involved. However, I believe the comment that El_C posted ("you are not permitted") is plenty sufficient and will stop these users from doing that again. In summary: Brohanska blocked for trolling, other users have been warned. I believe this is entirely sufficient for what was most likely a rather innocent little conversation. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 03:50, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This debacle is a perfect example of why I think underage persons should not be allowed to edit Wikipedia, at least as a public rule (whether it can be enforced or not). Issues like this one aside, the anonymity and equalizing factors of Wikipedia make it extremely annoying when I find myself, a college professor, forced to engage in disagreements over articles with editors who are clearly schoolchildren. Wikipedia has enough image problems without being known as an encyclopedia edited by kids. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 21:29, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

That's just not what they're for.

Please explain, because I sure don't understand it. I feel there is something more behind this block other than a stupid comment. --<a href="../../../m/b/o/User%7EMboverload_cce2.html" title="User:Mboverload">mboverload</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mboverload_00ae.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mboverload"><font color="red">@</font></a> 05:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, here's the comment: ":::Mmmm... yes... a pint of palestinian blood would be a fine dessert right now. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_Userpage_0087.html" title="User:Crzrussian/Userpage">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 04:24, 7 August 2006 (UTC)" This was put on the talk page of a user who had been making edits which present an Arab point of view. The context was a dialog in response to this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yas121&amp;diff=68038631&amp;oldid=67752635" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yas121&amp;diff=68038631&amp;oldid=67752635" rel="nofollow">outrageous post by Ruy Lopez</a> which attempts to exploit Yas121's presumed discontent with our "Zionist bias". In that context, the remark Crzrussian inserted seemed to me outrageous. Perhaps it was just an attempt to make a joke to break the tension. I don't know what was in his mind. Interestingly Yas121 seemed to react maturely, even to someone who had recently blocked him. I will point out something. I blocked Crzrussian for one day. I did not propose desysopping him. I don't see unblocking yourself as meriting automatic desysopping. An administrator does not always have to be mature, just generally so. However, making a facetious remark in the context he did is outrageous. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 12:58, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm... so I did something outrageous, just people can't quite agree what. I'm not terribly sure what the intention was... Best way to put it is, I wanted to escalate the preposterousness to get Yas to drop the <i>Jews control Wikipedia</i> line of thinking. I still don't see my comment as outrageous. Stupid, maybe.</dd>
<dd>It's pretty clear by now that I will have to resign my mop. Which is a shame, since I think I have made myself very useful with it, and nobody seems to have weighed that yet. Nor did anyone weigh the fact that I've bestowed only a handful of (hopefully proper) blocks, focusing instead of deletions. Everyone should know that I am not bitter, and that my wife will be incredibly grateful if two more dedicated individuals step up for their <i>pint of blood</i>. All you sysops, prepare to handle 100 more deletions per day yourselves!&#160;:) Cheers! - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_Userpage_0087.html" title="User:Crzrussian/Userpage">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 15:59, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I just want to drop in and say that what is occuring here is utterly ridiculous. I think an RfC and a reminder that people are watching you is proper enough for a mistake made. Other admins and editors seem to make ridiculous comments but fly by under the radar. If you have an issue first make an RfC, then take it from there. To suddenly become happy to de-SysOp someone over something else when their other contributions outweight that <i>heavily</i>, is out of line and a waste of our time when there are bigger issues to fry. I think it is fairly obvious that Crz will not abuse the tools and will act more within acceptable lines. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 16:09, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm dropping in too (I didn't need the pint of blood for my patient). Other admins have said far more inappropriate things than this. CrzRussian is clearly apologetic for his actions, and I'm certain he's learned from this for the future. An RfC may be appropriate, but instigating a de-sysopping over this? He's an intelligent and highly active administrator.

<dd><b>Oppose</b> as well. It is true that too many admins treat adminship like a Golden Ticket or a Get Out of Jail Free card. It is way to early to make that determination here. Everyone stumbles. The admins who deserve to be de-sysopped are the ones who refuse to admit they have done anything wrong and take corrective criticism as persecution. Good admins learn from their stumbles and their peers and become wiser.

<p>Dear all, being just a regular user and not an Admin (in other words powerless) I wasn't going to add anything here. However I really think I should after reading <i>"...I wanted to escalate the preposterousness to get Yas to drop the Jews control Wikipedia line of thinking..."</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, Crzrussian you are right I was not offended by your comments (as you saw by my response [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yas121&amp;diff=68132499&amp;oldid=68131294" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yas121&amp;diff=68132499&amp;oldid=68131294" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>], hence you don't need to apologize to me, BUT like I said how could you know that? what if I was Palestinian, living through the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflict?!? How would you feel if a Lebanese made similar remarks to you about Jews?</li>
<li>Secondly, I have read through Wikipedia policy and can't see how you can deny you were not Edit warring?[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meir_Kahane&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67280173" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meir_Kahane&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67280173" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>] after Rev my edits about 9 times! Anyway, that's for the Admins to decide not me.</li>
<li>Thirdly, can you please point me to where I have stated that <i>"Jews control Wikipedia"</i>!?! So I don't understand why you would say that other than to try and give some legitimacy to the reasons behind your comments.</li>
<li>Lastly, on a seperate note...I wish this kind of thorough debate occurred over at <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamas.html" title="Hamas">Hamas</a> where I've been trying frutlessly to discuss merits of a neutral article in an encyclopedia over just a "damming report"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hamas" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hamas" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> and explain that US-Israel views (right or wrong) do not represent the entire planet. But powers that be, don't really seem at all interested, so far <b>not a single word</b> has been allowed to alter, nor the format in the article. All under the famous guise of "Rev POV" followed shortly by the classic 3RR warning (Thanks <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> for Rv all my edits and the Ban warning<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Yas121#3RR_on_Hamas" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Yas121#3RR_on_Hamas" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>)...Actually I did manage to get someone to finally stick that POV banner on top of the article so Yayy! Anyway that's my 2 bobs worth on the matter.</li>

<dd>It is, I think, relevant that Crz was sufficiently familiar with you as to be confident that you'd not take his comment as untoward; I imagine that he'd not have made such a comment to someone with whom he was altogether unfamiliar (although I'd have serious concerns vis-à-vis an editor's inter-personal stability and intellectual fitness were he/she to be off-put by such non-disruptive jocularity). I, similarly, have on occasion left comments on Crz's talk page apropos of the Jewish conspiracy that surely underlies all in the world, because I expect that such comments will not be disruptive. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 21:20, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Depends on the offense. In this case, one presumes an admin is aware of the policy against unblocking oneself - its not an "oops" its a deliberate violation of the Rules. For a more extreme example, when one commits a crime one is usally not given a free pass the first time - one is aware it is illegal, one does it anyway - one reaps the consequences. To carry the analogy, an admin breaking this serious a rule is like a police officer breaking the law, which makes the case more serious, not less, because there is no recourse to the "ignorance of the law" defense, which if I recall correctly carries little or no weight anyway.

<dd>Normally, I'm one of the hanging judges, but I don't think unblocking yourself <i>if you bring the matter up at AN/I or another forum</i> is a particularly grievous offense. It all depends on what you do and why you do it. If you unblock yourself and go your merry way, that's one thing. If you unblock yourself and "turn yourself in" to get more voices in the deliberation, I don't think it is. I think <i>evading</i> is much worse than unblocking yourself. An unblock is an announcement, and it's not as bad as using another account, etc. That's just me, though. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:06, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I honor <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">User:Crzrussian</a> for being ready to stand by the undertaking he signed, and I'm rather taken aback by the suggestions being made by other users here that his doing so should be traded for an admin RfC, or require community consensus (!), or that the users making the request are violating <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> and I don't know what else. If I shared the view that it means strictly nothing to add oneself to a page headed "These adminstrators are willing to stand for re-confirmation of adminship if six editors in good standing request it", I'd propose deletion of the "open to recall" page as meaningless. Surely any admin can be RfC'd for misuse of the tools without being listed any particular place, and it goes without saying that any admin will be de-sysopped if there's <i>consensus</i> for it — so what's the point of listing oneself on the recall page? Lar's take on the process as appropriately being complex and multi-layered also seems rather at odds with the process section on the recall page itself: ""Just ask, nicely, on the administrator's talk page, and if five others agree, it's done." <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 08:30, 8 August 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Blocking is done not as a punishment but as a preventative measure. I believe recall should be on the same basis. This is the first time that <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crzrussian</a> has been called to task in this way and he has made his mea culpa. If it is now thought that he will repeat the errors, then recall is in order. If it is considered that he will not, then it seems a counter-productive exercise. Admins are not policemen, and wiki has different rules from police forces, one of them being <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a>. Everyone is allowed to make a mistake, as long as it is not perpetuated. Furthermore, an admin's mistake(s) should be seen in context of their general record, not in isolation, as it is likely that those admins who do the most work are statistically also more likely to be the ones who make an error.<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 09:37, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bishie: (and thanks a lot for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=68355403&amp;oldid=68353829" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=68355403&amp;oldid=68353829" rel="nofollow">singing my hair</a>!!!&#160;:) ) Most (not all) RfCs relating to admins are hugely contentious, called against the admin's will, and often result in nothing useful at all happening, as the results are blithely disregarded. Sometimes they're pro forma, a prelude to ArbComm...</dd>
<dd>The idea here is to be different:If I were to get recalled (because 6 users I felt qualified to do so asked for it), and I chose the RfC route (I refer you again to <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_Accountability_eee6.html" title="User:Lar/Accountability">User:Lar/Accountability</a>, where I list 3 choices I can make) what I'm pledging is; that it won't be called against my will, it won't be contentious if I have anything to say about it (I'll actively work to keep it civil), I'll participate politely and in good faith, and I will honor the outcome instead of disregarding it, without forcing the case to ArbCom by being intransigent. That's a big big difference from how most of them go. If the current category (or my template) wording doesn't make it clear that this is a voluntary process and that the admin in question has some say in what it means, but that it's real, and binding, then correction is in order. I don't think it is process heavy. Now, it appears that Crzrussian has chosen the "resign my powers and stand again for adminship;" (in 2 months time apparently) choice of the three I list, as is his perogative. I'd rather see him do an RfC if this is certified, but it's his choice. Hopefully that helps clarify... ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:09, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree with Nick. I'm tired of WillC as well. He needs to be mature, or just not be on Wikipedia. You don't post facts, you post non-notable things. Comedy isn't used much in jobbing, but you just won't understand that. The Ding Dongs and a few examples in the new ECW isn't enough for a comedy relief section or note.

<dd>I'm just giving my opinion, and it was not the best or worst thing that I said right above. You've been banned like 5 times, that's enough to show that you are a volitile editor. And look at what you put in some of the edit summaries, "check with your fellow conspirator", that's name calling.

<p>It's "Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", not "Wikipedia, the non-redistributable gallery of fair use images".

<dd>So it has been asserted. But why galleries? Where was this discussed, and what was the reasoning behind it? I can suss out bits and pieces here and there, but it's like everyone's going out of their way to avoid stating anything resembling <i>an argument</i>, for no apparent reason. I'm sorry if I sound frustrated, but all I've gotten from Cyde, Kelly, and ed g2s is repeated assertions that "these violate our fair use policy" without much attempt at explaining <i>why</i> they feel that way, and without any attempt at acknowledging that other good-faith users might reasonably disagree. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 21:50, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Galleries were determined to be verboten a long time back, because in 99% of all situations they were simply collections of images which were not incorporated into the text. Isolated images have very little "fair use" claim — they are not being use analytically or critically, and they are not terribly transformative in the way that images-plus-encyclopedia often are. In most case they serve no substantial point other than decoration. It is easier in a case like this to just make them verboten. That being said, I've seen maybe <i>one</i> instance in which the gallery was not an inappropriate way to present a sequence of images claimed under "fair use", and was essentially just being used as an organizing structure in a way which was itself critical/analytical (putting them in a sequence). But even then there were others ways to achieve the same effect. I hope that explains the reasoning a little better.</dd>
<dd>Now in the case of <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Hockey_dad9.html" title="Atlantic Hockey">Atlantic Hockey</a>, I think the "gallery" version is clearly not a good use of "fair use"—the images float by themselves disconnected from anything else. In the "table" version, I could see an argument that it makes it easier to identify teams if you are used to just seeing them on TV, or something like that, but even then it strikes me as pretty non-essential, something one would add just to make it look nice, rather than something the article <i>needs</i> in order to function. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 23:53, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

While they have different rules for what they will accept, creating a gallery of "free use" images here won't help anyone in the long run. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 00:57, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, that's the first cogent explanation I've seen. So the argument, then, is that galleries are just too <i>generic</i> (perhaps) to enable the constitutent images to qualify as fair use? I can buy that, in most cases -- but I hardly think it's <i>necessarily</i> true, as Kelly Martin and others have implied. However, I'm not wedded to the gallery format -- it's just that when I tried incorporating them into the table as seen in <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Hockey_dad9.html" title="Atlantic Hockey">Atlantic Hockey</a>, ed g2s still reverted them, even though they weren't in a gallery, but instead were part of the identification table. The logo is as much a part of the team identity as the mascot is, IMO -- but certain factions seem to think my opinion on that matter doesn't count. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 01:40, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This editors first action was to vandalize an article that is on my watch list, hiding it under "Spelling fixes" and then did an actual spelling fix edit, which he may have screwed up in his first edit. The timing of his arrival was way too close to the whole attack put on articles that I watch by YourCousin/Repmart/his socks. I brought this up in one of the IRC channels, but only one person replied, and it would probably be better if it was given much clearer notice. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 03:21, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure that redirecting the article was correct. A hairstyle is a far different topic than an <i>type</i> of hair, and there is very little duplicated information between the two. (although, I don't think that "Afro textured hair" is a proper term in and of itself, and the artciel should probably be moved someplace else. But not redirected.). --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 08:58, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am an active Wikipedian in good standing. Consistent with the letter and spirit of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>, this account was created today for the sole purpose of making the present complaint and obviously has not, nor will it ever, interface with my main account. Sockpuppet? Yes. Abusive? No.</p>
<p>That I feel it is necessary to do this anonymously at all is indicative of what I see as the root of this very complaint: an administrator who has come to regard herself as exempt from the policies that maintain fairness and order here, and who has lately demonstrated a certain eagerness to exercise her power in unethical ways.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> appears to have abused her position for the benefit of one editor and the detriment of another, violating her ethical responsibilities to this community in the process.</p>
<p>I've learned that many editors know about this situation generally, since it was first described some weeks ago on another website. Instead of linking to that site, I'll summarize what I've gleaned from forum banter and my own email exchange with the the editor involved, inviting those more familiar with the specifics to follow up and fill in the gaps.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive127_d80b.html" title="Edit section: Details">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Details</span></h3>
<p>Recently <a href="../../../i/p/f/User%7EIPFrehley_e5d6.html" title="User:IPFrehley">IPFrehley</a> claimed he had evidence of abusive sockpuppetry on the part of <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a>.</p>
<p>At one point he uploaded a graphic of some sort which he intended to use as a “visual aid” when making his “case” (he clearly had no idea what the hell he was doing<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:IPFrehley&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64530502" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:IPFrehley&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64530502" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>).</p>
<p>After uploading the image but before he could do whatever he was going to do next, IPFrehley was blocked by SlimVirgin and the image deleted (but not until after she apparently let Mantanmoreland have a copy, since he does refer to it on some thread I can't find now).</p>
<p>Based on comments IPFrehley made in another setting, it seems that prior to this, he reached out to a few admins, explaining what he wanted to do and asking for advice. He said the only ones he specifically remembers were <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Morven</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> but thinks there were three or four total requests made. None of them replied to his email, though at least one forwarded it to either SlimVirgin or Mantanmoreland, which is how she managed to intercept and block IPFrehley so quickly when he finally decided to do it by himself (she must have been waiting for it to happen).</p>
<p>When it did, SlimVirgin took advantage of IPFrehley's obvious lack of familiarity with <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>, because she told him to send his evidence to her via email so she could judge it privately and offline<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:IPFrehley&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64560423" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:IPFrehley&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64560423" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>IPFrehley says he didn't believe SlimVirgin was really interested in the evidence he was sending, so he did something a little diabolical: in the document he emailed SlimVirgin, he hid something that would alert him when it was opened (I don't get that tech stuff so don't ask me more about it), to know if it even got looked at. He says that yes it was opened, not by SlimVirgin but by <b>Mantanmoreland</b> -- '<b>the same person his evidence accused</b>!!!!! (<a href="http://static.flickr.com/47/198379597_cc4c5bebfd_b.jpg" class="external text" title="http://static.flickr.com/47/198379597_cc4c5bebfd_b.jpg" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> where he explains how he knew that).</p>
<p>Looking over their contribution histories it's easy to see that Mantanmoreland and SlimVirgin often work in tandem. But that's no excuse for secretly passing him information sent to her in confidence and with the promise that it would be reviewed and judged appropriately.</p>
<p>IPFrehley says he later emailed SlimVirgin asking if there was another explanation (other than what seemed obvious...that she was sending the information to Mantanmoreland) but she refused to answer, except for apparently announcing somewhere that IPFrehley was sending her threats.</p>
<p>I've yet to verify that, but is sounds pretty typical of a pattern that's emerged over time.</p>
<p>I suspect SlimVirgin will argue that because IPFrehley has since been indef banned and even spawned some socks of his own since this episode that his claims should be disregarded.</p>
<p>I would respond by noting that when all this happened, IPFrehley had yet to be banned. Also, IPFrehley openly admits to creating multiple socks specifically attempting to bring this situation to the community, which he apparently tried to do more than once though record of it is gone because he was summary banned and reverted and all diffs permanently deleted from the history.</p>
<p>In my time as a wikipedian, I've grown to respect SlimVirgin's dedication but feel increasing concern over her fading sense of impartiality and even propriety. If what IPFrehley says is true, it represents a grave deception, violation of trust, abuse of power, and act of inexcusable cronyism on the part of SlimVirgin. I'm requesting that her administrative powers be suspended while evidence related to this and other alleged abuses be presented and reviewed by a panel other than the Arbitration Committee, which I do not feel can be impartial in this case. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondMostLikely_9454.html" title="User:SecondMostLikely">SecondMostLikely</a> 06:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A sockpuppet created merely to bring accusations against a specific editor? Isn't that practically the definition of a disruptive sockpuppet? If you're an active Wikipedian in good standing, then come and voice your concerns and complaints as an active Wikipedian in good standing. I'll leave the merits of your case to others to hash out, but I don't think you'll get far asking for an administrator's powers to be taken away by your wishes, particularly since you don't feel that the Arbitration Committee is impartial to this case. If the ArbCom can't judge this, then who will? An unruly mob? (Never mind that the ArbCom, practically speaking, is the only body likely to perform a de-sysopping in this sort of case.) --<a href="../../../e/m/u/User%7EEmufarmers_b2e0.html" title="User:Emufarmers">Emufarmers</a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../e/m/u/User_talk%7EEmufarmers_439c.html" title="User talk:Emufarmers">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Emufarmers_b9ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Emufarmers">C</a>)</small></sup> 06:15, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>IP Frehley was an account set up by indefblocked <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWordBomb_879f.html" title="User:WordBomb">User:WordBomb</a>. I blocked WordBomb because he posted what he thinks are personal details about <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">User:Mantanmoreland</a>. When asked for an assurance that he wouldn't do it again, in exchange for an unblock, he responded by posting the details once more on his talk page, so that was that. He started making allegations by e-mail that Mantanmoreland had used a sockpuppet account. I like Mantanmoreland and think he's a good editor, so I didn't want to have to judge whether to block him for sockpuppetry. I therefore handed the situation over to FloNight as an uninvolved admin, and she has been dealing with it since then, together with Fred Bauder who has conducted a check user and, I believe, has blocked some of the accounts WordBomb/IP Frehley set up.

<p>This stuff is classic trolling. There was an incident, a minor incident which did not amount to much. Based on that minor incident a number of administrators have wasted a great deal of time due to the agitation of this editor.

<dd>The allegation of breach of implied confidentiality is serious though, and merits response. (Not necessarily investigation -- but <i>response</i>: some explanation or justification.) It is not OK for an administrator to tell or imply to someone that they will keep private communications private, and then leak them to the other side of a dispute.

<p>I think some context is needed here. Fred discovered that Mantanmoreland was using a second account and editing a particular article with both accounts. He warned Mantanmoreland to stop, and as far as I know, he has. WordBomb, and later Homey for some reason, decided Mantanmoreland had to be publically <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pillory.html" title="Pillory">pilloried</a>, filing two RFCUs (which were declined) and asking Fred (on more than one occasion I believe) to make a more public statement, which he has declined to do. Unless you share the opinion that a good editor who made one mistake and stopped after warning should be publically crucified, there's really no reason to entertain this discussion any longer. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 15:20, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Yes, if you go to <a href="../../../f/e/e/User_talk%7EFeedyourfeet_99c3.html" title="User talk:Feedyourfeet">User Talk:Feedyourfeet</a>, just under the "click here to leave me a message" text, on the left, there is a full stop which is a link to a partial archive of warnings and other critical comments.

My irony meter burned out when I saw it... I'm not sure if it's an incident, as far as I'm concerned it's mainly another example of an obviously opinionated editor being determined to portray themselves as whiter than white, but if anyone uninvolved feels like helping him with some constructive comments then I'd appreciate it. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:27, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It amuses me... this essentially is the reason my talkpage is protected... administrators admit JzG was out of line but reason that indefinitely protecting my talkpage, with the stated reason of making me leave, is okay because I wasnt being fair. I wasnt being "nice" to him. Just for the record, when are you planning on unprotecting my talkpage? Or how about, when can I vote on RFAs again, since JzG's cronies are now telling Mets501 that I cant vote. Is there even any imaginary rational for my talkpage being protected or is this just a case of "yah, way to sock it to him"? <a href="../../../t/c/h/User%7ETchadienne_58ee.html" title="User:Tchadienne">Tchadienne</a> 16:16, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Below is the corespodence I had with ptk✰fgs and he recomended I report my problems here...</p>
<p>Re: Drosenbe I am Angelo Liguori of Strange But Surf. I have been the victim of harrasment since by the person behind the banned aliases drosenbe, blacktooth, drosenbe626, smellyfatboy and others since April of 2006. Wikipedia noticed the spamming and sock puppertry of this user drosenbe enuf to ban him and his alias' The history of the Surf Music pages show that quite clearly. An attempt is now made being made to portray me as Blacktooth, one of his many aliaes.</p>
<p>I need not point out his offences against Wikipedia, nor I do need to establish the truth of my identity. Wikipedia has figured it out, without my help. I have had this discussion via email with Soundclick, My Space and other sites that he abuses the freedom they allow him to slander and harrass me, my band and others. They either has banned him, forced him to remove slanderous comments or simply ignored his threats of legal action.</p>
<p>I dont not want to cause trouble for him, I just want it to stop.</p>
<p>Not only for my band, but for all the bands that work hard to establish themselves in history. I am quite aware of the rules and know that my band has not yet reached the level of fame to warrant grand statements in history. I am also aware that this user's only need to be part of Wikipedia is to continue to harras me and the entire surf genre. He has been banned from every single surf music site I can think of. I commend Wikipedia for the actions taken so far, for I cannot keep defending the enire genre of surf rock forever. Thank you for your time, I have tried to email other Wikipedians to discuss this but most of the editors do not have an email addy listed. Please help.</p>

<p>This discussion page... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blacktooth&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blacktooth&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blacktooth&amp;action=history</a> were edited as shown in the history by his latest sock puppet that you banned... $taypuffmarshmellowman - the revision can be seen here. I corrected it, but I should not have coreected a discussion page and he should not have edited it either. Most of the editors of these pages do not have emails and leaves me very little recouse but to have this public discussion.</p>
<p>The page was posted by wikipedia to alert people to his vandalism, but was changed to use my name instead of his. Check the history, its there.</p>
<p>This harrasment must stop. I will supply you with whatever help you need to protect not only me, but wikipedia from this continued vandalism and harrasment.</p>
<p>he has also posted this self promotion page... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Dave" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Dave" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Dave</a> using the name...

<p>I would recommend that you make a post at Administrators' Noticeboard/Incidents. If this is a user who is continually using sockpuppets and harrassing you, you will need an administrator to deal with it. I am not an administrator (and I also did not ban any of his other accounts; I merely reported them). I realize that you were not the only one to edit my post at Blacktooth's talk page. No harm done, just avoid editing others' comments in the future. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarbles_Mahoney_4150.html" title="User:Marbles Mahoney">Marbles Mahoney</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarbles_Mahoney_6278.html" title="User talk:Marbles Mahoney">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marbles_Mahoney_722b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marbles Mahoney">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>I am not sure what exactly Marbles Mahoney means when he says this user is harrassing him. However, it appears to me that User:Smellyfatboy and User:Imnotrappaport are sockpuppets of <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrosenbe_669f.html" title="User:Drosenbe">User:Drosenbe</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrosenbe626_307f.html" title="User:Drosenbe626">User:Drosenbe626</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacktooth_4b0f.html" title="User:Blacktooth">User:Blacktooth</a> were blocked *after* a sockpuppet accusation, but Blacktooth's block was for another reason. User:$taypuffmarshmellowman is another likely sockpuppet of the same user, blocked for username choice. All of these users have focused their edits almost entirely on adding information about someone named Dave Rosenberg, or posting uncivil comments about Angelo Liguori.</dd>

<p>User:Gfmer has added to about 60 multiple medical articles an external link to the "Geneva Foundation for Medical Education and Research". These links are to pages that contain no further information on the topic but are merely collection of pictures of patients and Xrays. There is no introduction to indicate what features are being shown or whether the images represent common or rare variations of a disease. Hence only a specialist will find the image of direct use, and even as a non-specialist GP many of the pictures seem mere curiosities and fail to add understanding about the conditions. So whilst teh website is a useful resource for a doctor looking for specialist images, it is inapprioproate material for the general readership and fails to give any additional describtion. Could an admin consider doing the bulk roll-back tool you have to these 60 odd pages&#160;? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 23:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dt>Jossi has harassed me about not having a user account until I got one. He has already posted an RfC calling me disruptive and been immediately turned down. Now he is threatening me with blocking my account because Ive deleted content which is off topic (he claims that deletion of content is vandalism when, in fact, it is only vandalism when done in an attempt to compromise the integrity of the encyclopedia - that was pointed out to him and he is still threatening to block me). I see his actions as an ongoing abuse of his admin powers and am seeking a resolution. I admit that I have logged on anon as well as in this user account, but I got my user account today and have sometimes forgotten to log on. Let me make that clear..I edited anonymously for some time before getting a user account (it was during this time that Jossi was harassing me about it). I got a user account today and have, when making edits since then, sometimes forgotten to log in. However, while admins have had plenty of opportunity to show evidence of me engaging in Sockpuppet abuse (which isn't just editing from different IPs, but detailed abuse as in the Sockpuppet page), they have failed to do so. Further, I have made no secret of being the same person and whenever I felt confusion might exist or when I was asked, I clarified. On one occassion, I posted in Illegal immigration in the United States to clarify that a post came from me when I had forgotten to log on and that explanation was immediately deleted by Jossi (and has not been undeleted). Seeing my explanation immediately deleted, I assumed that the best thing to do when it happens is just let it go.<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychohistorian_e240.html" title="User:Psychohistorian">Psychohistorian</a> 02</dt>

<p>At no time has he/she denied ownership of the other offending addresses. But appeared happy to allow you to reach that conclusion on your own, and failed to correct the misunderstanding. - from Brimba</p>
<p>Ahh, looks like the IPs weren't as unrelated as I thought. On further inspection (using the City link at the bottom of an IP's talk page) are about 60km away from each other. The Virginia IP was registered to an Time Warner subsidary in Virginia. (compare <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/city.ch?ip=71.74.217.83" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/city.ch?ip=71.74.217.83" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=198.97.67.56" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=198.97.67.56" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Wright-Patterson+Air+Force+Base&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.041284,-84.302216&amp;spn=0.935684,2.738342&amp;om=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Wright-Patterson+Air+Force+Base&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.041284,-84.302216&amp;spn=0.935684,2.738342&amp;om=1" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> ).

<dd>Brimba claims that I was happy to have people be confused. Though, as Ive pointed out, I took it on my own initiative to clarify the issue whenever I thought the confusion existed (such as the edit I mentioned above to the talk page of Illegal immigration in the United States). I have to ask, why would I take it on my own initiative to clarify any confusion if I was happy to have people be confused?<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychohistorian_e240.html" title="User:Psychohistorian">Psychohistorian</a> 03:35, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A content RfC is never inappropriate, agreed. An admin threatening an editor with having their account blocked for deleting content (which does not violate the 3RR) is, however. Let's be clear here, there are three issues. 1.) Harassment of anon editors (all that has been addressed was whether I was engaging in sockpuppetry, the harassment has not been addressed yet, though the evidence is in the Illegal immigration in the United States article), 2.) Whether or not I've been disruptive (and there is no evidence of that which has been brought forth), 3.) Threatening to block me because I deleted content in accordance with policy. All three accusations, especially when taken together, make it clear that Jossi is attempting to use his admin powers to control content in that article. Further, Will Breback, Brimba, and Jossi have all participated in editing that article and all share the same politics on the issue. MER-C is the only admin who has posted on this issue who does not have an emotional connection to the content of the article. I am looking for third parties who do not have an attachment to the content of the article to examine this issue.<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychohistorian_e240.html" title="User:Psychohistorian">Psychohistorian</a> 11:34, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Many editors warned the different IPs you used about these deletions and behavior, which you ignored. As for my actions, these are there for the community to see: I have welcomed you, explained to you how to merge articles, how to add references, etc. as well as explaining to you the futility of editwarring. I have twice in the past 24 hours extended an invitation to edit this article amicably, that you rejected on the basis of your assessment of my integrity as an editor. I invite you for the third time to collaborate in this article amicably, to avoid making comments about other editors motives while ignoring yours, to desist from deleting properly sourced material from articles, and avoid inserting your opinions in the text of articles. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 15:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I welcome any third party not already attached to the article to examine my behavior in this matter. While we disagree regarding WP:NPOV and WP:NOR (I feel that you've violated those policies and you feel that I have), I have never threatened to lock another editor out of an article because I didn't agree with their politics. While we might disagree on what is not relevant material (sourced or not), I have never threatened to lock another editor out of an article because I didn't agree with his politics. Of course I have an emotional attachment to the article, but, again, I have never threatened to lock another editor out of an article because I didn't agree with their politics. You have done so. Therefore, it is incumbent upon you to prove that such a block is warranted and, so far, you haven't done that. I welcome your attempt to do so using hard data, not baseless accusations. As for using different IPs, what this boils down to is whether or not editing anonymously is allowed by policy (it is) and whether or not third party administrators feel that I have done so to engage in sockpuppetry (the only one who has weighed in on the issue states that he doesn't believe I have). I don't believe you would have asked for a peaceful resolution on this matter if I didn't tell you that I was going to raise the issue. I believe you would have continued with your abuse if I hadn't told you that I was going to make an official complaint. Finally, I am convinced that you are looking to resolve it under the radar now so that you can continue with your abuse later.<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychohistorian_e240.html" title="User:Psychohistorian">Psychohistorian</a> 16:36, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you are so convinced about my future actions, then there is no much to discuss, is there? For the record, the reason for my invitations to you to edit amicably, these were not done because of your complaint (which by the way I invited you to make when you first accused me of harassment) but because I believe that edit warring can be avoided when editors collaborate and respect each other event after a heated dispute. Also for the record, note that each and every one of my additions to the article were backed up by detailed references from scholarly journals, books and articles, and in complete adherence with Wikipedia content policies. So here is my extended hand again: I invite you to collaborate on this and other articles amicably within the boundaries of WP content policies and assuming good faith. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 19:24, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you believe that, in harassing me about being an anon editor and threatening to block me for deleting content in accordance with policy, that you did anything wrong? I don't believe you do. If you don't, then there is nothing disinclining you from doing it again in the future. You have the power to do it again. So, I can't believe that you won't do it again. I could easily agree to a truce if you did believe your actions were wrong. And creating content, updating content, and deleting content in accordance with policy is what editing is about. It is inevitable that different editors have different understandings of policy so it is inevitable that wat one editor does, another will view as against policy. What should not be part of the editing process is an admin making threats against a user to use his admin rights so that that admin can have an article reflect his politics. My complaint is your misuse of your position as an administrator. My concern and why I cannot accept a truce at this time is that you don't see anything wrong with that misuse.<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychohistorian_e240.html" title="User:Psychohistorian">Psychohistorian</a> 20:14, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I did not apply a block, ony warned your multiple anon IPs about disruptive edits (joining the voices of many other admins and editors that warned you of the same). When I saw the need for a block, I placed a request in this page. FYI, I intend to continue editing this article but I refuse to edit war with you.

So, how did 11 admins create nine posts and many of them have more than one post? Is this a "breads and fishes" thing? Of those nine posts, three of them are part of the anon editing harassment. Those are Brimba's post to 71.74.209.82 at 06:57 7 August 2006, Will Breback's post to 198.97.67.58 at 16:22 August 2006, and Will Breback's post at 16:23 4 August 2006 to the same account. Of those nine posts, three of them I'll fess up to. They were a result of my not knowing certain policies and, once I was aware of them, what I was doing that lead to them stopped. Those are Will Breback's 21:00 23 July 2006 post to 71.74.209.82 and both of the posts from Abstract Idiot to 198.97.67.58 (both of these were me deleting improperly placed claims of sockpuppetry - they had no evidence with them - Mer-C explaind the proper way to delete these tags and I stopped doing it). Of the remaining three posts, two were from Jossi and were part of the issue being discussed here. One was from Bachrach44 20:28 2 August 2006 to 71.74.209.82 and about him deleting a direct quote I had added to the Illegal immigration in the United States article on the grounds that that direct quote violated POV (how can a sourced direct qoote violate POV??).<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychohistorian_e240.html" title="User:Psychohistorian">Psychohistorian</a> 00:38, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Second, the other posts you mentioned were not warnings (for example, Dark T's post is, "Your argument with another anonymous IP user on the Talk:White (people) is very hard to follow if you do not sign your posts with an account name. It's harder to distinguish two IP numbers than it is to distinguish two user names.

Wikipedia will automatically sign your post with the user name you created" - not a warning).

<p>Firstly, I was not confused by Psychohistorian's actions, I just simply overlooked something and jumped to the wrong conclusion. The discussion on my talk page wasn't about the user's edits but the allegations of sockpuppetry, which have been resolved for all I can see. Editing at work and at home under different IPs is fine, as long as it stays clear of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>.

So I increased the block to 48 hours. According to him I'm an abusive admin who is out to buy him and I have a Napoleonic complex which I've suborned into harrasing him personally.

<dd>I disagree for blocking for "personal attacks." One reason I do is that the person who makes them is usually breaking a number of other rules and conventions at the same time. Take this guy: he seems to be here to disrupt. He came to DRV shadow boxing, throwing jabs at nothing, just begging for someone to quarrel with. That's disruption. It isn't even civility, as much as it is hysteria, if not outright paranoia. I support the block, as he has had multiple occasions to choose between writing articles and writing attacks, and he has chosen the latter. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:15, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm seeking a rough consensus to unblock <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardsplayer4life_41e9.html" title="User:Cardsplayer4life">User:Cardsplayer4life</a>. Background information follows. This is quite condensed and I may well have omitted something important. I encourage you to do your own research before commenting.</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">User:Kelly Martin</a> declared that there was now a policy that anyone who reverted edits to a certain state would get blocked. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Logos&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68401221" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Logos&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68401221" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> When questioned how this new policy came about, Kelly explained:</p>
<p>"I have now formulated a policy as a result of the discussion. You may continue the discussion if you wish, but the policy is now made, and will be enforced." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Logos&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68412132" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Logos&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68412132" rel="nofollow">[51]</a></p>
<p>"Anybody on Wikipedia can attempt to set policy. I just happen to be good at actually doing so, especially in the copyright arena, and so I have decided to do so in this case. If you choose to ignore the policy that I have decided is best for Wikipedia, you may find yourself blocked, a state which many Wikipedians find problematic." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kelly_Martin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68448990" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kelly_Martin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68448990" rel="nofollow">[52]</a></p>
<p>When Kelly was criticized for what seemed to one person like a "unilateral and intimidating" statement she explained:</p>
<p>"It was unilateral, and it was intended to be intimidating." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Kelly_Martin2&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68525562" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Kelly_Martin2&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68525562" rel="nofollow">[53]</a></p>
<p><a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardsplayer4life_41e9.html" title="User:Cardsplayer4life">User:Cardsplayer4life</a> disagreed with Kelly and reinserted images she had removed with the edit summary:</p>
<p>"According to the policy: "Sports team logos may be used in articles or aticle sections where the team is discussed", so logos are ok as long as teams are discussed. (they are))" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_12_Conference&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68494626" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_12_Conference&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68494626" rel="nofollow">[54]</a></p>
<p>Kelly reverted this edit with the rollback tool <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_12_Conference&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=68494626" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_12_Conference&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=68494626" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> and blocked Cardsplayer4life. I feel a block is not necessary and I asked Kelly if she would consider lifting it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kelly_Martin&amp;diff=68573297&amp;oldid=68568126" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kelly_Martin&amp;diff=68573297&amp;oldid=68568126" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> I've waited an hour and she seems not to be online so I'm taking the issue up here instead. Would there be a rough consensus for unblocking <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardsplayer4life_41e9.html" title="User:Cardsplayer4life">User:Cardsplayer4life</a>?</p>
<p>I have no opinion on the policy question. Using the team logos in this way is, as far as I can tell, well within the boundaries of fair use law but it's still something we may wish to avoid. In non-emergency situations we usually set policy by discussion and consensus rather than fiat and intimidation. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 10:03, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the case of long-standing clearly defined copyright policies but I don't feel this is such a case. I've long been opposed to us having galleries of unlicenced images, see my post here, for example: <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-January/038214.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-January/038214.html" rel="nofollow">[57]</a> but I don't think the case with the sports team logos is as clear as you imply. Whether the logos come in a batch ahead of a list or one-by-one as a part of a list does not seem to me like a crucial distinction. I'd probably tend to side with you in avoiding the batches but I don't feel we should block those who disagree. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 12:46, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair use has always been explicit in this regard: images may be used only for illustrating the subject. Image galleries, userboxes, user space and so on have never been acceptable places to put unfree images. Sure, we'd love it if the logos were released into the public domain so we could have those nice image galleries that magazines have, but as I understand it we have had legal advice on this from Brad, and his legal advice is that we have to take a conservative approach or rik having our asses sued. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:49, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While this might be a borderline case where copyright is concerned, the 'gallery' format for displaying the logos looks like it runs afoul of our policy. Subjectively, I'd be inclined to argue that the gallery format doesn't look very good, either—it's just an array of logos chunked into the middle of an article. In any event, there was an ongoing (albeit rather slow) edit war going on over the inclusion of the images. There should have been a discussion and resolution on this issue before the images went back into the article, and Cardsplayer4life should have known better to continue revert warring. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 13:05, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True, our intentions are different but still. If you go to an article about a particular Pokémon there'll be a prominent picture of that Pokémon.

That image page has a link to <a href="../../../p/o/k/Category%7EPok%C3%A9mon_images_3466.html" title="Category:Pokémon images">Category:Pokémon_images</a>. To me that link says: "Hey! You want to look at some Pokémon images? Here are lots more!" So, unintentionally, we've created and widely linked to a page which is nothing but a gallery with unlicenced images. Saying "well, it's not a finished product so we're not really publishing it" sounds awfully weak to me.

<dd>How many warnings do you have to issue? The user clearly knew that he was violating the policy and that Kelly was going to block him, unless he didn't read the previous edit summaries, which would've been very foolish. On a page that has had copyright material added inappriopriately about a dozen times, stating "do this again and you will be blocked" is entirely appropriate. If someone, in the face of that final warning, does it again, it's a clear cut case for an instant block. <span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s">ed g2s</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s">talk</a></span> 13:58, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agree. There's ways to be persuasive and emphatic without making it such an overt domination of will - in fact, I would say that being overly-dominant, together with a hint of smarm ("many Wikipedians find [being blocked] problematic.") encourages the behavior of rebellion more than an approach that seeks comity. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 14:16, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bottom line, it seems to me, is we need to balance keeping our project free and immune from criticism on copyright issues, and not putting off good contributors. Let's put it another way; although I agree that the blocked editor acted very unwisely, and as I said I support the block, when we have to block people for this kind of thing it is a good sign that the policy needs tweaked and/or clarified, so that it won't happen again. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 14:12, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have been a participant of the discussion on the logos almost from day one. In fact, I proposed a clarification to the logo guideline that would have specifically clarified that galleries were not OK and that certain other uses are OK. You can read about this at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Logos#Clarification_on_use_of_sports_team_logos" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Logos#Clarification_on_use_of_sports_team_logos" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>]. There was productive discussion occurring on this over the last several days. Then Kelly Martin, apparantly based partly on some discussions Kelly had at Wikimania, decided to swoop in and unilaterally declare what the policy should be. In my opinion, this is not the right way to do things.<br />
<dl>
<dd>The discussion was going along fine and Kelly does not have the right to come in and attempt to exercise some sort of veto and then begin blocking people.

<dd>I am a concerned about one aspect of this thread: I was at Wikimania, &amp; I never knew any substantial &amp; formal discussion about image galleries took place. (Maybe I was too busy meeting various Wikipedians from "the old days" like Andre Engels &amp; Sannse.) Not that I would have attended any meeting on this matter because I had other interests in attending; yet one item I remember that was discussed repeatedly at this conference was the need for <i>transparency</i>. Call me a process fetishist, but if a decision like this is made, either it should be done as visibly as possible or its implementation needs to be as gradual as possible. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 22:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Wow, thanks everyone for all the nice comments and positive support. I have never been blocked before (never even received a warning before). I would comment on you guys' individual pages, but I can't because I am blocked. I really enjoy editing on wikipedia, and wish I would have got a warning or something before being blocked. (you can look back at my post record, I am not a troll or anything like that) Reading through the policy, it seems as if I was indeed correct in my edits, as I understand it. I will be leary of any edits I make to pages in the future, as it seems making edits to pages might result in being blocked again in the future. I guess I will be hanging up my Wikipedia hat for awhile, since it seems as if I might be causing trouble that I did not intend to cause. I apologize if I did anything to cause too much trouble, I sure did not mean to. As a word of advice to admins, in the future it might be good to give out a warning telling an individual what they were doing wrong, before blocking them, especially when the policy is ambiguous at best, and direct them to the place where the official policy states they can't do what they are doing. (I <i>still</i> haven't received anything telling me why what I did was wrong. All references I have seen have only backed up what I did as being correct.) In any event, it has been fun. Perhaps I will be back in the future at some point.

<dd>I will consider an unblock request if and only if Cardsplayer4life promises not only not to do this particular thing again (that is, insert a gallery of unlicensed images into a page on Wikipedia, something which is clearly outside of policy), but also to ensure that he has examined both the history and the talk pages of any article before editing it. His failure to do so is the cause of this block. Ample warning was in place that reverting the gallery would be responded to with a block; his unawareness of this is due to his own negligence. Ignorance of warnings placed on talk pages or in recent edit history is not an excuse for gross breaches of policy.

<dd>Thank you for the unblock. I appear to have the ability to edit now. I harbor no ill will towards Kelly, as I hope she does not towards me. Having policy decided beforehand, so that people are clear on what they can and can't do, might be wise in the future, or at the very least having a discussion before blocking might be a way to handle things better in the future. I was perfectly willing to discuss matters (as evidenced by my posting on the discussion page), but using moderation powers to come up with individual policies makes it very hard for individual Wikipedians to know how to make edits. (in other words, moderators can come up with policy spur of the moment, with no offical written policy, and it is hard to read the minds of them beforehand). In any event, I will try to keep my edits to a minimum in the future to avoid causing any further trouble, I am generally a very peaceful individual and really dislike conflict.

<dd>They're not "describing the subject in question". They're decorating another (admittedly related) subject. And our "fair use" policy does not allow that. The use of a team's icon in an article about a league that the team is a member of adds no more information <i>about the league</i> than does the inclusion of the team's name in its list of members. Since the former requires the use of unlicensed media, and the latter does not, we preference the latter. I am not going to point to specific policy because this is simply obvious common sense, and Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 00:52, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Give us a break. As if this makes the wildly inappropiate behavior <b>all ok</b> in some manner. When someone makes a block, it's <i>courtesy</i> to talk about it before unblocking, and that's what was shown here. Apologise for courtesy?? On the other hand, demanding that the editor aspire to some arbitrary higher standard before you'll consent to an unblock, especially in light of the adminstratorial conduct here, is simply farcical. Yes, it's bad that the ip/editor again chose to re-insert images while discussion was ongoing, but this damage is easy to contain. The damage from the corrosive attitude displayed in "creating policy" leading up to the block is not easily contained, and is thus a much larger problem. Is it really so mentally difficuly to seperate these two things: Block ok, manner of block not ok.<br />

Just that way everything would be "above board" and no one could come back after Kelly to say anything negative later.

<dd>No, this certainly does not warrant an indefinite block. Cardsplayer4life shows an agreeable and cooperative attitude in his comments above and on his talk page. If he, while blocked, logged out and reverted again, that's a very bad action, but it may well have been an action made in frustration about being blocked so brusquely. Given the attitude of cooperativity he displays here, I think we should be forgiving in this case. At least ask him first if (and why) he did it.</dd>

<dd>Agree wholeheartedly with Mark. I believe <i>all</i> recently blocked users should be cut some slack regarding what they do in the frustration of reacting to the block. For instance, don't scrutinize their posts for personal attacks, don't expect model behavior, don't take it so personally if they tell you how abusive you are. A block is a shock. All admins are more powerful than all regular users; but admins are so <b>much</b> more powerful than a blocked user that it should give them pause. It's not the right moment to express your irritation with how much trouble the user is being by slapping on an indefinite. Assume even more good faith than usual. This all goes double if the first block can be seen as dubious or unfair. I support unblocking now. Oh, and btw, I'm assuming good faith on Deckiller's comment that we "might be able to get an indefinite for this": I'm sure he didn't mean it as crassly as it sounded. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 08:48, 10 August 2006 (UTC).

<dd>I would agree that a certain amount of "lashing out" should be politely ignored in most cases; here however he reinserted the edit for which he was blocked in the first place. The minimum should be to serve the full 24 hours originally applied. Whether to extend it depends on whether this was an accident or whether he has a history of making dubious edits while logged out (see Mackensen and Haukur's discussion below). <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 11:32, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd love to help in this project. I've tried to help when he was still able to edit legally, but found it extremely difficult.

<p>I don't think it needs saying, but it's worth making clear that I, for one, would completely oppose an unblock. We tried "mentoring" him, and it didn't work. I wouldn't consider an unblock sooner than a year after I implemented the community ban, leave alone a month. I know this will sound harsh to Jumbo and others that have done their best to reform Pnatt, but I'm not sure why this particular tendentious edit warrior has received so much sympathy compared to the others that pass through this page. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:51, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Instead, if you look at his contribs over the last day or so (since he was unblocked), he has used the the account for fighting, name-calling, personal attacks, and a disruptive spate of incivility. This is not a legitimate use of multiple accounts. I therefore propose that Tchadienne be blocked indefinitely, with the understanding that he is for now free to go and peacefully edit under the new account he has probably switched to by now. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 18:51, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It does indeed look like a repeating pattern of disruption, trouble, and moving on to a clean sheet to start all over again - interspered with numerous valuable contributions. The question is whether we should block the old accounts, including Tchadienne, and await developments (history indicates that there will soon be an association made with the old accounts) or whether to go to ArbCom now. Since Tchadienne has now asserted (s)he is switching accounts again I think ArbCom is unlikely to accept, so I think we bank the evidence, block the old and disruptive accounts as an inappropriate use of alternate accounts, assume good faith in respect of the change, and stand ready with the Wikitrout if it starts again. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 19:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, reading his comments, 1 week doesn't seem like enough, especially when you consider that he's been acting like this pereodically for months... I don't think a week will really change much.

<dd>You know me; when it comes to blocking for personnal attacks I'm just a big softie.

<dd>I would advise against jumping to an indefinite block in this case, at least for now. When it comes to editors that have a history of positive contributions to Wikipedia, indefinite blocks should be the very last measure taken (preferably decided by group consensus). As far as I'm concerned, indefinite blocks should only be used when a user has shown beyond doubt that he or she will never make a positive contribution to Wikipedia, ever. If that hasn't been proven, but a long-term block is necessary, go with three months or so. That's plenty of time to allow someone to cool off and put things in perspective (and should be enough to discourage most unrepentant vandals). You never know when an unruly editor may just have lost his cool after a frustrating day (or week). <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 01:38, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>TB, did you read my suggestion up at the very top of this section? Noting that he has repeatedly announced his intention to abandon the Tchadienne account and move on to a new one (something he may well have already done), I suggested we make sure that happens, by indef-blocking that account, but explicitly permit him to quietly and hopefully productively move on. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 02:08, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry that I didn't address your initial comment very well. To clarify, I have the feeling that we're pushing this user into the position of having to creating a new account to escape other users' vengeance, rather than using blocks as a temporary measure to discourage policy violations. I do appreciate that you've proposed an alternative which allows him (or her) to fly back in under the radar, and agree that Tchadienne's behavior is inappropriate, but I sense that vindication may be outweighing mercy here. And I don't mean that as an accusation, just an observation.</dd>

<dd>In any case, if Tchadienne has already moved on and no longer uses his/her former account, a block wouldn't be necessary. If it becomes apparent that a disruptive sock has been created, then it shouldn't be too difficult to address the issue at that future point — going for an indefinite block now may be a sort of chilling effect. ...but, then again, a few months back I tried encouraging Thewolfstar to mend her ways up until her first indefblock.

<p>This may not be anything bad, but it looks suspicious to me... Just looking at recent changes, and there was an enormous list of new accounts all being made at the exact same time... Looking at new account log, there is a whole page full within the last few minutes, though none of the few I checked seem to have done anything yet. At the same time as I saw that go by, almost nothing else was showing up on recent changes (not for lack of room, just like nothing was happening), and I was getting site errors saying it was having trouble.

<dd>I've seen this happen before, when there are database problems, so you can't update articles. User accounts are, I guess, a separate database, so registrations continue.

<p>Recent Delete: There was an AfD dialog for Jayram Menon which resulted in a delete due to non-verifiability. The original AfD was initiated by an administrator was based the AfD on an erroneous premise on the number of hits that was got through a Google search. However the dispute remained on the verifiability. I am enclosing a scan of a press/news item that was featured in a leading newspaper in India that does acknowledge the notability and verifiability of the individual.

<p>User:216Cali may be a sockpuppet of User:Francespeabody, or the other way around.

There is an RfC I see open in regards to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Francespeabody" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Francespeabody" rel="nofollow">Franscispeabody account</a>. They both linger in the exact same few articles, and the 216Cali account often seems to appear to defend Frances as their primary contribution. What made me suspect was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scholars_for_9%2F11_Truth&amp;diff=68746727&amp;oldid=68746122" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scholars_for_9%2F11_Truth&amp;diff=68746727&amp;oldid=68746122" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> by Frances and what followed. Another editor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scholars_for_9/11_Truth&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=68746727" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scholars_for_9/11_Truth&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=68746727" rel="nofollow">reverts her</a>, per the concensus we're reaching on the talk page. 216Cali then arrives to back Frances, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scholars_for_9/11_Truth&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=68747871" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scholars_for_9/11_Truth&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=68747871" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, which features the summary of <i>"Wow, FP, you were right, same ol' same censorship. I have updated the article and renamed the section in question to more accurately define why it is included"</i>. 216Cali also extensively defends Francespeabody as seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Condoleezza_Rice&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64800626" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Condoleezza_Rice&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64800626" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Another thing that makes me suspect a puppet connection is the fact that the 216Cali user did nothing at all on WP from 28 July 2006 until today, when people pointed out that Francespeabody would violate 3rr if she reverted once more--and the next edit is 216Cali doing the same edit again.</p>
<p><br />
The confusing bit is that the 216Cali account technically edited <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condoleezza_Rice_57ca.html" title="Condoleezza Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a> first, so I'm not sure which would technically be considered the master. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 07:32, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Potters house, it looks to me like the suggestions various people left on your talk page were good ones; as for the article dispute, please try to work things out through the mediation once a mediator arrives. They tend to be pretty helpful. If mediation doesn't work out, there's some further dispute resolution procedures available, but don't worry about that unless it becomes necessary.
<p>Sometimes the way we do things takes some getting used to, but the people trying to help you on your talk page generally know what they're doing, so please try to accept their advice about citing sources and that type of thing (the policy docs they mentioned are also important to understand). Also, yes, the 3RR results in an automatic block, so be very careful about reverting--discuss the issue on the article's talk page instead.

<dd>(heh, edit conflict): Further: it looks like OrangeGum has been making some basically ok edits, but has <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> issues and is acting out childishly. S/he's (originally) blocked for talk page warning removal (now for attacks), and the talk page is protected. Personal attacks are not mentioned in the <s>block message</s> talk page. Samir, it would be good if you could add a mention of that, plus something about WP:CIV and about citing sources, and ask the user to act more maturely in general.
<p>Jenny--don't let this kind of thing get to you too much--you're probably dealing with a dweeb juvenile who is way overaggressive online, something that happens quite often, so don't take it personally or lose sleep over it. It's just someone else's behavior problems and/or sugar overdosage that you were unlucky enough to get mixed up with temporarily. Generally, I'd suggest either backing away from the person or trying to communicate in a way that tones down confrontation, even if the other person is needlessly combative. See: <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">WP:COOL</a>. Of course this is not always easy to do, and admin intervention does help when it gets bad like this&#160;;-).</p>
<p>As for the OR-ish edit about what model of guitar was shown in Back to the Future Part II, it's not very damaging even if it's wrong, so for that kind of thing I generally prefer to add a {{fact}} tag and bring up the issue on the talk page rather than reverting immediately. I'd only revert if 1) some time goes by without the citation request being responded to; and 2) I thought the claim was actually wrong or controversial. This is just a matter of trying to get along with other editors on a collaborative project like this. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 11:05, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Missingno was the subject of a complaint here recently, he (I guess it's a he) was engaging in <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive125_351a.html#Hel-p_me" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive125">odd behaviour</a>, running multiple accounts, making no edits to the encyclopaedia and generally being a pain. I blocked all but the one account, and in an uncharacteristic assumption of good faith I advised him to edit articles about cats since he seems to like them. The result was a few additions of pictures of kittens to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat.html" title="Cat">Cat</a>, and the creation of a user sub-page of pictures of women he loves (please, no jokes about pussy). This was then moved to an entirely inappropriate pseudo-user page (User:Missingno-Women I Love). I've blocked Missingno for a month, deleted the gallery of women, and also deleted his user page, which was the focus of his activity here. Four article edits, the aforementioned kitten additions. If anyone feels I am a wicked and evil person, please slap my wrists. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 19:11, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, Joshua. For info, LART = Luser Attitutde Readjustment Tool&#160;:-) The thing is, if you look in Category:Schools of Medicine in England what you see is the established GMC-accredited schools. Imperial College, King's, Guys and St. Thomas's - and then he wants to add this oddball place named after its founder, registered in Senegal and not accredited by the DfES or GMC? This institution, whatever the hell it is, just <i>does not belong</i> in that category. Since my parents live not far from Luton I am minded to go there and scope it out some time. The behaviour of this user has nudged me towards believeing it's a degree mill, but mustn't be hasty. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 23:01, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At this point, we probably need another checkuser to put to bed her claims that we're doing this without evidence. You know, because she's not accepting the fact that she just jumped onto the scene a few days back and started pushing the exact same edits that Lingeron and Wolfstar did as evidence. And she considers it a coincidence that she's spouting the same rhetoric about the featured article review on <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> being an attempt to "destroy the article." So maybe we should checkuser her.

<p>In the edit summary to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denmark-Norway&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68638801" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denmark-Norway&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68638801" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> the user referred to a fellow editor as "fjeldape" which means mountain ape. This in it self is not good, but when you factor in that this is a nationalist derogatory term used in Denmark against Norwegians it becomes highly unaceptable. The reported editor is Danish and the editor which was labelled a mountain ape is Norwegian. The editor has been warned against personal attacks numerous times, but has removed many warnings from his talk page. He is presently blocked for 3RR violation, but a reaction for this violation would be in order as well.</p>
<p>The user has been involved in a handful of articles now and the mode of operations seem not to improve. Frequent reverting sometimes just within the 3RR, sometimes braking it. A common trait is also personal attacks against editors disagreing with him.</p>
<p>A third point is some of his random insulting edits such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Muslim&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58617640" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Muslim&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58617640" rel="nofollow">[77]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Muslim&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58627829" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Muslim&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58627829" rel="nofollow">[78]</a> against muslims and his entries of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61397284" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61397284" rel="nofollow">17:42, 30 June 2006</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61433050" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61433050" rel="nofollow">21:32, 30 June 2006</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68599213" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68599213" rel="nofollow">13:49, 9 August 2006</a> to the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> article.</p>
<p>He has been involved on this page on the following occasions before: <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive120_975a.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive120">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive120</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive121_9df2.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive121">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive121</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive122_b98a.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive122">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive122</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive125_351a.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive125">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive125</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes administrators have given him warnings which he has broken without penalty and sometimes administrators have stated that penalties would increase if the mentioned behaviour continued, but that has not been followed through. He is frustrating and using up time for many editors and not showing any signs of improvement, but adminstrator involvement has been short. I fear that he will be alowed to go on just because of the narrow nature of the articles he is involved in.<a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EInge_1e43.html" title="User:Inge">Inge</a> 02:05, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can see that Comanche is currently under a 24h block. Just to get the record straight from the beginning: I had a long discussion with Comanche yesterday (see <a href="../../../d/e/n/Talk%7EDenmark-Norway_5805.html" title="Talk:Denmark-Norway">Talk:Denmark-Norway</a>), which became a rather frustrating experience. I'm worried about the attitude he has shown on <a href="../../../v/i/k/Talk%7EViking_Age_03cc.html" title="Talk:Viking Age">Talk:Viking Age</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/a/Talk%7EScandinavia_a84b.html" title="Talk:Scandinavia">Talk:Scandinavia</a> and other pages. Some time ago I wrote a long message to him trying to persuade him to become more friendly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Comanche_cph#Pr.C3.B8v_at_v.C3.A6re_mere_venlig_over_for_andre_brugere" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Comanche_cph#Pr.C3.B8v_at_v.C3.A6re_mere_venlig_over_for_andre_brugere" rel="nofollow">[79]</a> unfortunately without success. (To be sure he understood it, I wrote it in Danish, and any Dane, Norwegian or Swede can confirm its contents since our languages are mutually intelligible). His later edits prove that he *did* read the message since I asked him to simply ask people nicely "what is your source for saying this or that". Now he uses this phrase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Normans&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67639090" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Normans&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67639090" rel="nofollow">[80]</a> but it seems like he simply ignores information that disagrees with his own views.</dd>
<dd>Since I'm a Dane, I can confirm that "fjeldabe" is an offensive and derogatory term used against Norwegians, and its use here is highly inappropriate (Inge's translation is correct: it literally means Mountain Monkey / Mountain Ape). He has accused <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EInge_1e43.html" title="User:Inge">User:Inge</a> of being a nationalist before, and this really bothers me, since Inge is a very fine contributor. For my part, I am frustrated. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a></sup> 08:50, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In just 2 months, he has already served 6 blocks without showing any signs of improvement in his attitude, and he continues to defy at least 4 different, non-negotiable rules.

<dd>Thank you for getting involved. I really appreciate that. It sometimes gets lonely when dealing with Comanche cph. I have the view that he should be given a longer brake from wikipedia now. Action speaks louder than words when it comes to this editor and he has been given many such chanses before. He has been given so many warning of the type "if you do this one more time...." which have not been followed up that I don't think he respects them. I believe he has been given too much slack already. I was very surprised when his "joke" about muslims linked to above didn't earn him a long block or even a warning. The mountain ape thing on its own deserves a long block. <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EInge_1e43.html" title="User:Inge">Inge</a> 12:06, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks because you have used so much time on me. I have had probelms with my way to talk with "some" other users. (Does who make unsourced and wrong edit's). I have allways made a joke on the page <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>. (nothing harmfull). Sorry to that.</p>
<p>I will keep moving all user:Inge edit on my talk page. That user seems to have pested me since i'v made my early edit in moving some wrong edits from that user. I don't move warnings from my talk page witch comes from a moderator/administrator. But since Inge have made many attacks and fake warnings on my talk page in hope to get me banned. I will not tolerate that user on my talk page. Thanks and have a nice day. --Comanche cph 20:02, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Comanche cph, as I tried to tell you on your talk page, warnings are not issued in order to attack you or try to get you banned. They are issued in order to let you know what is and is not axceptable behaviour and to let you know when you have crossed a line. That way you will become a better editor. <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EInge_1e43.html" title="User:Inge">Inge</a> 20:22, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe i should put some warnings on user:inge talk page for all the unsourced edits on wiki and fake adminstrator recalls on me. Hmm, no! I will not sink that low. --Comanche cph 20:32, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My take is that non admins making informal warnings can well have their warnings deleted, but if they have a concern they should ask (here) for assistance, as Inge has done. Admins making more formal warnings should not have warnings removed without some evidence that the warning was read and understood... removing a warning unread or with an insulting edit summary is, in my view, cause for a block as the user is showing that they do not intend to heed warnings or change behaviour. Inge is not an admin. I am. I have reviewed this users contributions and while there have been some issues in the past I wasn't able to spot recent issues that clearly called for a warning, other than the Turkey (bird) one given above (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68599213" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68599213" rel="nofollow">[81]</a>) which I did issue a mild warning about...

<dd>I have no connection to him at all, except that we are both Danes. However, I felt that somebody had to say something, so it might as well be me, so "for what it's worth" does in this case equal something very small. I did not enjoy making that post, believe me, but I like seeing Norwegians being offended even less. Would I have preferred to see the real thing? Yes, by far. Do I think it will happen? No, but I'd love to be proven wrong. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a></sup> 19:15, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cyde has now blocked <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardsplayer4life_41e9.html" title="User:Cardsplayer4life">User:Cardsplayer4life</a> for a week for, in his words, "Sock puppetry and block evasion, CONTINUED violation of copyright policy, as confirmed by CheckUser". Here's a timeline of my interpretation of what Cards says happened.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>The alternative theory, which Cyde assumes is true above, is that Cards was logged in, received the message saying he was blocked and logged out to intentionally evade his block. In that case the IP address in question would have been recently used by a blocked user (to receive the message) so the autoblocker should have prevented Cards from editing with it. You can see above that Kelly is puzzled why this didn't happen.</p>
<p>If the charitable interpretation above is accepted I think Cards should be unblocked again. The things that might count against it is that Cards has previously edited through his IP address to complain that "the moderators suck", perhaps indicating that he intentionally uses it for edits he wouldn't make with his user account. The lack of autoblock can be explained by Cards logging in and receiving his block message at another computer than he usually uses. I don't have access to checkuser data and I don't know exactly how the system works so a) I may have assumed something that isn't correct and b) it might not be possible to tell anyway.</p>
<p>In any case I'll take no further action in this case. Thanks to everyone who commented. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 09:16, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I neglected to mention one obvious thing which I'd better spell out. It's inherently unlikely that Cards would happen to have been logged out and then happened to edit the one page which would get him into trouble unless he had a habit of editing IPnonymously, which hasn't been established. It would seem likelier that he noticed his block, felt it was extremely unfair and decided to evade it, then calmed down a bit and wrote his reply. On balance I would still prefer to unblock the person but I find it unlikely that I'll be able to get a rough consensus for it so I'll go and do other stuff now. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 09:33, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah yes, sorry, missed that. No, that's about all.

<dd>Here's how I see it: we have an editor who engaged in a brief outburst. The sock allegation has a semi-plausible innocent explanation. He shows evidence of contrition. He is engaging in reasoned debate. He has a fair amount of sympathy. Without for a moment criticising AMIB's block, which seems to me to be justified certainly then and there, could we also agree to unblock? The reason for blocks is to prevent disruption and it seems unlikely at this point that further disruption will occur; it would also seem appropriate to keep Cards on a short leash for a ehile. If he reforms, then we have done a good job and can pat ourselves on the back; if he does not then we will surely have unanimity for a future block. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:06, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I find most troubling here is the conduct of Cyde- he seems almost <i>gleeful</i> about the block, and he's going around picking on people who supported unblocking. This is conduct most unbecoming an admin. I just re-read his RFA and found significant opposition to him based people seeing him as sometimes uncivil and overly confrontational. It saddens me that rather than taking this criticism to heart, he's just continuing in his ways. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:56, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to clear up a very important misconception. It has been argued above that Cards should have been caught by the autoblocker. Recent improvements in the blocking mechanism allow blocks which don't affect logged-in users, therefore Cards wouldn't have been caught by the autoblocker. That's what happened in this case, which is why I reblocked the IP last night with all editing disabled. That block has run out by now of course, and with a block in effect on the actual username is now moot in any case. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 16:01, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This discussion is spread all over the place, but as Bishonen noted above, I also support an unblock at this point, because the week-long block by Cyde was clearly placed as a punitive, not a preventive measure. This goes against the blocking policy. To all involved getting a little heated, I think <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">WP:COOL</a> might offer good advice, in particular its tips to 'take it slow' (point 3) and to 'sometimes just walk away and leave it to others' (point 8). <b>This case is not as urgent as the heated discussion here makes it out to be</b>.

<dd>I'm sorry? You're accusing me of what? My fear is that, given this user's lack of qualms of using proxies or anonymous IPs to make his reversions, if we unblock him, he's simply going to do it with his main account. That <i>is</i> preventative, not punitative. If you look on his talk page he's already made the comment, "I was trying to revert the page that I had already been trying to revert. I just went straight to the page and reverted it." That's a direct quote from him. He doesn't even care about discussing any of the issues, he just wants the page to look the way he wants it to look, policy be damned, and he really only considers these blocks a temporary measure preventing him from doing so. Why in the world should he be unblocked? --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;"><b>Cyde Weys</b></span></a> 19:17, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He didn't do anything bad after I unblocked him yesterday. In particular he didn't revert the page in question again and his only article-space edit was perfectly fine while his other edits were mostly gracious. Why not give him a chance?

<dd>This user doesn't strike me as simultaneously technically savvy enough to go through a proxy and silly enough to make the edit yet again.

<dd>Continuing to assume good faith in the evidence of bad faith is lunacy. Even without the anon proxy edits it's obvious that this user isn't here for the good of the encyclopedia. Go read some of his statements on his talk page. He doesn't care about discussing, he just wants to revert things so quickly that sometimes "he doesn't bother logging in first". He's a revert warrior. And he certainly doesn't care about any of the relevant fair use issues. And you should actually try using Tor; it doesn't require being technologically savvy at all (unless being able to download, install, and run a program counts as "technologically savvy", but <i>plenty</i> of people have managed with Firefox, AIM, et al just fine). --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;"><b>Cyde Weys</b></span></a> 19:30, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Agree with Brenneman and Haukur: bad faith has not been demonstrated, let alone use of a Tor proxy. Being blocked brusquely may have caused him to evade his block but hey, that's no reason to place a week-long block. I propose to make it a 24 hour block at most, i.e. to lift the block today without further ado (Cyde <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cyde&amp;diff=68903328&amp;oldid=68902972" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cyde&amp;diff=68903328&amp;oldid=68902972" rel="nofollow">tells</a> he will be watching him very carefully).

<p>I have unblocked CardsPlayer4life based on the apparent consensus in the discussion above. While recognizing that there are suspicions this user may be 'more deliberately nefarious' than some think, I believe we run little risk by stretching AGF a bit further. The actual 'damage' the user has done to date was infintessimal... all of five minutes work to address, if that. Our more lengthy disagreements about how to handle him are not his doing. Allowing the user to resume normal editing should thus, if anything, reduce the amount of effort being expended here... we can stop hypothesizing/debating and simply observe what he does going forward. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:27, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was recently blocked by <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> for violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> on <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>. Stifle was acting in good faith, and I don't contest the grounds of the block, as he understood them. However, I was reverting the edits of the socks of banned users <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewolfstar_d89c.html" title="User:Thewolfstar">Thewolfstar</a> and <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> or <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a>. All three of these users are notorious for ban evasion, as well as for disruptive editing. I'm not sure as to whether or not Stifle was aware of these facts.</p>
<p>I was blocked yesterday, because the obvious sock of one of these sock puppets reported me to <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. Stifle apparently did not look to deeply into the matter. It seemed obvious to him that I was simply violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. But, I was not. I was reverting the edits of a banned user's sockpuppet, which is a clear exception.</p>
<p>I urge administrators to understand the context of the disputes surrounding these articles. It's very disappointing to find out that you've been blocked for trying to help out. Even the most partisan editors, who are polar opposites, manage to make progress. <i>Only these banned users, and their sock puppets, cause problems</i>. I see more and more good editors of these articles leave Wikipedia out of frustration because nobody is taking the time to understand the disputes, regardless of a number of requests for mediation, requests for comment, requests for arbitration, and more. It's like <i><a href="../../../g/r/o/Groundhog_Day_%28movie%29_e1a9.html" title="Groundhog Day (movie)">Groundhog Day</a></i>: the same thing is repeated every day. --AaronS 13:46, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reversion of blocked users' edits and reversion of vandalism is not subject to 3RR. Perhaps a note on WP:3RR that this particular article gets a lot of contention? I think people shy away from the mediation, in fact, <i>because</i> it's such a viper's nest over there. Is the Mediation Cabal still operating and still manned by well-meaning folks?

<dd>Good points, and an interesting suggestion, as well. We've got some more neutral editors working on them at the moment, and that seems to have helped quite a bit.

<dd>Just as a point of historical interest, Anarchism has <i>always</i> attracted the most dedicated warriors (well, except maybe <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a>). Today, we have these two, but in the past we had others. No "fart" scribbling vandals, these. These are the ones with a set jaw and an inexhaustible amount of time online. Special kevlar and asbestos ought to be awarded for any neutral and careful people who edit there, because when an editor there goes bad, he or she seems to go all the way bad. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:01, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lol, yeah, I wonder about that sometimes. But in real life, it's easier to kick a trouble maker out of a group than it is online when that trouble maker can come back cleverly disguised (although they rarely seem to do so cleverly). Also, there's the whole idea of autonomous communities--in the real world the rival factions would just go form seperate communities, but we've only got one page here (and if we had more they'd be deleted as pov forks) so we're stuck with each other.

<p>Please don't be fooled by AaronS. He claimed in the comments next to his edits that I'm a sock trying to get around a ban but I'm not. I consider the allegation a personal attack. Hopefully he sincerely thinks I'm a banned sock and not just making a false claim in order to delete the edits of other users with impunity. You could say I am a "sock" in a sense because I use different usernames when editing articles that may get me in trouble in my professional life, like the anarchism article. But as far as I know there are no policies against doing that. But I am not banned and have never been banned from Wikipedia. AaronS shouldn't be throwing claims around like that and system operators shouldn't consider the claim to be true without evidence. The system operators did the right thing by banning him. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThat%27sHot_b6db.html" title="User:That'sHot">That'sHot</a> 04:24, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>*yawn*. By the way, that comment about protecting your professional life is silly. It implies that you either (a) edit under a different user name while at work (which makes no sense), or (b) your employer knows your "real" Wikipedia user name and monitors its activity, even when you're not at work (which is a bit far-fetched).

And given the number of times it was removed, people obviously saw it as a potential issue (although perhaps it was just Striver's persistance that suggested to them that perhaps it didn't belong). I personally don't have a problem with him mentioning a conspiracy theory, even if I don't agree with it. But the manner in which he says it and his persistance with pushing the idea that it is true, calling the situation a <i>psyop</i>, could potentially attract even worse debate.

<dd>I agree with what's said above -- talk page comments are generally excepted from the usual rules -- but I also think this should go into the "Striver file," as the fellow has a pretty serious desire to see the boogey men and hobgoblins discussed everywhere, and he has been disruptive in the past.

<dd>His constant POV pushing is not likely to attract many people interested in helping his cause.

<p><b>"If you want to make an open informal complaint over the behaviour of an admin, you can do so here..."</b> (Please stop posting on my userpage otherwise. You are misinformed.)</p>
<p>Admin <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">User:El_C</a> misused protect to take the upperhand in what is clearly a content dispute after blanking my page. This is a matter of a handful of people upset over what is admittedly controversial material. Wikipedia was made specifically as an open tool to cover controversy. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Sarastro777&amp;oldid=68888338" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Sarastro777&amp;oldid=68888338" rel="nofollow">[87]</a>]</p>
<p>First, I documented <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megaphone_desktop_tool.html" title="Megaphone desktop tool">Megaphone desktop tool</a> which is hardly an accusation against ALL or even necessarily any Israeli editors. I highly resent your mischaracterization of my sourced material and making me out as some kind of lunatic conspiracy theorist. This is documented and cited in the article here, on my userpage, and from major media outlets.</p>
<p>Second, you are including information written by someone else and using it against me. I have no association with User:OiBoy nor any control over anything he has added. Saying we edit "hand-in-hand" is at best a malicious lie. Just as I cannot prevent you from blanking my userpage, I cannot prevent him from adding things. I requested that ALL editors stop adding material (like this), and now you use this as a basis for another attack against me as claiming ownership. This issue of User:OiBoy being associated with me is a red herring argument to bias other people against me. <i>I have never restored anything he added to my userpage.</i></p>
<p>Third, the so-called "personal attacks" are in fact quotations by other Editors with some wording I use in some instances to summarize their actions. "Personal attacks do not include civil language used to describe an editor's actions, and when made without involving their personal character, should not be construed as personal attacks." <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html#Examples_that_are_not_personal_attacks" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">WP:NPA</a> I am allowed to share my opinion on matters relating to Wikipedia on my userpage, as is specifically cited as a purpose behind the userpage and is documented on the bottom of my userpage, where you are asked not to blank material. "Another use is to let people know about your activities on Wikipedia, and your opinions about Wikipedia." <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERPAGE_c347.html" title="WP:USERPAGE">WP:USERPAGE</a> There are no personal attacks.. I don't call anybody names nor do I attack them. The only things that are "personal" are actual quotations from other editors which is their own words, placed by them in the history record. I have every right to recount these as I see it pertains to Wikipedia, especially on my own userpage.</p>
<p>This ADMIN is bypassing steps to Dispute Resolution by mischaracterizing my actions, and acting as sole judge, jury, and executioner. Repeatedly blanking content on a userpage is arguably Vandalism. Now he has used protect in a content dispute to force the matter to his liking in a persistent state.</p>

<dd>The links are all there Sarastro, the user history cannot be hidden. Please read the links I posted a number of times on your talk page, and see that in this situation, the community is allowed to take action against the fact that you collect these remarks and responses from all over wikiedipa to paint those who disagree with you poorly, as well as what I feel is the insulting <i>ad hominem</i> intimation that all such editors are Israeli pawns. You are beholden to process just as the rest of us are. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 20:59, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's first address the misinformation:</p>
<ul>
<li>"all such editors are Israeli pawns." -- Something never said, again "intimation"/"Your perception"-- not said, not my opinion.</li>
<li>I have nothing to do with Oiboy or his edits. I defy you to show something from the edit history where I restored a change he made to my page. In fact I specifically asked all other Editors to quit editing the page altogether repeatedly. Let's quit pretending like this isn't known, if you have something that shows otherise then post it, else you need to quit perpetuating the lies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we can address the hypocrisy:</p>
<p>Controversial material is protected by a somewhat judicial system of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_Resolution_7799.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute Resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute Resolution</a>. Instead of following this, Administrators have now vandalized all content off my page, put a burden on ME to follow dispute resolution. I don't have a dispute with my own content. The people with the dispute are the people blanking my page. This is as clear as day a twisting of the policies designed exactly to protect this kind of content.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On Wikipedia, and its sister projects, you are welcome to be bold and edit articles yourself, contributing knowledge as you see fit in a collaborative way. So go ahead!</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Pretty pathetic that not only can I not edit, the Dispute Resolution system is bypassed to censor me, and I cannot even include anything on my own userpage.... all done by somebody with a picture of Commandante Che on his webpage. The irony is all the self-proclaimed free speech experts, anti-vandalism unit members turned into censors is beyond belief. All it took were just a few quotes lifted precisely from discussion.

<dd>Sarastro, this page is not the part of the Dispute Resolution process that you need to be pursuing in order to get your userpage unprotected. Making unfounded [or at least unsourced] accusations of hypocrisy here is not going to do your case any good. Take a break, if you need to, and come back with a cool head. If you're incapable of reaching an agreement with the protecting admins, then you need to take it to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RfC</a>, not here.

<p>If you are involved with a project on Judaism then you have a potential serious conflict of interest, as the material in question deals with "Jewish Activists" deemed in the media to be colloborating with the Israeli Gov't. We need comments from people without identifiable sources of possible bias. It's nothing personal, but the possible bias is obvious enough. Hopefully you can understand that. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarastro777_95c7.html" title="User:Sarastro777">Sarastro777</a> 23:12, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

In what material? There is no <i>material</i> in question. All I have said is that this page is to give notice to administrators of activities of interest. It is, categorically, <i>not</i> a part of the dispute resolution process. I have no interest, nor I'm sure does anyone else here, in your comments about "people [with] identifiable sources of possible bias", as they're not only an obvious strawman, a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, an identifiable possible violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, a clear breach of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> and can serve no rhetorical function other than to <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">poison the well</a> here.

<dd>That is just about certainly really Schwarz on usenet. The article (last time I looked at it, during the most recent afd) definitely at least needed npov cleanup. I've read a bunch of Schwarz's legal filings and they're as bizarre as they sound (the stuff about Eisenhower, the stuff about being married to Marty Rathbun and trying to get him out of the clutches of supposed Scientology kidnappers, etc). Schwarz has been agitating for a long time to get the article deleted, and per her less-than-extreme-notability and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formosa%27s_Law_b726.html" title="Formosa's Law">Formosa's Law</a>, that might be the best solution. Any new article should be closely sourced. Her FOIA stuff has been written up in various legal journals and doing a closely sourced article should be possible if someone insists on doing that. I don't think the article is terribly valuable to the Scientology series. Schwarz is very visible to Scientology observers because she's a heavy poster to the Usenet group, but her actual effect on things has not been all that large. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 01:15, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are "retired"/"departed" users permitted to leave messages on their userpages or talk pages expressing their disgruntlement with the project and encouraging other users to leave as well?

There is no need to retain that false history on a living persons bio. It is an honest mistake of a wikipedia editor but a mistake nonetheless that does not need to follow the subject into eternity.

<dd>We should not alter history like that unless we have to. The current version of the article clearly explains the error, and I don't think anyone is going to get confused by some version buried in the article history saying the wrong thing, especially since the edit summaries show what happened. If the NYT makes an error like that, they print a correction. They don't go and scrub their archives except maybe in extreme circumstances, if at all. According to the article, the same error occurred in multiple media reports; we're actually in better shape than them, since our old article revs normally aren't indexed by search engines and databases, while news stories usually are. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 09:54, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I have been referred to this page by another Wikipedia admin, <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">User:Stifle</a>. I recently complained on the 3RR board about a possible violation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Kwame_Nkrumah_reported_by_User:Palffy_.28Result:_No_apparent_violation.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Kwame_Nkrumah_reported_by_User:Palffy_.28Result:_No_apparent_violation.29" rel="nofollow">[89]</a> which <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">User:Stifle</a> ruled to be a no apparent violation, since he could not concretely link the two user accounts. However, he did point out something strange about the account here as well as notifying Kwame Nkurah to leave his posts along on his talk page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kwame_Nkrumah&amp;diff=68903603&amp;oldid=68839090" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kwame_Nkrumah&amp;diff=68903603&amp;oldid=68839090" rel="nofollow">[90]</a>. Immediately after, <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwame_Nkrumah_1de0.html" title="User:Kwame Nkrumah">User:Kwame Nkrumah</a> proceeded to harass me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Palffy&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Palffy&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[91]</a> (see edits at 19:27, 19:38 and 19:39 August 10), the last of which he ended up deleting MY OWN response on MY OWN talk page. I reverted these posts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Palffy&amp;diff=68918303&amp;oldid=68917260" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Palffy&amp;diff=68918303&amp;oldid=68917260" rel="nofollow">[92]</a> and responded as follows on WP <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">User:Stifle</a>'s page as follows: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stifle&amp;diff=68919076&amp;oldid=68906415" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stifle&amp;diff=68919076&amp;oldid=68906415" rel="nofollow">[93]</a>. My post was immediately stalked (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stifle&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stifle&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[94]</a>) and Stifle replied that he is going to bed (see posts between 19:59-20:11, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Stifle" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Stifle" rel="nofollow">[95]</a>) which I hoped were going to be enough to get this guy off my back (I made no responses to the Admin's replies, I did not retribute or do anything against Kwame Nkrumah, nor was I planning on posting on this page, since all I want is for this person to leave me alone). Kwame Nkrumah seemed to have settled down himself, making no responses since Stifle left posts on mine and his Talk pages. However, upon waking up this morning, I find another harassing post by Kwame Nkrumah on my Talk page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Palffy&amp;diff=68999749&amp;oldid=68920899" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Palffy&amp;diff=68999749&amp;oldid=68920899" rel="nofollow">[96]</a>. I'm sorry that I had to resort to posting here, but this is the most vengeful Wikipedian I have ever seen--I have never had to deal with ANYONE like this and I demand that his stalking/harassment of me stop. This guy obviously does not understand basic words, so I'm hoping you can offer some insight either through talk or action that will make him stop..

<dd>I would also like to add that 3 minutes prior to his post on my Talk page this morning (07:10 August 11), this user proceeded to reverse the previously contested article using his suspected <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpunti_fee4.html" title="User:Spunti">User: Spunti</a> username, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Spunti" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Spunti" rel="nofollow">[97]</a>, at 07:07 August 11.

<p>My POV:</p>
<ol>
<li>I did three reverts, he put a 3RR warning on my talk page, I removed it, Stifle told me that removing warnings is not allowed, Stifle put back the 3RR warning</li>
<li>Palffy did three reverts, I put a 3RR warning on his talk page, he removed it, I added it back with a copy of Stifle message to explain that removing warnings is not allowed, he removed it, I added it back</li>
<li>Palffy denounced a 3RR break by me that was not, accused me of sockpuppetry, and now of "stalking" (or something like that)</li>

<dd>At first his contributions did not appear to be malicious, so I simply left a note on his talk page requesting that he get a new account, but now he is getting into controversial issues by revert warring at <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkinson%27s_Disease_38ed.html" title="Parkinson's Disease">Parkinson's Disease</a>. I'm tempted to block the account indefinitely for violating <a href="../../../u/n/_/WP%7EUN_1761.html" title="WP:UN">WP:UN</a> policies should he continue editing without addressing my concerns on his talk page. I avoided it at first so an autoblock wouldn't interfere. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 19:45, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Could an admin please block 64.34.166.88 and 205.188.117.74 per the vile edits at <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_Laura_dc01.html" title="User talk:JzG/Laura">User_talk:JzG/Laura</a> which appear to be a continuation of a situation described above beginning after User:ParalelUni's block. You will have to check history as the edits have been reverted, thank goodness. These IP's appear to have other, non-problematic edits but an admin should be able to tell whether there are any factors weighing against at least a short-term block. <i>If this has already been taken care of, please disregard this notice.</i> <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:51, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
