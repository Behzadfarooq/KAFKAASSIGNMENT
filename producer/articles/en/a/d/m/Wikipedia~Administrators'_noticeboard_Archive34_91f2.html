<p>A few seemingly California-based editors with an axe to grind appear intent on inserting blatantly POV statements, speculations, largely irrelevant essentially current events material and otherwise blatantly prejudicial information on Dellums. It is fairly obvious the intent is to try to skew public/voter opinion. (Dellums is a declared candidate in the Oakland mayoral race.) Prominent among the offenders is <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">User:Justforasecond</a>, who repeatedly has reverted deletions or reasonable edits of some pretty tackily written and prominently formatted information about Dellums' family life. Given the recent Seigenthaler episode, I should think there would be some care taken to avoid embroiling Wikipedia in another media incident over the disparaging of prominent public figures -- particularly those running for public office. This article needs immediate and decisive attention and warrants watching. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 12:19, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks a lot for taking up this question. I might add that I brought up the same issue at the RfC in question (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Aucaman_c54f.html#Outside_View_by_Lukas_Pietsch_.28II.29" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Aucaman">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Aucaman#Outside View by Lukas Pietsch (II)</a>, and have pleaded personally with two of the Iranian editors involved (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SouthernComfort&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44064577" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SouthernComfort&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44064577" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zereshk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44187558" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zereshk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44187558" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). The response has not been particularly positive so far (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:LukasPietsch&amp;diff=44066954&amp;oldid=44064057" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:LukasPietsch&amp;diff=44066954&amp;oldid=44064057" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>), but as of today, somebody else has started cleaning it up and removing the worst bits (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AIranian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;diff=44208208&amp;oldid=44184376" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AIranian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;diff=44208208&amp;oldid=44184376" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>). You probably saw the partly cleaned-up version already; it was worse until this morning, with an explicit black-list of alleged Anti-Iranian users who "need to be watched" and other such stuff. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 13:39, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Firstly, I didn't start that board. Secondly, I have only ever made one post to that board and that was regarding the situation with <a href="../../../r/u/h/Ruhollah_Khomeini_cf5c.html" title="Ruhollah Khomeini">Ruhollah Khomeini</a> (which was basically ignored). I don't know why you thought my response wasn't "particularly positive" but I wonder why it should be my responsibility to fix the problems there when I have only made one edit to that page? Simply because I happen to be of Iranian background or because I am involved in Iranian articles? It should be left to the responsibility of those who have been most involved with the page. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 16:49, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry for my unclear use of the word "involved" above. I had addressed you because (a) I thought you as one of the more experienced and respected editors in the "Iranian" group would be in a position to exert some positive influence; and (b) because you were centrally involved back in the events that led to the confrontational atmosphere between Zora et al and the Iranian group, which seems to be the background to the present situation. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 17:04, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologize as well if I came across as being "curt" but quite frankly I am tired of what you have correctly termed "factionalism." As I have just related on another talk page, I am tired of all the accusations that we all throw around so freely, of the racism (both subtle and overt) displayed by those who choose an extreme, of those who are unwilling to compromise or to communicate properly like human beings and discuss things civilly so that we can actually get down to how everything actually is. We are trying to have a society here, a civilization - and both online and in the "physical" realm all we see is a persistent breakdown in both civility and communication.

<li>You miss the point. I'm not complaining about the *existence* of the board - thats entirely sensible. There are many other boards, but of the few I sampled - e.g. <a href="../../../f/r/a/Wikipedia%7EFrance-related_topics_notice_board_6d56.html" title="Wikipedia:France-related topics notice board">Wikipedia:France-related topics notice board</a> - none listed anyone as "attacking"; the few sections on disputes described them neutrally. The Iran one looks far from neutral <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 16:23, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Each notice board has its own format. Many notice boards such as <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotice_board_for_Israel-related_topics_4d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Notice board for Israel-related topics">Wikipedia:Notice board for Israel-related topics</a> are similar in format to the Iranian notice board where users describe their own account of the incidents. Simply put, anyone and everyone is welcome to contribute to the Iranian Wikipedians' notice board, the project is neutral and does not endorse the opinions and the views of individuals who participate in the project. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManiF_8d90.html" title="User:ManiF">ManiF</a> 17:13, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManiF_8d90.html" title="User:ManiF">User:ManiF</a> has made an effort to clean that notice board up by deleting the section "Users to keep a watch on", which looked like a personal campaign against four users with explicit mention of the ethnicity of three of them. This removes part of the problem, but there is still some elements where its states "attacked by so and so ..." which are inflammatory. However, I think that there is a need for such a page so long as it does not have an agenda against individual users.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">Ahwaz</a> 14:16, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I hate to actually say this, but having known WMC, I think he is sort of a fair guy, and I feel the editors of the noticeboard should refrain from some of the sections they have been inserting, simply because we end up looking like the same person for whom we set up an Rfc page for, who posts help requests in the discussion pages of others. We really are not helping ourselves, although I`ve got to say users like Lukas seem to suffer from a clear case of double standards, since he is hitting the talk pages of many and identifying many editors as problem editors, which in a weird way, this noticeboard was doing as well (both are wrong). So, I dare say let`s keep the page, yet, unconditionally, erase any segments where it refers to certain users as attacking the articles. I`d say simply write certain articles are being vandalized (which with Iran being in the media a lot these days, they often are ), like in this case <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#.5B.5BWikipedia:Iranian_Wikipedians.27_notice_board.5D.5D" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#.5B.5BWikipedia:Iranian_Wikipedians.27_notice_board.5D.5D" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, or need clean up. Other than that, I think the board can serve as a good bridge between intreseted editors and certain specific articles. <a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 18:14, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This subject is already being discussed on the notice board <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#Self_promotion_spam" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">Self promotion spam</a> but I started a new notice because this has taken an ugly turn. <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti3414_5690.html" title="User:Ati3414">Ati3414</a> so strongly feels that people removing his selfpromotion spam is a personal attack that after he got blocked <i>for adding his <b>own name</b> to the list of notable Romanian americans</i> multiple times, that he called my local police and tried to report harassment.</p>
<p>I think / hope that if enough people besides myself explain to him that this is not a personal attack, but trying to maintain policy and consensus, that he will eventually calm down and remove his spam and contribute to the articles instead.</p>
<p>As a side note, User:Socrunchy and several others that <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti3414_5690.html" title="User:Ati3414">Ati3414</a> sporatically calls my SockPuppets are in actuality just other editors removing his spam as well. Some of the newer editors go to the same school as me, so I do indeed know them in real life, but I fail to see the relevance of that. They are allowed to edit as well. And there are several veteran editors trying to combat his spam as well.</p>
<p>I should also mention (as I have to <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti3414_5690.html" title="User:Ati3414">Ati3414</a>) that besides the self-promotion reason, I and others have been removing his links because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The papers are often not on the topic of the article and sometimes not even relevant in any manner.</li>
<li>The papers often contain large direct copies from other works / plagarism.</li>
<li>Some of the papers contain misunderstanding of the material and should not be included as a information source.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the ridiculous heights this dispute has risen to, I think it is best if I bow out of this discussion to help <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti3414_5690.html" title="User:Ati3414">Ati3414</a> come to consensus about how to handle the spam.

<dd>I have blocked Ati3414 for a month for off-Wiki harassment and to give us time enough to work this out. He's lucky I had just enjoyed a good lunch, or he'd have been indefinitely blocked. Clearly, this is vanity. Clearly, it is inappropriate and there is no need for the previously-mooted RfC. I'm inclined to bulk-remove all of his additions and be absolutely firm on the fact that they <i>stay</i> removed. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 14:06, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to comment on this. This user has claimed ownership of a deleted and redirected article i.e. <a href="../../../h/o/w/How_to_calculate_Earth%27s_Age_45b7.html" title="How to calculate Earth's Age">How to calculate Earth's Age</a>. That was last month, when the article was nominated for <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AFD</a>, I voted on the article to redirect to <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_the_Earth_411b.html" title="Age of the Earth">Age of the Earth</a>. Another user and admin also voted the same. We then got messages on our talk pages that this was his article, don't mess around with it, if you have any doubts ask me. This went on for sometime, until a failed <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERFM_dd02.html" title="WP:RFM">Request for mediation</a> came along regarding an external link. Well, I'm not surprised to see this user being blocked for a month regarding his actions. Calling the police regarding Wikipedia harassment, this is totally absurd. Well, this is a severe offence worldwide for calling the police for unnecessary matters. Self promotion is definitely not acceptable on Wikipedia. This is vanity. Off-wiki harassment is worse still. I believe a month's block is fine, unless he creates sockpuppets, then that is the time to block him indefinitely. --<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">Ter</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">nc</a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerence_Ong_215c.html" title="User talk:Terence Ong">e Ong</a> 15:31, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm not sure what kind of proof you want, as by the very nature of it I have no physical proof. I can supply you with the officer's name and phone number and you can check yourself I guess. Is that good enough?</p>
<p>Since this latest incident was against me, can I request some leniency? It was annoying being contacted by the police, but they told me right off the bat that they looked into it and didn't feel this was a matter to involve the authorities in. We shook hands and that was it. So, in short, I don't feel this is worthy of blocking him indefinitely. As <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> mentioned himself, in the volumes of spamming, there were some cases where <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti3414_5690.html" title="User:Ati3414">Ati3414</a> added worthwhile content. I think we should be trying to encourage this side of him instead of punishing him. He may have issues that prevent him from listenning to other people or being able to question his own actions, but he seems to be a smart guy. Which just makes this all the more sad.</p>
<p>Please, error on the side of helping him instead of punishing him. Thank you <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregory9_32be.html" title="User:Gregory9">Gregory9</a> 16:30, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not going to make international phone calls to confirm a block on Wikipedia. I'm also not going to set a precedent for admins needing to go to such lengths to confirm a block. He has a dead easy way to get himself unblocked: a message either on his talk page or in my inbox apologising and promising to stop the spam campaign. Also, blocking is not a punishment, it is a remedy for a situation. A 24 hour block didn't achieve anything, he's on the road to an indefinite block and so a month seemed pretty lenient. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 16:59, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But as I told JzG, I didn't repost anything. I had no idea about the previous article that had been deleted.

<p><a href="../../../0/w/a/User%7E0waldo.html" title="User:0waldo">0waldo</a> was blocked for 3RR (he was also violating <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>).

<dd>Posting "vandalism" warnings to someone because you do not like how he/she deals with posts is vandalism itself. I am not hostile to anyone, I just asked those who crossed out the EU flag for some respect of those who feel represented by it. I showed respect to them by letting them know instead of just getting their picture deleted as was done before. Several users agreed with me, and some removed the picture. I leave honest comments on my talk page even if I do not agree with them but prefer to keep discussions together. I explain this on my talk page, and if you do not agree this does not mean you should revert on other users' talk pages. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7EROGNNTUDJUU%21_d10f.html" title="User:ROGNNTUDJUU!">ROGNNTUDJUU!</a> 16:39, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're "warning" him about something which is just impolite and not a blockable offence (many users remove comments rather than archiving them), and then calling him a vandal for removing the "warning". That's why I caution to leave well alone. Anyone can cite rules, absolutely, but it's best to get them right and - more importantly - it's better to try and find common ground than to go waving the rule book. As for enforcement, revert after revert isn't the way to go about it, surely? If he's truly a vandal he should be blocked as per policy, and a non-admin can't do that.</dd>

Well sure you can remind someone of the rules, but posting absurd warnings and reverting when they get removed with an edit summary indicating that what you wrote had already been answered is not encouraged.

<p>If you look at the discussion page of the article there is a clear consensus there. The material is a translation of the historian for whom the article is named after, and it is relevant to that section; it does come with ample references from R. N. Frye of Harvard and others. The user continues to erase that section, despite good intentioned warnings, although, as of today, he has been eerily quite.

<dd>Exactly. I hope we all intend on enforcing the vandalism policy for April fools just as we would for any other day. I suppose we may have to take an extra step of assume good faith and warn everyone first, but more pranks in article space after a warning is grounds for blocking. As I've said here and elsewhere, there are plenty of people in meatspace to goof around with, there's no need for the pranks to be in articles, especially not on the main page. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 21:05, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a> webpage user:Diyako added a claim that the Kurdish flag is criminal in Iran. He cited bogus non-existant cites as verification after the issue was clearly pointed out on the talk page recently and in the past. This is gross falsification of articles. For references bless see my talk page and the administrator I asked to get involved's talk page. I asked user:InShaneee to act on the issue, but the adminstator did nothing and said it was basically okay as long as any web page is given. That is ridicuolous and an insult to everything Wikipedia stands for. Additionally this user was warned just before that for personal attacks and instigation with offensive terms that he uses continually. I would like to see some action taken. The <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian peoples</a> are constantly vandalized and falsified by this user and user:Acuman who has made racist attacks and personal attacks on other editors who are asking for neutrality or reasonable articles. I offer my talk pages and the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a> talk page as evidence and the section with the flag and the sources used.

<p>Maybe I didn't make my case clearly enough, and I'd be happy to do so. CWSB was instrumental in the careers of the four authors. Willingham went on to his DC comics work, much of which was related to his stories in Clockwork Storybook. Now fellow CWSB founder Matthew Sturges is working WITH Willingham on his new Fable spin-off series for Vertigo. Chris Roberson launched a new publishing company, Monkeybrain Books, specializing in printing non-fiction genre books, as well as establishing his chops as a novelist and short story writer. Mark Finn wrote some fiction and turned his attention to non-fiction work as well and is now one of the more recognized Robert E. Howard scholars in the country. Maybe a couple of the wiki reviewers never heard of Clockwork Storybook, but a Google search of any of the four authors above with Clockwork Storybook produces many results for their books, the reviews of same, and comments about the work they did. Seems valid enough for me, and likewise for something as all-encompassing as Wikipedia. Solomon Kane 04:49, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What's the policy on a user blanking his own talk page? I know that it's considered "bad form" (per <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html#User_pages" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR#User pages</a>), and many editors will revert a user who blanks his talk page, but is there actually a policy or guideline against it? I've been trying to explain <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> to a rather obstinate editor, and his response has been to make vague threats and blank his user page — nothing severe, but certainly not in the spirit of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>.

<p>Who is the admin who deletes userpage images <b>without informing the user</b>? That is rude, to say the least. Please check my userpage, two images have been deleted without any notification. (They were tagged as userpage images, and thus acceptable without any other licensing, AFAIK) I ask here, because I can find no history to refer to, nor can I any longer see exactly how I tagged the images, back then...

<dd>That they were tagged for deletion without notification to you was, indeed, impolite. But as far as I can tell, the deletion itself was justified: the licenses on those images qualified them for deletion under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Images.2FMedia" title="WP:CSD">speedy criterion I3</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<small><i><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a></i></small> 11:10, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeFacto_97f0.html" title="User:DeFacto">User:DeFacto</a> and I have been editing a number of articles related to motorist advocacy, from opposite standpoints (he is pro-motorist, I am sceptical). Thus far I think we have worked productively to the benefit of the encyclopaedia, holding each other's point of view up to scrutiny. Recently on <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_British_Drivers_3d1e.html" title="Association of British Drivers">Association of British Drivers</a> (A UK motorist pressure group) there has been some difficulty over one of the group's claims. They state that the UK has low car ownership rates by international standards. I compared the official figures and found:</p>
<ul>
<li>UK car ownership per capita is ranked 14th among the list of countries in the figures; UK GDP per cpaita is ranked twelfth</li>
<li>UK total car ownership is ranked fourth, population is ranked sixth</li>
<li>UK GDP per capita in purchasing power equivalent is ninth in the list</li>
<li>Of the four countries with population density per km higher than the UK&lt; two have higher car ownership rates, two have lower (one of which is Japan)</li>
</ul>
<p>Which seems to me to refute the claim.</p>
<p>De Facto has now removed the comparitive ranking per capita, and is comparing <b>car ownership per capita</b> with <b>total GDP</b>. This is, to my mind, a false comparison - the size of population is accounted for in one, and not in the other, whihc is absurd. If I came across this as an outsider I would give De Facto a warning re NPOV and 3RR, but (a) I am involved in the dispute and (b) my POV is not neutral. So if somebody would like to have a look and perhaps ask De Facto nicely not to do this, I would be grateful. I would stress that this is the first time our strongly opposing points of view have come to anything I woudl characterise as an edit war, so I think a gentle comment from a neutral third party is probably all that's required.</p>
<p>Or, of course, I could be wrong. But I don't think so, not this time. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:52, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm being quick, but to me that article is not of encyclopedic standard. The bulleted list of objectives, I would argue, is in violation of POV, since such a presentation discourages a discussion of each point. However, the association do state that the UK has low car ownership rates by international standards, so removing it as a method of refutation is also POV, the claim should be refuted in the article citing sources. You can't refute that the ABD claim such a thing, since they do and a cite is provided. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 13:24, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You've got an entire section devoted to one claim by ABD, and the attempt to invalidate it is clearly original research. If Transport 2000, the Department of Transport, or some other external body has scrutinized that claim, write about that. Don't make up your own refutations like this.</p>
<p>In "Criticisms", the first paragraph reads: "Taxation per car in the UK is around the European average, similar to France and Italy, higher than Germany, much lower than the Netherlands or Ireland, and claim robust evidence that reducing speeds reduces both the incidence and the severity of collisions."</p>

<dd>IMO, this case has been handled in a negligently poor fashion. Half the Committee didn't bother to turn up and vote and half again closed the case without waiting for the others. There was a significantly opposed Principle (of "administrative fiat") which has been rejected even though there is no majority either way, backed up by a rejected but <i>majority supported</i> remedy that failed for want of one vote, which might have been somewhere in the sleepy half of the committee, which could not have been enforced if it had passed, since the enforcement was being rejected; but without a committee majority either way! And yet 4 arbitrators (out of 12 non-recused!) have closed the case. You should reopen the case and do it over again. And abolish the rather silly-looking 4-to-close rule. Bed without cookies, the lot of you. And the clerks, too, for not making sure the Arbs are doing their job. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 18:15, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How do we expect to keep getting uninvolved admins? I'd be for the 2 weeks considering he had several options to discuss the issue of his behavior without wasting people's time on the disruptive arbcom request, and he knew that. He could have discussed it on his talk page or here. Consider me involved or not as you like, I've had a different dispute with the user over similar behavior in the past, and no contact since other than commenting on AN and his arbitration talk page.

<p>I’m writing to complain about the actions of one of your administrators, Golbez:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Golbez" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Golbez" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Golbez</a></p>
<p>This user came to my attention when I attempted to correct some factual errors on the wikipedia entry concerning the Old Man Murray website:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_Murray" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_Murray" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_Murray</a></p>
<p>When I attempted to correct these errors, I discovered the article had been locked. I then went to the discussion page concerning this article:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Old_Man_Murray" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Old_Man_Murray" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Old_Man_Murray</a></p>
<p>Only to discover THAT page had been locked as well. At this point I am at a loss as to what to do. I was under the impression that the free exchange of ideas is not only a feature of wikipedia, but it is INHERENT and VITAL to the continued existence and relevancy of the project. Mr. Golbez seems to have entered into some sort of flame war with an external site (www.caltrops.com) and this has caused him to unilaterally shut off ALL contributions concerning Old Man Murray.</p>
<p>I respectfully request the article and its discussion page be unblocked, and that Mr. Golbez be instructed as to the true responsibilities of an administrator on wikipedia. If he feels he cannot carry forth those duties, his admin priviledges should be revoked.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/u/s/User%7EFussbett_7b1b.html" title="User:Fussbett">Fussbett</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/s/User_talk%7EFussbett_8666.html" title="User talk:Fussbett">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fussbett_997c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fussbett">contribs</a>).</small></p>

I don't like being called a "Bozo" (hey, it's funny though), but even worse is the comment he left on <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini">Kukini</a>'s talk page. To have a <a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukini_a0ce.html#an_angry_response_to_an_AFD_vote" title="User talk:Kukini">racial opinion thrust in your face</a> for the dreadful crime of writing "Delete. As per above" on a vanity page's AfD is a little much. Most of his comments are just babble written in slightly obscure language, but the comment that those who don't want this vanity in WP are apparently "...low class people unworthy of being associated with a great encyclopedia." is out of line. Any admin care to mention the incivility of this (and perhaps give a brief run-down on AfD etiquette) to <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill314159_8d98.html" title="User:Will314159">Will314159</a>? <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990000">Dei</font><font color="#FF6600">z</font><font color="#990000">io</font></b></a> 18:22, 20 March 2006 (UTC</p>
<p>I regret any uncivility. I don't think Kukini took offense when I pointed him to a forsenic anrthopologist's position from a nova pbs site on a position he takes on his user site although Deizo enjoys having a go with it. I really have no clue what he means by "meat socket puppet" stuff though I find the language instantly viscerally inflammatory. It has been quite an experience and mercifully it is over. Thankfully, I did not contribute any funds to Wikipedia during the fund drive, although I came very close. I need to learn a lot more about its control structure and how it is run. I see that are reasonable folks here punctuated by hotheads.

<p>I have found out what a "meat socket puppet" is. I had a right to get mad and call the guy a BOZO. He basically called me a FRAUD. He said I was masquerading as somebody else for an improper purpose. And he is an administrator. All he had to do was look at my IP address. It was a NC USA IP. Also he could have googled Will314159. I have thousands of posts on veterans boards. I demand that BOZO be removed as an Administrator. Please refer me to the proper forms to fill out.--Will314159 00:18, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I too regret any incivility, and my sockpuppet comment (I've explained the meaning of this to Will in talk) was retracted after Kingboyk cleaned up the page and chased some IPs showing we were dealing with a great number of posts from one user unfamiliar with posting on Wikipedia. However, as I am not an admin, and given the large number of unsigned posts that were left by Will which led to my suspicion of sockpuppetry, I think Will has shown inexperience with Wikipedia practices and recommend he get to grips with the project a little more before calling experienced users with extensive contribution records "Bozo" and saying I accused him of fraud. I do apologize for any inadvertent bad feelings my actions caused. However, it is not up to me, or anyone, to look up IP addresses if users cannot follow the given advice about signing posts. I would also strongly encourage others to look at this AfD to get a true measure of what actually took place. As a result of this and several other AfDs I've noticed where (among other reasons) new users with an interest in one particular page being considered for deletion get a little too involved I've proposed a policy at <a href="../../../e/a/r/WP%7EEARLY_d298.html" title="WP:EARLY">WP:EARLY</a>. I know some wikislang is strange for newer users and am being more careful to explain things to such users in AfD debates to avoid precisely this kind of situation. I hope Will continues to contribute to Wikipedia and realizes that like many Wikipedians I am only interested in quality content in line with WP policies and guidelines entering the encylopedia. The article that precipitated all this off has been deleted. I hope this can be the end of the matter. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990000">Dei</font><font color="#FF6600">z</font><font color="#990000">io</font></b></a> 00:41, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I did actually look up this user's IP (he posted as an anon IP on occasion) and it resolved to the USA as he states. The IP of the article creator also appeared - but <i>not</i> as Will314159, and taking the opposing view - and resolves to the ESA in Germany. I can therefore confirm that to the best of my knowledge Will314159 is indeed an American user and not the author of the article. As regards the article, community consensus in the AFD was that a self published book and one notable cartoon does not satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If Mr Deasy becomes more notable in the future the decision can be reviewed. My recommendations are a) that anyone who has an outstanding allegation against <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill314159_8d98.html" title="User:Will314159">User:Will314159</a> that he is a sock or meat puppet withdraw those accusations now and apologise, b) that Will314159 accept said apology, c) that Will314159 take a nice cool shower and chill out a bit, d) we all get back to <b>writing an encyclopedia</b>. There were no serious accusations of racim so I won't even address that point. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 11:46, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Arbitration Commitee has reached a decision in this case.</p>
<p>Karmafist is prohibited from welcoming with any template or wording other than {{<a href="../../../w/e/l/Template%7EWelcome_2ac1.html" title="Template:Welcome">welcome</a>}}. He may not link to personal advocacy pages, or include political language, in the welcome message, signature, or edit summary. He must use a reasonable, civil, relevant edit summary. "Welcoming" is to be interpreted broadly, to prevent gaming. If Karmafist violates this remedy, he may be blocked for a short time of up to one week. After five such blocks, the maximum block time is increased to one year.</p>
<p>Further, Karmafist is placed on standard civility parole for one year. If he makes any edits which are judged by an administrator to be uncivil, personal attacks, or assumptions of bad faith, then he may be blocked for a short time of up to one week. After five such blocks, the maximum block time is increased to one year.</p>

<p>Hi... I apologise humbly if this isn't the right place to post this, but there is a bit of a problem on the main page at the moment and I would appreciate it if some admins could have a look. Currently the first main page news item misleadingly states "Swedish Foreign Affairs Minister Laila Freivalds resigns following the Muhammad cartoons controversy."

<p>Please see <a href="../../../c/u/t/Wikipedia%7ECut_and_paste_move_repair_holding_pen_ccf4.html" title="Wikipedia:Cut and paste move repair holding pen">Wikipedia:Cut and paste move repair holding pen</a> I listed a case of a cut and past page there:</p>

<p>Hi, an article defaming Wikipedia is spreading across the internet. You can read it at the bottom of this link. http://thailandesl.chazzsongs.net/internet.wiki.htm The article's author, <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judi_McLeod_2e05.html" title="Judi McLeod">Judi McLeod</a> implies that Wikipedia is connected to and takes its orders from <a href="../../../k/o/f/Kofi_Annan_b04e.html" title="Kofi Annan">Kofi Annan</a>. She also claims that Wikipedia removed information from the <a href="../../../k/o/f/Kofi_Annan_b04e.html" title="Kofi Annan">Kofi Annan</a> page at Kofi Annan's request. According to her, the article had claimed Annan's father was a freemason.</p>
<p>Wiki contributors went through all 542 revisions of the <a href="../../../k/o/f/Kofi_Annan_b04e.html" title="Kofi Annan">Kofi Annan</a> article and found no mention of freemasonry whatsoever. There is an ongoing discussion about this at <a href="../../../k/o/f/Talk%7EKofi_Annan_b902.html" title="Talk:Kofi Annan">talk:Kofi Annan</a></p>
<p>Senior sys-op and Wiki news reporter <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a> wrote her two letters asking for proof but she refuses to respond. She also refuses to correct the errors or withdraw the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_Free_Press_4d3e.html" title="Canada Free Press">Canada Free Press</a> article.</p>
<p>Can anybody advise us on the next step to take? Ignoring them isn't an option since they have written several error-ridden articles about Wikipedia. No doubt there will be more.</p>
<p>This is very frustrating and upsetting. We have gone out of our way to address her concerns but she gives us no credit. Both Homeontherange and I have made sure that unproven assertions and inflammatory statements are quickly taken out of the article whenever they appear. I myself made it a priority recently to include positive details such as the journalism award McLeod won in 1983. And yet she calls us "wicked pedia". --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberboomer_ae81.html" title="User:Cyberboomer">Cyberboomer</a> 21:34, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Darn it. Unmasked at last! Though the funniest one was being told on one page that I another user <i>knew</i> I'd been hired by Pope Benedict to be his representative on Wikipedia and write pro-Benedict stuff. Later that day I was told categorically that I was in the pay of MI5 to push a pro-British slant on Irish articles, and by another editor a member of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinn_F%C3%A9in_5dd5.html" title="Sinn Féin">Sinn Féin</a> pushing an anglophobic Brit-bashing agenda, for the <b>same edit</b>. Zeech. With all these pay cheques coming in from His Holiness, Her Majesty, Gerry Adams and everyone else to be "their representative" I must be rich. Let me look at my bank balance again? mmmm obviously their cheques all bounced.

<dd>So <i>you are</i> that mysterious other person at that dinner with Her Majesty and Tony Blair in Windsor Castle where we planned the secret takeover of Wikipedia in a hidden masonic royal New Labour conspiracy. I was wondering who my co-conspirator was. Sorry I couldn't stay. I was rushing off to fly to Jerusalem to meet with Sharon to plot the Jewish takeover also. That was on busy Thursday. I simply had no time to drop in and take my orders from His Holiness on the way back. But at least George Bush let me stay in the Lincoln bedroom for the night, and gave me my pro-American orders the next morning over breakfast with himself and Laura. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 05:35, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well Netscott is changing the place of the poll at the top of the page <b>without discussion</b>. The poll is there all along the time. Changing its place change the whole structure. The same user already vandalized the poll for 2 days before. During that time, I was blocked agin by the editor involved in this issu: NSLE. They are acting together. Plese look at my talk page too to see it. NLSE is already trying to block me indefinitely because of the dispute we had before. I am tired of these people, any help is apprecaited. <a href="../../../r/g/u/User%7ERgulerdem_75f6.html" title="User:Rgulerdem">Resid Gulerdem</a> 09:59, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is important because unilaterally a user who dislike the proposal started a poll. There was a consensus that we will have an approval poll when the policy is mature. WHen the user started an approval poll unilaterally withouut discussing, we started a poll to ask the community if it is a good time for it? It turned out to be no. Even the contributing editors, including me as the main proposer, do not believe that it is in a policy form yet, and need to be improved. I made announcements in the village pump to get more input from the community. A few editors consistantly trying to kill the process. They vandalized the poll which is asking to the community if the policy is ready for it. By starting an approval poll, they would like to get disapproval so that they will kill the process. I hope it is clear. If not I can get into more details. Thanks... <a href="../../../r/g/u/User%7ERgulerdem_75f6.html" title="User:Rgulerdem">Resid Gulerdem</a> 10:19, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The bottom line is they are trying to kill a policy proposal I have started. They are using an approval poll for it. An approval poll at the early stage won't give a positive result, they know. I would like to ask people if we need to have a poll at this stage. They say no. But they are trying to ill that poll too, because they dislike it very much. <a href="../../../r/g/u/User%7ERgulerdem_75f6.html" title="User:Rgulerdem">Resid Gulerdem</a> 10:51, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>After proper review I admit that the "Approval Poll" wasn't initially in a top position superior to the other poll, merely chronologically.

The ruling is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>T-man, the Wise Scarecrow placed under the Mentorship of two to three administrators in good standing, to be named by the Arbitration Committee at a later date, for one year. They may be changed at the Arbitration Committee's will. The mentors will be knowledgeable in the case, and are expected to actively enforce T-man's Probation and parole. As such, while any administrators may enforce the ruling, the mentors should be seen as the primary enforcers, and other administrators are encouraged to communicate with them before taking actions. Additionally, the mentors are charged with monitoring and guiding T-man, and maintaining contact with him, as well as helping him to carry on productive communication with others towards the goal of successful collaboration.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I would like to ask that all administrators try to take any possible enforcement to them before acting, and approach them with any concerns you may have regarding T-man. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:32, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to request a review of the history tab for the following entry:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Wyatt_Ehrenfels" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Wyatt_Ehrenfels" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Wyatt_Ehrenfels</a></p>
<p>Someone by the name of Calton has been aggressively managing this page (in my name) so that I am not able to add comments to it. Moreover, where the history tab once archived old drafts that contained my responses, in a rare maneuver, someone had these drafts expunged from the history. Along with my expunged drafts is a draft from him in which he disclosed that the user page was designed to rank highly in a Google search of my name (it is currently ranked third in a search of that name). His comments in the draft subject fields are designed to suggest (rather presumptuously) that the purpose of my previous edits was to search optimize my web site. I did not always drop links to my news &amp; research blog and, when I did, it was clear the quality of my page as a reference did not differ from other content in the links section.</p>
<p>There is reason to believe this is a vindictive maneuver designed to redress a dispute in Amazon.com which Amazon.com settled in my favor (i.e. a fake book review).</p>
<p>I have since suspended contributing to this encyclopedia and, even if I had any trace of interest left, I acknowledge that any of my edits would be tracked and expunged by this fellow.</p>
<p>The User Page is not that important in and of itself. But I am curious as to how the Wikipedia Administration (I have only dealt with fanboys up to now) would address this issue in principle.</p>

<p>The molecule article version is about the chemistry of hydrogen, and the atom version is about the physics of hydrogen. They are both large and neat by themselves, but might be illegible if merged. Perhaps a disambiguation page? Like this:</p>
<p>Hydrogen (Physics)<br />
Hydrogen molecule (Chemistry)<br />

<dd>If your going to have a separate physics and chemistry page then name them both Hydrogen. ie. Hydrogen (physics) Hydrogen (chemistry). A disam is not required currently since they are not the same names.</dd>

<p>Ideally <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen_atom.html" title="Hydrogen atom">hydrogen atom</a> should be a subarticle of <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen.html" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, as the atomic structure is one aspect of the broader topic.

So, the user nominated the article for an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Khalistan_4dff.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Khalistan">AfD</a>, as s/he believes that's the way to handle with POV problems. Next, s/he went through the list of Indian wikipedians, and spammed them to vote on the issue. Looking at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Anmol.2k4" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Anmol.2k4" rel="nofollow">contributions page</a> of the user, it seems that the spamming was done in an alphabetic manner (going alphabetically from a to z in a list of Indian wikipedians).</p>
<p>Funny thing is, even a closed AfD was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FKarunakara_Guru&amp;diff=45297755&amp;oldid=33044578" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FKarunakara_Guru&amp;diff=45297755&amp;oldid=33044578" rel="nofollow">spammed</a> by the user with the same "Call to action" message.</p>
<p>Looking deeper at this, I see that this user has spammed some strange pages; rather than spamming at the talk pages, sometimes the spam was placed into other user pages. For example, <a href="../../../s/h/y/User_talk%7EShyamal_UserTags_eaa6.html" title="User talk:Shyamal/UserTags">User talk:Shyamal/UserTags</a>, <a href="../../../k/r/i/User_talk%7EKrishnavedala_MyStuff_76ee.html" title="User talk:Krishnavedala/MyStuff">User talk:Krishnavedala/MyStuff</a>. The reason is that *these* are the pages linked to from the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Category%7EIndian_Wikipedians_aeb9.html" title="Category:Indian Wikipedians">Category:Indian Wikipedians</a> page, as the users had placed their user boxes in those particular pages.</p>
<p>Do we have a policy on internal spamming (rampant recently)? If not, this is probably a good time to have one. Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 21:27, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Technically that would not have been possible because the original uploader specifically only marked EndlessKnot03d.png as PD.

<dd>1. They were two identical copies of an image file. It wasn't possible to release only one (and not the other) into the public domain. 2. I suspect that the creator uploaded a second copy because he/she didn't realize that it was possible to add the license tag to the original.

<p>Hypothetical question: A new user uploads an image to "Image:Foobzr.png" tagged as "PD-user", then uploads an identical image using correct spelling to "Image:Foobar.png" but tagged as "<a href="../../../n/o/n/Template%7ENoncommercial_931a.html" title="Template:Noncommercial">noncommercial</a>" and sticks that image into the "Foobar" article. The image is absolutely amazing visualization of "Foobar" and should be in the article. You ask the user to clarify the licensing, but it appears he has left for good.

However, the article <a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETangoTango_6e1a.html" title="User talk:TangoTango">User talk:TangoTango</a> still has a "user page" tab to it, and it's acting like a user talk page - isn't this simply an orphaned page in the User Talk namespace? - <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETangotango_2487.html" title="User:Tangotango">Tangotango</a> 16:10, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the problem is in my settings. I've set my local offset to be +08:00 (HKT) and have never had a problem before today. And here in Hongkong we don't have summer time, mind.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps I should be more specific. The problem I see is that those edits made between around 01:00 and 02:00 HKT today in real time (ie between 17:00 and 18:00 UTC) on my watchlist would <b>sometimes</b> be shown as been made between 02:00 and 03:00 (ie one hour fast), but <b>sometimes</b> be shown correct upon refresh. However, edits made outside that period appear to be correct. --<a href="../../../p/k/c/User%7EPkchan_0b01.html" title="User:Pkchan">Pkchan</a> 04:58, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
