<li>Seeing as both introduced the exact same content, it appears to be sockpuppetry, but neither have received more than a single warning. At the very least they should be asked to provide citations before a block can be considered. Are there any other related accounts? - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:34, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>In this case, it would appear reasonable to conclude it's intentional insertion of false material, and vandalism. I have left uw-error3 warnings on both users talk pages. They seem to have stopped before that; if they do it again, leave them a uw-error4 warning and then report them to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> if there's anything after that. It should be safe to assume they're sockpuppets for purposes of that. They may be past 3RR there between the two of them already, but I haven't warned them for that. Someone else can check and do so if appropriate. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:14, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The quotation is irerelevant to the article; it's attributed to Gaddafi, not to Bell, and has no obvious direct (or indirect) relevance to Bell. It seems to have been inserted for the pleasure of being rude about Thatcher.

<li>I agree with Mel. Even if this can be sourced with the book, it has absolutely no relevance to the Ivor Bell article. (I'm not even sure if the book was used to reference that quote or the surrounding text.

I think this editor is very close to policy violations on this talk page (or may have crossed the line already) and I do not want to place warnings on the editor's talk page in order to prevent escalation.

<dd>The survivalist issue was taken care of long ago.

<p>I have no idea how to deal with this problem so if this is the wrong forum I apologise and would be happy to be pointed in the right direction. Since early February I have been attempting to revert a series of edits from one user, mostly to <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudette_Colbert_9bf2.html" title="Claudette Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Talk%7EClaudette_Colbert_5afa.html" title="Talk:Claudette Colbert">Talk:Claudette Colbert</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivien_Leigh_c566.html" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>, and to a very minor extent <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Boyer_47d0.html" title="Charles Boyer">Charles Boyer</a>. The other editor has been consistently removing cited material and injecting a non-neutral POV into these articles, or has added "cite needed" to areas that are cited. It's petty, but annoying. Has also engaged in vandalism to the user pages of several editors, including myself, but this seems to have stopped. The first user name, User:Wbrz was blocked temporarily and emerged as User:Wptfe who was blocked indefinitely for vandalism. Returned within a day or so as <a href="../../../n/r/h/User%7ENrh15_3edf.html" title="User:Nrh15">User:Nrh15</a> making similar edits. The edit summaries used to revert my edits are dishonest - for example they often say "reverting unexplained deletion" when I've clearly explained my edit, saying it is "potentially libellous" when it's not, or replacing cited text with uncited POV, with cryptic edit summaries such as "POV or guesswork" which seems to have been taken from a comment I made in one of mine. It's all so odd. The edit summaries make no sense at all particularly those relating to <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudette_Colbert_9bf2.html" title="Claudette Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a>. I don't know what to do, but having an edit war every few days is obviously counterproductive. <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudette_Colbert_9bf2.html" title="Claudette Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a> is semi-protected because of numerous edits made by this person as an anon, but has easily gotten around this by creating user names to make the same edits. I've left messages on the talk pages of these identities, but the replies I receive make no sense. <a href="../../../n/r/h/User_talk%7ENrh15_98b1.html" title="User talk:Nrh15">User talk:Nrh15</a> contains a couple of replies - but they are incoherent and downright odd.

<p>I completed a major rewrite of the Zodiac killer page to bring it into conformity with Wikipedia policies and guidelines. To do this, I had to delete approximately half of the 72 KB article, since it violated <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive208_6c53.html" title="Edit section: Blocking open proxies on home IP's -- a few words on process &amp; policy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Blocking open proxies on home IP's -- a few words on process &amp; policy</span></h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was recently asked to verify a purported open proxy, and opine on the length of the block established vs. it.</p>
<p>After looking into current de facto standards for blocking home users running (suspected) proxies, I'd like to give a little bit of guidance.</p>
<p>I encourage admins blocking home DSL and cable IP's suspected to be proxies to avoid using indefinite blocks, due to the potential for collateral damage, and the potential for these machines to shift IP's. When indef blocked, there is a significant possibility that non-proxy machines will end up on these IP's, and thus be inappropriately blocked.</p>
<p>In general, systems with *dhcp*, *dsl*, *dynamic*, and related strings in their hostnames should not be being blocked indefinitely. I've included, below, an excerpt from my reply to the user who originally asked for verification:</p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.42.49.227.html" title="User:80.42.49.227">80.42.49.227</a> is verifiably a home dynamic DSL IP, and not currently running an open proxy as of Fri Feb 27 16:59:31 EST 2007. Based on the foregoing, and the stated block terms of "(anon. only, account creation blocked, noautoblock) with an expiry time of indefinite (suspected open proxy but registered/logged in users are allowed to edit)", this block should be lifted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My reading of policy infers that proxy blocks are for the life of the proxy, regardless of the type of system in question. When it ceases to be a proxy, it should cease to be blocked. For practical purposes, blocks are against IP's rather than against specific machines, so when a machine gets a new IP, the previously blocked IP is de facto no longer an open proxy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The metapolicy on open proxies affirms this reading, stating: "Non-static IPs or hosts that are otherwise not permanent proxies typically warrant blocking for a shorter period of time, as the IP is likely to be transferred, the open proxy is likely to be closed, or the IP is likely to be re-assigned dynamically."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>dhcpd defaults the lease length for a given IP to one day. Many DSL and cable providers use "sticky" dhcp, which means that clients will continue to receive the same IP when they renew under many but not all circumstances.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An informed blocking policy would then be for a length of at least one day but no more than seven days. Ultimately, when blocking a nominally dynamic IP, the blocking admin should take responsibility for ensuring that the benefit to the project outweighs potential harm, and for re-checking (or having re-checked) the proxy status of the IP if the block is for any substantial ( &gt; 3 days ) length of time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hope this helps&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>In summary, it just takes a moment to check the hostname of an IP -- you can do it at a number of sites, including <a href="http://www.kloth.net/services/nslookup.php" class="external text" title="http://www.kloth.net/services/nslookup.php" rel="nofollow">this</a> one. In the case of the IP referenced above, the output is 80-42-49-227.dynamic.dsl.as9105.com, which is clearly dynamic DSL.</p>
<p>The metapolicy on proxies lives at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WM:NOP" class="external free" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WM:NOP" rel="nofollow">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WM:NOP</a>, and is also good reading.</p>
<p>There are more accurate ways to do this, and this one will produce both false positives and false negatives, but it's better than nothing, and the most accessible to non-technical users.</p>
<p>If you have doubts as to whether a system is still a proxy, please ask someone on the Wikiproject on Open Proxies <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_on_open_proxies_verified_users_997a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject on open proxies/verified users">approved user list</a> to check for you. The Internet community will thank you for keeping Wikipedia sane, while still protecting end-users from collateral damage.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. If anyone else has considered this issue, I welcome feedback&#160;: )</p>

<p>Didn't Wikipedia already go through something like this before with <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>, with the Scientologists not really willing to talk about what happens at the upper levels, and trying to get such information removed?</p>
<p>Trying to get <b>any</b> truly substantiated reports of the details (particularly the level systems) of these facilities is even more difficult.</p>
<p>But please, for neutrality's sake, don't delete anything actually sourced and don't take anything <b>anyone</b> says at face value, particularly when they write it in angry letters.</p>
<p>What looks like blatant POV is, unfortunately, actually what is going on (although it could all be phrased much, much more neutrally, I'm sure..) Difficult as it is to believe, some parents out there really are paying top dollar to have their kids kidnapped and "behavior modified". Much of this is third-party sourced in news articles.</p>
<p>Oh, and Covergaard's not intentionally using weasel words- the man doesn't have the English skills to do that. He's just calling it as he sees it, which is probably not the best idea when trying to maintain neutrality.</p>
<p>What this whole business <b>needs</b> is a good and thorough editing by experienced Wikipedians willing to knock out POV crap on <b>both</b> sides of the issue and find sources, not rampant deletion. Eugenitor 18:23, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I must have to protest that you have deleted some of the pages without tagging them for speedy deletion. Maybe such facilities or the concept of therapy is not wide-wide based subject, that can be on wikipedia at all.

<dd>If it makes you feel better, consider this thread the tag. Clearly the need to evaluate was indicated above. Speedy deletion criteria do not require tagging, nor any particular delay prior to deletion. Those speedy deleted were mostly done under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G10" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G10</a> (not necessarily with those letters in the summary), which has its own category and gets faster than average processing - my guess is the average tag to bag time is well under an hour, probably under 15 minutes. Many admins choose to only tag and let another delete, but the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">policy</a> does not require a two person process. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a></dd>

<p>The recent edits by User:132.216.104.200 suggest to me a reincarnation of a banned user. This user is simultaneously rejecting low numbers on the number of Romanians and high numbers on the number of Roma. In neither case is he presenting any real arguments, just saying that these numbers (which seem as well cited as others in the relevant articles) constitute "POV pushing". Use of that term strongly suggests experience with Wikipedia, so this is presumably not a newbie.</p>
<p>Following up on this, I see that the IP is McGill University in Montreal. I believe that is where banned user <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorbertArthur_ab3b.html" title="User:NorbertArthur">NorbertArthur</a> was, and these edits would be typical of him.

YeLLeY511 was a new user who created an article <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brimstone_%28wrestler%29.html" title="Brimstone (wrestler)">Brimstone (wrestler)</a>, uploaded several Brimstone-related images, and inserted references to Brimstone in a few (apparently carefully-chosen) wrestling-related articles. The writing did not seem overtly promotional to me, but it was certainly fawning and non-encyclopedic in tone, which gave me the impression more of a young, enthusiastic fan than a professional promoter. The user has been in continuous contact with me (after I tagged her images as unlicensed or improperly licensed) on my user page and with the rest of the community on <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMedia_copyright_questions_04f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Media copyright questions">Wikipedia:Media copyright questions</a> and seems to have made good-faith efforts to abide by policy.</p>

<dd>It seems more likely than not that the user is a paid promoter: (1) the user wrote a fawning article on an arguably NN local wrestler (CSD G11 definitely, possibly A7), (2) all of the user's contributions were related to promoting or building this article and the wrestler, and (3) the user uploaded 32 images, by my count, all related to said wrestler. E-mails purported to be from the wrestler were posted by the user on several of the image talk pages, further lending credit to the view that the user is a paid promoter.

<p>Please have a look at the reverts of my edits of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> article. I have given a detailed reason for my edits on the talk page of that article. I sthink that putting this article into the Categories <a href="../../../c/r/e/Category%7ECreation_stories_474c.html" title="Category:Creation stories">Category:Creation stories</a> and <a href="../../../m/y/t/Category%7EMythology_a7a6.html" title="Category:Mythology">Category:Mythology</a> is justified and even demanded by the NPOV principle. Wikipedia must not treat any single religion special. The mentioned user seems to have taken ownership of that article. This kind of behavieour is threatening the neutrality of Wikipedia. Please note his answer.</p>
<p>Moreover, his comment on the last unedit, he writes "(rm POV pushing supercat)". I take this to be a personal insult! On a similar revert of the edit of another Users he commented "(rv per WP:NPOV - POV-pushing cats, this has been tried with many religious books, but it is not neutral to state that the Bible or Quran are "mythology". You can attribute the opinion, not a cat)". I think this is wrong and the choice of words is going too far!</p>
<p>Can this User be blocked or can the page be protected after puting those categories?</p>
<p>I respect the belies of Christians, but Wikipedia is a multicultural project with editors from many religions. It must by allowed to do comparative studies of religions and put the creation stories of - for example - the traditional religion of the Baluba into one Category with the creation storiy of Jewish and Christian religion. In Wikipedia, the Christian or Jewish religions must not receive any special treatment or status. Some of the editors and some of the users belief in other things and so there must be neutrality here!<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENannus_11ce.html" title="User:Nannus">Nannus</a> 20:33, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have had a quick look, but it seems rather low profile. In my view, the categorization is deserved. I encourage you to continue to try and use the talk page, and any user who chooses not to when dealing with such a sensitive topic is quite revertible. Only if the comments or scale were significantly higher would it be likely that protects or blocks would be made. Revert wars do generally lead to comments from both sides, but I don't think much can be gained in the form of resolution if one were implemented.

<p>I've just spent some time cleaning out an infestation of blog spam - an anonymous user, most likely the blogger himself, has been systematically going through Wikipedia adding links to his personal essays and smuggling them into lists of scholarly references. He's been warned about this before, his links have been removed plenty of times before (most recently only two days ago!), but he seems to be intent on using Wikipedia to drive traffic to his blog. Unfortunately the spammer is coming from a number of Verizon dynamic IPs, so I can't simply block him without causing unacceptable collateral damage. The only alternative I can think of is to add his blog to the spam blacklist. Could someone advise on how to do this or suggest any other alternatives? -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 23:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
It is simpler than that. I deleted an external link as it contravenes the External Link policy, but the people who are moderators of the site the link goes to are adamant that the link should stay. I have NOT reverted at all today. I took the action of deleting the link - the others reverted. I did not revert, I made NEW edits based on my original action. This means that I was simply upholding the Wikipedia policies, and should not be punished for such.</p>
<p>As it stands, it is actually Carnildo that I have asked as an administrator to protect this page - I am still awaiting a response.</p>

<p>As I have stated numerous times the link has been viewed as relevent to the article at hand for some time. It is quite simple though. Cybertrax is a former matrix site owner who has been attempting to sue MW for the better part of a year. When his link was deleted by a third party his response was to delete the link to MW. <a href="../../../a/r/z/User%7EArzel_c62e.html" title="User:Arzel">Arzel</a> 01:10, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed, I approached Yamla about the unblock and raised the issue that this was done without communication, which is not a good move, in my opinion. Checkuser has information that normal admins do not, and these blocks should only be repealed after communication with the checkuser.</dd>
<dd>It should also be noted that since his unblock his only contributions have been removing sock tags from his sockpuppets and harassing users that he sees as his opponents on their talk pages. When the sock tags were removed, administrator JzG restored them and protected the article. I think that his lease on good faith has expired and should remain blocked. ✎ <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_M_Dodge_b77b.html" title="User:Peter M Dodge"><font color="#669966">Peter M Dodge</font></a> (<a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_M_Dodge_3d4d.html" title="User talk:Peter M Dodge"><font color="#669966">Talk to Me</font></a>)</span> 20:14, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Remember that blocks are preventative, not punitive.

<p>It is <i>not</i> the case that I unblocked this user earlier today. The user was unblocked more than three weeks ago after discussion on unblock-en-l. The user did at the time commit to having read <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and some other policies, and agreed not to violate them again. I unblocked the user because blocks are preventative, not punitive, and iirc (which I may not), notified JzG about my actions. I was rightly criticised by JzG for unblocking without first discussing with him, and apologised for doing so. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 20:29, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ah, I see it now. My mistake; it <i>was</i> three weeks ago. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadow1_a579.html" title="User:Shadow1"><font color="olive">Shadow1</font></a> <a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShadow1_f31d.html" title="User talk:Shadow1">(talk)</a> 20:37, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, having cleared this up, what is it now: has he done enough disruptive things within those last three weeks to deserve a <i>new</i> block, or not? In particular, is there evidence for renewed sockpuppetry? He's currently on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Category%7ERequests_for_unblock_4c8c.html" title="Category:Requests for unblock">Category:Requests for unblock</a>. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 15:07, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know if there is evidence of renewed puppetry, but at the same time I can't really say he has had a lot of high quality edits since the block was lifted. His claim of wanting to be unblocked because he in involved in 2 AfDs rings a bit hollow. One he apparently became suddenly interested in after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Mario_Party_8_minigames&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Mario_Party_8_minigames&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">JzG showed up and opined delete</a>. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, but it is kind of hard not to see this as a <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a>.

That said, I'd be willing to extend him a bit of AGF and see if he actually wants to contribute positively here, but any more socking should result in a ban discussion.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:24, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just a couple of bits on the issue: I haven't seen his checkuser, but he claims to be connecting from several different places, each of which could be shared by random and disparate users. He has read and agreed to several policies (including <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. Yes he violated the policies, but he didn't really know them? He wanted to participate in the AfDs, but they're both closed, so those are moot issues now. People have been making a big deal about him becoming an enemy of JzG and just joining the opposite bandwagon. People have been throwing words around like "proof" but I've yet to see anything besides circumstantial evidence.

<li>Okay, as not much fresh material has come to light here that would necessitate an ongoing block (we're talking indef here!), and since the previous block was based at least in part on a factual misunderstanding, I'm unblocking now. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 17:51, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, it rather depends.

Nysted's contributions thus far are of approximately zero worth, as noted above, and the text below implies a legal threat, which hardly helps his case. Discussed on unblock-l? For what value of discussed? I posted a <i>strong</i> request not to unblock when he first asked, and although I subscribe to unblock-l it looks like I missed <i>that</i> debate as well. So once again Nysted is loose and&#160;!voting "keep" for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">syntheses of original research</a> and other "helpful" input.

<li>Plus, he is lobbying to have the article on <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Walker_%28drummer%29_578e.html" title="Matt Walker (drummer)">Matt Walker</a> mention him.

<li>Fine, then learn. Please, learn. First up, when voting on a deletion, remember it's not a vote, and remember too that if someone has researched the issue and concluded that the article is a <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">novel synthesis</a>, that means you need to check for that argument, not whether you personally think the topic has merit. If it can't be verified from authoritative sources then we <i>must</i> delete it even if we are personally convinced that one day it will become important so we will one day have to have an article. Right now there are no reliable sources for that article, the sources cited do not support the actual content. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:52, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think a temporary block on both is in order to get their attention.

<dd>The three-revert rule comprehends blocks in this circumstance. The language used there to express the principle is "Editors may still be blocked even if they haven't made more than three edits in any given 24 hour period, if their behaviour is clearly disruptive." Clearly these people are edit-warring and clearly it is disruptive; they show no intention of stopping. The page should be unprotected and the users blocked if they perform similar edits to the page; other users shouldn't be prevented from making valuable contributions because of these editors' misbehaviour. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 06:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>For now there are no other editors, and a 24 hour block for a 1st offense will help for 25 hours, if we're lucky. I'd rather find someone who is knowledgable about TLRs and who does not have an axe to grind, like WIkiproject:Biology? I'd be happy to unprotect early if someone else will take an interest, and then block the two edit warriors if they can't get along with the new editors. If you feel strongly, you may reverse my protection and block the editors instead. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 07:23, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's indeed another factor to take into account, and I wouldn't block them straight away, but only if they persisted in their edit warring (which I would make clear to them if I unprotected the page). The main point I was trying to convey is that people can still be blocked for edit warring even when they don't make more than three reverts in any 24 hour period. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 07:35, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Thatcher. I noticed that there seemed to be some sort of slow-motion revert war going on there, but it hadn't really clicked that it had been going on as long as it had. I had been meaning to take a closer look at the competing versions, but I've been busy putting together figures and last-minute data for a grant application. If they come out edit warring again after the protection comes off, then blocks would be in order to get their attention. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 15:34, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm partly involved in this situation so I'll bring this issue here - there has been quite a long revert war going on in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matrix_scheme.html" title="Matrix scheme">Matrix scheme</a>, and the parties involved in the edit warring appear to be using the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3rr_66ae.html" title="WP:3rr">three revert rule</a> to <i>allow</i> them to make a maximum of 3 edits within 24 edits, which is gaming the system, and much throwing about of the word 'vandalism' to other users. There are only 2 or 3 users involved in this edit warring, so protection does not look like the most feasible option, but instead blocking may be necessary if things escalate. It needs to be made clear that any edit warring of any sort is unacceptable, so I'm seeing what other sysops have to say.

This kind of vandalism is particularly pernicious because it is likely to go undetected (as a several of his edits have).

The links were to recognized websites run by Queen's University or it's affiliates, namely the Alma Mater Society. I posted the link to the Golden Cockroach awards as they are relevant to the substandard housing that can exist in the ghetto. The "winner" of this award was named in local media and this can hardly be considered a slight in any way. If this user bothered to check rather than to remove the link he would have noticed this.</p>
<p>I have tried to let this issue drop but this user seems keen on harassing me and continues to keep posting things to my talk page, even after I indicated that I would like the issue to drop.</p>
<p>My chat with an editor was on a completely unrelated image I submitted relating to copyright and I welcomed his input. I really couldn't care less about the links but would appreciate it if this user would leave me alone.

<dd>Note: An IP isn't a sockpuppet, it just means that Zarbon is using a computer that's not signed in (not surprising, since his login is blocked). And I'd recommend against blocking the entire IP range, since it belongs to a university, and there's a good chance that he's not the only person at that university that wants to use/update Wikipedia. The best situation here seems to be simply partial-protecting the two articles in question, so that IPs can no longer edit them. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 20:38, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi there, I'm a teacher at a high school in Richmond Ontario. I edited content for the town of Richmond in August of 2006. I noticed as I glanced at the page today that there is a Reeve listed for the town (there are no longer Reeves in our area) by the name of Rodney Fillman. He's a student at our high school. Looking back through the history of the page. All entries between Sept 2006 and Jan 2007 are fallacious entries by a character or two at the school I suspect. They play euchre and I suspect that coning was the act they did rather than a sport in the town&#160;:)</p>

In particular, I recently protected <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavica_Ecclestone_ae03.html" title="Slavica Ecclestone">Slavica Ecclestone</a> due to their edit warring there. Similarly, Paulcicero has frequently reverted edits on <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Majstorovic_499e.html" title="Daniel Majstorovic">Daniel Majstorovic</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Serbs_d101.html" title="List of Serbs">List of Serbs</a>. Just a couple hours ago I blocked Paulcicero for thirty-six hours due to the revert-warring, the sockpuppetry (that he has made no attempt to deny), and the fact that it's the second block in the past couple days.

I felt compelled to agree due to similarities in edit and revert patterns, even though Tar-Elenion has strongly denied the claims. I blocked Tar for twenty-seven hours, and simultaneously filed a request for checkuser to confirm (or de-firm) the sockpuppetry allegations. Unfortunately, checkuser can take awhile, so I'm curious for some feedback on whether this was the right move.

User ROOB323 rarely participates in any factual discussions, instead, spending most of the time reverting pages -- his record is easy to check.</p>
<p>I have re-iterated why my edits should stay, as he has removed the following important facts from the article: 1) stub about this page being part of Azerbaijan related pages; 2) that Erivan khanate was an Azerbaijani state (like other khanates, such as Karabakh, Naxcivan, Baku, Shirvan, Kuba, Sheki, etc) and was nominally independent at times, and at other times fully independent; that 3) khanate is not a principality (like melikdoms), but a state or kingdom (which is reflected in the military historians' John F. Baddeley presented quotes); and 4) that along with all Armenians, all Jews and all Muslims (Azerbaijanis and Kurds and Persians) were deported by Shah Abbas (discussed at length at the Nakhichevan page). All this has been discussed on other relevant pages, sometimes at length, plus several quotes were provided.</p>
<p>After I pointed out that I am tired of these constant reverts by these users, user ROOB323 made the following insulting and uncivil comment: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AErivan_khanate&amp;diff=111545155&amp;oldid=111544568" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AErivan_khanate&amp;diff=111545155&amp;oldid=111544568" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>.

I have asked him not to do this and explained the correct way to do page moves, but he continues to do this (he has done this in the past with other pages, and basically ignores the whole Move process and move wars by copying article/redirect code back and forth.</p>
<p>This isn't a content issue, just a process/policy one - I'm not opposed to an actual move if there's consensus for it, but it should happen in a way that preserves page history.</p>
<p>Could an admin look into this and get him to stop? Protecting the redirects would probably take care of it, I've made a request for page protection but no response yet. The sooner someone could look into this the better, since any edits in the meantime screw up the history more and make this mess harder to fix.

We now have a new incident. The users <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuprynka_a4fb.html" title="User:Chuprynka">Chuprynka</a> being blocked for no reason by Betacommand yesterday. I commented on that earlier <a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html#Proper_tagging_of_blocked_users" title="User talk:Akhilleus">here</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Hillock65_d7f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Hillock65">here</a> but chose not pursue this further since the user blocked by Betacommand said earlier that he has left. So, ultimately, it did not matter except as another example of eager blocking by Betacommand. Today, however, the user in question posted an "unblock" template. I honestly, have nothing to do with this. Moreover, my interaction with said user haven't been pleasant but purely due to some content disputes.</p>
<p>Anyway, to summarize the issue briefly, Hillock65 was among several users who stood up to trolling by the confirmed puppeteer <a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYarillastremenog_c48f.html" title="User:Yarillastremenog"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Yarillastremenog</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../y/a/r/User_talk%7EYarillastremenog_a191.html" title="User talk:Yarillastremenog">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yarillastremenog_343e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yarillastremenog">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Yarillastremenog_7480.html" title="Special:Blockip/Yarillastremenog">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>), see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Yarillastremenog_5326.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Yarillastremenog">list of confirmed puppets</a> of that user. In retaliation for the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Yarillastremenog_5326.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Yarillastremenog">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Yarillastremenog</a> the puppeteer submitted the frivolous report at <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Hillock65_d7f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Hillock65">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Hillock65</a> where he alleged that Hillock and Chuprynka are socks. I have edited the article in question and observed the behavior of all users involved. There was no similarity between these two accounts and report was clearly submitted in bad faith. It stood idle and unaddressed by checkusers for a while, and yesteday, when it was already too late for checkuser to give any result, Betacommand, who is neither a checkuser nor has any familiarity with the problem, decided to "close" the puppetry case himself, blocked them both as socks for no reason and placed the sockpuppet templates at both user's pages. Only after I raised the issue, he posted his "report" on the very same page where he merely says that he concludes towards sockpuppetry based on the fact that among the articles edited by the users, there was one common one (!).</p>
<p>My analysis is presented at <a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html#Proper_tagging_of_blocked_users" title="User talk:Akhilleus">User talk:Akhilleus#Proper tagging of blocked users</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Hillock65_d7f4.html#Response_to_report" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Hillock65">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Hillock65#Response to report</a>. As I said, I had my problems with Hillock65 due to the content conflicts but before he decided to leave, he wrote several articles himself. Most notably the comprehensive <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Konotop_8eab.html" title="Battle of Konotop">Battle of Konotop</a> article was written by Hillock single handily. At the same time, <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuprynka_a4fb.html" title="User:Chuprynka">user:Chuprynka</a>'s entries at the talk pages were clearly civil and measured, while Hillock's was more combative (but this is not incivility we are discussing and incivility was not a major problem anyway).</p>
<p>To conclude, whatever issues one might have with these editors, the sockpuppetry accusations were brought in bad faith (by Yarillastremenog) and decided on sloppily (by Betacommand). The users needs to be unblocked and the unblocking edit summary should include the apology for the inconvenience and false accusations.

<li>I generally concur, especially with Betacommand going commando <i>again.</i> One person asked, "Why else would someone want to be an admin" except to block. I was aghast at that, because people who do want to be admins so that they can block can end up acting like Betacommand and causing the whole project grief. One mantra: discuss, confer, and act multilaterally. That's all a person needs. Discuss, confer, and act multilaterally, and especially <i>in public</i> and not on IRC with whoever happens to be in channel at the time. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:53, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I've just stumbled across this after someone mentioned Beta being dragged in front of the Arbcom, Irpen, please relax, you seem very aggressive in tone here and there's no assumption of good faith by you on the part of anybody else here at all, it really seems your intent on dragging this to Arbcom, which to my mind is, at this time, unnecessary. We're dealing with usernames here, something that some people see as fine and others see as being excessive, it has been suggested on IRC that Beta stop blocking users for a little while (a couple of weeks) and instead, should watch others performing username blocks and looking through the RFC/N page to see what usernames are being thought of as unacceptable there too. ArbCom is really not the place to discuss the good faith functions of an admin, rather, it should be a last resort if the admin or any editor refuses to change their behavior, is seriously damaging the project, is doing nothing to help the project at all, and all other avenues to rectify the situation have been exhausted. We're not their yet and I think if you try a less confrontational approach, we might be able to make some really significant headway here. <font face="Arial">-- <b><a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><font color="blue">Heligo</font></a><a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><font color="red">land</font></a></b></font> 23:45, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

After briefly looking over this issue, I think betacommand's blocks have been made in good faith in this particular instance, there has been evidence to suggest that the 2 users are sockpuppets. However there have been a number of users blocked (once again) for username violations; User:Asdf555, User:Sally catastrophe;, User:B;uedog, User:Ihatechillums which are questionable to say the least <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 23:04, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thank you, Friday. Given that we're seeing the very same list of names appearing in support of Betacommand's blocks this time as last, and some of the same names upset at unilateral blocking (without warning, of course) plus quite a few more, it is time for an RFC, as I don't think that the one important remedy has been accepted: confer. Confer on AN/I. Find an uninvolved person. If your last block got overturned, think twice before the next one. It's no vendetta: it's an attempt to ensure that we don't keep going over the same ground and losing people and escalating into wars. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:13, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>**In light of recent goigns on, and probably this covnerstaion, Betacommand has dumped about 30 names to be blocked at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. Some of them are blatantly obvious but i feel that he is doing this to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">Make a point</a> and i feel it is innapropriate.

<li>about a 3rd of the names seemed appropriate for <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, penis, poop, vandal in the name is generally ok. I am fairly sure Beta knew what he was doing when he flooded the page with the rest of the questionable names.

<dd>The fact you would have blocked accounts such as User:Asdfgrewq purely on their user names is precisely why you cannot be trusted with username blocks at this moment in time. I note now that you have reverted to adding them to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a>.

I'm not sure it should be making any decisions regarding blocking or not people based on usernames, RFC is Requests for Comment no other RFC can instigate a block or ban on anyone. The normally expected outcome from RFC is for *all* involved (not necessarily just the person being complained about) to consider the views expressed and as a matter of self make suitable adjustments.
