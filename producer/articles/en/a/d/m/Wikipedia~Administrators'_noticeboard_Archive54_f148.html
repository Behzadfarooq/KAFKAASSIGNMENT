At <a href="../../../p/h/i/Talk%7EPhiladelphia_460a.html" title="Talk:Philadelphia">Talk:Philadelphia</a>, I suggested the links that he should look at, to try to get him to look at the consequences of changing those links, and to get him to think that it's a bigger issue than he thought. He saw the consequences with his editing, and thought that others were vandalizing his edits (in my view), so the edit war escalated. Because I saw similar behavior from another user, <a href="../../../w/r/a/User%7EWrath_of_Roth_f915.html" title="User:Wrath of Roth">User:Wrath of Roth</a>, I (wrongfully) opened a sockpuppet case against him (<a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Kramden4700_df92.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Kramden4700">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Kramden4700</a>).

<dl>
<dd>Israel’s Government has thrown its weight behind efforts by supporters to counter what it believes to be negative bias and a tide of pro-Arab propaganda. The Foreign Ministry has ordered trainee diplomats to track websites and chatrooms so that networks of US and European groups with hundreds of thousands of Jewish activists can place supportive messages.</dd>

<dd>In the past week nearly 5,000 members of the World Union of Jewish Students (WUJS) have downloaded special “megaphone” software that alerts them to anti-Israeli chatrooms or internet polls to enable them to post contrary viewpoints. A student team in Jerusalem combs the web in a host of different languages to flag the sites so that those who have signed up can influence an opinion survey or the course of a debate. <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2289232,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2289232,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<li>If we have a reliable source for "massive population movements" within Israel as a result of the Hezbollah missile bombardment, then we should write about them. If we have a reliable source for "extremely high collateral damage" sustained by the Israeli population, we should write about it.

<li>Not that this is the place to argue this, but a roughly 10-to-1 ratio of Lebanese to Israeli civilians -- as well as the similiar ratio for civilians displaced -- should strike an objective observer as being wildly unbalanced enough to not require the automatic utterances of exact equivalency when bringing up the events to avoid actual claims of bias. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 06:01, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello, A few days ago, I discovered a neat way to add coordinates to the stadium infobox. I added it to the infobox and it worked well. I have spent the last 5 days of my life adding coordinates to all the psorts arenas. Now, someone has found a way to add coordinates to the top (such as <a href="../../../p/e/t/PETCO_Park_ec6b.html" title="PETCO Park">PETCO Park</a>) and tehy have found a way to disable the coordiante settings I have put in the infobox. They did this without an audit trail. I feel this was the wrong way to go about things for the following reasons...</p>
<p>1. It has been the standard way that coordinates show up in the infobox for other types of infoboxes.</p>
<p>2. The new coordinates on the pages work differenly than the coordinates that (were) in the sports arena infoboxs. For instance they do not pull up links to googel maps.</p>
<p>3. Some stadiums that I had added coordinates to in the info box (such as <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giants_Stadium_3dd9.html" title="Giants Stadium">Giants Stadium</a> now have no coordinates for them what so ever.</p>
<p>4. Nobody cared about coordinates until I added this and nobody contacted me before adding the coordinates the other way. I have spent 5 days of my life working on this and strongly feel I should have at least been consulted. Somehow they have screwed up my ability to even add it back to the stadium infobox even though infoboxes such as the "protect areas" infobox have coordinate settings. They have stifled my innovation.</p>
<p>Please let me know. I put a lot of mental energy into figuring this out and feel I have a lot more to contribute along these lines to wikipedia. If somebody had only contacted me before doing it I would have been open minded to it. But I won't contribute any more if people don't talk to me before messing with something I did.--<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_who1975_66e5.html" title="User:Dr who1975">Dr who1975</a> 02:13, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>If I understand you correctly, the template you are looking for is <a href="../../../c/o/o/Template%7ECoor_title_dms_2cf9.html" title="Template:Coor title dms">Template:Coor title dms</a>. <a href="../../../p/e/t/PETCO_Park_ec6b.html" title="PETCO Park">PETCO Park</a> has the template tag near the bottom of the page, next to the <a href="../../../m/l/b/Template%7EMLB_b2fd.html" title="Template:MLB">Template:MLB</a> tag. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 02:28, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, like Zzyzx11 said, it's part of that template. If you look at the history of the PETCO Park article, for example, you'll see it was added on July 10th with the edit summary "Adding geographical coordinates" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PETCO_Park&amp;diff=62962056&amp;oldid=62411808" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PETCO_Park&amp;diff=62962056&amp;oldid=62411808" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I can't speak for why it was removed from the other template, but I would assume that it's because whoever removed it thinks it is redundant to have them both in the top corner and in the infobox. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 02:44, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Recently, I received a message on my talk page from a CapnCrack sock stating that these accounts had not been blocked and had made vandal edits and created bogus pages that had not yet been delt with. I'm not completely sure whether or not all of this is authentic, but I still recommend blocking these accounts (and also CJ Izzy) and checking their contributions just in case.--<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEdmonde_Dantes_5c97.html" title="User:Edmonde Dantes"><font color="purple"><b>The Count of Monte Cristo</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/d/m/User_talk%7EEdmonde_Dantes_545b.html" title="User talk:Edmonde Dantes"><b><font color="red">Parley</font></b></a></sup> 05:53, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've blocked CJIzzy as a probable sockpuppet, and the ones on the bottom of the list (bottom 12 or so) I also blocked for vandalism-only accounts. However, the rest appear to have already been blocked by Curps and others. I didn't catch any further up the list that weren't already blocked. Feel free to go thru these with a fine-toothed comb, but these were almost all blocked right away.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 07:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the username's altogether fine and concur in Deathphoenix' formulation. Another relevant question, though, is whether the username is likely to impair the user's cordial collaboration with others and by extension to disrupt the project; notwithstanding that two users have expresed being off-put by the username (although perhaps only in view of policy), there doesn't seem to be anything to suggest that those users or any others have refrained from working/corresponding with Peach in view of his name. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:45, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm having some issues with users who are removing messages and warnings from their talk pages, and either deleting them altogether, or putting them into an archive immediately. In both cases, the user has also been uncivil in his or her response, and both have engaged in personal attacks. Because <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_48c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings">Wikipedia:Removing warnings</a> is only proposed policy, I'm afraid to push too hard in telling the users that they shouldn't be removing legitimate warnings from their talk pages, and I'm also having difficulties finding the best way to deal with their other misbehavior, much of which seems to be trolling. A request for comment might seem applicable in both cases, but I know I'm supposed to try to find a better solution first, and would like to. Neither user seems cooperative, however, so I'm somewhat at a loss in terms of how to proceed. --<a href="../../../e/m/u/User%7EEmufarmers_b2e0.html" title="User:Emufarmers">Emufarmers</a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../e/m/u/User_talk%7EEmufarmers_439c.html" title="User talk:Emufarmers">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Emufarmers_b9ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Emufarmers">C</a>)</small></sup> 06:41, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have undone the blocks. A user called "robertbfc" requested the unblock on behalf of himself and others, as Tiscali is a major ISP in the UK. Active users in #wikipedia agreed that this was a good idea. I will help watch for General Tojo-related vandalism; I understand the problem, but blocking an entire ISP is, in my opinion, a bit heavy-handed. --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowking_Man_5da9.html" title="User:Slowking Man">Slowking Man</a> 13:46, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes - There are thousands of Tiscali UK members, it's the 3rd largest ISP in Europe. To be honest, I am peeved at Chris 73's tactics:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>•He didn't discuss such a major block before carrying it out.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>•He doesn't appear to know who Tiscali are - he says <i>Has anybody experience in contacting the provider to report abuse?</i> on the Administrators' noticeboard.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>•But anyway, no matter how big the ISP, he is ignoring the principle and punishing the majority for the immature actions of the few.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>

<dd>•He leaves legitimate editors with no way to continue editing, as he has blocked new account creations.</dd>

<p>How would we go about making a formal complaint regarding this action? - 15:15, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I understand and to a large extent agree with the complaints from Tiscali users. However, we have a very persistent and frequent vandal in General Tojo (take a look at the history of user PaulWicks personal pages and contributions), and it appears our tools for dealing with such vindictiveness and spite are limited. The results will be that editors such as Paul and myself will grow discouraged; the amount of time and tediousness of trotting around scooping feces behind General Tojo ensures that. It appears that a time honored tactic is to wait for the vandal to move on to other things &amp; grow bored, but in the few cases where that doesn't apply, it looks as though there's very little in the way of tactics in the Wikipedia administrative toolbox. Chris 73 has inconvenienced a large number of people apparently, although I'm not understanding why ability to edit anonymously or for long term editors to create new accounts is necessary. Nevertheless, if you Tiscali subscribers would take a moment to take a look at the nature of our problem and suggest solutions, we would appreciate it. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfsnow_eafc.html" title="User:Profsnow">Dan</a> 16:30, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, why should one stupid user from an ISP be held against all legitimate editors from the same ISP? In Chris 73's actions, he was holding majority accountable to the actions of the minority.</dd>

<dd>In reply to Dan, this <i>was</i> a great inconvience - it affected people who wished to edit anonymously, of which their are many, as he should take note of. Also may I point out that the ban on account creation meant legitimate editors who hadn't got an account were prevented from carrying out any more of their work. Finally, perhaps he should consider that Tiscali members know no more about this vandal than he does, and that in the statement <i>if you Tiscali subscribers would take a moment to take a look at the nature of our problem and suggest solutions</i> he himself is holding the majority accountable for actions which they have no control over. 88.105.35.203 17:47, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My apologies to the anonymous editors of Tiscali for their inconvenience. As for my reason and defense:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Tojo is by now a bigger problem on Wikipedia</li>
<li>Another admin also initiated a block of the Tiscali range before to address this problem, and only for technical reasons the block did not come into effect (See <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELong_term_abuse_General_Tojo_d5c6.html#Range_Blocks" title="Wikipedia:Long term abuse/General Tojo">Wikipedia:Long term abuse/General Tojo#Range Blocks</a> if you want to know the details)</li>
<li>The Tojo problem and the block was discussed extensively before</li>
<li>I added a range block only after other options did not work</li>
<li>The block was also announced on the <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>, where it drew only minor response. I do not know a way of contacting the <i>anonymous IP'S of Tscali</i>, as some users above suggested.</li>
<li>The block blocked only anonymous users and account creation, and had no effect on logged in users.</li>
<li>I was monitoring my Wikipedia email, but up to date have not received any comments regarding the block. The first feedback I received was by User:Victor Greenstreet on my talk page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this obviously did not work, and I will not block the range again. I would welcome suggestions on how to handle the General Tojo problem on <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ELong_term_abuse_General_Tojo_c3e2.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Long term abuse/General Tojo">Wikipedia talk:Long term abuse/General Tojo</a>.

<p>Hey, I've already talked abit to JD_UK (I thought he was an admin, heh!) about this, but <a href="../../../k/a/i/User_talk%7EKaisuan_1a65.html" title="User talk:Kaisuan">User:Kaisuan</a> had copied, redirected, and renamed <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearching_5336.html" title="Wikipedia:Searching">Wikipedia:Searching</a> to a vanity article about himself, <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaisuan.html" title="Kaisuan">Kaisuan</a>. I've since put all the data back into place (including talk page), but there are a few lingering redirects to Kaisuan from Wikipedia Searching (or was it the other way around? I dunno). The other problem is that the user created the Kaisuan page from a double redirect (or something that used to be good redirected to a new page)(Which either I failed to notice or was something crazy impossible), and now the history for Wikipedia:Searching is on the Kaisuan page. Someone with oversight or deletion abilities (Administrators in general) might need to take a look at this in the near future (There are huge vandalism backlogs right now, so I'm probably really low on the list...)</p>

She's apparently been accused of operating sockpuppets; she wrote to me saying that User:Orangehead is not a sockpuppet but is her junior-high-school aged granddaughter, who is staying at her house. Either that is true, and something is being blown far out of proportion, or that is not, and she is perpetrating fraud. I'd be inclined to presume good faith: I don't see any evidence that she is out there wreaking havoc. (It is possible that she was at times "coaching" her granddaughter; I don't think that is necessarily out of line, unless it is an ongoing pattern over time, especially insofar as it becomes a doubling up on votes.)</p>
<p>I have a feeling a lot of this had to do with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kent-Meridian_High_School_9e25.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kent-Meridian High School">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kent-Meridian High School</a>, where Mattisse, operating under her former account name KarenAnn, made what seems to me to have been a reasobable nomination for deletion; someone definitely spammed to get a rush of inclusionists into the discussion; several people then improved the article, making edits that demonstrated notability; then several people, notably <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapit_578d.html" title="User:Capit">User:Capit</a>, made <i>ad hominem</i> attacks on her for nominating it in the first place. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">User:Metros232</a> appropriately cut the discussion short, since with the changes the article was a clear keep and the AFD had no further use other than mudslinging.</p>
<p>Wikipedia needs to be a welcoming environment for people other than just 20-something geekboys (BTW, I'm not by any means a 20-something, and not particularly a geekboy). I think some benefit of the doubt needs to be extended here, and possibly some mentoring, but I think there has been an overreaction and some "piling on". - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:36, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is worth noting that Capit is also a sockpuppet of KarenAnn/Mattisse. This apparently puzzled Mackensen as well and he spent more time than usual checking it, plus he asked for review from another checkuser, see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Listerin_33a8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for checkuser/Case/Listerin">Wikipedia talk:Requests for checkuser/Case/Listerin</a>. If KarenAnn created a persona to attack herself, it is not out of the realm of possibility that she also created a teenaged granddaughter. Also note that Orangehead has about 120 contribs, mostly to AfD, which hardly seems like typical behavior for a teenager. At this point, Mattisse is editing again. If she wants to create a second account to keep AfD separate from her edits, that's permissable as long as the streams don't cross (quoting Mackensen). Her granddaughter can create a new account, same principle applies. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 21:10, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The evening of the Colbert Conflaguration, a group of admins working the question of what to do about <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephencolbert_2969.html" title="User:Stephencolbert">User:Stephencolbert</a> got together on <i>teh sekret irc</i> and we came to a quick consensus on how to handle one element of the event, the existance of <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephencolbert_2969.html" title="User:Stephencolbert">User:Stephencolbert</a>. I have realized, upon reflection, that we may have failed to document our findings on the wiki (unless it's on another page that I don't monitor), an oversight for which I apologize. As has been covered elsewhere, Tawker blocked the user for possible impersonation (not incitement, a popular misconception). We met on #wikipedia-en-admins and agreed that while it was possible that it <b>could</b> be SC, the nature of the internet and the visibility of the situation made it appropriate to block and request external confirmation. Tawker emailed and called the Colbert show and left a message requesting followup, and to my knowledge, has not yet received a response. We hashed out the message that is currently on <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephencolbert_d735.html" title="User talk:Stephencolbert">User_talk:Stephencolbert</a> (requesting confirmation). Our intention was to provide a clean, unified response if it _was_ SC. Jaranda's welcome message was left up, followed by our request. Since then, a number of folks have worked together to keep the page in its current form (ie, removing "zomg i luv you steeeeephen!" messages). Ryulong suggested yesterday that we semi-protect the page, and at the time, I demurred, saying that the workload of reverting it wasn't high and that if we semi'd it, the actual user wouldn't be able to respond there. Time has passed, and I now feel that Ryulong's idea is sound, especially considering both the volume of traffic to the page as well as the fact that other means exist for the user to contact us. As such, I'd like to semi or fully protect it. Thoughts? I'd like to request that we put the issue of whether or not we think this COULD be SC aside for now, I move that the standard of evidence on this must necessarily be higher than mere possibility.

<dd>Incidentally, when requesting confirmation emails from such folks, it's much better to have them email <a href="../../../o/t/r/WP%7EOTRS_ffb6.html" title="WP:OTRS">WP:OTRS</a> on info-en-q@wikimedia.org - that way the request is handled officially (I'm guessing a famous person will be rather unwilling to correspond with some hotmail account), it's archived (so if the <i>real</i> SC came along in six months and said we'd allowed an impersonator, the foundation could pull out the email from him - they can't do that if the email just went to Tawker), and it's handled in accordance with the foundation's privacy policy. We need a boilerplate template for this, which says essentially what your note to him does, but also mentions <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a> (which is the underlying policy which allows you to block such cases). -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 18:31, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks! The message we used actually _does_ link to <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a>, but the OTRS link is an excellent idea. We provided Tawker's email address because he had already launched a request mail, but I support updating the text to make appropriate use of OTRS if we can confirm that whoever is on the other end of the mail will recognize the confirmation when it comes in and let us know.

<p>It should be noted that Stephen Colbert is playing a character (described by Colbert as "an idiot") whose advice to vandalize Wikipedia articles was purely satirical. I seriously doubt that he would register an account and act out this one-off comedy bit in real life.</p>
<p>Of course, while the likelihood that this username belongs to a misguided fan of "The Colbert Report" is roughly 99.9%, the attempt to contact the show for verification is entirely appropriate. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 19:06, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi there! I apologize if I wasn't clearer above, what I meant to communicate is that the admins that got together during the firestorm decided that on the off chance it _was_ SC, we wanted to keep the page limited to the welcome and the 'why you were blocked and how to fix it' message to maintain a single unified WP response. This is why I have brought this here as followup, to make sure that admin consensus on this extends outside of the immediate group that worked the issue initially. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 23:24, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, there has been some vandalism of both <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephencolbert_2969.html" title="User:Stephencolbert">User:Stephencolbert</a> and its associated talk page. However, with respect to <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephencolbert_d735.html" title="User talk:Stephencolbert">User talk:Stephencolbert</a>, some of the edits appear to be attempts by Wikipedians to communicate with <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephencolbert_2969.html" title="User:Stephencolbert">User:Stephencolbert</a> and some of these edits have been reverted as if they are obvious vandalism. I will be watching these pages and I am available to revert vandalism, so I will probably try taking off the page protection. I believe that Wikipedians should be allowed to edit <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephencolbert_d735.html" title="User talk:Stephencolbert">User talk:Stephencolbert</a> according to normal policy. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 01:19, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello everybody. As Jkelly advised me, I would like to hear your opinions regarding my course of action against the articles created by the sockpuppets of <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">user:Iasson</a>, a user permanently banned for his endless creation of socks (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Iasson_7fc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Iasson">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Iasson</a>). This user for sport, not for any agenda, appears to take pleasure in creating through his always reborn socks much false info and many new articles. After discussing the question with Jkelly, I'm oriented to delete all the articles he has lately created by his socks; but while a certain number of these accounts have been ascertained as socks of Iasson by the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Iasson_b821.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Iasson">Checkuser</a>, others have been blocked without passing through checkuser because it was quite obvious they were socks of Iasson. Now, regarding the obvious but not ascertained socks, would you find it correct to delete the articles so created, as I and Jkelly believe as the only measure to stop Iasson and banned users like him, or have you some doubts.

<p>Do i really need to say more, inspite of all this he actually goes around reporting me to every admin board, request for protection, personal attack board etc, there is.

<p>I am sorry for my long reply.

<dd>I'm sorry I missed the discussion on deleting this category. I think perhaps we ought to reconsider. The discussion mentioned concerns that it violates the Childrens Internet Protection Act, but it doesn't -- that primarily involves filtering on public computers (e.g. libraries) to get public funding, and ensuring that personal identifying information isn't disclosed deliberately or accidentally <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/washoff/WOissues/civilliberties/cipaweb/legalhistory/Summary.PDF" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ala.org/ala/washoff/WOissues/civilliberties/cipaweb/legalhistory/Summary.PDF" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. There's no good reason not to let kids self-identify on Wikipedia; it's not like we're a hotbed of preteen activity, and we're actually safer than most places since there is NO personal information anywhere, not even through hacking into the site (unless someone actually POSTS it, which could happen anywhere). (Last week Congress extended CIPA limitations to chat rooms and social sites like MySpace, which I personally find grossly excessive. Let's not jump on the paranoia bandwagon. One of our main tenents is "assume good faith.")

<p>I was idling in #wikipedia-en and a rather flustered person came on asking for help with a problem on his User talk page (<a href="../../../f/u/l/User_talk%7EFullstop_5b19.html" title="User talk:Fullstop">User talk:Fullstop</a>). On it was a discussion going on between Fullstop and Spahbod. It seemed that Spahbod was unhappy about certain changes Fullstop has been making to a certain article, resulting in an edit war. Since that edit war, it seems Spahbod has been stalking Fullstop and reverting most changes. When I last checked, 7 of 10 changes to the Wikipedia mainspace that Fullstop had made had been reverted by Spahbod, on claims of vandalism, NPOV, and in 2 cases, the only rv reason was "sad". It seems that every time someone counters his points, he accuses the person with accusations of incivility, personal attack and more interestingly sock puppetry. I've check the diffs, and Fullstops edits have been far from Vandalism, nor NPOV. The diffs of the unsubstantiated reverts can be found on <a href="../../../f/u/l/User_talk%7EFullstop_5b19.html" title="User talk:Fullstop">Fullstop's talk page</a>.</p>
<p>I regret, now, joining the discussion in this conflit, as since then I have been twice accused of Incivility, once for Personal attack (see the history for <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>), and also for sock puppetry (you can checkuser me if you want, I only have one other account which I stopped using before I created this account).</p>
<p>This isn't the only incident involving Spahbod. He, at the moment is part of an Request for Arbitration, in which he is defending himself with uncited accusations of incivility.</p>
<p>Please can an an administrator resolve this issue. Fullstop is at a loss on what to do, and I believe it is unfair on Fullstop as an editor of Wikipedia to have to deal with this.</p>

<p>It seems like there are some sneaky vandalism by two users here, who wanna claim fake things to Norway with no sources for it. I'm pretty new here and don't know how things work yet and how to deal with this kind of vandalism here on wikipedia. In the article "<a href="../../../n/o/r/Normans.html" title="Normans">Normans</a>".

<p>I do not believe that this user has been treating me with proper respect. The first incident of this that I can recall was during a nomination for deletion of the article "List of shock sites", which has since been merged with <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">Shock site</a>. He posted a comment which brought up the suggestion that I had nominated it for deletion simply because I was Catholic and found the content inappropriate. In my proposition for the article's deletion, I never once stated that religious had to do with my wanting the article deleted, and I think that it it was unacceptable for Abscissa to allege that my real reasons for wanting the article deleted were religious ones. (And also, after viewing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Abscissa&amp;oldid=66473808" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Abscissa&amp;oldid=66473808" rel="nofollow">most recent version of his userpage</a>, I find it somewhat ironic that he would accuse me of editing with POV.) Another memorable incident occured after a fairly recent situation in which I was blocked for creating accounts with offensive usernames and reporting them myself pretending that they were created by trolls (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive121#Conrad_Devonshire" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive121#Conrad_Devonshire" rel="nofollow">see here</a> for details). Abscissa posted a provocative comment on my talk page, stating that he found the names "funny" after the "List of shock sites debacle" (why he refered to it as a "debacle", I do not know, as it resulted in the article being drastically improved) and another refering to what I did as a "vandalism fiasco" (which is inaccurate since virtually no edits were made whatsoever with any of the accounts I created, though regardless, what I did was <i>completely inexcusible</i>). And finally, here the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEdmonde_Dantes&amp;diff=67393598&amp;oldid=67374015" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEdmonde_Dantes&amp;diff=67393598&amp;oldid=67374015" rel="nofollow">most recent example</a> of what I have been talking about.</p>
<p>Forgive me if I sound extreme, but I have come under the impression that this user is stalking me and I am tired of it.

<p>Image:Delhi ITO Bridge Traffic Jam.jpg used under fair use, but it clearly fails point #1 of the fair use criteria: it's just a generic photo of a traffic jam, one that anyone in the area with a camera could replace. The problem is that all my attempts to get it deleted have been reverted: the uploader believes that the only requirement for fair use is that it be low resolution and credit be given, and has actively removed all attempts to tag the image as "no rationale", "fair use disputed", "speedy delete", or "ifd". --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 20:22, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I thought that the indefinitely blocked template {{<a href="../../../i/n/d/Template%7EIndefblock_e2ef.html" title="Template:Indefblock">indefblock</a>}} should be put on a user page so that the account will be identified as indefinitely blocked and it will put the account in the indefinitely blocked category of the month. Also, I thought that the template was supposed to be added to the user page, not the user talk page. I am talking about choosing which one to add it to if you are only going to add it one, not whether there is no harm in adding it to both (Although I would think that adding it to both would be bad since it would create duplicates in the category. Perhaps a different template should be used for talk pages that would inform people the user was blocked, but not put the page in a category. I suggest {{indefblocktalk}} for the name). The reason that I am asking is that I have come across the user and user talk pages of indefinitely blocked users that are marked with a personal message, marked on the talk page but not the user page, and marked on both pages. Also, sometimes admins place a sockpuppet template on the user page and a indefinitely blocked template on the talk page. Most of them are placed or not placed by just a few admins. You can see examples at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_users_indefinitely_blocked_in_July_2006_7524.html" title="Category:Wikipedia users indefinitely blocked in July 2006">Category:Wikipedia users indefinitely blocked in July 2006</a>. If I am correct, it would be sweet if a bot could put the templates on user pages of accounts that only have them on the talk page, remove them from talk pages, and possibly add a different indefinitely blocked template for talk pages. I am in favor of a talk page notice because it would help prevent people from unintentionally adding comments after the user was indefinitely blocked. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 12:13, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm moderately involved in the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador_Allende_6d40.html" title="Salvador Allende">Salvador Allende</a> article, so I'm probably not the best person to facilitate matters related to that article from an administrative position. I'm in danger of losing my temper; I already more or less did once. It seems to me that <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">User:Mike18xx</a> has been involved in a lot of POV-pushing and that, just in general, he isn't "playing fair", in that he is holding others to standards of neutrality of sources that he has no intention of obeying himself. He seems to reject as politically biased any source that he characterizes as Marxist (and when I pointed out that "clearly your definition of Marxist is wide enough to embrace people who don't even call themselves such" he responded by saying "Most US <i>Republicans</i> are <i>Marxist</i> without <i>knowing it</i>…", a remark that I think speaks more about him than about the sources we are using); meanwhile, <i>he</i> cites <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Horowitz_9935.html" title="David Horowitz">David Horowitz</a>'s <i>FrontPageMag</i>, hardly a beacon of objectivity.</p>
<p>Since his comments on that page and on his user talk page suggest a guy who likes to argue rather than discuss and who moves pretty easily over the line into personal attacks (both on authors of sources and on Wikipedians), I don't think I would help matters by trying to engage him further. But I think the situation is in need of attention.

<p>That seems a far from an obvious conclusion to make, and even if true, doesn't appear to be a clear-cut 3RR.

<p>The articles flayer removed were from sources that included MSNBC, CNN&amp; the Guardian, so their removal was cerntanly unjustified. aditionaly it seeems flayer has gone about removing information he dislikes(but is sourced.) in other pages.--208.61.16.41 16:59, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I’ve seen what’s happened in that page my self Flayer appears to never use the talk page, or answer to requests for dialogue, so talk won’t work. He also goes about removing information without leaving a suitable message. (often nothing or, done under the guise of NPOV.) and replaces the information with dubious claims, or removes it totally. A quick check to his talk-page User talk:Flayer, (and contrib. page.) shows that he hasn’t just defaced Lebanon related articles but also articles as unrelated as house keeping. I strongly advocate that an administrator take action. (.BTW a look at the time data on the articles in question does seem to reinforce the view held by 68.215.134.176 that he operates a sock puppet under an IP address around 88.155.198.100.)--<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreepsbane_2964.html" title="User:Freepsbane">Freepsbane</a> 19:25, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Earlier today, the article <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Arpaio_a995.html" title="Joe Arpaio">Joe Arpaio</a> was tagged as a copyvio by <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKaszeta_0108.html" title="User:Kaszeta">Kaszeta</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Copyright_problems/2006_August_4/Articles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67640118" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Copyright_problems/2006_August_4/Articles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67640118" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. I looked at the text and noted that the copyright violations were not too terrible and could be easily fixed.

I followed the instructions and created a new page at Talk:Joe Arpaio/Temp where I proceeded to work on the problems as outlined in the talk page. While I was working on these problems, <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibofh_f636.html" title="User:Wikibofh">Wikibofh</a> reverted the copyvio tag and struck the copyvio entry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Copyright_problems/2006_August_4/Articles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67661227" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Copyright_problems/2006_August_4/Articles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67661227" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive54_f148.html" title="Edit section: Stamps wrongly claimed as Fair use: serious copyright problem">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Stamps wrongly claimed as Fair use: serious copyright problem</span></h2>
<p>This is not a small, but quite serious problem regarding fair use guidelines. I noticed that <a href="../../../f/a/i/Category%7EFair_use_stamp_images_b60a.html" title="Category:Fair use stamp images">Category:Fair_use_stamp_images</a> has close to 500+ images of stamps, all tagged with {{<a href="../../../s/t/a/Template%7EStamp_917c.html" title="Template:Stamp">Stamp</a>}}, and are supposed to be under Fair use. However, the fair use criteria as defined in <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html#Images" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR#Images</a> clearly states that this usage is only allowable "for identification". Furthermore, the guidelines in <a href="../../../f/a/i/Category%7EFair_use_stamp_images_b60a.html" title="Category:Fair use stamp images">Category:Fair use stamp images</a> state that "stamp images in this category should not be used solely as a cheap way to illustrate articles. In addition to the problem that images are often altered for artistic reasons and thus may not be factually accurate representations of their subject, Wikipedia:Fair use criteria does not allow for it."</p>
<p>However, *most* of the images under the category are being used for identifying the *subject* rather than the stamp itself. This is, as described above, not allowable under the fair use criteria.</p>
<p>I did check some of the images, and found that almost all of them (save a few used in philatellic articles) are being used in biography pages, or pages related to the building or the thing shown in the stamp. This is not fair use, and it should be dealt accordingly.</p>
<p>Since IANAL, could others with knowledge of the US fair use law clarify whether the usage of stamps in this case is ok or not? If the usage of stamps in biography or other such pages is not fair use, then the stamp images should be removed from those articles. If it IS fair use, then the criteria should specify this.</p>
<p>Since copyright is a big issue, and according to the recent zero-tolerance policies about non-licensed or non-sourced images, we should take care of this immediately. A related problem is the {{<a href="../../../c/u/r/Template%7ECurrency_ae04.html" title="Template:Currency">Currency</a>}} tagged images. I found today that <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimm_brothers.html" title="Grimm brothers">Grimm brothers</a> contains the image of <a href="../../../1/0/0/Image%7E1000-DEM-OBV-178x83.jpg_dcf4.html" title="Image:1000-DEM-OBV-178x83.jpg">Image:1000-DEM-OBV-178x83.jpg</a> i.e. the 1000 Deutsche mark, claiming fair use. I don't think the claim is valid. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 01:29, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Re. stamps, it's not fair use to illustrate the subject of the biography, unless the biography specifically deals with the fact that the subject has been honoured with a stamp. Ditto currency.

<dd>So, you mean, adding a sentence to the biography page saying that "A commemorative stamp on &lt;insert personname&gt; have been issued by &lt;insert country name&gt;" would make it fair use? --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 01:43, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I touched fourteen image description pages to remove orphan tags. Some stamp articles were using the same image because it was a particularly important one, so that is less than the number of clickthroughs. Another dozen or so had already been done before I began. I did not replace unfree stamps in "List of people appearing on stamps" articles, so the total number of articles I edited was nine. Again, there were also articles that had already had their stamps replaced before I began. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 19:16, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>During my time on English Wikipedia, I’ve come to realize just how male dominated it is (I myself am male). Seriously, how many Wikipedians are female? If these legendary creatures do exist, they would be classified as “rare and endangered”. But perhaps they are more common than I think, as it is difficult to tell and we tend to assume the user is male. But I digress; Female Wikipedians are few and far between. Unfortunately - we need Female Wikipedians, to continue effectively as an encyclopedia, as they can offer insights that males cannot. Male/female insights and interest differ radically. Compare:</p>

<p>The truth lies within the Article quality. How can we overcome this?</p>
<p>If I am wrong, and every second editor is female – correct me. I also apologize for stereotyping and generalizing. I am also unsure of how Wikipedia’s Homosexual community rates in this.</p>

<li>There are quite possibly lots of wikipedians who don't go around advertising whehter or not we are female and we frequently get mistaken (wrongly in my case) for being male. I also don't tell everybody what television show I watch or which way I vote, or even how old I am. I expect to be judged on my edits and the content I add should be able to measure up against wikipedia's policies - nothing more or less. There is probably a dispropritionate number of Australians compared with say people from Kazakhstan - the nature of an English language resource using technology. Since people can and do mislead others on the internet, I would say we have no way of finding out what the proportions are. Not sure it would be useful anyway - there are all sorts of biasses - income level, against those who are too time-poor to contribute or don't have access to the technology as well of course based on language and country.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A&#160;Y&#160;Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 02:21, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agree with the thrust of what you are saying, but I think the examples could be better - the F-35 is to my mind clearly more important than Madonna, (if you buy market economics for example, the way the cost overruns and albums sales are going, a single F-35 will soon be worth more than she is&#160;:-). While I play netball and I am certain that soccer IS NOT football, RUGBY is, even I can see given the relative size of the two sports, soccer deserves the bigger article, (marginally, and it should be rewritten to explain it is a form of Irish dance cum competitve amatuer dramatics death scene acting, in which no one ever scores&#160;:-). <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinstonwolfe_5756.html" title="User:Winstonwolfe">Winstonwolfe</a> 03:48, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So, to illustrate your point that there are small numbers of female editors here, you compared the quality of articles on stereotypically male and stereotypically female interests? I imagine you'd find that there are more women here than you think, but their distribution of interests is not so identifiably "female".

<p>I just wanted to make a note of the page, seemingly a personal wikiproject, at User:AMbroodEY/Fundy_Watch.

Though the project states its goal to promote NPOV, the watchlists, and adjectives given to users (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:AMbroodEY/Fundy_Watch/Watch_List&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67835991" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:AMbroodEY/Fundy_Watch/Watch_List&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67835991" rel="nofollow">diff</a>) makes it appear otherwise.</p>
<p>The watchlist also contains phrases like "not really islamist but bible thumpers", "Has religious implications. Edited by ultra-right Christian fundamentalist HolyWarrior and dbachman, biased because I think he might be Witzel's student", "<a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> Potentially dangerous anti-Hindu. he is an admin!

<p>This is just a heads up. A few months ago, Penny was indefinitely blocked for personal attacks and (literally) death threats involving the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halle_Berry_1870.html" title="Halle Berry">Halle Berry</a> page. Well in the last few days, she has returned as <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagentaThompson_9b13.html" title="User:MagentaThompson">User:MagentaThompson</a>. I didn't catch it until she used the exact same language and style as Penny. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHalle_Berry&amp;diff=68162132&amp;oldid=68152323" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHalle_Berry&amp;diff=68162132&amp;oldid=68152323" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is an edit by Magenta and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHalle_Berry&amp;diff=56038957&amp;oldid=56037832" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHalle_Berry&amp;diff=56038957&amp;oldid=56037832" rel="nofollow">here</a> is an edit by Penny.

However someone had already opened a second CFD at august 6 (even before the 1st one was closed). I didn't noticed this and it was pointed to me. Since the 1st CFD was valid and had more than a week of course, with good participation, I closed it and acted according that consensus, thus removed the cateogry and speeedy closed the 2nd spurious cfd. It seems there's a single user insisting on the category to be created, since he's the only one that uses. I don't consider the DRV on august 6 to be valid, since the CFD was still open and I closed it on 7th. Moreover, DRV should only disucss wether the closing was valid or not. <b>It's NOT a vote to overturn deletion discussions when an users is unhappy about the outcome.</b> Consensus was achieved on the July30-August7 and thus it's a valid closing.</p>
<p>User:syphonbyte is the user who keeps recreating CFDs, the one that does the DRV, (which closed BEFORE I closed the CFD) and the ony one that uses the category. -- <small><a href="../../../d/r/i/User_talk%7EDrini_c4b2.html" title="User talk:Drini">Drini</a></small> 16:47, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know the answer to that, but I think <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allende_stamps.html" title="Allende stamps">Allende stamps</a> makes an interesting test case for where the border of fair use might lie on this issue; it's probably right on the border for fair use, in that contrasting Cuban and Chilean stamps were being used to illustrate different commemorations on the 10th anniversary of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973_Chilean_coup_2641.html" title="1973 Chilean coup">1973 Chilean coup</a>.

<dd>That article is just a list of unfree images with a little prose, but there's no reason why it couldn't be a real article. It is a curious case.

<p>Another case: <a href="../../../g/l/k/Image%7EGLKStamps.jpg_1ddc.html" title="Image:GLKStamps.jpg">Image:GLKStamps.jpg</a>. These stamps were issued by a micronation. Fair use rationale was given in the image description (why doesn't OrphanBot parse for that?), and the article text mentions the assertion of the micronation that the stamps have philatelic value. Is this fair use? Also, some editors want to remove the claim of philatelic value as advertising, leaving only the statement that stamps were printed. I think that leaves fair use of the image on shaky grounds, and would like an outside opinion. (Original uploader thinks these stamp images are public domain, but I have been unable to verify that and am doubtful.) <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 12:04, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Assuming good faith doesn't work here. I believe that almost every rationale put on an image description page was put there in good faith.

On seven national <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting.html" title="Scouting">Scouting</a> articles-five in Africa which the Scouting WikiProject had to save from afd earlier this year, plus Lithuania and Turkmenistan, the stamps don't illustrate the subject, they prove the <i>existence</i> of the subject, and so are an integral and structural part of the article.

<p>User:Intangible is in the process of recategorizing hundreds of pages, despite the fact that Intangible is in arbitration over this very issue. I have asked for a temporary injunction, See:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Intangible/Workshop#Propose_temporary_injunction_against_User:Intangible" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Intangible/Workshop#Propose_temporary_injunction_against_User:Intangible" rel="nofollow">request for injunction</a>. I raise this here because so many pages are being edited, and I felt someone should at least glance at what is going on and decide if it is OK or not. I am obviously biased, and think the recategorization is POV, idiosyncratic, and ultimately destuctive of the work of scores of editors.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 12:38, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the most relevant question is whether it is likely that <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Warner_b84a.html" title="Time Warner">Time Warner</a>, the parent company, is likely to place Wikipedia high on its list of those infringing on copyright whom it desires to stop. Because of the caprice inherent in adjudging the likelihood of a given copyright holder's demanding the removal of material for which he holds the copyright (or initiating legal action), and in view of our general favoring of free content, we almost haven't a choice but to phrase our copyright policy in the fashion we have, but in individual situations it is, I think, fair to weigh the costs attendant to a prospective legal undertaking (multiplied, of course, against the likelihood of such undertaking) against the value of the copyrighted material to an article. With respect to Soviet stamps, for example, a general policy to the contrary notwithstanding, we can be fairly certain that we may infringe on copyright with impunity; can there be any valid reason for us not to do so? <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 02:25, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I supposed I meant cursorily to dispose of the former with my <i>general favoring of free content</i>, by which I meant to express the extent to which I think we inappropriately elevate the import of non-free non-textual media. I suppose under my formulation, though, where we would treat essentially as free those media that we know to be copyrighted but nevertheless use other than consistent with fair use law, such that the reusability concern wouldn't entail. The latter is, at least to me, a more persuasive argument, and it is one, I suppose, that highlights the problems to which I alluded and the salience of Jkelly's objections. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:06, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see two issues. First, multiple people may be editing through the account which is a nono. However, if they make an article off-wiki and then upload that would presumably be ok. Also, this doesn't seem to violate the spirit of that rule. The second issue is more serious, which is that this could set a bad precedent. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:36, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This was mentioned at <a href="../../../c/s/d/WT%7ECSD_761e.html" title="WT:CSD">WT:CSD</a>. I don't see a problem. They only write articles for companies that meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> <a href="http://www.mywikibiz.com/eligibility.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mywikibiz.com/eligibility.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, which in my mind sets the best precedent we could ask for. Sure, they're unlikely to include much that reflects badly on the company, but that can be added by someone else - an incomplete article is better than nothing. The only problem I can forsee is if they also start defending articles against all criticism (even when sourced), and as far as I'm concerned we should assume good faith and wait for that to start happening. If they are indeed familiar with how things work here, they probably won't do that. And, as JoshuaZ says, <a href="../../../m/y/w/User%7EMyWikiBiz_056a.html" title="User:MyWikiBiz">User:MyWikiBiz</a> may be a role account, so I've asked on the account's talk page whether that's the case. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:51, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Admin names are almost certainly not being targeted. Spam sites harvest content from other websites so that they will appear to be relevant in search results and so that Google will give them as search results for the terms in the content that they harvested. They often break up the text into pieces and then jumble it around. Some phrases are still intact, but not sentences. In the old days, they copied the whole page and left it intact. For Wikipedia, however, I have found sites that have a long page of Administrators' Noticeboard comments or Articles for Deletion nominations. Also, someday, can we stop making the Internet suck and get rid of the Wikipedia mirrors in search results? We've become much worse than spam sites and link farms for many searches, especially on obscure topics. Google is clearly not up to the job, as the problem was brought to their attention years ago. The CustomizeGoogle plugin is nice, but it does not remove them from the results entirely. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:39, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps the template should be changed, but I think it's rather clear the template is not referring to sysadmins on Wikipedia. For one, there is a rather large difference between a system administrator and sysop (sysadmins being Brion VIBBER, Tim Starling, etc.; sysops being you and I).

<dd><a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a>, it is unlikely that you can fully understand the situation without speaking with the original admin first. You are only getting one side of the story. That is why discussion is needed. If you disagree with another admins actions, it is best to discuss it on AN/I or AN. Other admins may agree with you and then you will have consensus to reverse.

<dd>At a wild guess, the distinctions between "chiding" and "blocking", and between "deliberating passing oneself off as a WP admin" and "using a potentially confusing userbox" both seem to be pertinent here. I think it would have been preferable had Friday explicitly consulted with Zoe beforehand, especially if there's "history" there likely to lead to friction from another such action? But: isn't review of the block implicit in the listing here in the first place? Or at least, <i>shouldn't</i> it have been, given how marginal the basis for it was in the first place? Nor was Friday the first person to express disagreement with the block, and that he should be unblocked. It does not seem like an appropriate block to me, if we're actually still discussing that aspect, as opposed to recasting this purely in "wheel war" terms. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 03:56, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Leaving aside the merits of the block (but noting that Zoe did not just fall off the turnip truck) none of us should undo another's admin actions without talking to them first. Unless this just had to be taken care of at once, it should have been discussed with Zoe before anyone unblocked. We need to presume competence - that the admin is probably not just being capricious, but has some reason for what she is doing. If I see an admin action that looks arbitrary, it is likely that I do not know all the facts. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 03:48, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Any admin making a block is obliged to explain said block on the user's talk page. If there's an arbritrary-looking block, the blocking admin did not explain adequately. All admins should act as a check on each other, and this includes (occasionally) undoing unjustified blocks. If people don't consider it a proper admin function for me to act as a check on other admins, let me know and I'll turn in my sysop bit.

<p>I have never seen the template used as a way to identify admins.

Also, unlike other admin identifiers, there is no reference to Wikipedia, such as the Wikipedia logo or a link the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a>. Since Friday thought that the block was a mistake, rather than a difference in opinion, I do not think unblocking the user was a big deal, especially because the user was right, it is a profession template. Still, according to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a>, it should be discussed with the blocking admin first, if he or she is online, even if it is believed that the block was made in error. I think that the user's perspective should be examined. An admin removed a template from his user page and blocked him for restoring it based upon the incorrect belief that the template is for identifying Wikipedia admins, even after he let her know that the template is not used in that way. That seems like a mistake to me. Should users be blocked for disobeying the directions of an admin when they are incorrect and the admin has even been informed that they are incorrect? We have not reached that level of insanity, yet, have we.&#160;;-) -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:11, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Remember when admins weren't allowed to block people unilaterally for anything other than vandalism? The fear of incidents like this was the reason why. At the time, I didn't think the fear was justified. I'm sorry to see myself proven wrong. The original block was a travesty; a hapless Wikipedian, guilty of nothing as far as I can tell, steamrolled by an admin who misunderstood the situation and wouldn't listen to explainations. I find it amazing that Zoe is still defending her actions, and even attacking Friday for undoing the block.

<p>It would make it a lot easier to determine at-a-glance, whether a user is or not, if all admins were required to add themselves to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_administrators_1aba.html" title="Category:Wikipedia administrators">Category:Wikipedia administrators</a> (perhaps even as the 1st category in their list).

I specifically don't explicitly mention being an admin on my user page because if there's a disagreement, I don't want anyone to think I deserve any special treatment. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 01:09, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, that makes sense. I'd been considering it more in terms of reminding admins that setting a good example is expected of them, or for finding an admin to help with some particular task.</dd>
<dd>(not to advocate instruction creep... but) perhaps, that it is not required to self-identify, should/could be mentioned somewhere on the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a> page?

<dd>It's not a big deal with me, but I would prefer it if every admin had the grey user box displayed. If someone is an admin, I think people should know. They can be very useful for all sorts of eventualities.

<dd>But why is that a problem particularly? I also don't advertise my sysop flag on my user page. Per Friday in the normal of course of things it is irrelevant the validity or otherwise of my arguments/statements is a constant irrespective of that flag.

<dl>
<dd>I think it depends on what area the admin works in and wants to work in. If it's processes like AfD, CSD etc, then it's not an issue. I've been contacted by several people to ask for help with specific problems that it needs admin powers to address, so it's essential for me to make it known I'm available for that. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 07:32, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The original task I was trying to achieve, was looking through a policy page edit history to find someone who was both familiar with the topic, and also an admin, in order to ask something or other.</dd>

<p>I personally don't see the point in forcing an admin to announce themsleves as an admin. Most of them seem to, its their choice to do so. This seems to have been blown out of all proportion - admins are just editors with a few extra tools.

<p>Lets cut the ideological wishmaking. Many new users and IPs will only respect what an admin says, not a regular user. An admin is more important than a regular user. Period. They get more respect. If the admin is comfortable with it, they should have some standard way of indicating that fact so we can ask them for help. Shit, they had to go through an RfA after all. --<a href="../../../m/b/o/User%7EMboverload_cce2.html" title="User:Mboverload">mboverload</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mboverload_00ae.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mboverload"><font color="red">@</font></a> 07:48, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's some of what I've been doing. An editor is trying to enforce policy like <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">VERIFY</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">NOR</a> for example and is getting ignored. Of course there's not much they can do about it, especially if they're in a minority. Of course, as an admin, I can, so I want the advantage the role gives me in that situation. If I'm acting as an editor, however, then I see myself on a level playing field. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 09:03, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's not encourage that attitude. An admin is not more important. They may be more respected than average, but that's a prerequisite for becoming an admin. It isn't because they are an admin.
