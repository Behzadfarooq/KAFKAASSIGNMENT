I considered it verging on a personal attack, if not a threat, and I replied with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWeirdoactor&amp;diff=99202843&amp;oldid=99182672" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWeirdoactor&amp;diff=99202843&amp;oldid=99182672" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which was probably not the most diplomatic response, but I wanted to make it clear that his comment on my Talk page was worrisome. He removed the comment, calling it "admin harrassment". I reverted the removal. He responded on my Talk page with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZoe&amp;diff=99364090&amp;oldid=99292667" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZoe&amp;diff=99364090&amp;oldid=99292667" rel="nofollow">this</a>. This is completely coming out of the blue, as I had no previous dealings with him except for suggesting he be civil in an AfD discussion. This threat should not be idly dismissed, but I have no intentions of continuing the discussion. I will, however, take action if there are further such threats issued against anyone else.

<dd>Thanks much for posting all these diffs, it helps to know the situation background. I will attempt to obtain an understanding of what Weirdoactor's view of the situation is, as I can see no reason for his characterizing your comments as harassment, or any reason for his reactions at all. Hopefully it is just a case of him having a Very Bad Day and reading your posts wrong. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 18:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Whatever. His attitude seems to be that the "deletionists" are out to destroy Wikipedia and he's here to protect it from the evil ones. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 19:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well I don't know about that, but his current attitude is certainly "any admin who politely informs me my incivility and hostile demeanor is unacceptable is harrassing me, and anyone who says s/he isn't is just protecting her/his friends and is a Bad Admin too!" which is hardly a helpful or rational attitude. I wouldn't have taken the trouble, except that I had interacted with this editor before, as I've mentioned, and seen nothing to indicate this kind of attitude - as Moreschi has also noted above. I'll post to Durova's talk page, up to her whether she wants to give it a go or not. I now withdraw any objection to any block deemed acceptable by any admin, my attempt to help this user resulted in insults and accusations. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 19:48, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Her vocals on <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_To_Tell_2528.html" title="Live To Tell">Live To Tell</a> were considered her best at the time by some, and the song's lyrics have been described as "poignant"<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup>: "<i>A man call tell a thousand lies.

<p>I happened to see one of Cplot's more recent edits before it was reverted. In it, the Cplot sock says that even though these edits are all being reverted, they are still worth making because they live on forever in the page histories and curious users look to see what has been reverted. I don't know whether that is right or not but I wonder if admins should begin the practice of deleting rather than merely reverting these edits. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps it's a shame in that respect (assuming you are correct, which I've no reason not to), though my experience of the web in general suggests that when people get ideas in their head to the point of writing long and persistant rants about them, there's just no reasoning with them.

<dd>"My opinions", sounds like a mini-heirachy for this thread - just kidding&#160;:) I forgot all about this "project". Anyways, I'm <b>strongly against</b> that sort of heirachy, and combined with my inactivity regarding MOTD, I've speedily-resigned. As you can see, I "signed up" (or was it elected? I can't remember) during August, when I was a <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">very new editor</a>. Although MOTD is good, the current system of "overseers" isn't, and I don't have any brainwaves currently on how to fix it.</dd>
<dd>I think that there will be an overwhelming concensus here to remove the "overseers" <i>per se</i>, and replace it with a better system where everyone is equal (and no, <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Farm_e7d2.html" title="Animal Farm">none will be more equal than others</a>. As I said, MOTD is a good concept, and it should be reformed instead of being <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMFD_9ce3.html" title="WP:MFD">dished into hell</a> for being heirachal. Again, I'd just like to repeat I'm totally and utterly against this kind of, in my opinion, destructive structure which promotes the idea that some users' opinions are worth infinitely more than others - within reason it is appropriate, eg admins to trolls, but having it spelled out and definitive in such a black-and-white fashion is not the Wiki way.

While I will not comment one way or another on this issue, I really think that the RFC went nowhere and no real solutions were brought up. I would suggest another firm RFC, out of InShaneee's control, so we can see what could happen. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 19:37, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Question, so simply giving a neutral notice and posting on the talk pages of all who had responded to the RfC, even those supporting InShaneee, and including InShaneee, would have been okay, or Hypnosadist would have had to wait until after posting an RfAr? I think it's an important distinction, particularly with the RfC closed prematurely, as it would have been a general venue to post a single notice rather than proceeding to post messages on individual talk pages. I don't see that InShaneee controlled the RfC outside of archiving it during the holidays.

I won't get involved in the RFAr, but I wish for no sanctions to be placed on Hypnosadist for this, since he was going to have to do it anyways due to ArbCom procedures. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 19:50, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Response to KP Botany: essentially, yes. If Hypnosadist had contacted <i>everybody</i> who commented on InShaneee's RfC and noted that he was adding additional information to that RfC and inviting participants to consider it, that would have been fine. The problem here was twofold: first, the apparent selection of only those likely to be anti; second, the tone of the message, which was essentially "let's all get together to get InShaneee desysopped". Posting a single comment inviting participation, in neutral terms, to <i>all</i> existing participants in a process, is not usually viewed as problematic, although it may depend on the circumstances. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 20:05, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Excuse me, Ahwaz, why did you delete my post? I'll assume it was by accident, which I've done before. Ironic, but now you know how to do it in the future, and, as Zscout370 points out administrators had notice beforehand about what you intended to do, and the tone you would take, and no one bothered to stop you before you did it. So, it appears it's not a well-understood or well-known or well-respected or .... policy, and it's not like you did it on the sly. In general, though, being mellow about the situation will make it easier for everyone, potentially gain you more supporters and clearly deliniate between you and the person you are complaining about, not just on Wikipedia, but in all situations. So, in the future be neutral and invite everyone to the party, but, yes, oh the irony of it all.

<dd>As you'll see from Hypnosadist's Talk, I went there and told him that he had done wrong, and pointed out why, and did so in terms which assumed good faith (ignorance is a defence on Wikipedia). I went out of my way to assume that this was a one-off based on not knowing it's wrong. Sadly Hypnosadist chose to bluster and escalate rather than ask for clarification. "You can't do that!" tends not to work with the better-known and more active admins, because generally we are doing it precisely because we <i>can</i> - and usually <i>should</i> - do that. We are the <a href="../../../r/o/u/WP%7EROUGE_ace2.html" title="WP:ROUGE">rouge admin cabal</a> and our anthem is "We Will Block You" but only if you persist after your errors have been pointed out. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:31, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>(unindent) Also, as I posted above, it's best to wait to leave notes on the RfC commenters pages until an RfAr has been filed. Otherwise it's like you're plotting to overthrow someone, which shouldn't be your intention. Your intention should be to tell your side of the story, let everyone else tell theirs as well, and then allow the ArbCom to come to the appropriate conclusion(s). —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 20:39, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just to sum up, InShaneee gets given a clean slate after so many examples of uncivil and over-the-top actions that breach Wikipedia guidelines and he is let off the hook without so much as a warning. Hypnosadist, who was insulted by InShaneee, feels this doesn't adequately address his or others' concerns about this admin and wants to take it further, asking other editors suffering similar grievances to outline their complaints ahead of arbitration. In response, admins come down on him like a tonne of bricks for allegedly spamming users' talk pages (although those users have not complained). This is about admins covering each others' backs, not an even application of policy. This strengthens Hypnosadist's case for taking the problem to a higher level.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 22:02, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Except that the admin's are not coming down on him for spamming folks pages. If he had contacted ALL members of the RfC, then there would have been no repercussions. Instead, he selectively chooses those who would be the most sympathetic to his cause . That's not allowed. Please read the notes earlier in the case, and try to assume good faith of their legitimate issues. Comments like "This is about admins covering each others' backs" do nothing to help your cause. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirFozzie_a2f2.html" title="User:SirFozzie">SirFozzie</a> 23:18, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wrong Sir Fozzie i was accused of as the title suggests <b>MASS</b> posting and now you say i did not post enough when it turns out what i was doing was not spam.

<dd>Apparently you are seeing parts of this discussion and not others. Several folks (admin, and not-admin alike, including myself) have agreed that the mass discussion you were doing was ok in theory.. EXCEPT: A) you were only letting people know that already agreed with you, when to be fair, you are supposed to let all sides know that you are adding more information to the RfC, and inviting comment, and B)You did not do so in a neutral manner. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirFozzie_a2f2.html" title="User:SirFozzie">SirFozzie</a> 23:47, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hypnosadist, I have explained <i><b>MULTIPLE</b></i> times the correct procedure for the future, and have explained exactly what policies you did not follow. You were not blocked, you are not being attacked, you are not being hindered in any way. Please acknowledge this and move on. Thank you. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 23:46, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for the information Bbatsell i understand the correct proceedure, that from now i should go to arb com then tell inshaneee that i've done it <b>then</b> try to get the evidence for my case. I am being attacked as this tread is about how i'm wrong while i'm trying to get justice for how me and many other people have been treat by inshaneee. I've been hinderd by having my messages deleted on talk pages, i deliberately did not post loads of messages just so i would not be accused of spamming and then i am accused of doing that because of how few messages i posted. I am really having difficulty with this.<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 00:15, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This thread is not about your attempts to get "justice". That's not the issue at hand here. There are other places for that. Like the RFC you have filed. You didn't follow WP proceedure in your canvassing. Period. Accept that and move on. No one is having a big black mark against their name. No one is getting blocked, banned, etcetera. The only thing you are doing is prejuducing people AGAINST your case, with your constant complaints about how you're being treated unfairly, despite SEVERAL people trying to explain what you did incorrectly so we can all move on. Now, PLEASE, take the advice you are given and move on. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirFozzie_a2f2.html" title="User:SirFozzie">SirFozzie</a> 00:22, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have not filed an RfC ever! Given that you have that fact wrong could you relook at this case!<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 00:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This seems to be the confusion "If Hypnosadist had contacted everybody who commented on InShaneee's RfC and noted that he was adding additional information to that RfC and inviting participants to consider it, that would have been fine". I'm not doing anything to do with an RfC, the one A Link with the past started died with nothing happening. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 00:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is because a RfC cannot hand out disciplinary measures. You need an arbitration to do that. BTW, I have reviewed the information. It makes things worse AGAINST you, not for you. You are actively soliciting those who agree with you to file a case against the admin (who even I agree has not been lily white in this whole issue). You are/were attempting "Trial by Ambush" here, (please don't attempt to tell me different, telling folks that you are messaging them only because they supported your case in the RFC as in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Newyorkbrad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99348450#Inshaneee|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Newyorkbrad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99348450#Inshaneee|here" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>] . Just end this farce, Stop claiming you're being persecuted in here, and get on with the Arbitration (then let EVERYONE involved know, not just those on your side). ~~
<dl>
<dd>Actually Hypnosadist I did add the note that you had explained what you were going to do before you did it in two notes (as Zscout pointed out) and that folks/admins could have asked you not to <i>before</i> you did what you did, and I pointed out that you didn't try to hide it or anything. Still, this is, imo, the kind of thing that happens when people "in power" abuse it or are perceived to abuse it, it builds up bad feelings, the kind that don't readily go away. That's why I also urge you to take a cool step back to deal with this. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 01:00, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is comforting to know that you must stoop to the level of personally attacking new users and wrongly accusing new users of sockpuppeting because you dont want a verifiable source (which they added) to remain in a article. theres no threat on my part--and the only personal attacks have came from you.</dd>

<dd>It should be noted that the "verifiable source" is largely unverifiable original research carried out by JB196, a link to which has been inserted on a constant basis by JB196 and all his socks. The claim of a personal attack refers to me stating <i>Common sense says that screenshots can easily be doctored or manipulated, so they are not reliable</i>, which is clearly not a personal attack.

<p>The reporter is a dumbass: even on top of the Facebuster page it states that if a move incorporates a headlock it isn't a Facebuster at all, but a DDT or Bulldog. The move is because one of the moves listed is really a DDT. I've been trying to repair HIS vandalist shit ever since making the correction to shitopedia's inaccuracy.</p>

Recent notifications concerning the NLP article have covered promotional obscuring of views (suppression of information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Information_suppression" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Information_suppression" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>) and users of a known COI editing the article To be found under "Comaze" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive160" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive160" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> Under "NLP article specific examples of promotional obscuring of facts and relevant views" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive164" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive164" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. An admin has already civilly explained the situation to those above editors <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJzG&amp;diff=95099314&amp;oldid=95097095" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJzG&amp;diff=95099314&amp;oldid=95097095" rel="nofollow">[22]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJzG&amp;diff=95698569&amp;oldid=95698364" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJzG&amp;diff=95698569&amp;oldid=95698364" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. Also Cleanup taskforce has asked for a serious cleanup of the article - including reducing redundancy and making the debate more concise and contained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup_Taskforce/Neuro-linguistic_programming" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup_Taskforce/Neuro-linguistic_programming" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. Efforts to balance views emphasizing the concept <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Information_suppression" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Information_suppression" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> seem to be getting ignored -</p>
<p>"It is important that the various views and the subject as a whole are presented in a balanced manner and that each is summarized as if by its proponents to its best ability. This is because neutrality requires much more than simply citing verifiable sources or proving a point -- it requires using credible sources to accurately represent a broad range of views and a balanced overview."</p>
<p>Some editors have been persistently trying to suppress core information from the opening and these tend to be the ones reluctant to get along with those of a different view <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=97917686&amp;oldid=97895410" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=97917686&amp;oldid=97895410" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=97329516&amp;oldid=97328145" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=97329516&amp;oldid=97328145" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=97115759&amp;oldid=97104878" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=97115759&amp;oldid=97104878" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=96898433&amp;oldid=96896526" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=96898433&amp;oldid=96896526" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=96510976&amp;oldid=96506627" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=96510976&amp;oldid=96506627" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=96230293&amp;oldid=96222804" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=96230293&amp;oldid=96222804" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=95682972&amp;oldid=95676846" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=95682972&amp;oldid=95676846" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=95501855&amp;oldid=95501825" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=95501855&amp;oldid=95501825" rel="nofollow">[33]</a></p>

<p>There is still a misuse of argumentative words to avoid. There is no need at all for the argumentative or debate word "however" in the line yet they insist. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98349049&amp;oldid=98346912" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98349049&amp;oldid=98346912" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98582748&amp;oldid=98564066" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98582748&amp;oldid=98564066" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. Their behaviour seems to me to be highly unconstructive considering the assessment of the CleanupTaskforce.</p>
<p>Editors have been ignoring efforts to make the article more concise (without obscuring views), by physically distancing the discussion on the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98197940&amp;oldid=98161860" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98197940&amp;oldid=98161860" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>- and by removing it completely from discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98590145&amp;oldid=98564468" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98590145&amp;oldid=98564468" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>.</p>
<p>There is some evidence of editors with known COI making odd edits on other articles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psychology&amp;diff=97716087&amp;oldid=97556581" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psychology&amp;diff=97716087&amp;oldid=97556581" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>.</p>
<p>On the positive side - there are fewer edits per day (usually less than 40). A lot of the problem was caused by the plus 50 eds per day which has led to an oversized article. The CleanupTaskforce has given helpful instructions to make the article more concise and to clarify what NLP is about. I don't see any particular problem long term and I'm fairly sure editors will come round to the idea that editors of different views are supposed to try to get along. Once they properly discuss the suppression of information policy I'm sure a win-win can be achieved. Trolling - sockuppetry - and meatpuppetry don't seem to me to be an issue. I believe the main point is to encourage editors of various views to work together collaboratively and civilly in the long term. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 07:06, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello user 58.178.142.37. The editors you mention all seem to be keen on obscuring key views or at the very least they are all reluctant to make clear concise statements of each view. I've provided edits and discussion recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;curid=739665&amp;diff=98607895&amp;oldid=98599437" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;curid=739665&amp;diff=98607895&amp;oldid=98599437" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> and on multiple prior occasions and encouraged discussion concerning getting along and making sure that each view is concisely summarized to the best of each view. Rather than discussing or adjusting my edits - others have tried to either marginalize the discussion or in your case - delete my edits altogether without discussion on a regular basis - call me a troll with venom - and restore argumentative debate into the article. I believe that most would see your actions as unreasonable. I havn't tried to cut away - reduce- or obscure any of the sourced NLP views. You and others seem to have obscured the views of science either by removing them from the lead - reduce them so they become obscure - add undue argument - or cover them with nonrelevant information. All the article needs is to present the subject of NLP with each view summarized so that it becomes clear to the reader. This can all be done without excess size and it can be done civilly. This is not a content disagreement. Its about COI - obscuring key views - getting along- and a simple enough NPOV solution. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 08:49, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It has been asserted by others that AlanBarnett is HeadleyDown. I would not like to call that, since at least some of the motivation for the assertion seems to be that he is pushing the scientific mainstream view of NLP in that article. Previously the article was under mediation; maybe it needs to be again. My understanding is that HeadleyDown was less calm and less polite than AlanBarnett. I have no personal knowledge of HeadleyDown, though. There is abundant evidence of conflict of interest in the pro-NLP camp, and they definitely dominate editing of that article. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:57, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your view that editors are partly motivated out of their POV is unfounded and must necessarily be based on not having read the NLP talk page.

<dd>Hi user 58.179.166.57. I am cooperatively posting notices on ANI to solve a problem. I never said I communicated with Guy privately - only that I am keen on cooperating with admin. There have been over 80 edits on the NLP article per day at times and with no sufficient discussion. There are editors on the article who seem to have a COI and you seem to be encouraging them to edit. I've reiterated admin suggestions and assessments and you call it harassment. You seem to be dismissing key NPOV points about keeping the article summarized and you've been regularly marginalizing key science views as can be seen in the links above. When I make reasonable suggestions towards making sure all relevant views are presented as best as the proponent of each view can - you delete the suggestion. When helpful editors restore the suggestion you delete again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98616799&amp;oldid=98616296" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98616799&amp;oldid=98616296" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>. You and others seem to be refusing to balance views and refusing to make succinct concise statements about each view. I am talking about getting along. If you would like to start civilly discussing the Suppression of Information policy on the NLP talkpage I'm sure admin would be happy that editors of different views are trying to get along. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 03:40, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi 58.179.166.57. Editors who have not shown a reluctance to presenting all views clearly seem to be reverting you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98616296&amp;oldid=98616234" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98616296&amp;oldid=98616234" rel="nofollow">[67]</a> (Editor MER-C at least).

<dd>Hi again; Just to help get the ball rolling towards collaborative editing and discussion - I'd like to present this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98819910&amp;oldid=98798503" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98819910&amp;oldid=98798503" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> for discussion on the NLP talkpage. Rather than just delete such a large piece of unsourced argumentative commentary - it seems more constructive to see if there is anything of any value in it by discussing with other editors.

<p>Guy. You are being naive. Just because AlanBarnet says he's presenting mainstream scientific views and preventing them being obscured by others doesn't make it true. AlanBarnet has done virtually none of the work in sourcing, verifying and citing the mainstream scientific views which now have a full clear section. I know because I did alot of it myself in collaboration with other editors, including Comaze, but almost never AlanBarnet. He has no real interest in ascertaining genuine views from genuine sources, whether they're pro or anti NLP. Neither is he remotely interested in helping shorten, improve or clarify anything else. Mostly what AlanBarnet does is revert to older inaccurate versions without bothering to clear up the mess created with references, citations etc, put inaccurate or highly selective quotes in the introduction (over and over again), put in grossly POV statements, unverified and unsourced and refuse to provide verified sources on request, and then clutter up the talk page insultingly accusing everybody else of doing these things.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96222128" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96222128" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> (note inadequate edit summary)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96235245" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96235245" rel="nofollow">[70]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96235681" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96235681" rel="nofollow">[71]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96238159" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96238159" rel="nofollow">[72]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96256383" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96256383" rel="nofollow">[73]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96260083" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96260083" rel="nofollow">[74]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96260516" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96260516" rel="nofollow">[75]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96261831" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96261831" rel="nofollow">[76]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96305729" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96305729" rel="nofollow">[77]</a> If you believe any of that nonsense about wanting to collaborate or work constructively with others then you are the only one who does.

I also asked you some time ago that if you had any decent sources to back up your claim that it is a 'fact' NLP is a cult, to let us have them, because nearly all of the ones from the HeadleyDown/AlanBarnet camp, when somebody troubles to actually read the blasted things, don't support this.

<p>JzG/Guy. There is no pro-NLP camp. Firstly Fainites and 58.* tend to be on the side of skepticsm and scientific rigor. As far as I know they have no prior knowledge or personal experience in studying NLP. They are basing their edits on what is in the reputable / verifiable literature. It is a complex topic because there are so many different views with no black and white mainstream view. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComaze_7cd3.html" title="User:Comaze">Comaze</a> 14:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Users Comaze and Fainites. Rather than repeatedly and dismissively delete the concise view of science from the lead section - you could discuss why you feel it does not quite capture the full view of science and we could go on with improving it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;curid=67147&amp;diff=99027162&amp;oldid=98945871" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;curid=67147&amp;diff=99027162&amp;oldid=98945871" rel="nofollow">[78]</a>.

Might I invite anybody reading this to go to the NLP article and read in particular the sections on Mental Health practice and Research Reviews and then state whether they think there is 'promotional obscuring of scientific views' as alleged (ad nauseam).<a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFainites_e96a.html" title="User:Fainites">Fainites</a> 16:53, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure Fainites. This Information Suppression policy is helpful: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Information_suppression" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Information_suppression" rel="nofollow">[81]</a>. "It is important that the various views and the subject as a whole are presented in a balanced manner and that each is summarized as if by its proponents to its best ability. This is because neutrality requires much more than simply citing verifiable sources or proving a point -- it requires using credible sources to accurately represent a broad range of views and a balanced overview.". As shown above - you (and Comaze and 58 and others) have removed clear succinct summaries of the critical view from the lead section. The whole article can easily be improved with reasonable following of that Suppression of Information link. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 01:56, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi again. User 58.178.199.92 seems to think I'm sockpuppeting - trolling and wikilawyering, removes my discussion and states "we're still waiting for a block on AlanBarnet" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=99276773&amp;oldid=99229492" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=99276773&amp;oldid=99229492" rel="nofollow">[86]</a>.

<p>Guy. The only person about whom there is even a COI allegation is Comaze (from AlanBarnet only). Can one editor be a 'camp'? Who else <i>precisely</i> are you including in the 'they' of the 'pro-NLP camp' who supposedly dominate the article and about whom there is apparently abundant evidence? Do we get to see this 'abundant evidence'?<a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFainites_e96a.html" title="User:Fainites">Fainites</a> 21:10, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi all. I presented this (below) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;curid=739665&amp;diff=99522691&amp;oldid=99522341" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;curid=739665&amp;diff=99522691&amp;oldid=99522341" rel="nofollow">[88]</a> on the NLP talkpage in order to sort the NLP article out as per NPOV and neutral wording. I am adding it here so admin can get a chance to add suggestions and some editors seem reluctant to countenance the finer points of NPOV policy so it may well get deleted or dismissed from the talkpage:</p>
<p>Hi all. Further to outside/authority assessments from the ANI and Cleanuptaskforce: Again here is a back to basics solution: The NPOV tutorial: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial" rel="nofollow">[89]</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The suggestion from ANI is that there tends to be too much promotional obscuring of science views.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Cleanup taskforce looks at this from the view that editors are putting criticism diffusively all over the place and then defending it as if it is some sort of debate – thus obscuring lots of views and never really getting round to saying what NLP is or does.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Writing what NLP is should be done in as neutral language as possible without adding any pro or con argument directly to it. Straight reporting of what NLP is and does on terms that a reader will understand – without promotional language – without confounding jargon – and without any unattributed promotional claims such as “Modeling' another person can effect belief and behavior changes to improve functioning” or defensive statements such as “Neuro-linguistic Programming is an eclectic field, and”…. Sentences should be written in neutral language with proper attributions of who says what (eg scientist (name date) says…. or NLP author (name date) says…..</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize information according to the most reliable sources. Prioritizing will help reduce the overload and help editors in choosing what to include or exclude and to determine weight. We need to look at how the most reliable sources describe what NLP is and does - and what NLP proponents do with NLP specifically. The most concise and clear descriptions will make the article encyclopedic and accessible to the reader.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regarding controversies: The NPOV solution is to summarize each view “as if by its proponents to their best ability” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial" rel="nofollow">[90]</a>. This can be done throughout – or if it disturbs flow (which right now it seems to) – it can be confined into sections.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We can practically negotiate weight and neutrality using the evidence we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial" rel="nofollow">[91]</a>. Part of the reason for problems with the article is that too much evidence has been added to the article through exessive daily edits - when it should have just been placed in the talk page and properly discussed before summarizing each view “as if by its proponents to their best ability”.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There has been a problem with un-neutral language in the article at times (for example - argumentative howevers and nonsequiturs). Again – the NPOV tutorial and WP words to avoid are useful guides</li>
</ul>
<p>So – feel free to discuss any of these points. Constructive suggestions are welcome. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 08:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hello, I'm a friendly admin. How may I be of assistance? Oh, right, this "Hari Aranth" nonsense. Yes, there's something to JuJube's complaint. First, though, a note on the <i>specific</i> complaints. The particular comment that was deleted was my own; I later restored it and I gave the perp a one-hour vacation from WP (no, not as a punishment; because he really was wasting an awful lot of time). The "racial attack" is not something I'd term a racial attack. Yes, it could be read that way if one were very earnest about these things; and no, it shouldn't have been written; but let's not aggrandize these matters. (Believe me, I have seen things on WP that I would call racial attacks. They're different.) Now for the larger matter of the AfD and the article on which there's an AfD. I'm pretty sure that either (i) this is a complete hoax, or (ii) this is a very insignificant but genuine actor around whom a hoax is being made. Either way, it seems speediable. I'd speedy it myself, but for the fear that somebody might say I did this out of spite, what with my user page having been vandalized by the original author, etc. So I'm holding off. Incidentally, I notice that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Madndndrumr711_74a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Madndndrumr711">this other contributor</a> to the dodgy article has created another ho-hum <i>Borat</i>-related article, Ashwin Betrabet, which at this point looks as if it's complete rubbish but may for all I know be well-intentioned; shortage of time and energy prevents me from investigating. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:33, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Until we actually come together and have some sort of a large discussion on this and agree that process <i>is</i> important, it should be tagged as an essay.

<p>Ericsaindon2 continues to edit under various IPs and sockpuppets. While it certainly isn't the daily edit war that occured during his prime, a look at the page history shows that we still continue to deal with his disruptions [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anaheim_Hills%2C_Anaheim%2C_California&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anaheim_Hills%2C_Anaheim%2C_California&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[96]</a>]. The bulk of the articles discussion page focuses on attempts by other editors to remove his original research [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anaheim_Hills%2C_Anaheim%2C_California" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anaheim_Hills%2C_Anaheim%2C_California" rel="nofollow">[97]</a>]. This blocked editor shows no attempt to work within the quidelines of the encyclopedia. He is unrepentant and will continue to disrupt Wikipedia until his original research is included.</p>
<p>I'm here proposing an indefinite community ban of Ericsaindon2, and I'd appreciate a review by any administrators. He's more than exhausted the patience of those who have had to deal with him. <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAniMate_73bc.html" title="User:AniMate">AniMate</a> 01:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This situation is regrettable, but I'm not sure what more administrators could do here. As you indicate, the one-year ban keeps being reset after each evasion, so unless he walks away for a year it will never expire and is effectively indefinite already. Other than watching the articles and reerting the edits, or maybe asking for a checkuser and seeing if there's a safe rangeblock, what else is there to do? <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:58, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, I think we can certainly call our patience exhausted. I've extended the block to indefinite. Frankly I think it's ridiculous to extend any block more than three times before making it indefinite. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 02:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As for the block evasion, looking at the pages' recent history he seems to be only using one IP a day (rather than switching every edit, as some evaders do). If he continues in that way we can just block the IPs when they appear. If he does start rolling the IPs to continually evade blocking, but it's just <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaheim_Hills_14a8.html" title="Anaheim Hills">Anaheim Hills</a> he attacks, we can semi-protect the article. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 02:11, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Yes, again. An anon is back adding the claim that the subject was a councillor - the subject himself has removed this information from the article (a while back when he was removing a variety of false or partially false information), and as there is not a single page that mentions the the councillor and the subject of the article (a radio host) as one, I believe this is definitely false.</p>
<p>This has all been gone through before, but still, every single time this anon appears and starts reverting, 3RR dictates that I need to ask someone else to revert as I may be the only regular user watching the article.</p>
<p>I'm honestly tempted to simply starting to block and revert given a) the anon's persistent refusal to follow Wikipedia policy, b) blatant non-sequitur arguments and refusal to address stuff like the subject denying it, c) the anon's recent appearance coinciding with that of a small sock farm adding the same stuff. As it is I'm merely <i>very</i> close to doing it. The hell is it with British radio biographies? --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 02:03, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as I can tell, different Mike Mendoza. Loads of articles on the councillor exist, like that one, as do articles on the radio DJ - but none that I've seen that mention both as the same person, none that would convince me that the subject is lying. Mendoza may sound like an odd name to non-Hispanics (it did to me) but it seems to actually be a common surname. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 02:23, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>(undent) Good luck. The website for the current council has pictures, I believe, but when I used archive.org to look for an older picture ("Mendoza" is no longer a councilor), I discovered the page of pictures - and, oddly, if I remember correctly, <i>only</i> that page - had been excluded via robots.txt. Or maybe I did something incorrectly. Comparative pictures or even middle names might help resolve this. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 18:07, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most of the images are on the Commons, so there is little to what many Admins can do here. With me being an admin on the Commons and here, I could try and help you out.

<p>I am an editor of Wikipedia, a multilingual project to create a complete and accurate encyclopedia by open editing. We gather information from all types of sources, but the web sites of government bodies, institutes of higher learning, and other non-profit organizations are often particularly useful. The English-language version may be viewed on the Web at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/</a>. As a unique and highly visible project, we freely and publicly release our work, that it may benefit mankind. To this end, we deeply respect copyright, and are careful to prevent any infringement.</p>

<dd>Don't get me wrong. I'm not against examining the licenses. The correct procedure if one suspects the validity of the licese is to use the pd-dispued whicle keeping the existing license. This user simply removes the licese and replaces them with the no license tag. That is incorrect.

<dd>Morwen and others, I have no axe to grind against anyone. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">User:Venu62</a> just seems to want to draw your attention and sympathy to his cries, so he starts the same issue again and again here. Coming to the issue, I said he cannot cite his personal emails as verifiable license here. I dont think I was wrong there. His reverts like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Wallajah2.jpg&amp;diff=99685440&amp;oldid=99683547" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Wallajah2.jpg&amp;diff=99685440&amp;oldid=99683547" rel="nofollow">[109]</a> make little sense. He thinks he can revert whenever and whatever he feels like. He also gives me bogus warnings like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Srkris&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99686057" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Srkris&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99686057" rel="nofollow">[110]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Srkris&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99688176" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Srkris&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99688176" rel="nofollow">[111]</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Srkris&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99691783" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Srkris&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99691783" rel="nofollow">[112]</a>.

<dd>It's not vandalism to remove warnings from one's talk page - this is a matter for hot debate every now-and-then. It is, however, frowned upon.</dd>
<dd>The content that the IP replaced it with is explicitly prohibited per <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a>. That's what justifies the protection. Generally, users who make legal threats on Wikipedia are blocked indefinitely (see <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>); IP's are rarely blocked indefinitely, however, as they can be reassigned or shared.

He overreacted, fine, but calling him immature, calling for the disbandment of the Project, and revert warring on the Project page is taking it too far. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 10:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And that's when the closing admin should use his or her brain and only consider those "votes" which contain arguments built off policy and guidelines. Refactoring away the mindless votes is a good place to start, then building off the arguments, the admin should use reason to make a decision. Informing people, perhaps experts, on the subject of the article in question of the AfD would help gather input from persons who KNOW about the article, rather than basing the decision off of those who merely scan or less the article before placing their two cents in. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 18:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nice stereotyping. This shows you know absolutely nothing about Gundam or anime fandom in Japan.

(Refactor: I don't intend this to slight or attack you, it is just my experience that the average person in the US does not have any clue what sort of impact anime, manga and its related materials have on Japan as a whole and judge Japan based on their US/Western European Culture-centric view of anime geeks.) <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 19:02, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Whoa, whoa, BACK UP. Kyaa, did you just accuse me of wikistalking? I see something that looks very much like vandalism. I warn the guy. I check his contribs, I see he's not a vandal only account, he's done some contributing, I try to find out why, I find a PERSONAL ATTACK on WP:GUNDAM, and I report that, then I go to vote on AfD's (one of which I voted on before this all began), and you call that WIKISTALKING? Apologize. Either that, or stop saying everyone else is not following AGF and "whining" about civility. I, for one, agree with Zoe. I'm sick of project owning articles. I'm really insulted by the fact that if I try to fix something I'm stalking, but if you dismiss everyone who isn't a huge Gundam fan by saying their vote on AfD is worthless because they only "scan" the article, you're being helpful?

<p>Good man - ok, there are a lot of issues in here - I really think that everyone needs to step back and take a deep breath. This "gundam" issue has popped up on a number of boards and has gone beyond this individual editor and I'm seeing editors "digging" at each other (and I hold my hands up here as well) in a number of places. It's pretty silly to let it develop into a them/us issue - we are wikipedians first and foremost. Many of those articles predate the Gundam project and it is a big job to clean them all up. On the other hand, I would suggest that the Gundam project looks at it's to-do list - removes the expand for the moment and concentrate solely on merging/editing and even AFDing articles that don't need to exist (and let's be honest there are lots of those). I am going to join the wikiproject as a "lay" member (to try and reduce some of the concerns about WP:OWN) and hopefully a couple of other people who are not interested in Gundam but are interested in developing an encyclopedia could pitch in.</p>

<dd>POINTish? No. Quite simply, these articles should be deleted. I stand by every one of those PROD nominations, nearly all of which were in fact valid speedy candidates as none of them actually asserted notability. To boot, all of them were unreferenced, and all of them were written from a non-real-world perspective. They failed <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, and probably <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> as well in a large majority of cases.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, editors are of course perfectly free to remove these PROD tags, but I will simply put all of the articles I tagged together in a mass AFD. I was very fair about what I did and did not nominate: where an article contained an assertion of notability or even a mention of <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_life.html" title="Real life">real life</a> - <b>because most of these articles did not, that bad</b> - I left the article untouched. I resent any suggestion that I disrupted Wikipedia just to prove a point.

<p>"Taunting"? It seems to me Moreschi was merely making a wry comment on the mass incivility on display at the WP:GUNDAM talk page. Not a pretty sight and not something it would be wise to draw administrators' attention to, I would have thought. As for the mass deletion, that's simply consistency. Most of those articles have the same problems conforming to WP policy.

<p>If I see a couple of poorly tagged images, I will hunt down through that user's history and see if there are more such instances.

An email that you get does not qualify as a source; the museum has to send the permission to permissions AT wikimedia.org. You'll get the OTRS ticket number, which will then count as a valid source.

The user is an apparant SPA that continually removes any reference to The Sword from the music articles and reverts the genre of the band away from the consensus, which is Doom Metal, to Hard Rock (which seems to be his and only his opinion) with no reason given, completely ignoring cited sources that state the genre is Doom Metal. Regardless of what myself or the other editors say on any of the articles talk pages, or the users talk page, they make no comments. If they were responding to attempts to communicate with them, I would have taken this to the mediation board, but since the user remains silent, I was unsure if this would even be effective, so I'm posting this request here. If an admin could either preside over this conflict, or point me in the direction of someone who can better help me, I'll be very thankful. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 14:48, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <i>thought</i> so! He was the user who started the revert war and stopped after being warned by 2 people, then the IP started warring.

<dd>I'd say it's an issue of "undue weight" rather than verifiability. The issue is that a local paper published that a star dated someone local. Well, that may or may not be true, but we don't care. She's single, popular, and not in a monastic order, so presumably she dates people. Unless there is something unusual or very important about this particular date (are they engaged to each other? engaged to someone else? expecting a child together? jumping up and down on Oprah's couch?), it's not worth a sentence in her article. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 16:05, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, that person's supposed to be a major sports star there, though his Wikipedia article smacks of hyperbole even after an NPOV purge, but...

<dd>Even so - I'm sure she dates mostly reasonably rich and famous people, it's what famous people do. Unless there is something unusual about this one, it doesn't deserve mention. It's like her wearing clothes and eating food, we assume she does it. Now a fashion magazine may write an article about her wearing such-and-such an outfit, or a restaurant may proudly post a photograph of her eating there, but unless it's somehow notable, <i>we don't care</i>. If she left a husband or a monastic order to date this guy, yes, it would be notable. If he's just another out of dozens, so what? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 16:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<p><a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivana_Mili%C4%8Devi%C4%87_02fd.html" title="Ivana Miličević">Ivana Miličević</a> has been semi-protected for over a month now.

<dd>Will do... I never noticed there was an unprotection sub page. Of course I've noticed now it is called out in the banner at the top. Ugh. I need to get some sleep.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:16, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
