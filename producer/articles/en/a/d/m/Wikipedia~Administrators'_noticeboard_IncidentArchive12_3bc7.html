<p>A <a href="../../../r/o/v/User%7ERovoam_02c5.html" title="User:Rovoam">User:Rovoam</a>, apparently as a result of a content dispute (which I think has boiled over into arbitration) is replacing the entire contents fo the talk page with his preferred version of the article. Needless to say, this is both a misuse of the talk page and hopelessly confusing (i.e., you think you're going to a talk page....but it looks just like an article). I have a self-imposed one-revert rule that I try not to violate even in a case like this, which I see as borderline vandalism. I also, as a mediator, have tried to help both users in this dispute, and don't want to appear biased. Will someone give this a look and take whatever action is appropriate? Don't go vigilante if you can help it--I haven't yet posted a warning to Rovoam's talk page, and I imagine a warning should be posted before anything more drastic than a revert. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 23:22, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to update anyone interested, Rovoam has returned multiple times over the last hour or so -- Dan and I have been blocking and reverting at a slow and steady pace. At this point, there are a few range blocks that Dan has applied (I'm not savvy enough to apply them, and therefore I avoided doing so) after it was clear that Rovoam could pull a new IP number at relatively high speed. A calm appears to be settling in now, but I'd anticipate another firestorm tomorrow at this time when the range blocks expire. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 00:56, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rovoam's real account should be blocked indefinitely. He's descended into belligerent vandalism, using Netzero dialups and open proxies to vandalize articles, talk pages and user pages. This should go into the arbitration evidence for good measure. I think the range blocks may be too long however. 24 hours is too long to block huge chunks of NetZero's IP space. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 01:45, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This morning I removed the Rovoam block for now and reset the longest of the two blocks on 66.whatever ranges to expire about the same time as the other one--around 1300 GMT. See <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_Admin_log_3ee9.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway/Admin log">User:Tony Sidaway/Admin log</a>. I think we should adopt a firefighting posture with respect to Rovoam; arbcom will deal with him in due course and I don't think we should pre-empt that unless he starts to pose more than a very minor threat to a localized part of the Wiki. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:03, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I personally vow never to get into protection or blocking wars, so I won't fight you on this Tony, but I don't think that someone before the ArbCom has the right to spam Wikipedia with his version of an article as a result. As I recall, he was vandalizing your userpage, and the pages of others, as well as multiple talk pages and articles. That's not acceptable, regardless of how "localized" the articles may be, and it's not "minor" in my book. I agree that Rovoam has the right to a defense, but at some point the line must be drawn. But since it was your userpage and not mine being targeted, I'll assume you know more about this situation than I do. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 23:58, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also would never get into a sysop war. I released the one week block but would not again unblock that user in the current situation. My attitude to this kind of vandalism is that it's not likely to escalate, and frankly I can live with a user page covered in maps of Nagorno-Karabakh for a few days if that makes Rovoam feel more comfortable. Rovoam's actions now are a reaction, obviously an overreaction, to my protecting of "<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="extiw" title="m:The_Wrong_Version">The Wrong Version</a>" on at least two occasions and an earlier instance in which I removed from <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a> a good faith 3RR report he had made because the span of the timestamps was well outside 24 hours. The fact that I show up a couple of weeks later basically writing Tabib's evidence for him has made Rovoam understandably upset. There are two sides to every story. Rovoam's behavior has not been pristine, but I could probably have been a little more tactful. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 01:34, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if an edit war breaks out, I would probably apply protection to the pages (I'm big on this now, because of all the hassles you get with 3RR blocking - "yes it was a complex revert, no it was an edit", etc, etc.).

<p>Trey Stone has been evading his 24 hour block by using a "sockpuppet" called User:De-Chomskidize. Apparently this is nothing new. Upon going through his user contributions history earlier today, I found out that he has a long history of doing this. (A similar account was User:Chomskoid.) I don't see how it will be possible to reach a compromise with this editor if he can use sockpuppets every time he gets himself blocked and then continue to revert. If blocks do not moderate his behavior, what's the best alternative mechanism for dealing with editors like this? <a href="../../../w/e/b/User%7EWebLuis_4c5e.html" title="User:WebLuis">WebLuis</a> 02:56, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>After I'd made the section report, Trey Stone continued making unexplained reversions with a "sockpuppet" while blocked and personal attacks, now on the talk page. If he is not going to honor his block and the norms of civility on this website, he will be able to start turning all these articles into his personal property. <a href="../../../w/e/b/User%7EWebLuis_4c5e.html" title="User:WebLuis">WebLuis</a> 05:10, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

One of the vandals, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_5000_81ab.html" title="User:David 5000">User:David 5000</a>, has a shared account, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_5000_vs._Dmn_e4c7.html" title="User:David 5000 vs. Dmn">User:David 5000 vs. Dmn</a>. <a href="../../../d/m/n/User%7EDmn_b398.html" title="User:Dmn">User:Dmn</a> admits to this account's existence on his userpage, and furthermore unblocked David 5000.</p>
<p>For added fun, another user in the vandal group, <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasmic_Squonka%21_4cec.html" title="User:Plasmic Squonka!">User:Plasmic Squonka!</a> made edits to Daniel Nazarian. Investigation showed Daniel Nazarian to in fact be a Cambridge student (Along with the rest of this group). Also, to not be a German aristocrat, as far as anyone can tell. Troublingly, the article asserts that he is usually known as DM Nazarian. This is close enough to Dmn to raise eyebrows, if nothing else. That Dmn also unblocked his friend with whom he shares an account over vandalism there is non-trivial reason to think he was at least peripherally involved in is troublesome enough that I wanted to post it here to get some opinions on it. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 16:13, Mar 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I asked Dmn if he was Daniel M Nazarian on his talk page, and he replaced my usage of that name with "*********", so it's safe to assume he is in fact Daniel M Nazarian, and from the tone of his reply to me, it sounds like that article (Daniel Nazarian) of the same name was created by his friends to make fun of him.

<p>I finally figured out what happened at Daniel Nazarian (yes, I'm slow). The article was fake, was put up for VFD and consensus was to Delete, but it was never deleted. Then, User:Plasmic Squonka came along, found an article named after his friend <a href="../../../d/m/n/User%7EDmn_b398.html" title="User:Dmn">User:Dmn</a>, and added fake content to it.

I unblocked the user and urged him to defend himself on RfC (now that he could actually comment). I gave 3 reasons for unlocking him which are visible in the block log. I blanked my name on my talk page because I have a right to do see. I didn't do this secretly - I commented underneath that I had done this. The Daniel Nazarian article is what it is - a joke created by someone who knows me well (sadly I am no actor of merit).

<p><b>Comments:</b></p>
<p>Mikejm and a couple of anon accounts, who may be the same user (one has a very similar editing history) have been constantly adding "alleged" to Israel's nuclear weapons, and making similar "weasel words" changes. The clear consensus on talk seems to be that such words are not needed. Mikejm just added his changes for the fourth time in 24 hours, and I just reverted for the 4th time (I forgot to check that it was more than 24 hours since my 3rd previous revert), so feel free to block us both.</p>
<p>See Mikejm's comments about me on the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Talk%7EMordechai_Vanunu_736d.html" title="Talk:Mordechai Vanunu">talk:Mordechai Vanunu</a> page, and my comments to him on his talk page at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mikejm&amp;diff=11279675&amp;oldid=11279496" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mikejm&amp;diff=11279675&amp;oldid=11279496" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, since he's removed them from the page.</p>

<p><b>Rebuttal</b> You have provided no justification for your reverts nor contributed anything to the article other than to revert my edits. Your allegations of multiple accounts are false. You're trying to pin me on a technicality and now you violated the rule yourself.</p>

<p>Gadfium, Mike, I'm delighted to see you both making the effort to communicate here, but I fear that you're both involved in a rather sterile revert war. I would love to oblige by blocking you both for eighteen hours as of now (around 3am GMT) so that you can both try to work out alternative strategies, and perhaps reach an agreement on what belongs in the article and what does not. Please understand that I want to do this because I think you both sound like the kind of people who would use the period of the block wisely.</p>
<p>However (and I'm sorry to say, this is a bit of a killer) I cannot find any evidence that either of you has reverted more than three times in twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Sorry, but in the circumstances I can't oblige.</p>
<p>I'm stil shocked by the amount of revert warring you're both engaging in, but I am sorry, I cannot do anything about it in the way of blocking either of you unless you provide the requisite evidence. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 03:13, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comments:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Admins please note. I have not violated 3RR on any of these pages, though I have reverted a lot. They currently remain as his last version, and I request rollback be performed as well as a long block. I also ask that anyone who can co-sign an RFC contact me. I am unable because it requires two signatures, though the case is obvious. This user makes no productive edits, just reverts of these specific templates, and has shown no sign of stopping, even after a previous block. Please send a message. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 07:05, 2005 Mar 20 (UTC)</li>

<dd>He's also tagging everything as a minor change, and leaving no edit summary. I furthermore see that he's going all over, and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anthony_DiPierro_c638.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anthony DiPierro">removing</a> his posts from many different talk pages.

<dd>The minor changes are a quirk of how he licenses - his minor changes are public domain, and so he uses minor change differently from most people. As for the rest, in this case, I'm inclined to give it a pass, because there's an arbcom ruling that's one vote away from passing that would remove his ability to edit any plages in the Wikipedia namespace, and it's currently unclear whether this limits talk pages. To this end, he's trying to remove opinions and votes that he can no longer meaningfully change his mind on. That said, I'd prefer he strike out instead of remove. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 16:03, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly. If he wants to strike out his votes, that's fine. But he's doing a lot more than that, he's removing entire comments from the record, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies&amp;diff=11324776&amp;oldid=11322582" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies&amp;diff=11324776&amp;oldid=11322582" rel="nofollow">this deletion</a>. He's also removing timestamps from some comments, but leaving the comments - why, I can't imagine, unless he wants to make it harder to find where he added the comment in the history. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 16:16, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There has been a longstanding policy of maintaining history. We don't delete failed RFC's, for example. Not only is the removal of Anthony's comments making the replies of others nonsensical, but he's deleting his votes in polls, which will make future lookups of these historical articles meaningless, and people in the future will wonder how the votes were decided, if voters are allowed to remove their votes. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:31, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>people, I'm <i>this</i> far from starting a deletion war over it. please weigh in and keep me from doing something stupid. No matter how desperately <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">Autofellatio</a> needs "encyclopedic" illustration, this image is beginning to hold WP hostage: categorize it under similar instances where our open policies makes us indulgent to the point of utter stupidity. New users are greeted by porn on their talk pages. Schools will shun away from using WP. In some countries, people could even get into legal trouble over this image (yes, this is bordering on real-life harassment). It's serious, ok? This has got to stop. On the technical side, it would be useful to have a software feature that doesn't monitor a particular page, but the addition of a <i>link to</i> a particular page, to <i>any</i> page, so that we could react more quickly to linking to problematic images (I know it's not the only problematic image we have, but it's the worst case by a long long long way). Should I appeal to Jimbo or the board to finally rid us of this scourge? Am I getting worked up over a trifle? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 16:15, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>I do see your point: the very fact that the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">trolls</a> find this image so attractive suggests that the presence of the image itself may have more "con" aspects than it does "pro" aspects. The informational value of the image is questionable at best (one short sentence can describe what it illustrates), and I know at least one newcomer who was greeted by that image on their talk page and decided never to return because of it. Yes, I understand that this image has survived at least two recent votes for deletion, but I think we should put some <i>real thought</i> into considering the practical over the principle. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 16:26, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>(via edit conflict) I rather suspect the double-redirections to this image have been made <i>precisely</i> to get this reaction. Probably the best thing to do would be to beg the developers for a sockpuppet check, just in case whoever it is wasn't careful enough. (That said, I've been in favor of deleting the image from the start, and the idea of it showing up on new users' talk pages is the most upsetting one I've come across since I started editting here.) —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 16:29, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am very unhappy to have that image on my computer, and strongly support the speedy deletion of this image.

<dd>As far as I can tell, copyright issues were never answered. The image has no source material. The image is not encyclopedic, but is clearly from a porn site. The image is a source of vandalism. The image is not even regularly in use on the page it is supposed to be in use on. Delete away. The fact that Wikipedia is not censored for minors does not mean every bit of sexually explicit trash needs to be kept. It means that the sexual explicitness isn't the reason we delete. In this case, the reason we delete is the searing stupidity. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 16:54, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I deleted it once. It was re-uploaded within a day. VfD on grounds of copyvio issues, was even, I think 9:9. There is good reason to suspect copyvio, as the same actor was found posing in thumbnails (see <a href="../../../a/u/t/Talk%7EAutofellatio_Image_polls_and_discussions_ce87.html#Image_poll" title="Talk:Autofellatio/Image polls and discussions">Talk:Autofellatio/Image_polls_and_discussions#Image_poll</a>). Jimbo wanted it gone, but wants the community to resolve the issue (see <a href="../../../a/u/t/Talk%7EAutofellatio_Image_polls_and_discussions_ce87.html#Thus_spoke_Jimbo" title="Talk:Autofellatio/Image polls and discussions">Talk:Autofellatio/Image_polls_and_discussions#Thus_spoke_Jimbo</a>). Imho, the issues of copyvio and inappropriateness should be kept separate (but they do add up, of course). If we want this image gone, we'd have to replace it with the drawing on commons and protect. It will still be uploaded under other names, for some time, which we'd have to delete on sight. I do feel it is inappropriate for an admin to do this unilaterally. It will still be questionable for admins acting as a group, and I would want to put the case on VP or RfC. It seems <i>abundantly</i> clear to me that this image is harmful, however, that I'm willing to remove it as part of regular mop&amp;bucket duty, at least until there is some satisfactory compromise (there is no reason that it should be online <i>by default</i> while its case is under consideration. In my view, it should be <i>deleted</i> by default unless we have a strong (non sockpuppety) consensus to keep it in some form; btw, that's pretty much what Jimbo said, too <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAutofellatio&amp;diff=10213963&amp;oldid=10213426" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAutofellatio&amp;diff=10213963&amp;oldid=10213426" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 17:08, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>I completely sympathize with you. At present, the image is not "officially" used in any articles, and Jimbo is on record against using it. Any usage of the image in Wikipedia is apt to be vandalism, and maintaining the image simply facilitates vandalism. It should be removed forthwith. The last attempt to delete it via IFD on March 12 was summarily removed from <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a> before the vote was complete on the grounds that the image had been twice nominated before, even though those votes were quite sparse. Nobody seemed to protest this action. I think one might be able to get a two-thirds consensus to delete it, if nobody interfered with the vote and it were sufficiently publicized. But that would take time, and you would have to deal with people voting stupidly to keep it on the grounds that it had "survived" IFD already twice, and that removing it is "censorship", etc. Perhaps you should just appeal to Jimbo for a decision on this one. Or else just delete it and hope you are one of the super-administrators whose common sense will be blessed retroactively. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:19, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is at least one admin, <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a>, who is in favour of keeping it ("it's just a guy sucking his dick"; see exchange on my talk page. peace to Tony, he does seem to sincerely think the image is legitimate; he also announced his capability to resolve the copyright issues <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAutofellatio&amp;diff=11161926&amp;oldid=11161731" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAutofellatio&amp;diff=11161926&amp;oldid=11161731" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>...). Acting unilaterally would just mean entering a deletion/protection war. I am hoping for some consensus at least among admins. If we can agree that we'd want community consensus (the famous 80%) <i>in favour</i> of the image before we keep it, I'll happily delete away. "Cabal" accusations will then sound more hollow, since it will be evident that we are acting in good faith, out of the desire to protect users, and that we're open to a consensus in favour of the image, should the community really, <i>really</i> want to keep it. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 17:28, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

I suspect that others feel the same, judging by the strong reaction it has provoked. Now that the image has received a bit of publicity (for better or worse), and a few people have had the opportunity to give the idea some thought, maybe we can get more than 18 people to vote on it?

<p>Great. This was inevitable. First people fought hard to get the picture off the article page, and voting was done and the apparent decision was to make it a link from the article page instead of directly on the page. And now people want the picture taken down altogether. There were <i><b>many</b></i> people who voted to keep the image on the page, and even if we didn't win that vote, doesn't give anybody the right to say that the image should be removed altogether. Do we delete articles that are the subjects of repeated vandalism? No. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 20:20, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I initially didn't have a problem with the image existing on Wikipedia, but now, with copyright issues, and the fact it's only used for vandalism, I'd rather see it replaced with the drawing. It still illustrates the article, and in my opinion it's a lot less offensive. Hence, I've never seen it (edit: the drawing) used to commit vandalism. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:39, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>there is a difference of (a) being vandalised and (b) being used <i>for</i> vandalism. Obviously we don't delete articles that <i>are</i> vandalised. And honestly, I don't think people would be driven off WP for being redirected to <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">shock site</a> from their talk page. Many would be disgusted, however, by being redirected to an <i>actual</i> shock site. The difference between having articles on offensive content, and actually <i>hosting</i> offensive content is immense. I do not know of any precedent of a similarly offensive image being hosted on WP, so I wish people would stop pretending that it should be considered an image like any other, that deleting it would put us on the slippery slope of censorship, etc. etc.; I know the image is not "orphaned". It's linked to from it's article. It's <i>still</i> used for vandalism <i>primarily</i>, and I cringe at the thought of any new user being greeted by this image. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 20:52, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li>Indeed, I am rarely an advocate for removing an image based on contect, but there are exceptions, and indeed precedents (goatse).

<p>I'm happy for an image to be deleted if it's a copyvio, a crap image, or not used in an article. But I'm concerned about deleting an image because it's used for vandalism. We had plenty of vandalism before this image was uploaded. If we delete this photo becasue trolls like it, the trolls will either go back to the erect penis photo, the clitoris photo, or some other photo. Deleting the image wont get rid of the vandals. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(ask the rotten)</a> 21:44, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Theresa - you're right that an image should not be removed just because it's used for vandalism, if it has some other worth. This image, however, is pretty much used <i>exclusively</i> for vandalism. After all, what's so complicated about that particular act isn't already conveyed both in textual description and by the other drawing? This image is not exactly clinical in its nature, it adds nothing to Wikipedia (nothing we want, at least), and is clearly a copyvio. The reasons for deleting it are plentiful, the reasons for keeping it are scarce: exactly the reasons that "goatse man" isn't keep here. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 22:24, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But it's not used solely for vandalism. It's linked to from the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">Autofellatio</a> page because of people who didn't want it embedded in the page. This is the inevitable consequence of removing the picture from that page -- once it's only linked to, it can be much more easily deleted. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:08, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>what makes an image porn? any image with sexual content (and then some) may be considered porn, but what makes it "usable" as porn (and as shock image) are the colours and the resolution. <i>Any</i> residual encyclopedic worth of the image would still be present if it was reduced to say, 200x100 pixels and grayscale. I suggested reducing the size, and was turned down. This convinced me that people insisting we keep this image do so entirely for its pornographic "value". RickK, if you insist this image is useful, because it proves the anatomical feasability of the act (it's not like such proof is easily obtained from the external links already!), is there any reason you support it being in fleshy colours and nearly desktop size??

<dd>Good point, but I'm not surprised it's sinking like a stone.

<dd>I do not have any articles on sex acts on my watchlist, and I missed every one of the preceding IfDs. True, I could patrol IfD more frequently, but I don't care too much about useless but <i>non-disruptive</i> images hanging around on WP. I am obviously involved, but as I perceive it involved as an admin from the start (I don't care in the least about what is and what isn't on the autofellatio article). Now, removing this vote would be censorship. I want this case well-advertised now, hopefully resulting in a verdict truly reflecting Wikipedians' views. Also, my question as to why this image has to be so large, and in colour, has still gone unanswered. As for VfD being a "bastion of deletionist", I beg permission to snort dismissively. As for "parroting" that the image is unencyclopedic, why the condescension? Maybe it is, in fact, unencyclopedic, and people are not so much parroting as expressing their disgust that these "shenanigans" have gone on for too long now? The damage is even spreading to other Wikipedias, now. People from <a href="../../../../fr/index.html" class="extiw" title="fr:">fr:</a> have complained about being redirected to the image. If you care about autofellatio so much, upload a gfdled, unobtrusive (say, 200x100 pixels) image already, and let's discuss that. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 09:35, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd>If the image should be on Wikipedia at all, it should certainly be of as high a technical quality as possible. As I remarked on IfD, I think it would be a grave error to permit the activities of vandals to determine what is and what is not going to be used to illustrate Wikipedia articles. If this image is deleted, some other sexual image will be used by the same vandals and then I hope we won't see the same people pushing for the deletion of *that* image. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:29, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the image should be deleted. There were two sparse votes on IFD, and the third attempt was stopped short by someone, on the grounds that there had previously been two votes. The current vote on VfD should perhaps be moved somewhere else, but the vote should continue, and it should be in a place which people can find. This is a ugly, noxious, image that should not be on the Wikipedia. People have the right to put these images up on their own walls. But Wikipedia is our house, and I don't want it on our walls. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 11:28, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>re "invalid": it passed IfD on 19 Jan (with a tie). When was the second IfD vote (I couldn't find a link to it)? The third one obviously doesn't count, since it was removed prematurely. If we have a policy on how much time must pass between votes, I couldn't find it, either. Surely it is admissible to reconsider an image that passed with a 9:9 tie after two months, during which it proved a troll magnet, a vandal tool, and caused considerable distress to numerous readers and editors. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 12:51, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>Actually, I only looked at one of the two votes, plus the aborted one that started on March 12. I took the claim that there had been previously been two, which was in one of the IFD votes, at face value. But I don't know for a fact that there was more than one IFD vote before March 12. RickK claimed that there have been four, but he may be counting the RFC on whether the image should be inline versus linked in <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">Autofellatio</a>, the two claimed IFD votes, plus the aborted IFD vote. It may be that there has only been one completed IFD vote, the 19 Jan one. I regret if I have erroneously propagated the idea that there was more than one completed IFD vote. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:06, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's an unreasonable point of view, and certainly against the spirit of having votes on deletion. There is a general consensus that overzealous attempts to delete content are to be avoided. Now I don't know about you, but in my opinion four IfD listings since January, not to mention the failed attempts to list it as a copyvio and at least two occasions when the image has simply been deleted, plus at least one occasion when it was overwritten by a completely different image, and one when it was replaced by a much poorer quality image, is arguably overzealous in the extreme, and moreover suggests to me that there are some people who will stop at nothing to destroy this image, consensus be damned. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:32, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>ah, yeah, let me rephrase: suggestions for compromise were labelled degradation and vandalism. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 07:17, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>On your main point, you seem to be saying that people are complaining that the "majority" is "getting its way." Well that simply isn't true. The majority always was against that picture, and I have no problem with that. What I have complained about is the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Four</b> listings on IfD in about ten weeks;</li>
<li>'<i>Two</i> flat no-consensus deletions of the photograph;</li>
<li>Numerous unsupported claims that the image is a copyright violation.</li>
<li>At least <i>one</i> no-consensus replacement of the photograph by a completely different image;</li>
<li><i>One</i> act of vandalism whereby the image quality was deliberately degraded;</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Listing an image for deletion is one thing, but this kind of campaigning to destroy an image is certainly not consensual in any way, it's sheer bullying. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:56, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, Tony, I don't think you can really complain about four listings. The first listing was in January before most people were even aware of the issue. The second and third listings were removed before most people had a chance to vote by somebody who apparently wanted to keep the image. The second was turned into an RfC vote to make the image inline or link to it, and the third was just deleted A number of people, including me, voted "inline" but said the image should be deleted. Deletion was not presented as an option. Two months later, more reasons are becoming apparent for deleting it -- namely that it facilitates vandalism to have the image in the Wikipedia. As if more reasons are needed! It is really only had one previous listing on IFD. So, now the people who would like to have the image deleted are getting another chance to vote for its deletion. If there is a consensus to delete it, which will require two-thirds vote, it will be deleted. A large number of people working with you on the Wikipedia say they find this image disgusting and an embarassment to them, and want to see it gone, not to mention more practical arguments. When I was a freshmen at college, one of my four room-mates covered the walls of our room with pictures that he had clipped out of Penthouse. None of the rest of us wanted them there, but whenever we took them down, he would put them back up again, complaining about our censorship and prudery. Eventually, the R.A. heard about it, and told him to knock it off. The point was that it wasn't censorship. All of us were fairly liberal and would have defended the right of people to publish, sell (or buy) Penthouse Magazine. We just didn't want the pictures on the walls of OUR room. Wikipedia is our common project, and a lot us don't want images like this on the walls. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:08, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BM, I think it's grossly unfair to dismiss <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a>, who works very hard on all aspects of Wikipedia images and does much of the maintenance work, as "somebody who apparently wanted to keep the image." The implication seems to be that he did something underhand in resisting these repeated attempts to destroy a perfectly good image for which no consensus existed to delete.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly you claim, oddly, that "it facilitates vandalism to have the image in the Wikipedia.". This is nonsense. There is nothing special about this image that makes it easier to vandalize. Remove this one and the vandal can start on other sexual images.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You say: <i>A large number of people working with you on the Wikipedia say they find this image disgusting and an embarassment to them, and want to see it gone.</i> I have no problem with this. However I have enumerated a lot of instances in which individuals have unilaterally deleted, replaced or just vandalized the image without any consensus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I have never cried censorship, nor am I opposed to censorship; if the image is IfD'd it's IfD'd and it's gone, no complaints from me. Do I have to keep repeating that I object to the disgusting and unprededented campaign by individuals to destroy the picture, irrespective of any consensus? It is in this context that the <b>four</b> listings on IfD occurred. It is this, not some blocke sucking his penis or some silly children going around vandalizing, that disgraces Wikipedia in my opinion. Enough is enough. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another point worth checking is, I think, the timing of the end of at least of one of the IfD listings. I believe someone replaced the image with an entirely different image, which rendered the IfD listing moot.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A note to dab: please keep this civil. You say: "I know, it will spend six more days on IfD. plenty of time to round up the trolls on IRC, isn't it" This amounts to yet another accusation of intent to fix votes (following on from that attack on Quadell). Yet I have shown that consistently it is individuals who want rid of the image who have attempted all manner of ruses: listing it on IfD a ridiculous number of times in the space of ten weeks, outright deleting the image, replacing it with another image, and even brazen vandalism, replacing the image by a severely degraded version of the same picture. These are events that I can enumerate in detail on request. You cannot support your insinuation with one iota of evidence--indeed the opposite is the case. I have in fact given the URL for voting to people who told me they would vote to delete. That I have to point this out is the true disgrace, for yet again a totally false and extremely damaging accusation has been made, and you probably didn't even think of it as a personal attack, let alone a grave and utterly unworthy one. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:54, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>the image was repeatedly deleted by various people who couldn't conceive anyone in their right mind would want it on Wikipedia. Who, like Jimbo, did not even consider it a borderline case. I spend an hour digging up <i>evidence</i> of what happened to the "four" IfD's you insist the image has survived. Maybe in one instance, it was nobody's fault the image was removed, since things were quite hectic. That doesn't change the fact that the image survived <i>one</i> IfD so far, barely. All your comments of "individuals" "campaigning" and "vandalizing" fly in the face of the many clear votes against this image by good editors on IfD. If you cannot acknowledge that there <i>are</i> issues with this image, there is no point in discussing further. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 07:17, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>I'm claiming that the admins who speedied the image had opinions similar to Jimbo's, who didn't delete the image because he doesn't want to rule WP by fiat, bless him, but who certainly expressed that he thinks it shouldn't be here, yes. He didn't "advocate linking to it", you are the one misrepresenting things now, he voted for linking it, just like me and a dozen other people who want to delete it, <i>because that was the bloody poll option</i>, it was not a VfD, it was a vote on the Autofellatio article, where there were choices between lesser and greater evils. I am really disappointed at how this is handled. I am not enjoying this at all, but if I hadn't made a stand, you would have told people that there were "four votes already" and hushed it all up. You were calling "Invalid IfD" at first, and now that it transpired that it is not, in fact, invalid at all, you are trying to accuse me of mischaracterizations?

<dd>Jimmy Wales: <i>This image is completely unacceptable for wikipedia -- I don't even consider this borderline.</i>. That is the edit summary that Jimbo put on his comment regarding this image. What part of that do people not understand? He has so far trusted the consensus to do the right thing, and so far the consensus has been slow to fulfill his expectations. However, unless there a flood of Keep votes comes out of nowhere, perhaps we are finally living up to Jimbo's trust. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:43, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

And bear in mind, a person who <i>was there</i> is likely to have strong opinions about these things. He's a good editor, willing to take on POV warriors in the past...and being called a "friend of <s>satan</s>Saddam" and having you edits called "bullshit" <i>is</i> provocation. Does not excuse a 3RR violation, but certainly comes into the realm of mitigating circumstances. <i>Less than 24 hours</i> is probably more in line here. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:26, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not agree at all. I have been evenhanded or even somewhat heavier on TDC. If you have a look at his edits he is as persistent as TDC wrt whatever POV they are pushing - just on the other side. I have blocked both, TDC initially for a week, Christiaan for 24hrs as it was TDC's second occasion in short time, but Tony felt this was OTT. So be it. Christiaan though has his 24 hour block well deserved and I objetc to anyone shortening it for no good reason. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 14:39, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just want to reassure Refdoc, in case it's needed, that I think his handling of both cases has been fair. I only reduced the block on TDC because I don't think the reason cited can be used to justify the length of the block when made by an administrator. If TDC is being a major nuisance we should go to dispute resolution (RFC etc) and/or petition Arbcom; as administrators we don't really have authority for long blocks except in cases of persistent of egregious vandalism, sock puppetry or attacks that put an editor in danger. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:00, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wasn't saying that Refdoc's treatment of Christiaan was unfair...I was addressing the comment: <i>I believe a longer block might be appropriate.</i> Can you justify this situation? After all, he was tag-teamed in a revert war by someone who not only engaged in personal attacks in his edit summaries, but also said (on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Christiaan#Human_shield_in_Iraq" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Christiaan#Human_shield_in_Iraq" rel="nofollow">Christiaan's talk page</a>): <i>How does it feel to know that you were nothing more than a Shill for Saddam Hussein, and were lead around by your nose by his secret police? Does it feel good? I am going to laugh as I watch this article burn. TDC 03:20, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>
<dd>Calling for a longer block on Christiaan is offensive. The version he was reverting was badly written and terribly waffly. As an organiser of the Human Shields, Christiaan may have a POV, but he also has insight that is not available to the rest of us, since we only have CIA propanganda to work with. The article shouldn't reflect his POV, but I would give more credit to his version than one that is based merely on US policy. In a case like this <i>there is no way of knowing the truth</i>. This is one case in which we have no choice but to present both POVs. The line from the CIA/Pentagon is <i>certainly</i> no more trustworthy than that of the participants. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 16:15, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A longer block for either of these editors could only be called by an admin if they'd been disruptive to Wikipedia (vandalism, etc) or threatening.

<p>I have not read any of the articles discussed as I think this is completely irrelevant. I have blocked both on account of their 3RR violations and have alerted others to their blatant revert warring. I have no particular problems with Christiaan's politics, I probably would also more subscribe to his version of the truth than to TDC's judging from both users' talk and user pages. This does not though give to Christiaan and us an excuse to tolerate or conduct revert warring. I also apologise for misunderstanding the bit about length of blocks, I simply (mis)applied the vandalism rules onto 3RR blocks, instead of reading and thinking through the small print on 3RR blocks. I am a new admin and try to find my feet. This was my mistake and I acknowledge it. Hence I did not dispute Tony's change of length of TDC's block and do not ask - anymore - for Christiaan's block to become longer than 24 hours. Having said all this I do not think eitehr of the two editors behaviour should in any way be excused by being goaded/riled, I think both gave as good as they got. Christiaan certainly makes me think he was setting a trap for TDC and once safely trapped "shopped" him - see above. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 18:02, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did not mean to make this 3RR violation and I would hope it's my first and last. If you look at my reverts you'll see I was reverting waffly edits that were not there to improve the article but to try and make a point. When you blocked me my revert was not the status quo, the status quo of which I was discussing with the other editor on the talk page, so my reverts can hardly be categorised as egregious (and I'm not particurlarly happy with Tony weighing in on this for various reasons either). I had already noted that I was open to a rewrite of the summary in question but that I hadn't yet seen a good one. It appears now that there is an alternative edit that I can live with, by another editor.

<dd>RfCs are not an essential part of the blocking policy for disruption, which is the criteria employed. The edit in question involved making inaccurate statements about the rulings of the arbcom and several other groups. This is on top of two prior blocks for disruption, which seem to provide prior warning. And, contrary to Netoholic's account of things, I explained everything I'm saying here to him on his talk page when he asked.

<dd>Unfortunately, questionable blocks by Snowspinner are par for the course. Why does he have to do things like this? Why can't he come to deliberate here before acting? Being an admin isn't intended to make anyone a miniature dictator; it's janitorial work, and if the powers are going to be used aggressively rather than cautiously, they just shouldn't be used at all. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 20:05, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the gist of Everyking's comments regarding the nature of the administrative role. There are very few policies under which an administrator is empowered to block an established user for a month. Which one was it in this case? <i>Claiming non-existant judicial legitimacy</i> doesn't call to mind any obvious policy that would support a one month block. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:15, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cyrius' comment is most relevant here. The issue isn't Snowspinner's block, it's about John-1107's edits that led to his blocking. John-1107 does not appear to be able to edit Wikipedia in any positive way; Snowspinner has done both him and Wikipedia a favour. Protestations of "admin abuse" against Snowspinner would have more weight if the people he was "abusing" didn't so consistently turn out to be trolls, vandals, or people who end up being sanctioned by ArbCom. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:23, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, Theresa, administrators do not have the authority to block other members, except under very specific circumstances that are spelled out in the policies. These are, briefly:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>short blocks for violation of the 3RR rule</li>
<li>vandalism</li>
<li>violations of various specific injunctions against specific users arising out of Arb Comm cases</li>
<li>a few situations described in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a>. The only one of these that is at all generic is "disruption".</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>There is no policy that gives administrators the authority to block people who they think it would be a good idea to block. Even behaviour that would result in the ArbComm blocking or banning someone is not behaviour that administrators can act against as individul administrators. Individual administrators are not cops or enforcers, except in a very few cases. Now, someone giving himself a "made up title" is not a grounds for blocking BY AN ADMINISTRATOR. If the Arb Comm would like to block someone for this, then they have the authority from Jimbo to do so, the arbitrators being people who have been elected by the community specifically for that role. Individual administrators should not be blocking people. When people vote on administrators (unlike Arbitrator), they are looking at whether the prospective administrator can be trusted with the elevated privileges needed for custodial functions. Nobody elected Snowspinner, or any other administrator, to be a moderator who can unilaterally block people, except for a few very well dilineated reasons. Even individual arbitrators are just administrators the same as the others -- that is, janitors -- except when they operate as the Arbitration Committee. If all of this is too cumbersome, then somebody should say so, and we should change the policies and the messages around administrators' roles. For example, we should stop saying that administrators are just the "mop and bucket" brigade, because Snowspinner, for one, is obviously carrying more than a mop and bucket around. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:05, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the block seems fine to me too. if this sort of nonsense isn't disruption, I don't know what is. WP isn't a kids' hosting space. Assuming good faith is important, but we need to stop fooling around with every random kid who wants to waste our time. Fine, so administrators are janitors <i>and</i> doorkeepers. If you walked into an office building with a made-up uniform and started shouting orders, I am sure the security staff would show you the door, without first considering that you may just be a kid who wanted to have some fun. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 09:36, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>It is not acceptable to add pages in a user namespace to general categories. If I see this, I will remove such categories. There are categories designed for user pages (at least there were once—I may not be up to date on this) but they are to categorise yourself as a user interested in a certain topic.

<dd>If there is no guideline or law now, we should definitely have one - and I think this discussion shows that there is pretty much unanimous consensus on this. There's nothing wrong in principle with keeping old revisions of articles in userspace, but a category entry in effect places these articles back in article space through the backdoor (because everyone browsing the category will be able to see those articles without any indication that they are not meant to be seen in article space). -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 09:33, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Guettarda, this had to specifically spelled out for this user that putting userspace articles into the main wikipedia categories was not cool at all. This page changed to specifically say "not cool" <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html#User_namespace" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization#User_namespace</a>. I will have no problem removing userspace articles from main wiki categories and if an abusive user decides he still has a right to do that, I'd hope for backup from folks watching 3rr. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 21:39, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>then what protects the main wikipedia from a user who has decided to put up alternative articles in his userspace? <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 22:44, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks everyone. It wasn't reverted for more than 3 times within 24 hours, and I am still waiting for, if there's any, a clear Wikipedia law or guideline on whether encyclopedic articles in user space can be categorised. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 21:46, Mar 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would have thought that "Users should not add their user pages to article namespace categories" (from <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html#User_namespace" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization#User_namespace</a>) was adequate. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:22, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
