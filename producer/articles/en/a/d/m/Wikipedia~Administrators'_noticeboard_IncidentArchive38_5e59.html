<dd>Ok.

<dd>Yeah, that's fine, I don't give a frog's fat ass if you block people that deserve it. But I (the original GrandCru) didn't create the fake Bobby or Derksen accounts. I was innocent, and got blocked anyway. If you look at Bobbybuilder's history, you will see that his profanity and vandalisms were far greater than mine ever were. He was the truly abusive one, but you guys keep overlooking it. Why was he not blocked? Go ahead, look up all the IP addresses, you will see that prior to today I had nothing to do with any of the Jiang bullshit. But, you know what? Since you guys blocked me permanently and put to waste all my effort and contributions, I will spend the same amount of time vandalising Bobbybuilder. (And Jiang, only because Jiang's group of vandals are going to help me get Bobby). One of these days, the vandals will rise up against the communists. You can prohibit freedom of speech in mainland China, but not in the rest of the world. Wikipedia was created so that everyone can contribute, but as it turns out, the people that have power (admins, beaurocrats, etc.) will abuse it to support their own POVs, etc. Fuck you all, I'm going to the dark side of wiki! --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandCruTwo_ea42.html" title="User:GrandCruTwo">GrandCruTwo</a> 03:41, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Finally, an admin who reads what has happened. As anyone can see by looking at the relevant talk pages and article histories, Albanau has been systematically rude to anyone who disagrees with him, to the extent of calling a fellow Albanian of his "very unintelligent", just because they disagreed. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">Albanau</a> has also violated the 3RR rule multiple times (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">he even did 4 reverts within 51 minutes</a>), yet he has consistently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=19264314&amp;oldid=19263841" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=19264314&amp;oldid=19263841" rel="nofollow">taunted other editors to revert and break the 3RR</a>. If they take the bait, he immediately reports them. He has been very cunning in that he first edits in his own POV, and then creates a revert war, according to plan. He has also repeatedly given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Arvanites&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19311904" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Arvanites&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19311904" rel="nofollow">provocative titles to his edit summaries</a>, and when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=19369144&amp;oldid=19338308" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=19369144&amp;oldid=19338308" rel="nofollow">offered neutral phrasings</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=19265562&amp;oldid=19265255" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvanitic_language&amp;diff=19265562&amp;oldid=19265255" rel="nofollow">he ignores them</a>. In an vain effort to compromise, I even proposed <a href="../../../a/l/b/Talk%7EAlbanians_7b16.html#Acerimusdux" title="Talk:Albanians">using his own words</a> in the article. Guess what: he started wiggling out of his own words. I will appreciate your involvement in this, if you have the time and disposition. I also suspect sockpuppetry in the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Talk%7EAlbanians_7b16.html" title="Talk:Albanians">Talk:Albanians</a> page, but for the time being I do not intend to request its investigation as it would inflame things further. <i>Milles mercis</i>. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 15:17, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Indeed.

These are his words, not mine. His blatant promotion of these groups was later removed by another editor as "redundant propaganda": <a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=U%C3%87K&amp;diff=345480&amp;oldid=345443" class="external autonumber" title="http://sv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=U%C3%87K&amp;diff=345480&amp;oldid=345443" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>,<a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=U%C3%87K&amp;diff=747896&amp;oldid=502431" class="external autonumber" title="http://sv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=U%C3%87K&amp;diff=747896&amp;oldid=502431" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, while his dubious claim that there is a ""Çamëria Liberation Army" in Greece fighting for "human rights" was disputed,<a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=U%C3%87K&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=856728" class="external autonumber" title="http://sv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=U%C3%87K&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=856728" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and no reference to such a group exists on the English Wikipedia.

<p>Albanau has been causing nothing but trouble with his untenable edits and style. How people react to him is a matter of taste, but hardly unprovoked; last time I checked, personal attacks per se were not blockable, only if it is "disruptive", so the complaint is pointless here, it should go to rfc, and then to the arbcom, and I do not think Albanau is likely to find much favour with the arbcom, in the light of his own behaviour. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 19:30, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think that's anons editing the page, but just one anon, with so far two IPs in the same range (editing from Switzerland, it seems). OK, so, an anon with no contribs except to a userpage for an account—if there is an account by the name—which also has no contribs? I'm quite tempted to incur my first administrative action shitstorm by speedy deleting this page. "Nothing to do with creating an encyclopedia" isn't a speedy criterion, agreed, but isn't it kind of implied?

<p>It isn't a user page at all. At best, it's an IP editor's misunderstanding of the term "user page." I think he or she has come to the conclusion that one's private sandbox page is created at "user:" plus the name of the page you want. Given what this page is, it will, upon publication, be immediately VfD'd. It's a collection of Bible prophecy coming true in the newspapers sort of thing, it seems to me. Properly, one would send it to VfD, but the problem there is that the current group of VfD voters seems congenitally incapable of reading a nomination. If you said, "This is not a user page," they'd vote "Keep! It's a user page! Leave it alone!" So, it's speedy delete as webhosting (Wikipedia is not a free web host) or nothing. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:45, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Update on Christ is the daily newspapers: a third IP has edited the page, 80.218.237.225, which is in a different range but resolves to the same Swiss ISP. Nobody has commented on my talk page message. Step two today: an explicit statement on the "userpage" itself (I doubt that they know from talk pages, and I don't think they're ever logged in, to get a "you have new messages" message) that I'm planning to delete.

<dd>And furthermore, it is <i>explicitly</i> a matter of individual subjectivity, as the precise wording is: <i>"wherein Irate will be temporarily banned for a short period of up to one week if he makes any edits that an administrator judges to be personal attacks."</i> Gosh darn that judgement thing!

<dd>I don't agree that it should be up to a single admin. Such a block could be hotly controversial. So it should be discussed here first. If I went around acting according to <i>my</i> subjective judgment about these things, I'd be before the ArbCom in a week. But the hardliners are supposed to get a free pass to ban somebody based on their own judgment? No, that's senseless. We have this forum here for discussion about admin actions; let's use it. If the block can't get a consensus here, it shouldn't be done.

<dd>It doesn't really matter if you don't agree it should be up to a single administrator. That is the judgment that was passed.

<p>Hey, I just did some looking around and noticed something: Irate is already blocked! He was blocked by Snowspinner on July 25, the same day this was originally posted here. Yet Snowspinner has said nothing to justify his actions, much less engage in the reaching the kind of admin consensus I proposed above. Was he hoping to keep it a secret? I put heavy odds on Gerard also knowing about it and failing to mention it. Wikipedia is supposed to prioritize consensus, in case these two (the arb and his enforcer) haven't noticed. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:16, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Snowspinner isn't the only admin who thought Irate should be have been blocked. Have you researched the background on this user? He was banned for three months for personal attacks, and then when he came back it didn't take long for him to fall back into his old habits. So he was placed on personal attack parole. He made the choice to persist, so he was blocked. (Oh, and did I mention he's been banned from everywhere from IRC to the mailing lists to meta?). Posting a note here is, of course, an option worth bearing in mind for admins, but Irate's case is fairly straightforward. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 18:26, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm just curious to know: Is there any discussion of Jimbo's decisions? Isn't the policy that once Jimbo speaks, there is no appeal? Isn't the ArbCom subject to him? (I'm remembering something about reserving the right to dissolve the ArbCom if it doesn't work and to overrule them if he sees fit.) The discussion here seems to suggest that perhaps Jimbo is also subject to community consensus, and I'd just like to know: Is He or is He not the final word? -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 06:48, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jimbo is the (not always so benevolent) dictator, so there's nothing we can do to override one of his decisions forcibly, although he certainly has a moral obligation to account for his decisions and act responsibly, and we have every right to question and discuss his decisions (and I know someone is reading this right now and thinking "We'll see about that..."). <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:06, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That was what I thought; I was confused because the discussion seemed to suggest he might be subject to an overrule.

<p>Hello everybody. I am a user from Spain who has tried to do useful contributions in the article <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero_5f9d.html" title="José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero">José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero</a>. SqueakBox has harassed me repeatedly. He insulted me explicitly in my user page as it is found here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zapatancas&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=18901058" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zapatancas&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=18901058" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> (in any case, it is the version of my talk page of 17:16, 15 July 2005 by SqueakBox). He said "Fuck off Nazi scum".</p>
<p>I have described the harassment I suffer in the 14:59 26 July 2005 version of my user page, which has been vandalized by him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zapatancas&amp;oldid=19645437" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zapatancas&amp;oldid=19645437" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. He claims that I am abusing him and that <i>a [user] page is not an excuse for a vicious and unjustified personal attack</i>. The reason I included the description of his attacks on me in my user page is that he vandalized it when I have not created it, as can be checked in the history page, identifying me with a blocked vandal I have no relation to as I have said him once and again.</p>
<p>I have always tried to be polite with everybody. I simply believe that SqueakBox could have some mental problem because of how he behaves (for example, he once talked about supposed death threats from other users in his user page what I considered absurd after reading it). I have not tried to be hard on nobody and much less on a sick person (if that is the case), I have simply tried to express what I consider to be the source of the problem.</p>

How exactly is <b>This user seems to suffer from a mental disorder (I am talking totally seriously)</b> not a vicious personal attack, the latest in a long, long line. Calling me a sick person is out of order, and I want Zapatancas to stop. Also SWquealingPig made his vicious attacks moments after Zapatancas and I had an edit war. His denial of being SquealingPig is not credible.

<dd>I am from Spain and my English is not perfect. I believe SqueakBox suffers a mental disorder because, among other reasons, he has included in his user page passages expressing he was receiving death threats from other users what I considered totally absurd. If I sounded rude in English I am sorry but I do not master the language and I have only tried to express my opinion honestly.</dd>

<dd>Effectively SqueakBox tried to start an edit war after destroying some articles I have contributed to without giving any logical reason.

<dd><i>Zapatero has been accused of telling the Spanish media in the aftermath of the attacks that suicidal bombers had been found among the victims (something discarded by all the specialists). When he was asked in December 2004 about the issue by the Parliamentary Investigative Committee created to find the truth about the attacks he declared that he did not "remember" what he had said. <a href="http://www.libertaddigital.com/php3/noticia.php3?cpn=1276239580" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.libertaddigital.com/php3/noticia.php3?cpn=1276239580" rel="nofollow">[31]</a></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I have tried to describe an objective fact related to Zapatero's biography. I have included a source to an article in Spanish I spent some time to find for those who may not have previous information about the fact to help them contrast the information. However, my contribution has been removed providing no reason only because I added it.</p>
<p>The article has not been updated since SqueakBox accessed it for the first time some months ago and removed everything he pleased. He continues removing everything usually giving no reasons at all.</p>
<p>Is that the kind of behavior encouraged in the Wikipedia? <a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZapatancas_8ec3.html" title="User:Zapatancas">Zapatancas</a> 16:40, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think this user should not acuse me of having mental problems. He is viciously attackoing me. Why should I tolerate his abuse. I don't have amy illnesses. I just want Zapatancas to cease attacking me and gegt over the fact that I edited his work months ago. is he incapable of not attacking m,e. CesarB permanently blocked RexJudicata for death threats.

At 10.47 SquealingPig appears, complaining about me on the Zapatero talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13271374" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13271374" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I revert him at 10.50 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=13373517" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=13373517" rel="nofollow">here</a>. He then gets in a rage and attacks me as SquealingPig many timesw in a below the belt fashion, starting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SqueakBox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13273682" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SqueakBox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13273682" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:19, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>He then insults me saying <b>A question, do you live in Honduras because your family could not stand you any longer?</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18899823" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18899823" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I reacted to this by telling him to <b>fuck off you Nazi troll</b>, mild in comparison. He is now using his personal page to accuse me of being mentally ill. I have not attacked other than this one time. I think I am being very patient and tolerant to a nasty interne t troll, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:23, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I advise to search in Google for SqueakBox and vandalism (Click <a href="http://www.google.es/search?hl=es&amp;q=SqueakBox+vandalism" class="external text" title="http://www.google.es/search?hl=es&amp;q=SqueakBox+vandalism" rel="nofollow">here</a> for example). I got 678 results. SqueakBox is getting in continuous problems with everybody and he is always accusing others. I have taken a look at his "contributions" and it is clear he always provokes other users on purpose. He never tries to explain his deletions. And that is difficult to justify. He has a huge experience here and knows others can get angry if they are not told why their effort (usually evidently honest) are removed. He really looks for the excitement of arguing and humiliating other people. And, of course, a lot of times his page has been vandalized. Of course, that only adds to his fun as he used every attack to fuel his continuous harassment.</p>
<p>It is not true he has attacked me only once. He harasses me continuously. Today he vandalized my user page eliminating all the text in it, he has added a lot of obscene comments in my talk page, he has reverted my edit in the <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapatero.html" title="Zapatero">Zapatero</a>'s article as I have already reported, he has accused me of being unable to write a NPOV article (this can be found in the <a href="../../../j/o/s/Talk%7EJos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero_966f.html" title="Talk:José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero">Talk</a> page of Zapatero), he has said I hate Zapatero (what is completely absurd as I do not know him personally), he has used improper language in a comment addressed to me (he has used the word bulls**t), he has called me a troll and he has removed the headline User:SqueakBox I added to report his mistreatment. And that only for today. <a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZapatancas_8ec3.html" title="User:Zapatancas">Zapatancas</a> 18:10, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Excuse me but it was you who made those obscene commenbts, I was reminding you of what you are really like. Yes, you are not the only troll here. So whatr dioes that prove. That I don't like POV warriors,. and they get angry when I remove their POV. If you can't handle your work being mercilessly edited don't contribute. It was not fun for me when yopu attacked me and my dog as squealingPig. Maybe you were having fun, but I wasn't. I have not vandalised your user page, I have removed your deeply offensive personal attack against me. Wikipedia do not give you that page to launch persobnal attacks against users you don\'t like. You have used endless insults against me. just take responsibility for your actions and stop trolling. As I have elucidated above, you are SquealingPig, and you have deeply insulted me on many occassions, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:19, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>RickK and vandalism brought up 954 pages, while with SlimVirgin it was 779. I am in good company. Zapatancas needs to differentiate between vandalisers and those who fight the vandalism of users like SquealingPig, who only got 5 google hits, substantially less than the number of vandalsims he did, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:34, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>From what I've seen, I'm more inclined to side with the user in question. This looks more like a case of a confused newbie than a delibrate vandal. The user in question has created a new account, and claims to have been harrassed by Fawcett5. I don't know whether or not that's actually the case, but the notes left on the above account's talkpage seem to bear that out. I think that if there is fault here, it isn't all just on one side of the incident. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanting_Fox_262d.html" title="User:Chanting Fox">Chanting Fox</a> 03:14, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>An INFINITE block? Snowspinner, I'm no admin, but an infinite block for copyvios seems a bit harsh. Are you sure that was warranted? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanting_Fox_262d.html" title="User:Chanting Fox">Chanting Fox</a> 03:24, 27 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If an account appears to have been set up only for policy violations, indefinite blocks are entirely in order - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 18:33, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm afraid that I'm going with the blocked user on this one, despite the copyvios. The infinite block is a clear violation of blocking policy and if not bad-faith is almost certaintly far too severe a punishment. The user in question appears to have been here for less than a month, and is almost certainly NOT doing this to cause trouble for people. In fact, she seems more confused than disruptive to me. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanting_Fox_262d.html" title="User:Chanting Fox">Chanting Fox</a> 03:35, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Was that really necessary, Everyking? For what it's worth, I agree that the indefinite block is too heavy given the circumstances, but I'm sure that Snowspinner will review his decision based on Fawcett5's polite note on Snowspinner's talk page. File an RFC on Snowspinner if you want to, but keep your snide remarks to yourself. I might suggest that you examine Fawcett5's comments to Snowspinner as an example of how to phrase <i>constructive</i> criticism. You're an excellent editor and admin in virtually all other regards—why can't you maintain at least a veneer of civility (or just remain stolidly silent) here? <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 04:23, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>

<p>Since directing him to the relevant policy pages on civility and NPOV have not worked, an administrator is responsible for enforcing them through a temp block, or at least a warning. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 04:30, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I also want to add that the idea that Mikkalai is a Stalin fan is a joke. On the contrary, he has filled Wikipedia with documents, testimony and so forth that reflect poorly on Stalin, and the CPSU during the time Stalin was the general secretary of it. Mikkalai is not pro-Stalin, he is anti-Stalin. Unlike Agiantman however, he does not make personal attacks and he is not disruptive. While msot of his material is anti-Stalin, he makes sure all of it he puts in is referenced and factual, and in neutral language, letting facts speak for themselves. He is also willing to compromise. A look over Mikkalai's edit history over the past year will show most of what he has done is fill Wikipedia with evidence about Stalin's misdeeds. But at least he uses references, sources, facts and so forth. People like Agiantman just hysterically rant that a page which consensus was reached very carefully is POV. I myself think the page is too anti-Stalin, I don't agree with this in the opening: "collectivization triggered a bitter struggle of peasants against the authorities in many areas, which significantly contributed to famine and millions of peasant casualties, particularly in Ukraine." I know the consensus-building is a delicate balancing act, so I am waiting for everyone to work other issues out before I come in and point out my problems with this sentence. AGiantman walks in on day one and starts disrupting this article which it took a long time to reach consensus on, a consensus which is ongoing. He thinks he is more important than the dozen or so people trying to achieve consensus, he is even attacking his allies like Mikkalai, who is on the anti-Stalin side but is neutral, a consensus builder and does not do original research. <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> 20:30, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(I'm not a lawyer, so don't take this as a legal opinion) It's also perhaps worth noting that the US and UK libel laws are significantly different. Wikipedia's servers are hosted in the US, so if there's any suing to be done I'd image it would have to be under US law. In the US, you can say pretty much anything you want about a public figure and, I gather, this is not the case in the UK. This difference might be behind some of the different views on this issue. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 01:50, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia can hope - and can even try to assure -- that it is sued where it is hosted, but there's no guarantee it won't be sued wherever it's distributed.

<p>Even if Wikipedia was sued in Britan and the British courts awarded Jimbo's house to the plaintiff, they'd have to get a US court to enforce it, and that's quite unlikely.

<p>I think just about every Wikipedian who has created a userpage with content that expresses their own views, if one finds them offensive, then don't visit the page. Unless they are making direct attacks against a user or specific racial comments, then there is no harm. There is no difference in these comments then that of the Opinion cartoons. As far as Vanity fair getting sued, they are a corporate magazine expressing its or the editors views, and not a personal userpage. Especially since a <i>Polish director</i> not a <i>public figure</i> sued them (yes I think some directors can be considered public figures, but not the majority of them). <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Who_d857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Who"><font color="#FF0033">∞</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 04:32, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The suggestion that anyone could be sued over opinions expressed on a member's user page is preposterous. The practice of editing other members' user pages is nothing more than sophomoric vandalism, the more reprehensible when cloaked in the guise of administrative propriety.</p>
<p>Cognition ought to be commended for disclosing his POV with such candor. Would that others would be as forthcoming, particularly those surreptitious types who routinely abuse adminstrative authority by selective banning members, or protecting particular versions of articles, in the service of their POV allies.

<li>Just a quick comment on libel issues. It would be libelous for me to say for instance "Hamster Sandwich is a donkey molesting drug dealer" whereas to say "<i>I think</i> Hamster Sandwich is a donkey molesting drug dealer" is legally acceptable. People are legally allowed to voice an opinion, but they have to make it perfectly clear that it is an opinion. The content in question is on a personal user page; this would tend to negate Wikipedias responsibility regarding the page. Also, I am certain that if Jimbo is half as smart as I think he must be, there is a disclaimer in here somewhere that defers legal responsibility away from Wikipedia and places the onus on the individual editor. We are here voluntarily, after all. The difference betwen a user page being libelous and citing a case vis a vis Liberace vs. The Evening Standard is that the author who wrote the Liberace article was paid for professional services rendered. The paper has paid fact checkers and frankly, they got screwed in that judgement against them in that case. That being said, I am not yet a lawyer, but I have played one on television. Now I have to go and find that damn donkey, he keeps hiding all my drugs. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 21:01, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>A person using above IP has been vandalizing my articles amd making false and damaging comments. I cannot follow yoru process because thsi vandal is not registered so it is an anonymous person. Can you please help me by banning the person? He made terrible. false, damaging comments that are despicable and ruining me. It is a terrible experience to have someone do this with no way to reach them. Thank you,</p>

<dd>He's already been causing trouble, and he's already been hit with a 24 hour block for violating the 3rr on his old RFC.

<p>Based on the near universal comment of "Can't we just ban him," and the fact that he's very obviously not reformed AT ALL, I'm thinking this is a good case for an addition to "banned by the Wikipedia community?"

<dd>If he goes back to doing the same things that got him blocked the last time, then it strikes me as reasonable for an admin to block him–for short periods, up to say 24 hours–for disruption. In the interest of keeping the peace here, I'd suggest placing a block request here and allowing a second admin to actually block (in the absence of clear vandalism or outright destruction). <i>If</i> he accumulates more than one or two such blocks, I imagine that it would be very easy to persuade the ArbCom to impose a temporary injunction against editing. In such a case, we might also be able to save a lot of time by direct appeal to Jimbo. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 18:29, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are less than 500 active and semi-active admins on Wikipeida. That's a scant number for such a huge project, perhaps if admins didn't waste so much time worrying about petty criticism of them on users talk pages that really don't ammount to much then they'd have more time to do the really important things and thereby attract less criticism. Which is more imporatant? Making sure there are no petty criticisms of admins on talk pages or making this into a real respectable encyclopedia. I fear that stamping out all dissent will only lead to more disent or more bannings of editors who would make useful contributions instead of arguing with the admins if the admins whould just loosen up and not be so sensative.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I freely admit that I've lost my cool recently, and I don't blame anyone for that but myself, but now I still have an admin hounding me who even blocked my for 12 hours for violating a rule he made up, and I'm not getting any support from the other admins below. So perhaps my opinion of the adminstrators is unfairly tarnished right now, but admins need to keep in mind that while there are rules in place to help easily address problems with editors, it's very hard to do anything when an admin becomes abusive and that's going to frustrate a lot of people. Admins can take the hard line in those cases if they want, but I doubt any good will come from it. I certainly doubt it will make this into a respected encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../1/9/8/User%7E198.93.113.49.html" title="User:198.93.113.49">198.93.113.49</a> 19:36, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I always thought that when a block was placed, it would replace any existing block. Am I just wrong now or have I always been wrong about this? Maybe this behavior changed with MediaWiki 1.5.

<dd>I asked the devs recently and was told that "no one really understands the blocking code". I <b>think</b> that blocks act independently of each other. So if I block user X for 5 hours, and then 1 minute later another admin blocks him indefinitely, in 5 hours my block will expire, the software will unlock user X, which causes both blocks disappear from the block list. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 16:34, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, completely spurious and ridiculous conspiracy theory. Could Plautus be hounding us again? I would like to note that I made the second infinite block, as a good-faith reversion to the most recently-instated one, which was cancelled for technical reasons.

<p>I don't agree with the block; I think we need procedure. Plautus' behavior since his return, and I'm not saying it wasn't abhorrent before, seems more along the lines of harmless rambling and mild mischief. Really I don't think an open and shut case can be made for "banned by the community". I would support having a community vote over it, though, with an agreed upon threshold in advance, followed by an ArbCom case if that fails.

<dd>I support some kind of process - right now Plautus is being mildly disruptive, but not overly so (most of his edits seem to have been in the Talk areas).

<dd>At this point I think I should point out what SqueakBox said in his welcome to this user: "Hello, I love PENIS lots lots lots, and welcome to Wikipedia." I wonder how I should interpret that... --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 20:56, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You should interpret it as me being a part of the welcoming committee. I do hundreds of these. Everyking had left a message saying maybe he should use a different name, so I left a message saying <i>The best way to do this is to press the above move button and folow the instructions. Meanwhile</i> and added the welcome as it was made clear here that his or her edits are fine, and therefore we want to encourage the user to be a regular contributor. It just seemed wrong to me not to welcome him or her, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 21:08, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>how is that a rationale for deletion? the redirect was placed there after the move, so I don't see why it should have more than one contributor, and how the number of contributors is even relevant. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:15, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see. Of course then the deletion of the redirect makes sense. It is still improper, I think, we do not normally consider 2:1 a 'consensus', Neutrality should at least have argued his point here. Anyway, undeletion is cheap. Incidentially, the title seems a bit awkward, what exactly is 'historical persecution'?

<dd>I had no reason to think Gamaliel would read it and was surprised that he did read it. What exactly is the blockable offense here. Gamaliel has said many things far worse about me and yet my attempt to discuss the situation on Roy Lichtenstein with a user who had had similar problems with Gamaliel is considered an attack. Is it now Wiki policy that admins can block users for anything if they think is inapporiate even if it does not violate any policy?

<p>The talk pages of new users should not be forums to air unrelated grievances. They should be for greeting new users and informing them of Wikipedia policies and customs, not for drawing them into preexisiting conflicts. I feel very strongly about this matter, and in light of the anon's previous history, I feel my actions were warranted. My to do list was merely a personal record/memory refresher of my interatctions with other users (as well as a list of articles I wanted to get around to editing) not meant for public consumption or as a public attack, but I suppose everything on Wikipedia is for public consumption in the end. Initially I reverted his comments to my subpage and locked it, but I decided to let them remain for the time being. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 16:25, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

Yes, I was involved in an edit war on Rob Liefeld and yes I lost my temper when a different standard was applied to other users than the one being applied to me. That has no baring on the issue here which is Gamaliel's blocking me 12 hours for a compleately unrelated comment on another page or the fact that he just today deleted a perfectly reason comment I made to the Rob Leifeld talk page which is still in the history for any one to see that it should not have been deleted.--<a href="../../../1/9/8/User%7E198.93.113.49.html" title="User:198.93.113.49">198.93.113.49</a> 19:25, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Those useless comments do not add anything to the productive discussion of an encyclopedia article, nor does a long discussion of the worth of comments like those contribute anything of worth to the article. You have recieved clear, repeated warnings from both User:Francs2000 and myself about your behavior on that page.

<dd>Irrelevet comment?! Three of my own comments were removed and they were completely relevent. Some of the comments made by others may ahve been questionable, but even then I think that when in doubt it's best to avoid deleting comments in a discussion. I think that this is a very valid point of discussion. I'm sorry that you and Gamaliel disagree, but we will just have to have a difference of opinion on that. However, just because you and Gamaliel don't find an issue worth discussing does not mean that those comments should be deleted. Gamaliel is at it again by the way. He's made it very clear on his talk page that he intends to revert edits to <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Scarborough_6f36.html" title="Joe Scarborough">Joe Scarborough</a> no matter how many people oppose his version and made a wildly unfounded accuasation about sock puppets (even though he's taken me to task for accusing some of being a sock puppet once) and when I tried to comment on the matter (I'm a part of the group who opposes his POV pushing on Scarboroug) he deleted my comment and left a nasty note on mt talk page.<a href="../../../1/9/8/User_talk%7E198.93.113.49.html" title="User talk:198.93.113.49">User talk:198.93.113.49</a>--<a href="../../../1/9/8/User%7E198.93.113.49.html" title="User:198.93.113.49">198.93.113.49</a> 19:48, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yesterday, on RC patrol, I noticed <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedia_Username_53d1.html" title="User:Wikipedia Username">Wikipedia Username</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedia_Username_d150.html" title="User talk:Wikipedia Username">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikipedia_Username_ad72.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikipedia Username">contribs</a>) creating User:Wikipedia Username/Letter, a letter to Hollywood stars about their failure to support the war in Iraq. I asked him to take it down, as I felt it was inappropriate content. To his credit, he did so, although he did label be a "fascist", and accuse me of double standards, since I have some slightly irrelevant stuff on my user page. I do, however, marvel at the comment, <i>And anyway I wasn't "calling" you a fascist, you are a fascist, so I was merely stating fact.</i> Now, having deleted the article, all should be fine and dandy, right? Wrong. He now creates User:Wikipedia Username/Facist Beating (sic) with exactly the same content. Firstly, is the content appropriate for Wikipedia? My reaction was no, although I concede that I may be wrong. Secondly, with the letter actually being written by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Daniels_92ac.html" title="Charlie Daniels">Charlie Daniels</a>, is the letter copyvio?

<dd>I'm going to have to agree with Smoddy; stating your interests is relevant, because it helps other editors find you. For example, listing my Ph.D. on my page helps others realize that I am a good source of information with regard to theology. However, an open letter to Benedict XVI in my user space wouldn't be relevant to my work here. If WU wants to write an open letter, he should do it on his hard drive or on a free hosting site, like Yahoo!. If it's a copyvio, then that just makes it worse. The user should be warned to avoid personal attacks, and blocked for 24 hours for disruption if the letter-posting and/or attacks continue. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 22:40, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm inclined to agree with Essjay. Some unrelated content, like the pictures people have on their user page are, IMO, fine. An open letter of complaint to the Wikipedia community is fine. Even Cognition's man-beasts, while distasteful, are useful in identifying him/her as a LaRouchie. But open letters to celebrities are not connected to Wikipedia. Of course, if it's a copyvio there's no excuse for it to be there at all. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 23:26, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If I came across this chap's edits in the normal course of events I might summarily block him for having an inappropriate username for Wikipedia, or at least have a word with him about engaging in political advocacy (his userpage). However he has made an apparently good faith VfD and this is being taken seriously, and I have taken part in the discussion, so I don't feel comfortable dealing with him as an administrator. But it does seem to me that he probably intends to use Wikipedia as part of some campaign. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:38, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Er... good faith nomination? In the nomination, he directly accuses <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> and others of being "racists" (I would block him for that personal attack). His userpage, which I wish you hadn't forced me to read, ew, verifies my worst fears about his motives. The irony is that he is most certainly the racist. Oh well, I guess we're not all Jews this week, maybe we'll be Muslims. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 05:48, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think Dmcdevit captured my feeling exactly. I don't know if you could call it a good faith VfD, but if nothing else, someone needs to remove the personal attacks on Mustaafa. I won't do anything, since I don't want to be accused of taking racism personally (again), and I have edited his VfD.

<dd>(I'll warn you I just had a run-in with sockpuppets on VfD today, so I may be on high-alert.) <i>But</i>, any account that is created with a throwaway username, makes its first few edits to VfD a contoversial topic and make racist personal attacks, and then makes allusions to Wikipedia's past and familiarity with an established Wikipedian ("it has been established time and time again on wikipedia that Mustafaa is biased against Whites and Jews") reeks of sockpuppetry. I don't know what conflicts Mustafaa's been in, but this is no newbie. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 06:32, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Absolutely. This guy was obviously a sock puppet. I don't have a problem with socks per se, only abusive socks.

<li>That question is a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_dichotomy.html" title="False dichotomy">false dichotomy</a>. ProudWHITEIsraeli is mostly only disruptive in the context of his racist user page, personal attacks and sockpuppetry, not the username. If the hypothetical ProudBLACKIsraeli acted the same, then the same would apply to him. And by the way, ProudWHITEIsraeli is also not accused of racism because of his name, but because of his own words (read the user page, he thiks all Blacks should go back to Africa!). I think either proudWHITEIsraeli (or BLACK) would be an acceptable name if it were in the context of a history of valuable contributions. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 00:35, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think these edits establish very well that this editor has a style extremely reminiscent of Enviroknot--in effect, a charm-free zone. The pattern of articles edited, and subjects, also closely fit the Enviroknot pattern.</p>

<li>User:Envirofuck is Yuber Sockpuppet. It's Existentializer's own user page and he can moderate it as he see's fit.

<dd>No, I am not, DreamGuy. I took a look at the users in question and I've watched Existentializer's page ever since mine was vandalized. YOU have been repeatedly told to stop making the edits you're continually reverting at Talk:Vampire by multiple users, not just Existentializer, and it is quite clear that you are in the wrong. Accusing someone of being a sockpuppet to get rid of people who stand in the way of your conduct is no way to act on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/i/-/User%7ENi-ju-Ichi_78ab.html" title="User:Ni-ju-Ichi">Ni-ju-Ichi</a> 05:37, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, but the only "multiple users" reverting that page are the now banned user, an editor who has a long history of reverting my edits no matter what they are (see his <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Gabrielsimon_9319.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Gabrielsimon">RfC</a>) and yourself (a clear sock... allegedly watching his page since it was vandalized in no way explains your sudden need to jump into and make edits to all the same articles he was making, and your history here is short and extremely suspicious, not to mention your comments use the same over the top accusatory style trying to quote policies you as a new user would likely be unfamiliar with). You can deny it all you want, but your edit history makes it all too clear. Claiming mutliple users oppose my actions when it's really only one (you) and then a person who doesn't oppose my edits so much as everything I do (all the way to his reverting my edits when I changed capitalization in articles to fit the Manual of Style) is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts... and one clearly calculated by a person banned mutliple times and trying to game the system to get his way. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 06:13, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to remind everybody that WP is not a project to emulate western jurisdiction. It is a project to write an encyclopedia. No real-life disadvantages arise for unjustly blocked users. Fairness is an <i>a posteriori</i> desideratum, in the interest of a good community spirit. I do think the evidence acted upon by Tony is conclusive enough, although the arbcom may want to have a word in this. I repeat that I think admins badly need to see IPs to facilitate decisions such as Tony's. Also, note that <a href="../../../n/i/-/User%7ENi-ju-Ichi_78ab.html" title="User:Ni-ju-Ichi">User:Ni-ju-Ichi</a> has been accused of being a sock <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ni-ju-Ichi&amp;oldid=19122847" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ni-ju-Ichi&amp;oldid=19122847" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>.

<p>As I indicated at first, I did not initially think a block on Existentializer necessary while we investigated his then-suspected status as a sock of Enviroknot. I did watch him closely, however, and his persistent abusive behavior led me to conclude that a block was justified. We assume good faith, but that doesn't mean we stand back and permit some editors to abuse others. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 07:18, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Enviroknot is known to change IPs very frequently, but I will post a message on David Gerard's talk page. Since Enviroknot recently was banned by the ArbCom, this may be something David can look into. Still, this is a very obvious case with Ni-ju-Ichi and Kurita77 (another one of Enviroknot's sockpuppets) being the <i>only</i> users to ever edit <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eyeshield_21_%28anime%29.html" title="Eyeshield 21 (anime)">Eyeshield 21 (anime)</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eyeshield_21_%28anime%29&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eyeshield_21_%28anime%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>.

<dd>At the very least, I think that demonstrable evidence of disruptive or anti-policy activity pre-block on Ni-ji-Ichi's part should be put forward. He's upset, but I think that's understanable.

<dd>Concur, personally I think potential non-disruptive though abusive sock puppets ought to go through the RfC process. I think that there is enough uncertainty that one can't directly claim that Ni-ji-Ichi == Enviroknot.

<dd>Enviroknot is banned by the ArbCom and thus all of his sockpuppets are also banned. I've provided evidence above that Ni-ju-Ichi is Kurita77 and it was already proven that Kurita77 was Enviroknot. I <b>strongly</b> request that the block be reinstated. I've already asked David Gerard to examine the IP evidence, but as Enviroknot uses dynamic IPs, I'm not sure how much he;ll be able to learn. If Ni-ju-Ichi has concerns, he may present his case to the mailing list or on his talk page. So far, he has done neither. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 22:14, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I sent my concerns to the mailing list. I got a "your submission has been rejected enviroknot" message back. This is total BS. I'm not a sockpuppet and I'm not Enviroknot.

<p>note that Enviroknot will almost certainly be back in more incarnations. He has been known to repeatedly lie through his teeth about his identity, and to adapt his behaviour to the way he was found out in earlier instances. The best of these so far was the story about the neighbor cutting his cable in the garden (Kurita77, I believe? I think that was supposed to explain why he had the same IP as Enviroknot&#160;:) Any new account with a strong interest in Enviroknot and similar edit patterns will very likely be another sockpuppet.

<dd>Looking at Pukachu's history quickly, it appears the only fight this editor is in <b>is</b> with you, DreamGuy. The only other controversy has been regarding the common courtesy of leaving talk-page notification of major edits, and that was an erroneous communication which happened only because I spoke to the other involved user on IRC trying to get them to be less combative and more courteous about mentioning large-scale changes on talk pages in the interest of wikilove. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevilbat_23b1.html" title="User:Devilbat">Devilbat</a>

<p>I am not a sockpuppet and I have been put through too much lately. I make good edits.

<dd>I was not "attacking any editor who posts there". Mostly I was pointing out when people were acting like sockpuppets (remember, two of them I identified previously were confirmed as sockpuppets of a well known troublesome editor who was banned for a year from all of Wikipedia), following the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppets_c28f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppets">Wikipedia:Sockpuppets</a> policy, and also identifying false claims of people who were attacking me instead of working toward consensus (and two of those were recently blocked elsewhere for other violations of Wikipedia policy, proving my case that they are problem editors). Pukuchu has already been blocked twice recently for highly abusive actions of the exact nature of taken by Existentializer previously, so the plea for innocence is quite misplaced. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 23:38, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now that we've gotten that out of the way, can we get to the truth? I came to the Vampire article in good faith, trying to get people to sort this nonsense out. My first edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AVampire&amp;diff=20242244&amp;oldid=20240008" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AVampire&amp;diff=20242244&amp;oldid=20240008" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> was to that effect, suggesting that we split the two articles off and leave the main Vampire page as disambiguation. This seems to have been taken to heart by Pukachu, but I think that is merely because it makes sense if we are splitting off sections from the article.</p>
<p>You can freely examine the rest of my edits if you wish.</p>
<p>Further, DreamGuy makes reports and accusations here and THEN uses his own reporting to insinuate that users are illegitimate? Or he makes edits on one page encouraging "fresh blood" to the <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire.html" title="Vampire">vampire</a> article but insists on that page's talk page that all editors with less than 100 edits be barred from contributing? I am sorry but these are not the actions of a good-faith editor, they are the mark of a control freak and someone who needs to take some wikibreak time to get a grip on his emotions. At least that is how I see it. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevilbat_23b1.html" title="User:Devilbat">Devilbat</a></p>

<dd>Cute, Devilbat called himself DevilBat so the sockpuppet tag got placed in the wrong location. That's fixed now though. The less than 100 edits thing is simply following Wikipedia policy on what to do when there are known sockpuppets about, not something I made up. You have been just as abusive as the others, but then you hide behind anon users clearly linked to Enviroknot to do most of your battling for you, and then go try to stir up trouble with other editors like <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliasAlucard_fc0e.html" title="User:EliasAlucard">User:EliasAlucard</a> so they do more fighting too.

<p>Please can somebody investigate whether the series of page moves made by user:John Kenny of Russian queen consorts was apropriate. I have reverted his move of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_of_Hesse_d151.html" title="Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse">Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse</a> to <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_%28Alix_of_Hesse%29_9fb5.html" title="Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)">Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)</a> as there is currently quite a contentious discussion/vote over what the title of that article should be, but <i>Alexandra Fyodorvna (Alix of Hesse)</i> has no support votes and 1 oppose vote. He moved a whole lot of other articles to similar titles, all afaict without any discussion on the talk pages concerned.</p>
<p>He has proposed a standard, at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28biographies%29_8bf5.html#Inadequate" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (biographies)">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (biographies)#Inadequate</a>, but (again afaict), this is not linked to from any of the talk pages concerned (with the exeption of the Alexandra of Hesse talk page - in a comment left after the page move), so many of the editors will not be aware of it. It is not the clearest discussion in the world, but I can't see any consensus for any proposal there at all.</p>
<p>I am tempted to revert all the page moves, but don't want to get into a war over it, and so I would like to get consensus here. As John is an administrator, page move protection would not stop a move war. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 11:05, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, in my opinion, regarding those who still were under their German birth names, the Kenney moves were towards better direction, but arrived not in the best placements yet. Those ladies could well be at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Fedorovna_of_Denmark_8164.html" title="Maria Fedorovna of Denmark">Maria Fedorovna of Denmark</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Alexandrovna_of_Hesse_5216.html" title="Maria Alexandrovna of Hesse">Maria Alexandrovna of Hesse</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Fedorovna_of_Prussia_a0d7.html" title="Alexandra Fedorovna of Prussia">Alexandra Fedorovna of Prussia</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_Alexeievna_of_Baden_b37d.html" title="Elisabeth Alexeievna of Baden">Elisabeth Alexeievna of Baden</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Fedorovna_of_Wurttemberg_7f36.html" title="Maria Fedorovna of Wurttemberg">Maria Fedorovna of Wurttemberg</a>, instead of those parenthetical disambig placements which mix Russian and German first names. I am however not asking to revert them to German names. And, Thryduulf did very correctly when returning <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_of_Hesse_d151.html" title="Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse">Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse</a> to its that location which is awaiting the result of the vote. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 17:16, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Speaking as an admin, I could well understand John's frustration with the situation. The vote had reached stalemate, mainly as a result of one contributor's determination not to comply with naming standards. This contributor had previously himself carried out a move without consensus, and I had done so prior to that (before this round of voting began), for much the same reason as John. So yes, it was wrong, but not as mind-numbingly so as the current title is. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 17:46, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Deb is correct in her summary. The vote is stalemated not because a decision can't be taken but because one contributor is determined not to comply with naming standards. I don't think the name picked was right, but the current title is ludicrous and unworkable. John's frustration with the determination of one user to force their clearly wrong name on the page is understandable. (BTW, in case someone misinterpets this: the user in question is <i>not</i> <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> who is also simply trying to untangle the mess.) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Ireland coa.png">Image:Ireland coa.png</a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 18:06, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></dd>

<p>It should be remembered that (1) Deb and F.Eire (above) are users also involved in the vote and discussion, and they have attempted to win voters for THEIR alternative (but are not successful enough), (2) there are no naming standards (except possibly in imagination of Deb and F.Eire) against which the current heading would straightforwardly be, (3) altogether six users have voted for keeping the present heading, (not only one as Deb and F.Eire try to misrepresent above), (4) Deb seems to confess that her attempt to move the page was without consensus and thus not rightful, and it is good to note her that original involvement in the issue, (5) there seems to exist certain bitterness from the part of Deb and F.Eire against those who have not complied to the alternative they personally have ben proponents for in this question. (Actually, such bitterness is clearly displayed even in their comments written above. The problem can be seen as Deb, F.Eire and possibly a few others being not ready to comply with the right of others to vote according to their understanding and own opinion, not according to Deb-F.Eire opinion.) This is quite funny, but also quite petty from their part. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 20:59, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Particularly, administrator should be a person who is patient and unfrustrated enough to respect the discussion, respect the vote, and not attempting to push their own personal preference over others.

<dd>And still he goes on, mispresenting everything said, making Deb sound like a cross between Stalin and Hitler in drag (as those who know her know well, Deb is one of the politest, fairest and most genuine wikipedians around!), blaming everyone else when his unilateral naming goes wrong, etc. And you wonder why John is so fed up with what everyone has to put up with on the stage.

<p>I'd like an second opinion on the manner in which this VfD was declared "No consensus". At my count there were 2 Keeps, 5 BJAODN, and 5 Deletes.<br />

<p>I'd interpret that vote as <b>delete</b>, insofar as the article namespace is concerned, with a mandate of sorts to translate the article to BJAODN. That said, Tony's suggestion that it be re-listed within a month is understandable, but we really don't want that sort of parody article masquerading as a real one, do we? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 13:04, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I will second the interpretation that this should be a <b>Delete</b> consensus. <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_deletion_e10e.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion</a> states “<b>BJAODN</b> is a shorthand for "Delete but keep a copy in <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense</a>, deleting the resultant redirect".” --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 13:29, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I didn't feel comfortable interpreting the BJAODN's as deletes. As the quote from the guide to VfD makes clear, they're completely different animals in terms of the final disposition of the material. Had there been consensus to BJAODN, or to delete, I would have been happy to perform either task. While it is my practise to interpret VfD's in a very strict manner intended to be predictable, transparent, impartial and accountable, I often choose to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> on my own account as an editor following a closing operation, making it clear that this is not part of closing. In this case clearly it wasn't acceptable to leave the parody as the current version so on my own account I removed the parody text and left the article as a stub. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 07:52, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I've stepped in and deleted the article, per the VFD consensus. Voting to send an article to BJAODN has <i>never</i> meant keeping it in the article namespace, and this seems like eccentric wikilawyering on Tony's part to override a consensus on an article he personally wanted to keep. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 14:00, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>For the record, Tony restored it, then blanked the article and replaced its text with a sentence or two on a school. While I see no harm in the stub as it stands now, I'm rather baffled why Tony thought the article history should have been undeleted. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 17:30, July 30, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It looks like he restored the history because the current stub was salvaged from the past article, and he didn't write it. Therefore, restoring the history would be the correct action. Personally, I think Tony's actions were the best way to diffuse the situation. We could have had a huge clamor over a bad article being kept, or had a bad article deleted, now we have a decent article, and any further clamor is moot. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 04:36, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There were quite a number of BJAODN votes, so for license reasons I didn't think deleting the history was appropriate--any editor who wants to can freely add text from the history to <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">WP:BJAODN</a>, but only as long as we comply with the GFDL. The current content of the article is not new; I didn't blank the article. What is there now is the introductory text of the original, kept as a stub <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Calvary_Christian_High_School&amp;diff=19919705&amp;oldid=18776878" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Calvary_Christian_High_School&amp;diff=19919705&amp;oldid=18776878" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> (another reason to keep the history).</dd>
<dd>Some people have argued that the BJAODN's should have been interpreted as "deletes", and I was tempted to do that, but for licensing reasons again I think that's a misconception. Using material from an article licensed under GFDL would require that the history be kept; in the case of deletion we remove everything. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 06:44, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's bad form to block a user you're involved in a dispute with unless it's very clear cut (i.e. straight vandalism). Ril is a good contributor, and it seems to me that he was acting in good faith - if not completely in the right. It seems a bit harsh to just block him without warning. I'm not going to second-guess you and unblock him myself, but I think it would be a good idea to do so. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 14:07, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "disruption" blocking provision is intended for dealing with users who won't stop. Ril is not in that category. There are plenty of better ways to deal with this without resorting to a block. Regular contributors who are to be blocked using the disruption provision should be warned first, and there should be discussion among admins before the block. If sie adds a VfD listing again, just remove it, or wait for another admin to do so. I will be watching for such listings myself.</p>
<p>I have unblocked Ril and asked Ril to quit relisting <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authentic_Matthew_7546.html" title="Authentic Matthew">Authentic Matthew</a> on VfD. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 15:00, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since Ril has pulled this stunt before (on <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Muslims_d2ab.html" title="Historical persecution by Muslims">Historical persecution by Muslims</a>), s/he clearly "won't stop". Relisting things that just got done with failing to get a VfD consensus after considerable voting is clearly disruptive, and intentionally so.

<dd>-Ril- is known for vengeful behavior when he does not get his way. When this happens, he will do anything in his power, use any Wiki trick, to get his way. It has happened a lot recently. Disruption is -Ril-'s real name, from using a name others can't use, to lying and unethical Wiki conduct, to a second 3RR in a few days, to edit war after edit war (where he totally refuses to even consider any point), to this action (which I have no knowledge of except what is written here and on his talk page). --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 00:08, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have my own problems with Ril but that's a matter for the AC. Blocking someone is not something to be done lightly, and abusing the "disruption" item in the blocking policy is a sure way for us to lose <i>any</i> discretion in this area. Believe me, I like blocking trolls and troublemakers, but Ril is a contributor albeit a problematic one. The appropriate thing to do would have been to delete the VfD, leave a note on Ril's talk, and leave it at that. Were Ril to re-add the VfD a second or third time within the space of a few hours, a block would have been appropriate. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 00:29, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is good news. I've hardly ever heard anything so funny as calling someone "banned by the community" when half the people who have commented have called the ban inappropriate. Further, I have seen nothing from Plautus to warrant a year's block. If he were a new user we wouldn't be doing this. We'd just say he's being a little obnoxious; we wouldn't even be at RfC stage yet. Remember, once one's time is served one gets a clean slate and becomes again a user in good standing. I think we should give him a while to settle in. The problem, most likely, is built up animosity (on both sides). So let's just stress that this is a clean slate. No hard feelings.

<dd>I imagine that the mocking tone of the note on his talkpage, and the confident signature in the name of "the community", has made Plautus appear as a victim in people's eyes. Gloating easily backfires on Wikipedia.

<dd>I wouldn't have unblocked him myself. I was just taken aback a bit by his protected talkpage.

I think by now it's fairly obvious that Plautus is not here to help build an encyclopedia. It's time he was shown the door. To Dbachmann - his talk page was protected because, with Tim Starling's recent patch, user's can edit talk pages even while blocked. So when blocked, Plautus would use his talk page to rant. That's why it was protected. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 20:44, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia may not be a bureaucracy, but really, this is the kind of heavy handedness that leads to people muttering about cabals and arbitrariness and unfairness and all sorts of nonsense. The bigger the project becomes - Hell, the bigger a community becomes, it becomes more and more imperative (and some would say inevitable for survival purposes) for informal customs to become formalized rules. Certainty becomes required, precedent becomes required, not from-the-hip justice. Perhaps it's just my legal and historical training showing, but if we are to be able to justifiably say that there are certain types of conduct we do not tolerate, at the very least we should set out this criteria properly. After all, if Wikipedia is supposed to be a consensus community, shouldn't we get a consensus from the community before we sanction people in the name of the community? --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 08:02, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Why does it matter at all if he rants some on his own talk page? It is not an encyclopedia article and should do little harm, so long as he's not just posting copyvios or personal attacks. Immediate protection would seem heavy handed, if he has legitimate complaint about the block he should be able to use the feature for what it was meant for, at least, and talk page should not be protected just because he has been blocked. After all, that would prevent other Wikipedians from communicating with him too. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 22:28, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>You all may recall about 3 weeks ago, an anonymous editor from various IP addresses in the 69.2__.* range was making disruptive edits at <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>, insisting on inserting language clearly elevating Jews to a position of prominence in the imposition of apartheid in .za.

Well, now he's back, and seems to have switched ISPs, possibly specifically for the purpose of pursuing his insertions (despite clear consensus that they were inappropriate). My review of the situation is as follows:</p>

<dd>Well, I've blocked him for an hour just to get him to stop deleting this discussion (which is surely vandalism).

<p>This is clearly someone's sockpuppet. And is clearly being used in a disruptive way.

<p>A few days ago an anon asked for admin help on the Hep desk, so (not knowing what I was getting myself into) I volunteered myself. The anon turned out to be User:Universaliss, who left me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADmcdevit&amp;diff=19831262&amp;oldid=19826173" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADmcdevit&amp;diff=19831262&amp;oldid=19826173" rel="nofollow">this</a> message asking me to block another user (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">Freestylefrappe</a>) who he was invloved in a dispute with on <a href="../../../q/i/y/Qiyamah.html" title="Qiyamah">Qiyamah</a>, claiming the other is a vandal. I had no invlovement or prior knowledge of the incident, and so tried to do the best I could to mediate. In response, I left a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AUniversaliss&amp;diff=19833283&amp;oldid=19831348" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AUniversaliss&amp;diff=19833283&amp;oldid=19831348" rel="nofollow">message</a> on Universaliss's talk page explaining some of our dispute resolution procedures, since, having taken a quick look at the related talk page, it initially looked like a content dispute, not vandalism. However, both parties had thrown around some level of personal attacks, neither warned, so I also left an open warning against all personal attacks. Freestylefrappe insisted on my talk page that I was being too hesitant in not blocking Universaliss immediately for personal attacks. But since Freestylefrappe was the first to make the next personal attack, I blocked him for 24 hours. Then this morning I noticed Universaliss doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qiyamah&amp;diff=19940304&amp;oldid=19932520" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qiyamah&amp;diff=19940304&amp;oldid=19932520" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit, obvious vandalism. It now seems to me that he was acting in bad faith from the beginning, and has always been a vandal, POV pusher, and personal attacker. His plea for help was most likely an attempt to dupe me into blocking Freestylefrappe so he could get on with it. For extreme bad faith, vandalism, and personal attacks, I have blocked Universaliss for a week. I guess I'm asking if other admins could review my actions help me monitor the situation in the future.

<dd>I was concerned to avoid sounding sarcastic or like I was taking the mickey, so I avoided test1, yes. You think I should have been even tenderer of Sam's feelings; I understand where you're coming from, but I don't agree. If the template is not too unkind to use on newbies or passing anons, I think it's good enough for when a contributor with over 25,000 edits has inserted nudity in an architectural article. As for my avoiding addressing Sam in, so to speak, my own voice, he explains the circumstances behind that in the flame that follows the template on his <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade">talk page</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:06, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you don't want to talk to someone because of past bad feelings - fair enough. But using a template on a user who has, as you say, 25000 edits and so certainly knows a template when he sees one is bound to be imflammatory. If you don't want to speak to him, then don't edit his talk page at all.

<dd>Hang on, I'm not sure I understand all this. A user with 25k edits ought to know better than to post boobies on an architecture article! It wasn't an accident, so I don't get worrying about Sam's <b>feelings</b> in this case at all. Newbies and passing IP's who put their favorite breasts pictures up might be clueless, but Sam had to know exactly what he was doing. As such, it had to be a fairly deliberate act of sabotage/vandalism, and personally I wouldn't worry about his feelings when he has as much as said that he doesn't care for the rest of the project's (or the project's goals). As for whether Bishonen should have been on his page, the person reverting should be warning. Leaving it for somebody sometime isn't our way. This exchange strikes me as very odd -- Bishonen's tenderness of Sam's feelings and Theresa's further tenderness. Maybe I'm just extra mean, but I don't see any need for delicacy in a case like this one. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:54, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just to keep my comments together, and to explain away from the "personal attack" bit. When someone scrawls "FART" in an article, that person is trying to attract attention to the rude word and destroy the effectiveness of the article. It is an effort at destroying the article. Similarly when someone puts up breasts or penises or vaginas or whatever, the purpose is to say "Look at me! Look at me!" and, simultaneously, destroy the article's function as part of an encyclopedia. Therefore, the person who does this has respect neither for the feelings of Wikipedians nor the goals of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:40, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Theresa, I can appreciate your good intentions, but I do find myself in agreement with George and Bishonen on this, and I feel you've oversimplified this whole silly hyperbole (inadvertantly, of course). I would ask you to reexamine some of the evidence, but since you are likely on (or soon will be in) a plane right now, I will leave that as an open statement. My own protest is elsewhere. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 05:02, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well I'm not leaving intil noon So I'll respond. It's not a question of tenderness. It's a question of policy. What Sam did was either a good faith attempt to improve the article, or a bad faith attempt to damage it. There is no way we can tell. So we assume good faith until proven otherwise. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(a tenth stroke)</a> 06:42, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Heh, well... how very elusive of you, to still be here, then! In isolation, I would assume it as sillyness (positively), shortlived, and all political-correctness nonsense and puritanical baggage aside, smileworthy. My grievences are mostly related to a key piece of this narrative, but I'd rather not get involved further beyond my own personal protest, for what I feel (and if pressed, can demonstrate) are obvious reasons.

<p>When have I ever remotely suggested in any way that I don't care about the projector its goals? I find that an absurd personal attack. BTW, there was no need for an admin w a recent history of aggression towards me to accuse me of vandalism, if I were truely vandalising, there are hundreds of perfectly sensible, impartial admins who would take care of the problem.

<p>Not only do they make lousy pictures to illustrate the Skybridge (there are people obstructing the foreground), the images are probably also a copyright infringement.

<dd>Well, I think they're very intriguing young women, and they are quite pretty, and I enjoy boobies as much as the next guy (maybe more than the next Wikipedian guy, but that's another matter), but they kind of aren't the <i>point,</i> when you get down to it. The point is knowingly putting the pictures in, thereby vandalizing (see above). I just don't think that "assume good faith" applies when you have 99:100 pieces of evidence suggesting that there's no need to assume and the faith wasn't good (esp. when the reasoning for doing it is, essentially, I like chicks and removing the picture is censorship). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:16, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously that user page is in poor taste, but I disagree about the libel (in the legal meaning). In order to qualify as libel under US law, a person's statements must do harm to the victim's reputation. Given the context, I can't imagine any reasonable person taking those statements seriously. Hence there is no harm and by definition no libel. Admittedly, a little bizarre that one can get away with what would otherwise be defamation by virtue of surrounding it with idiocy, but that's my take anyway. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 06:06, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>10:39, 1 August 2005, Jimbo Wales blocked Skyring (expires 10:39, 8 August 2005) (contribs) (unblock) <i>(temporary block until the arbcom rehearing)</i></dd>

<p>Skyring came back and promptly started up against Jtdirl again, and so has been blocked by Jimbo personally while the AC gets onto it quick-smart.</p>
<p>Note that I will be recused from the case (I have openly stated what I think of Skyring's material at length), so I'm just another admin in this context. I should note, though, that although the IP evidence for the last month's sockpuppets wasn't enough to <i>nail</i> Skyring (and he couldn't take the <i>really strong hints</i> that we were most unhappy and that he should desist, could he), it would would certainly be enough IMO for an AC finding that it was Skyring - same aims, as per stated MO, from the same city. I will be offering evidence to this effect.</p>

<dd>I think (hope) that this action has been taken since the ArbCom did not actaully address the harassment aspect of the original case. There were no provisions where Skyring could be blocked for harassing other users, which was a significant aspect of the original case if you care to read it. Skyring has made it plain in a number of forums including his live journal and the mailing list that he intends to provoke Jtdril. In addition his inital block was also never reset despite evidence of sockpupperty, which according to the original ruling it should have been. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 13:12, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He seems to be getting back into this business lately. We have an ArbCom; they can issue an injunction if they want. Either Skyring does something uncontroversially blockable by an admin, or is put under an injunction, or else his behavior must not be all that bad, so we should just let it go.

<dd>From what I've seen, Jimbo usually steps in when the AN or mailing list are convulsed with self-recrimination and navel gazing. He will make a decision that allows the rest of us to move on with the important business of building an encyclopedia. Short of asking the Foundation to dethrone Jimbo, I really can't see any way to remove his powers—and I wouldn't want to, anyway. He has absolute power, but it is used sparingly and reasonably.

<dd>...and I was wondering why <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">User:Skyring</a> was masking his username with the name <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">pete</a>... <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 15:55, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't call that 'masking'—at least, I wouldn't want to imply it was deliberately deceptive. From his user page, 'Pete' is actually his name in the real world. We have a number of editors who use a name in their sig which doesn't match (or even include) their username. As long as the sig points at the proper editor's user space, I'd say that it is annoying but not actually harmful. Note that Jtdirl, for instance, also doesn't have his username in his sig (he signs as FearÉIREANN). <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 16:32, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

I blocked this range--only the 203.166.96 portion--for a week once, and received messages from innocent, and regular users (<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinorEdit_0301.html" title="User:MinorEdit">User:MinorEdit</a> comes to mind) who use this IP range; I ended up relenting and unblocking the first day.

<dd>Block them, and leave a note on the offending IP user pages inviting the school administrators or teachers to get in touch with you/us to discuss how to best proceed. If there is collateral damage, explain to those affected, politely of course, that it is the schools that are the problem and perhaps they should cc this e-mail to the school admins as well. Ultimately, if they don't police themselves, we will. That's the approach I'm taking with persistent Singaporean school vandals (since I'm in Singapore now and am more than willing to talk to the teachers). --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 05:25, August 2, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This was discussed a while back (I'm sure someoen will remember where). The outcome, iirc, was:
<ul>
<li>that it isn't currently technically possible to limit moves in this way</li>
<li>there was concern that the vandal would just make x nonsense edits before moving</li>
<li>It is technically possible to deny the move priv to the newest 1% of accounts. I believe this was implemented.</li>
<li>A feature request was made to allow page moves to be rolled back like article edits. This, and page move logging, was implemented in MediaWiki 1.5.</li>
<li>It would be useful in these situations to limit the number of page moves a non-administrator can do in 24 hours (iirc 3 was suggested). I don't think this is currently technically possible, but I don't recall what became of this discussion.</li>

Indeed, there was a flurry of silly activity. Wikipedia is not a chat room. A joke or two is OK, but if the whole contribution of an account is joking, I see this as trolling and have reasons to suspect sock puppetry.</p>
<p>I will unblock the account, since you are vouching for it, but if its main activity will be fooling around, it will be blocked again. In addition to disrupting the editing process, this frolicking is an unnecessary burden for wikipedia servers.

<dd>Thank you for unblocking my account.</dd>
<dd>Now to the reasoning. First of all, one jocular edit by no means implies that a user, be s/he new or not, is acting in bad faith. I still have to see evidence to support your claim of "silly activity". Secondly, I have no reason to use sock puppets, either for vandalism or for other reasons; it follows that I do not use them. Furthermore, I could end up a paranoid schizophrenic, an undesirable state of being to anyone.</dd>
<dd>This is all I have to say in reply to your suspicions. I know that you meant well in blocking me, but I hope you understand that I am much too mature to be thinking of fooling around in an online encyclopedia.</dd>

<dd>Quite right. Aside from that, he did not warn the users of being blocked, <b>and</b> was acting entirely on his own suspicions. And he banned an innocent user for trolling, again based on his own presumptions that I was a sockpuppet, which I have denied many times but without a single dent on his perception of me. For the record, I set up this account at around the same time I set up the one at HP wiki.</dd>
<dd>The other thing is that mikka deleted my user and talk pages for containing seemingly offensive material, again without warning. The user and talk pages contain <i>no</i> offensive material of any sort. I'm beginning to think that this is more than an honest mistake...</dd>
<dd>As to that edit, if you (mikka) blocked me just because of that, I suggesr you block <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">User:Doc glasgow</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">User:SPUI</a>, and <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort">User:Lord Voldemort</a> for doing edts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Severus_Snape&amp;oldid=19312394" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Severus_Snape&amp;oldid=19312394" rel="nofollow">[76]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Severus_Snape&amp;diff=19463358&amp;oldid=19312394" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Severus_Snape&amp;diff=19463358&amp;oldid=19312394" rel="nofollow">[77]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Severus_Snape&amp;diff=19580514&amp;oldid=19469119" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Severus_Snape&amp;diff=19580514&amp;oldid=19469119" rel="nofollow">[78]</a> to User:Severus Snape's user page.

<p>I agree that I acted a bit in a haste, thus violating the blocking policy. Two of the three blocked accounts were definitely disrupting wikipedia. The third one (ChosenOne) may possibly be an innocent victim, because I wanted to stop all that nonsense immediately. Next time I promise I will issue a warning in a similar case, since, as I understand this now, there probably was no really malicious intentions, just kids had fun. Examples of other accounts the ChosenOne won't go, since these users have history of normal contributions. Once again, if your sole goal is to chat at talk pages, this is not the place for you. This is a disruption of work, if you are not actually discussing how to improve the article or other things related to work of wikipedia. You create an unnecessary clutter at talk page, so other people would have to spend lots of time to find something useful for article improvement in old discussions.</p>
<p>I suggested to ChosedOne to read <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">Wikipedia:Talk page</a>. It looks like he didn't, judging from his last remark "banning an innocent user for trolling", he still holds himself innocent. Here is the direct quote from the policy: <i>Wikipedians generally oppose the use of talk pages just for the purpose of partisan talk about the main subject. <b>Wikipedia is not a soapbox, it's an encyclopedia</b>. In other words, talk about the article, not about the subject. It's only the habits we encourage that keep Wikipedia from turning into another H2G2 or Everything2.</i></p>
<p>Dab, please don't worry. If you look into the block log, you will see that I am blocking rarely. I am not, like, a trigger-happy blocker. I simply forgot to refresh my knowledge of the policy and I am sorry. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:33, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems Mikka does not understand my point. I set up this account <i>after</i> I had set up the one at HP Wikicity; in other words, this is only a satellite account. The whole point of setting this account up was to communicate regularly with those HP editors who do not always work there. Everything that I wrote in talk pages here was relevant to Wikipedia (more precise4ly, an offshoot of WP), except of course when replying to other users' irrelevant questions.</dd>

<p>Actually you were blocked for repeat 3RR violations on multiple pages, and only after being warned to stop — the person you were warring with was also blocked. (And BTW I was not the person you were in dispute with at the time. (But then you were in dispute with just about everyone on the pages.) When you came back after a short block you went back to the pages <i>again</i> and began the exact same edit wars you had been warned to stop before. In one ten day period on just one page, <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_F%C3%A1il_a8d8.html" title="Fianna Fáil">Fianna Fáil</a>, you carried out <b>17</b> reversions. On another page, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, over six days you carried out <b>11</b> reversions. On <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland_887d.html" title="Parliament of Northern Ireland">Parliament of Northern Ireland</a> you carried out <b>23</b> reversions in 12 days. And that is just 3 examples of your behaviour. There are plenty more. You were repeately asked to stop. You were repeatedly informed by multiple users that what you were trying to put in breached NPOV rules. Instead you reduced multiple pages to chaos, and even after a 24 hour block for breaking the 3RR rule, you went straight back and started multiple edit wars on multiple pages. I was told subsequently by admins that you should have been blocked sooner, for longer, for your behaviour.</p>
<p>And yes, what you are doing is blatently POV. Wikipedia had a couple of Northern Ireland unionist users some time ago who bombarded Northern Ireland pages with pro-unionist terminology (calling Northern Ireland <i>Ulster</i> all over the place, writing biased anti-republican and anti-nationalist rants into articles, etc). They were stopped by users, many of the same users that you in all the pages you are fighting on are fighting with. Then you began, adding in loaded pro-republican terminology in articles. You know very well you <i>cannot</i> call the Northern State the <i>Six Counties</i>. That is POV language from one community, added in to give the <i>fuck you</i> message to unionists on Wikipedia, just as their adding in <i>Ulster</i> is a <i>fuck you</i> message to nationalists. We have to use neutral terminology and the agreed neutral term for the state on Wikipedia is the one registered with the UN and used in both British and Irish legislation as its name — <i>Northern Ireland</i>. At least twenty users on twenty pages have repeatedly pointed that out to you. You have repeatedly ignored them and waged edit wars all over the place. Other admins would have banned you for a far longer period for your antics. (One suggested you should be banned indefinitely). Wikipedia is not here for either side, unionist, nationalist, loyalist or republican, to doctor articles to add in a term they want and that they know will infuriate and offend people from the other tradition. (What is it about you lot on <i>both</i> sides: even when you come on to an encyclopædia you try to find some way to provoke the other.) As was said to the unionist POV-pusher also: grow up, stop waging stupid wars where you are in a minority of one against a long line of people on each page screaming at you to stop, and do some writing for a change, this time. And if you start running multiple edit wars on multiple pages to force your POV language down everyone's throats whichever admin catches you will probably block for a heck of a lot longer than the two blocks you have had so far. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Ireland coa.png">Image:Ireland coa.png</a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 05:14, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></p>

<dd>I have not checked, nor will I check, the contents disputes referred above. After all, they are rather obviously content disputes.I present my opinion based on what I have observed about Jtdirl's (F.Eire) behavior in general. Jtdirl is known to draw hasty conclusions, sometimes without proper basis. This has shown as his hasty accusations. Fitting to his said behavioral pattern, he is known to make very haste reverts and blocks. Even in one very contentious case, the Arbitration Committee admonished Jtdirl of making "blind reverts", and asked him to refrain from reverting valid edits. This means that an expert panel here has found Jtdirl having made baseless reverts, in heat of disputes. I also have seen that Jtdirl has sort of pontificating behavior here with less than sound basis (such as citing his own opinion as established policy), and some others (such as Jkenney) have also testified to the existence of such behavioral trait in Jtdirl. According to my observations, Jtdirl sometimes uses blind reverts and blockings as one weapon in disputes he is personally involved in. Jtdirl also has a habit of writing long rants in defense of his less desirable actions and sometimes has intellectually dishonest habit of denying even self-evident things, if such does not fit into his own desires. It seems to me that it is fully possible that Jtdirl has blocked another user in order to gain advantage in edit dispute. It is undeniable that Jtdirl has some close allies here and despite of shortcomings in his behavior and in his edits, usually finds some support, some of such however being not deserved in terms of objectivity. In general, I would describe Jtdirl as quite hot-headed user and not sufficiently mature to use "blind powers", such as reverting and blocking. My opinion is that Jtdirl should refrain from blocking and reverting altogether, as more mature persons could do that without causing so many problems and disruptions as Jtdirl sometimes causes. Jtdirl's role would be more fittingly to ask others to revert or to block than to be allowed to do such by himself. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 08:13, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have singularly failed to address any of the issues I raised, and have attempted to cloud the issue by bringing the content dispute here, where it does not belong. I broadly agree with the above assessment of your temperament. In my experience your tone ranges from ingratiating, to pompous, to downright hysterical when you do not get your way. You have misrepresented me here and in other places and ascribed political convictions to me based on your simplistic reading of certain of my edits. If other admins feel as you do, then ask them to comment here. Please focus on the points I made above concerning blocking policy. I especially look forward to your list of my factual innaccuracies.</p>

<dd>The "content dispute" (as you refer to your edit warring over the POV term "six counties"), is <i>exactly</i> what is at issue here. I'm sure you'd prefer everyone ignored your blatant POV-pushing across multiple articles, but that's not going to happen. This argument is not about whether Jtdirl is sufficiently polite to other users, it's about whether your block was justified by your behaviour. It's also interesting the way you claim to be insulted by having your edits described as <i>"sectarian"</i> while you see nothing wrong with calling other users <i>"pompous and hysterical"</i> Please avoid personal attacks. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 10:33, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Demiurge, I am thinking whether there are reasons for why you ask selectively to avoid personal attacks. I am sure Jtdirl prefers you to ignore personal attacks made by him, and labeled as perhaps "insufficient politeness" by everyone. Please kindly tell us have you ever asked Jtdirl to avoid personal attacks. (As he had made such for example above.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In my opinion, neither of the parties Jtdirl and LP are highly entitled to accuse each other of personal attacks, and we rest should ingore such accusations. The question here is whether Jtdirl made a block in a dispute he himself was involved in. Jtdirl's such action reeks of impropriety. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 12:31, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No I did not and no it does not. Just about every Irish user here has been caught up with dealing with LP's extreme POVing of articles. I was not involved anymore when I was AIMed by a third party (not themselves involved in the edit wars) who complained that LP had broken the 3RR. I checked, saw that he had on that page, then <i>instead of blocking him, as I could have done</i>, left a message on his page warning him that he had broken 3RR and should stop. He carried on regardless. My attention was then brought to the fact, by yet another person, that he had not just breached 3RR once but multiple times, and was continuing to do so. I therefore, as an admin, took action and banned <i>two</i> users from that page whose edit war had gone way above 3RRs. BTW the people who AIMed me were not combatants in the edit war. (I don't know why they happened to come to me. They just did.) And the person blocked with LP was someone whose edits I personally agreed with. But <i>both</i> were blocked for breaching 3RR. The second guy returned after a 24 hour block and didn't return to his past behaviour. LP returned and went straight back to all the edits and started the edit wars straight away again. He was again blocked to stop this. (BTW one of the many many edits he reverted was one I had made to an article some time earlier. Even though factually his edit was garbage, because I had been the one who blocked him I deliberately did not revert his edit to my own but left his there. It was later reverted by one of the large large numbers of people who have been involved in stopping his blatently POVing articles.</dd>
<dd>BTW <i>you</i> making an issue of supposed personal attacks, given the personalised, bitter and frankly ignorant attacks you have made on <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">User:Deb</a>, brings to mind the words <i>pot</i>, <i>kettle</i> and <i>black</i>. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Ireland coa.png">Image:Ireland coa.png</a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 14:00, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></dd>

You blocked me for 72 hours, minutes after I reverted to a version of the Northern Ireland page that included election results, that other users were determined to blank. When another user had previously reverted to my version, you left a message on that user's talk page asking them not to do so again, as you disagreed with that version. That's involved enough for me, even if it was'nt already made abundantly clear to me that you disagreed with many of my other edits. I don't believe I was in violation of the 3RR the first time you blocked me (for 24 hours), but I let it slide as you had also blocked another user, which I saw as the impartiality that becomes an administrator. I was definitely not in violation when the second block was instituted. When you threatened me with the longer block, I left a message on your talk page saying that I believed this would be abusing your administrative privileges. I believed that then, and I still believe it. Once again, you claim an edit of mine was "factually...garbage", and your proof is that another user reverted to your version. I stand by that edit, and I would gladly debate it with you on the relevant talk page. As you seem determined to accuse me of factual errors without backing it up in any way, perhaps you could start now. I cannot for the life of me see how the edit in question could be described as POV, but you and many others are fond of painting with broad strokes. I ask you again to concentrate on the points I made in my first entry.</p>

<li>I completely agree with Jtdirl's block of Lapsed Pacifict (even though I was the other person blocked). The specific circumstances of this block was multiple violations of the 3RR. That's pretty clear, I think. But the underlying problem of LP is his consistent refusal to accept the talk page consensus. On multiple articles, he continuously reverts wording that <i>everybody</i> else agrees with to a version that <i>nobody</i> agrees with but him. It doesn't matter what the subject of the dispute is, the fact is that this is not how Wikipedia should work. This is a basic Wikipedia policy that is continuously violated by Lapsed Pacifict, apparently in a attempt to push a specific POV. The above paragraph (claiming that other users were attempting to "blank" some election results) is a complete misstatement of the dispute.--<a href="../../../j/w/1/User%7EJW1805_0d7f.html" title="User:JW1805">JW1805</a> 18:37, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I have not read much of what has been discussed here because I am unequivical of what LP is doing - he is a professional vandal - by this I mean someone who is using wikipedias open policies to push and twist their own agenda at any cost and against many and diverse users in the past who have disagreed - for instance using pov terms as if they were bona fide official terms. The only reason why LP is complaining about Jtdirl is because Jtdirl is someone who has taken a tough stance againt his vandalism - LP will do his best to play the poor mouth and then use a system of never-ending-appeals to stay active and justify himself. The day that wikipedia becomes a haven for the type of activity that LP is justifying is a time for either tightening up wikipedia policies or withdrawing from the project. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 19:42, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>Just to explain to users who may be confused</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In Northern Ireland, both communities, the unionists and the nationalists, made a big issue of using language to push their own "we're winning, you're losing" agenda. Hence battles over whether to call the second city <a href="../../../l/o/n/Londonderry.html" title="Londonderry">Londonderry</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derry.html" title="Derry">Derry</a>. They play these games over the name of the region they live in. Some unionists call it <i>Ulster</i> to claim a historical heritage to the (larger) Irish province of <i><a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster.html" title="Ulster">Ulster</a></i> and so pretend it <i>really</i> existed before 1920. (It didn't. It was created in the <i><a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Ireland_Act_546c.html" title="Government of Ireland Act">Government of Ireland Act</a>, 1920</i>.) Some nationalists play similar one-upmanship games by calling the region the <i>Six Counties</i> or even the <i>Six Occupied Counties</i>, to suggest that Northern Ireland is a bastard creation of British occupation and has no validity at all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To avoid appearing to support <i>either</i> side, Wikipedia ignores the names used by both (the <i>Province</i>, <i>the North</i>, <i>Occupied Six Counties</i>, <i>Ulster</i>, <i>Six Counties</i>, the <i>North of Ireland</i>, etc (because each is used to try to give a spin that favours <i>their</i> community at the expense of the other) and only uses the legally registered name for the region, which is used by both the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland_013e.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a> and the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> in both their laws. As both sides use it, and it is the name registered with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> it is thoughout of as the least POV and most NPOV option available.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Periodically on Wikipedia, people come on and heavily push either a nationalist or unionist agenda by changing names around both to push their version of Northern Ireland history, and also give the two fingers to the other side and in effect say 'our arguments are right. You are wrong. Look, Wikipedia uses <i>our</i> names, not <i>yours</i>. Two months ago we had an extreme unionist who deleted <i>Northern Ireland</i> and replaced it everywhere with <i>Ulster</i>, made sure everywhere said <i>Londonderry</i>, removed things critical of unionist rule in Northern Ireland, etc. He was reverted on sight and eventually blocked for it. Lapsed Pacifist is pushing the other agenda. So wherever he sees <i>Northern Ireland</i> he replaces it <i>Six Counties</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whereever he sees text that does not unequivacally endorse <i>his</i> community's view he rewrites it to take on his community's POV.</p>

<dd>As with <i>Mr Ulster</i> (not his username, BTW, just what I called him because of his agenda!) before, LP has been challenged about this. As with <i>Mr Ulster</i> his edits have been reverted to the more neutral terminology, by a host of users, many of them the same people who stopped <i>Mr Ulster</i> twisting everything to be pro-unionist. LP has waged edit wars all over the place to force his community's language and ensure his community's version of history is accepted as <i>the</i> correct version. As with <i>Mr Ulster</i> when he went too far as breached the 3RR rule he was blocked. While <i>Mr Ulster</i> got the message and stopped, LP came straight back and started it all over again. He was again blocked, this time for longer. He has been told repeatedly that <i>Six Counties</i> is too POV a term to use. Apart from anything else it twists articles and makes them appear biased and offends readers from other community. All efforts to make him stop, by numerous contributors, initially politely, then bluntly when he made it quite clear that he didn't care two figs about NPOV, say every term but those used by his community exclusively as POV — both communities' terms are pretty much exclusive to <i>their</i> side and not used by the other side) he was getting his terminology in come what may. He reduced numerous articles to endless edit wars. Numerous others had <i>Six Counties</i> added in and no-one noticed. (Users have now done a Wikipedia-wide search of the encyclopædia as removed them.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, re the <i>blanking</i> he mentioned. That is dishonest use of language. The article was not blanked. POV information he added in was reverted by someone. He reinsterted it with an edit summary that claimed all he was doing was reverting some vandal's blanking of an article. Once upon a time, LP was a respected neutral contributor (though not as neutral as people thought when his old edits were later examined). Indeed it was because people initially presumed he was a genuinely neutral editor in all cases that when he began his <i>Six Counties</i> crusade he was not blocked, but given the benefit of the doubt <i>repeatedly</i> while appeal after appeal was made on page after page, asking him to stop. In the last few weeks he has become nothing more that a POV pest, determined to push his side's agenda where he can, whenever he can, as many times as he can, with as many reversions as he can get away with. It has been explained to him <i>at length</i> by many users on many pages why <i>Six Counties</i> is too POV a term to be used. He however has made it clear that he will continue to change <i>Northern Ireland</i> to <i>Six Counties</i> whenever he can get away with. As such he is engaged in little more than POV vandalism on those articles. The irony is that when he gets off his POV hobby horse he does very good work. But users never know anymore when they see an edit from him whether it is a good, NPOV edit, or another attempt to sneak in one community's POV into articles and delete anything from the other community's POV. Regrettably he does not seem to think that Wikipedia rules apply to him, whether NPOV language or the 3RR rule (and is annoyed that many users here dared stop him, and is furious that I dared block him for continuous breaking of the 3RR rule). That is what is going on, and why this complaint is here. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Ireland coa.png">Image:Ireland coa.png</a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 01:43, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></dd>

<p><br />
Again with the broad strokes. Much of what you have written above is inaccurate to the point of being dishonest, as would be obvious to anyone prepared to go into it in detail. You blocked me for 72 hours right after I made edits to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and the <a href="../../../%C3%A9/a/m/%C3%89amon_de_Valera_5d90.html" title="Éamon de Valera">Éamon de Valera</a> pages you disagreed with, which had nothing to do with the terminology dispute. I notice you are less-than-subtly altering your position from "factual errors all over the place" and "factually...garbage", to "very good work". You made what I consider to be an insulting accusation, I expect you to back it up or withdraw it. I still cannot figure out why no other admin has seen fit to comment here, when you claim they were in favour of a longer block, and sooner. You are blatantly and deliberately misrepresenting my edit on the Northern Ireland page as "POV information". They're election results, Jtd, and I can't see why anyone would want to blank them from a section called "Demographics and Politics", unless it is to promote their own POV, i.e. that people there vote for politicians they fundamentally disagree with. You neglected to mention that the term "Northern Ireland" falls squarely into one of the categories you mentioned, and your attempt to portray it as acceptable to both sides is dishonest. Your references to "my" community I found risible.</p>
<p>These content disputes have already been gone into on different talk pages (and with varying levels of emotion), e.g. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Talk%7EArticles_2_and_3_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland_27b3.html" title="Talk:Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland">Talk: Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland</a>. I want to get back to the original points made at the top of this section, which have yet to be addressed. Either Jtd was in violation of blocking policy, or he was'nt. Comments (especially from admins) please.</p>

<p>Yikes. Has any other non-involved, non-Irish editor read every word of the above? I don't see any administrator noticeboard material in it, just complaints from a user who's getting slapped for being too aggressive with POV. No RfC's are likely to result from this, unless at LP, so anything more is just wp:an/i being used as a venue for the same arguments in a new space. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:32, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Probably not. lol. LP is making a big issue of it because I enforced the rules and refused to allow him to POV articles. I thought it useful to the <i>facts</i> behind what really happened on the record so that users know what is <i>really</i> going on. Whether temporarily (possibly) or permanently (hopefully) LP has just being doing NPOV edits in the last few days. Hopefully his POVing days are over. If so I for one will be very happy. If however he returns to the <i>Six County</i> nonsense users will be able to see it and take action to stop it, now that their attention has been brought to it. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Ireland coa.png">Image:Ireland coa.png</a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 19:42, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></dd>

It could'nt be more in my interest that people know what is "really" going on. I have nothing to hide. My first entry on this page specifically said that Jtd and I had our differences. I deliberately have'nt made any edits or reverts recently that could be considered contentious as I did not believe that would be appropriate while this discussion was on the noticeboard. Users who dispute my edits have been less continent. Jtd, your efforts to portray a series of disputes as simply one of terminology is deliberately dishonest, especially given the timing of the block. And you have successfully evaded almost all of the points I put to you. The reason I am making an issue of this is because I believe you have violated the trust placed in you as an administrator. It's beyond me how anyone could consider this page an unsuitable venue for this discussion.</p>

<p>Discussing this here seems a little over-escalated to me, but it's the only discussion I know of outside the VfD pages in question. So I'll post my research here.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComCat_ab6c.html" title="User:ComCat">ComCat</a> has several recent VfD nominations, which I would classify as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 reasonable: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Earth_laid_upon_a_corpse_4137.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Earth laid upon a corpse">Earth laid upon a corpse</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_DemaSked_938a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/DemaSked">DemaSked</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Audaphobia_519c.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Audaphobia">Audaphobia</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Florencia_13_7995.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Florencia 13">Florencia 13</a>.</li>
<li>2 not so reasonable: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Hunters_of_the_Dusk_7b93.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Hunters of the Dusk">Hunters of the Dusk</a> (a novel with about 5000 Google hits), <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Del_O%27Conner_2abb.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Del O'Conner">Del O'Conner</a> (a neo-Nazi leader).</li>
<li>and 3 flat-out unreasonable: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Carlos_Lozada_43e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Carlos Lozada">Carlos Lozada</a> (a Medal of Honor recipient), <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Larry_Hoover_320d.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Larry Hoover">Larry Hoover</a> (a very notable criminal), <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Hermann_Bauer_7d67.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Hermann Bauer">Hermann Bauer</a> (a WWI German submarine fleet commander).</li>
</ul>
<p>Just my opinions, of course, but I think most people would mostly agree. So, he's not just spewing out all bad ones. But I'd sure like to know why the heck he nominated those last three.</p>

<p>Could someone please take a second look at this VfD? Tony Sidaway already closed it with a result of "no consensus", but I see five "delete" votes, two with a helping of "transwiki", and one "keep" vote. The transwiki is already in process, so the article should be deleted. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 06:23, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A number of people did support transwiki (which would imply delete) and others voted delete when told that the transwiki was in process. I made the total five valid votes for delete/transwiki (one delete discounted because the voter is too new). One anonymous vote was also disregarded. There was one vote for keep and one well argued vote against transwiki. With 5 out of 7 for delete/transwiki, 71%, not what I'd normally view as a consensus according to the standards I have sought to apply uniformly for some time now. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:57, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I count three transwiki-and-deletes (including the nominator), three simple deletes, and one "keep". That makes 85%, and a clear consensus for transwiki-and-delete. I don't see Robert Horning's statement as being any sort of vote, just a warning about what's likely to happen to the article after being moved. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 07:18, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since the nominator wrote <i>This is a great idea, but I think it belongs on Wikibooks, not Wikipedia</i>, that's clearly a "Transwiki" vote. And Robert Horning says nothing about deletion, only about not transwikiing ("<b>Don't know what to do</b>...In short, if you want to delete it, kill it outright, and don't transwiki"). So throwing that into the total and counting it as as an undecided, that makes 6 out of 8 (75%) for deletion. This reads less like consistent standards and more like "Conclusion first, rationale later". --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:40, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wouldn't feel comfortable ignoring Horning's vote, which I took as "do not transwiki. Even if I didn't, I consider 75% borderline, and can go either way. Over 75% I'm much more comfortable calling a consensus. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:22, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Addendum: There are a few people who regard a 75%+ approach to consensus as a problematic view. I don't think this is particularly widespread; we commonly accept a 80% bar for RFA's. However for people who adopt a much more generous level, even as low as 67%, it may make my results appear strange. I'm confident that the higher level is far more workable and less likely to produce poor results, however. Articles that really need to be deleted don't have a problem making 80% and over. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:28, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It seems to me that the most important function of VFD is ensuring that no information is lost. However, if an article is transwikied to a sisterproject, the information will persist in an easily accessible place. Would it not be reasonable then to interpret transwikefaction as something closer to moving an article than to deleting it outright? And hence, would it not be reasonable to require less support for such a move? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 08:42, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think I see what you're saying--could I have gone with transwiki even without a consensus to do so? No, I don't think I could do that.

<li>I understand, but I didn't mean 'without consensus', but rather 'with less consensus'. Personally, I would feel far more comfortable closing a debate as consensual if 67% of the votes were to <i>transwiki</i>, than if 67% of the votes were to <i>delete</i>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 13:01, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I'd put the function of VfD more simply, too. The purpose of VfD is making sure that functions not reversible by normal editors are only performed with consensus. This is one of the reasons why I only sometimes perform merges, redirects, etc, where a clear consensus to do so hasn't arisen. A common question is: why don't I lump together the deletes with the merges and come up with a consensus to merge? The reasons are that firstly, delete and merge are different actions, and secondly, if there really is a consensus to perform a merge then anybody can do it. I also want to discourage the practice of people coming to VfD to get an "enforcable" merge. I performed one of these in the early days of my adminship, on a 75% consensus to merge (that is, 75% of voters actually voted to merge), but would probably now if I did the same close again I would probably close pointing out that a consensus existed to merge and the editors should act accordingly. I am not their daddy, and editing decisions made after the VfD is closed without consensus to delete should probably not be taken as VfD-enforced actions. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:26, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Possibly not, but fact is that they (sometimes) are taken as VFD-enforced, and it seems unfeasible to change people's behavior to that. If a merge is disputed, a straw poll could resolve the issue; if the article was on VFD earlier, that can reasonably be taken as such a poll, if it shows a rough consensus for some action. If a VFD had a strong majority to merge or redir, unmerging or unredirring it may well be counter to consensus and thus undesirable.</li>
<li>It is my understanding that several closing admins do not generally perform merges because it involves a lot of work (and so does closing, so there's no need to take on <i>both</i> lots). However, {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMerge_8f97.html" title="Template:Merge">merge</a>}} only reads "it has been suggested that this article be merged" - so if two or three people on a VFD make such a suggestion, I'd certainly feel justified to add that template to the article if I closed the debate.</li>
<li>Grouping votes to merge and to delete is really dependent on the debate and closing admin's discretion - however, in several cases it is obvious that the delete-voters would prefer a merge&amp;redirect to a straight keep. In such a case, it is plausible to close a 4d/3k/3m vote as a consensus to merge. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 13:01, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wikis work best when they're left to work it out for themselves, in my experience. A straw poll? No, usually it just needs one editor with some reasonable interpersonal skills. Pointing at the number of merge votes in the VfD would probably be useful for convincing people. But if there's serious opposition to a merge it shouldn't be done. In most cases a missed merge can be replaced by a single wikilink at the appropriate point. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:20, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't find the image disturbing at all. What I do find disturbing is its' inclusion in an article describing the joy of receiving an enema.

<dd>Adam has a long history of vandalism. I blocked him about a month ago when he was hitting the George Bush, Dick Cheney, and other articles -- he had forgotten that he was <i>logged in</i> when he made edits such as this one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dick_Cheney&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18540766" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dick_Cheney&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18540766" rel="nofollow">[80]</a>; normally he logged out so he got one of the dynamically assigned Alltel IPs. I got an e-mail from him, in which he was unrepentant for the vandalism, and managed both to admit that it was him, and deny it, in a single sentence; he asked me to please unblock him so he could "rebuild his reputation." <i>Then</i> he put up his user page, where he bragged about his vandalism. (Here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=19060483&amp;oldid=19059635" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=19060483&amp;oldid=19059635" rel="nofollow">[81]</a> is where I wrote about it on ViP in July; read the whole section, since it includes the full range of the IPs he was known to use.)

<p>I don't believe it for a second. Certainly, vandals can reform (I know of at least one that I consider a good contributor now who was a vandal not too long ago) but I think Adam's comments on his user page are the accurate representation of his intent. I suggest keeping a very close eye on him, and if he makes any missteps, take him to RfAr straight away; I'll be happy to support it. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 03:52, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If it's confirmed that Adam is behind this vandalism, there is no need for arbitration, we can simply block him for a while.

<p>Oh, certianly, if he slips up and does it under his username we can. However, its a lot of trouble (and potentially controversial) to block him for activities he does through a sock. If he is going to continue with his stated agenda of vandalism, then he needs to be taken to RfAr so we can get an offical ban and be justified in getting rid of him altoghether. As someone else said, I'm not entirely convinced that he gets that he can't just switch between valued contributor and vandal. The ArbCom should have a whack at him, and hopefully put the fear of Jimbo in him. Thats what he really needs, to be forced to realize that we will not tolerate this behavior. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 09:53, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is obviously trying to force the 3RR ban upon me. A revert refers to a single operation completely bringing a page back to its former state. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Value_added_tax&amp;diff=20041554&amp;oldid=20039588" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Value_added_tax&amp;diff=20041554&amp;oldid=20039588" rel="nofollow">10:55, August 1, 2005</a> was clearly an <b>edit</b> in which I accepted some changes, modified others, as well as restored a questionable edit. You dont break an edit down into parts and call it a revert. My issue is not just with your use of the word "Mainland" in the footnote, but also within the table itself, so since when is the footnote the sole criterion to judge if my edit was a revert or not? and btw, what hyperlink are you talking about?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 12:40, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>And so, here we are again, the three of us. So, I guess that discussion proved less than ideally productive... Huaiwei, yes, we do break an edit down and single out the reoccurences as ("complex") reverts.

<li>El C, I know about the "complex revert" thingy, but it is simply not logical for me to be gaming the rules here. This "complex" revert is in the first edit listed above. If I actually wanted to skim the 3RR rule, then whats the logic of me doing that in the beginning, and with no guarantee that Instandnood might start yet another round of reverts again? If there are some edits which makes sense, then yes, I shall let them stay. I dont simply use a few clicks and do a revert in a trigger happy manner if resolution is within sight.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 13:28, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Both of us were reverting each other, but I knew I have to stop. Before all these reverts I did express my concern to <a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">User:Huaiwei</a> at his <a href="../../../h/u/a/User_talk%7EHuaiwei_1532.html#Value_added_tax" title="User talk:Huaiwei">talk page</a>, but he did not agree there was any problem, and subsequently objected and reverted my edits to the footnote. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 17:02, August 1, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I am not too sure what instantnood's little exercise is for this case, but may I just point out that he asked in my talk page if there is a "better way of presentation" based on what he thinks was "misleading" information. I replied saying I didnt find that format misleading at all. When he still carried on asking me some strange questions on the next step to take, I replied quite matter of factly that the <b>proper</b> way to go forward is to wait for someone else to come forth if he thinks it is indeed confusing, utilise the talk page, or to do a RFC. He didnt bother to reply, and then from out of the blue, he suddenly decides its appropriate and jutifiable to edit the page in a way he deems favourable.

<li>Well, I myself, may not opt to view it as appreciable enough, and anyway, I'm looking toward an interim solution pending word from the Arbitration Committee. We obviously can't protect all the articles that this dispute encompasses. Is it possible for both of you to refrain from editing these names (either one of you), until this decision is reached? That is, without a formal injunction. This is a complete waste and drain of energy, in all possible respect. Nothing productive has come from these revert war exchanges. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 17:56, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would personally love to be rid of all these silly edits, but not until he stops spreading his agenda all over wikipedia even with an arbcom currently in progress. His current behavior seems to be showing blatant contempt towards the system in place here. The disagreements over the Mainland China issue remains unresolved, and so long that it is so, any sensible person who is not out to cause disputes or to spread an agenda would not be actively trying to use it despite it all.

<li>I have a basic plan for a cease fire while the RFAr is concluded. It basically involves refraining from making any naming convention edits, <i>anywhere</i> by the participants to this dispute (including SchmuckyTheCat and anyone else). I asked Instantnood if he's willing to do so, and I'm hopeful for a positive reply from himself and everyone else. Let's not waste each other's time while the committee deliberates (a decision that will likely lean more toward one position than the other, anyway). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 02:31, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am generally agreeable so long that the other parties similarly coorperate. Meanwhile, I have a suggestion to make with regards to the obvious and persistant abuse of the 3RR's intent here. Should either party ever nominate the other for 3RR again, I would suggest that BOTH parties be blocked, especially when both parties have clearly made 3 reverts already. In fact in one of the earliest instances, both of us were blocked, and it seems to work wonders...for a while.&#160;:D--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 06:22, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That's the spirit, but my diabolical scheme is even more ambititious! If any one participent makes a single naming convention edit, they shall be blocked, due to scroll bar lazyness on my part, shall we say: 15 minute, next 1 hours, next 24 hours per any given 24 hour period? I trust everyone will diligently watchover each other edits, since I certainly do not have the time (or the pertinent watchlist) to do so! I do believe it can work, it isn't that difficult to abide by, and at this time would be of great benefit to all involved. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 07:03, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As mentioned directly above, I am more concerned with the <i>quality</i> of the edit than the quantity of text reverted (not to imply that Genie thinks otherwise), and in this case I find it to be key in the dispute. Has the user been made aware of this request, and the 3RR in general? <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 18:21, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The user is well aware of controversial nature of this edit, and as he has been editing Wikipedia since 2002 (see the history of his User:page), is likely one of the longest standing editors of the project; hardly a newbie who needs to be coddled and taught the rules. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:15, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>User continues to insist that Jonathan Sarfati is a scientist, and reverts any changes removing this description. I have warned this user about the 3RR prior to the 6th revert. Unfortunately, this revert war has almost drawn <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918">User:Brian0918</a> into 3RR violation. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosh_Parris_7b8b.html" title="User talk:Josh Parris">Josh Parris</a> [<a href="http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Josh+Parris&amp;dbname=enwiki|#" class="external autonumber" title="http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Josh+Parris&amp;dbname=enwiki|#" rel="nofollow">[84]</a>] 07:24, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>There was no warning that I saw (or see) and there is no 'almost' about it:

</ul>
</li>
<li>Sarfati is a PhD scientist, and Brian0918, who is an administrator (who should have known better than a newbie like myself!), keeps deleting the original designation of 'scientist' from the description without citing any sources, and calls the deletion a minor edit. He is also violating the NPOV. User:138.130.203.178 a/k/a <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgapetos_angel_f3c0.html" title="User:Agapetos angel">agapetos_angel</a> 01:08, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>The reason I said almost is because none of those edits are a fourth in a 24hr window, unlike yours.</li>
<li>And you were warned, repeadly, by several users; just look at <a href="../../../1/3/8/User_talk%7E138.130.203.178.html" title="User talk:138.130.203.178">User talk:138.130.203.178</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosh_Parris_7b8b.html" title="User talk:Josh Parris">Josh Parris</a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Josh+Parris&amp;dbname=enwiki" class="external text" title="http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Josh+Parris&amp;dbname=enwiki" rel="nofollow">#</a></span> 06:27, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Oh? Deletion of an appellation (listed on that person's business card and job description) under the guise of a 'minor edit'--thereby 'hiding' the deletion--is not a violation of ANY policy, is it?

<li>I'd normally agree about the diffs being dated, but I was wondering earlier if I should block him for it. I received a complaint from <a href="../../../e/v/m/User%7EEvmore_3c05.html" title="User:Evmore">User:Evmore</a> about excessive reverting by DreamGuy at <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire.html" title="Vampire">Vampire</a>, and a complaint that DG had reported <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielsimon_92ed.html" title="User:Gabrielsimon">User:Gabrielsimon</a> for 3RR, but wasn't blocked for having violated it himself. So I left what I felt was a fairly friendly warning on DG's talk page about reverting, since when I've been subjected to several diatribes from him about how I'm rude, condescending, misinformed, how dare I, and so on. He does seem to be a serial reverter, and Gabriel's right about him refusing to acknowledge there's any kind of problem. I'm just writing this up here so you're aware of it.

<li>I've blocked DreamGuy for 12 hours for the 3RR violation at <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire.html" title="Vampire">Vampire</a>. Other pages he appears to revert a lot are <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire_fiction.html" title="Vampire fiction">Vampire fiction</a> and <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a>, one of which I've had to protect because of it. Attempts to discuss the reverting with him have met with abuse and deletion of messages from his talk page. I reduced the block to 12 hours to reflect that it was reported a few days late, but I'm acting on it because of a complaint that, while DreamGuy reports others for 3RR who are then blocked, he isn't blocked when he does it. However, I'm now worried about what Geni said about the blocked users, so I'll take another look at who he was reverting. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:59, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, this once again shows SlimVirgin's clear bias here... Gabrielsimon did go and revert <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropy.html" title="Therianthropy">Therianthropy</a> about five times tonight, and instead of blocking him she let him put protect tags on all the pages he wanted protected his way and then followed around and made them real... She has shown clear favoritism. The "abuse" she talks about is simply my pointing out earlier examples of her poor choices, pointing out that it was hypocritical for her to undo my comments on her page but then threaten to block me when I removed her comments from mine. Specifically regarding this incident, I told her I was willing to discuss the alleged violation with any admin other than her, because I believed she had already demonstrated clear bias against me, and she refused to let anyone else take over. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 08:41, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After some discussion on my talk page, I've looked over the article again. I still hold that there are only three actual reverts, but there were five times when he altered an edit made by Dreamguy, in the same section of the article - changing wording, etc. I don't know if these could be labelled <i>reverts</i>, however, these edits did occur, and were part of the editting dispute. <small>*mutter*placing a comment here may have been a bad idea*mutter*</small> --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a> 09:54, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</sup></dd>

<dd>Gabriel's latest game is to pepper the edits with lots of small changes so they are difficult to follow and then changing the wording slightly but of no real difference in the end result. I've gone back through his edits to the page and it's like a shotgun blast trying to sort it all out. The issue that was most controversial was, appropriately enough, whether mental health issues were controversial (he says they are not, that therianthropes do not have any overlap with mental illness at all and that there is no controversy, he's just right so there's no debate). Revision as of 21:06, August 2, 2005 he changes "controversial issue" to "difficult issue" Revision as of 19:38, August 3, 2005 he changes it to "interesting issue" Revision as of 19:43, August 3, 2005 he again changes it to "interesting issue" and then at Revision as of 19:51, August 3, 2005 he puts it back to "difficult issue". I guess it all comes down to whether someone can get around the 3RR policy by knowingly disobeying consensus for a certain wording by picking a couple of ways to changes it and cycle through them. IF the policy is that they can do this as long as the change is slightly diffferent, we'd be opening ourselves up to people gaming the system to make all the reverts they want as long as they have a thesaurus in front of them... Gabriel has progressed to doing the same constant edit warring as always but trying to weasel his way out of them (also including his latest claim that it really wasn;t him who made all the edits overnight but a roommate he just happened to talk like him except oops he "spels better than Ido I type rilly baddly so that oter one oviously wasn't me" -- discounting the fact that the dits in question also had plenty of bad spelling and grammar, just not as much as he's currenlty exaggerating it with). IF this doesn't count as 3RR then I suggest tigtening up the 3RR policy so that these kinds of shenenigans don't become more commonplace. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 11:16, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From my own edit history of articles, that DreamGuy has been part of every now and then, I can only say that he loves to revert for very stupid reasons. He's often involved in revert wars, that end up of pages being locked. He thinks he's better than everyone. He believes himself to know more than the rest of us mortals. Very annoying editor. Although, I'm sure he's done a lot of good for Wikipedia, since he isn't quite a vandal case, I think someone should give him a six month ban or similar, in order to cool off his attitude. Also, I don't get it why he's sooooooo into removing fiction and what he calls "fictioncruft" from mythological articles. He removes a lot of facts in many articles by doing this.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliasAlucard_fc0e.html" title="User:EliasAlucard">User:EliasAlucard</a> is a problem user who instead of trying to improve articles insists upon adding nonnotable fictional trivia as if it had a greater importance that information about the actual topic of an article and becomes abusive and unwilling to discuss things, reverting to his own version and unwilling o discuss anything. The idea that he's suggesting a 6 month ban for a cooling off period is ludicruous, as he needs cooling off moreso than others and it's basically just a way for him to try to make his edits without being checked by others. I have had to remove many articles that I was a solid contributor to from my watchlist to avoid conflict with this extremely stubborn and consensus-avoiding editor, and now out of the blue he is following me around complaining again. Not to mention his complaint has nothing to do with this alleged 3RR. It's just bloody ridiculous. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 20:55, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Take my word for it, if there's anything I don't want to do, then it's to "follow you around." I'm avoiding you more than you are avoiding me. It's just that you're found everywhere, and it's not a surprise from my side if there has been some lame edit war that you were involved in. Now, to your defense, some of the edit wars you've been involved with, you've been righteous. In other articles, you haven't. I can acknowledge that I've lost my temper once in a while on some talk page. But you, you're the master of being rude in every edit war you're involved in. The reason why I decided to make these complaints, is that you piss me off. Plain and simple. And calling me a problem user is a major exaggeration, and you know that I'm not, so stop lying. And it has something to do with this 3RR. Why do you think I complained here? Because the <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire.html" title="Vampire">Vampire</a> article was protected, because of another lame edit war you caused by removing fiction. I've been in an exact situation like this before with you. And you've removed lots of fiction from many other mythological articles. Why? I find it interesting to have it there. There's not much difference between mythology and fiction, and I don't see how it hurts to have fiction there.</dd>

<li>I would like to note that the last two reverts are not reverts of the same edit but two seperate reverts of different edits but of the same page. I understand there is some ambiguity over the 3RR here and mention this here and above for fairness. I would also like to note the Germen has been previously blocked two times for breaking the 3RR<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=15449372&amp;oldid=15449106" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=15449372&amp;oldid=15449106" rel="nofollow">[86]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=15635008&amp;oldid=15634965" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=15635008&amp;oldid=15634965" rel="nofollow">[87]</a> on Islamophobia leading to the page being protected<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=15639287" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=15639287" rel="nofollow">[88]</a>.

<li>I would like to note that I did only revert once. I did, however, move sections to more appropriate places and I did salvage deleted sections of my edits which represented valuable work and contained numerous references, such as the additional information on the Runnymede Trust characteristics of islamophobia. To summarize, I did try to maximize teh informational content of the article. It is another example of the bad faith and ad hominem approach some Wikipedians seem to prefer. I would like to add as well that <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> has agressively listed me for a RfC and RfAr without attempting a serious mediation effort (this happened only after I explicitly asked for it). This seems to indicate that <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> prefers ad hominem solutions to fact- or argument-based solutions. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGermen_dad1.html" title="User talk:Germen">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Germen_c63b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Germen">Contribs</a> <a href="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/a/ab/Nl_small.gif" alt="" width="25" height="11" longdesc="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" /></a>) 15:07, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Attempting to package your reverts along with other edits so as to avoid the 3RR is still reverting in my book: your edits clearly undo mine and Heraclius' edits. Given your prior experience with the 3RR you should be familiar with Wikipedia policy of reverts and 3RRR. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> (<a href="../../../a/x/o/User_talk%7EAxon_2304.html" title="User talk:Axon">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Axon_75d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Axon">contribs</a>) 15:46, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>1st revert: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamophobia&amp;diff=20181444&amp;oldid=20181283" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamophobia&amp;diff=20181444&amp;oldid=20181283" rel="nofollow">11:47, 3 August 2005</a> I did move a section to the Definition section, as agreed upon during mediation. I did not edit an out-of-date version of the page. I changed wordings and moved some text, so it was not a revert but an edit.</li>
<li>2nd revert: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamophobia&amp;diff=20181632&amp;oldid=20181522" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamophobia&amp;diff=20181632&amp;oldid=20181522" rel="nofollow">11:51, 3 August 2005</a> See first; was edit rather than revert; salvaged deleted section
<ul>
<li>Both of the above are clearly reverts of my early re-ordering<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamophobia&amp;diff=20179307&amp;oldid=20178443" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamophobia&amp;diff=20179307&amp;oldid=20178443" rel="nofollow">[90]</a>. I certainly did not agree to these specific changes in mediation. The second revert is even marked by Germen as "rv."! <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> (<a href="../../../a/x/o/User_talk%7EAxon_2304.html" title="User talk:Axon">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Axon_75d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Axon">contribs</a>) 15:30, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3rd revert: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamophobia&amp;diff=20185107&amp;oldid=20185075" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamophobia&amp;diff=20185107&amp;oldid=20185075" rel="nofollow">13:15, 3 August 2005</a> Seems a removal of double wording to me. Because of the high frequency of edits and the lousy internet connection here, editing conflicts arose frequently. It is well possible that by accident I overwrote the previous version. In that case, don't whine but do as I do: salvage valuable information and paste it in the new edit.
<ul>
<li>Clearly revert of my edit here<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamophobia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=20185055" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamophobia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=20185055" rel="nofollow">[91]</a>.

<li>4th revert: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamophobia&amp;diff=20188510&amp;oldid=20187850" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamophobia&amp;diff=20188510&amp;oldid=20187850" rel="nofollow">14:31, 3 August 2005</a> see 3).--<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGermen_dad1.html" title="User talk:Germen">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Germen_c63b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Germen">Contribs</a> <a href="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/a/ab/Nl_small.gif" alt="" width="25" height="11" longdesc="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" /></a>) 15:29, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Once again, clearly marked as "rv." by Germen. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> (<a href="../../../a/x/o/User_talk%7EAxon_2304.html" title="User talk:Axon">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Axon_75d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Axon">contribs</a>) 15:33, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So there were just two cases of reverting, which don't warrant the filing of a 3RR case. I recommend <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> to stop wasting valuable administrator and Wikipedian time in his endless and fruitless ad hominem attacks and indulge in more constructive endeavours, like proving your points with high-quality primary and secondary sources, for instance. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGermen_dad1.html" title="User talk:Germen">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Germen_c63b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Germen">Contribs</a> <a href="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/a/ab/Nl_small.gif" alt="" width="25" height="11" longdesc="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" /></a>) 15:44, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I still count 4 reverts above: only two are actually labelled as reverts by yourself. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> (<a href="../../../a/x/o/User_talk%7EAxon_2304.html" title="User talk:Axon">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Axon_75d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Axon">contribs</a>) 15:48, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have blocked <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">User:Germen</a> for 24 hours for a 3RR violation here. The third revert there troubled me, however. It appeared that Germen reverted a strange edit by Axon that nearly duplicated a paragraph, however it appears this revert was a deliberate and complete revert of Axon's edit (because Germen made an intervening edit and also reverted a spelling correction by Axon). The rest of the reverts there are far more clear-cut. Thus, I feel the 3RR has been breached, and I am justified in making this block. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> can still edit his or her talk page while blocked, if they wish to argue against this block. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 14:16, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Axon and German have agreed to a soft ban on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> while they work out mediation with dab. Dab can unban them at will. (he should drop me a line when he does, just to be sure). Germen has been unblocked.</p>

Much of it has been very odd edits such as changing "is" to "was", removing stub templates from stubby articles, or adding stub templates to large articles (e.g. <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Times_ea99.html" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a>), etc..

In the last two days this editor has now escalated to page blanking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_CBS_affiliates&amp;diff=20070699&amp;oldid=20059990" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_CBS_affiliates&amp;diff=20070699&amp;oldid=20059990" rel="nofollow">[97]</a> and now edit warring. I've even put comments in my edits on some of the pages that he regularly edits, asking him to look at his talk page but he has deleted them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=KTLA&amp;diff=20008868&amp;oldid=19964933" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=KTLA&amp;diff=20008868&amp;oldid=19964933" rel="nofollow">[98]</a>.

<dd>No admin has commented on this report and Sanctu continues to revert. I'm going to block since these are all simple reverts without question. I'm consider the first five reverts to have violated the 3RR, the sixth is just evidence he's not stopping. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 18:49, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Let's go through this:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Jiang moved Taiwan (ROC) from #C to #T, clearly indicating in the edit summary it doesn't belong at C at all.</li>
<li>Instantnood: "I added a link at #C"</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So the link at C was removed, then added. That's a revert, there was no housecleaning necessary after Jiangs change. Here's a bargain to any admin, I'll go back and revert him a fourth time if you promise to ban us both. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 23:27, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>There was no link for Taiwan (ROC) pointing from #C to #T, therefore no link under #C could be removed. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 23:37, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What? What? you just said and pointed at a diff that says Jiang removed the link under C. You put it back. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 23:45, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>originally, the link to <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> was at #C and labelled as "China (ROC)" with "Taiwan see China (ROC)" under #T. I moved the link to #T and changed the pipe to "Taiwan (ROC)" and did not leave any pointer behind at #C. Instanthood added a pointer at #C pointing to the link under #T. Instanthood's first edit (labelled as 1st revert above) doesn't look like a revert to me because the link to the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> article still resides under #T, where I put it. I don't really care whether there's a pointer under #C. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Ji</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang">ang</a> 01:08, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Involved editors were supposed to be informed of my interim plan for a truce, I'm sorry to see that did not end up being the case (either that, and/or not followed).

<li>OK, 'nood now made a 5th revert in 24 hours to add Taiwan under C for China. Any arguement about whether the first revert is a revert or not, is moot. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 20:20, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>"<i>rv to last version by SchmuckyTheCat. Got a problem with it? Deal.</i>" doesn't sound very inviting to me. Carlton is clearly showing consensus that Taiwan doesn't not belong under C for China. Whether the "problem for the pointer to stay" isn't at issue, Instantnood has added it five time since it was removed. (And no, it doesn't belong either, one country = one listing.)

<li>IMO Jiang has clarified his edit, the whole thing is concluded and there's no problem for the pointer to stay.

<li>Instantnood, I clearly said 'any and all naming conventions,' from <i>anyone</i> involved. Further, you were supposed to inform me when you felt the other side violated these, then I could have asked them to revert themsleves, adhere to the truce, etc. Instead, you not only reverted (which is expressly works against the truce), neglecting to employ my offer to mediate, but you also seem to have violated 3RR (regardless, recall that I said one revert = 15 min, 2 = 1 hr and 3 = 24 hr block). This is the <i>last</i> chance for truce as I have devised it; meaning, no edits of such a nature until the committee's decision. In answer to the question of what constitute a naming convention edit: any edit which modify the names of the contested subjects. Surely there are other edits to make aside from the naming. I want everyone involved to keep the naming as they are at present, if there are objections to this, my plan will be discarded; if there are violations, report to me and don't revert (this is directed to everyone else, too). Please, everyone, read the above closely. I am not interested in becoming involved with the specific details and inner workings of this dispute, only to reach a temproary détente. Blocked for <u>12</u> hours, as a <i>final</i> benefit of the doubt. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 21:18, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>He's up to <b>9</b> now, over about 5 hours. Can a revert war this heavy, carried out by one person, be moved to it's own vandalism page? I think it's about reached that point, and it might put enough attention on the problem that three or four editors don't have to use up their reverts of the page just to keep on anon address in check. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 18:44, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Possibly in violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> as well, Benjamin Gatti is determined not to let the VFD run its course and come to a decision. The VFD tag was placed on this VFD when he nominated it for deletion. That page has been speedied but he insists on the tag remaining. Warned on his talk at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Benjamin_Gatti&amp;diff=20335417&amp;oldid=20309649" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Benjamin_Gatti&amp;diff=20335417&amp;oldid=20309649" rel="nofollow">13:36, 5 August 2005</a> yet he still reverted again. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 15:52, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I endorse this block and would do it myself, but I'm one of the people who removed the VfD tag. By the way, the first revert should definitely count as the removal was not a mistake; Markaci's edit summary in removing it indicates clearly that it was intentional. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 16:06, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I read it that he thought it was a mistake by the nominator and that the VFD tag wasn't intentionally there, so removed it. Could be either way. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 16:08, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The charges are silly. The VfD will run its course, and I have never tried to "Stop" it except by official policy of nominating it for Deletion. The fact that vandals removed the nomination is irrelevent - it was replaced. I think that restoring a duly placed nomination for Deletion is neither a violation of 3RR nor of WK:POINT as there is no disruption. The removal of a VfD is a serious breach of process and ought to be taken up by the admins as well. I would therefore nominate those who admit to having removed it for equal sanctions at least.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion none of cited edits are reverts because they restore properly placed nominations for deletion where violations of policy had removed them, I will immediately arbitrate any action on that basis. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a></p>

<dd>So far I count 12 people who have indicated they oppose your actions, either by: a) removing the VfD tag; b) blanking, deleting, or calling for speedy removal of the resulting "VfD of a VfD" silliness; or c) calling for you to be censured for such frivolous nonsense. That indicates a growing consensus that your activities are inappropriate, as is your claim to be acting according to "official policy". You have articulated no policy reasons to support deleting a VfD listing; all you've done is complain about the motives and lack of disclosure by those who nominated <i>your</i> page for deletion. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 16:44, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Stop counting people. The question is whether or not I have violated a rule, so put down the popularity meter, and get out the rule book.</li>
<li>As for my counter nomination for VfD: It was properly posted in good faith for a stated reason.</li>
<li>As to the "Speedy Deletion" of the recursive VfD - I can find no basis in <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Criteria for speedy deletion</a> for this action - therefore I consider it to be vandalism.</li>
<li>In justification of the Recursive VfD, There is evidence that the initial VfD came into existence by a coordinated effort of two people currently pursuing arbitration against Ed Poor - which same events are mentioned in the Article - and they failed to disclose their involvment as required under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion#VfD_etiquette" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion#VfD_etiquette" rel="nofollow">VfD etiquette</a>. In short, I felt the purpose of the deletion was in part to promote their arguments while censoring counter arguments. Whether you agree with my arguments or not - censoring for the purpose of advancing your own is inappropriate and I properly nominated their censorship campaign for deletion.</li>
<li>Once again - my counter nomination was not granted equal process. - and to this day none of the reasons for Speedy Deletion have been even suggested.</li>
<li>I maintain that restoring the counter-VfD is not a revert - it is a valid edit to address violation of process (vandalism).</li>
<li>As to Katefan0's comments: According to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhatIsIllegitimateSpeech" class="external text" title="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhatIsIllegitimateSpeech" rel="nofollow">WhatIsIllegitimateSpeech</a></li>
</ol>
<p>"any speech questioning the intellectual honesty and moral principles of any person is considered illegitimate." (And ought to be removed). Because Kate's comments went beyond simple disclosure and suggested a conclusion questioning the intellectual honesty of the author, I followed this policy and refactored the comment to the discussion page (4 times), and would be happy to be sanctioned for it if that is the will of the people. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a> 18:24, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're trying to claim that a page on Ward's Wiki is valid as policy here on Wikipedia? Not to mention that the argument could equally be applied to the reasons you gave for the "VfD of a Vfd", thus justifying the speedy deletion you're arguing against. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 18:33, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ad hominum attacks are precluded from every serious forum. I'm sure you are well aware of policies against Ad Hominum attacks on the Wiki. Yes I think Ward's Wiki put it well, and again - I'm more than happy to be sanctioned for upholding the principle of no ad hominum if the people wish it. The line between impuning someone's intellectual honesty and covert attempt at Censorship is clear and wide. I did not delete anyone's comments - I refactored and labelled them as Ad Hominum. Rob Church and Co, on the other hand are trying to Censor a counter argument to their own by seruptitiously nominating a VfD - without disclosing their involvement. But you knew that. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a></dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>: This page was recently released from page protection after a series of vandalism attacks; it has a history of vandalism from partisans on both sides of the disputes. While it was under protection, several users, myself included, attempted to hammer out consensus text in several areas under dispute. User: 24.23.221.166 "lurked" around the talk page during this time, posting under at least one other ID, but refused to participate in the consensus efforts. When the protection was lifted, I edited the consensus revisions into the article. User: 24.23.221.166 then objected to the consensus text and inserted new language reversing the consensus changes (and, in almost every case, moving further away from the consensus language than the previous/text had been. The user initially insisted his changes reflected a "unanimous" view among observers, and "documented" his position by cut-and-pasting threads from various message boards from which all opinions differing from his on the disputed point had been deleted; he now insists that the article should not reflect NPOV guidelines, but should reflect "majority opinion" of its subject. The user has targeted particular sections of the text worked on during the consensus efforts -- most recently, reinserting text that was, without any dispute, previously identified as both NPOV-violating and reflecting original research.</p>
<p>The user is particularly insistent that references to the subject's current prominence and popularity reflect his opinions -- the text he objects to leaves the issue open -- and his changes on this point vary between declaring the subject is no longer popular/prominent and removing the relevant text entirely.</p>
<p>The user in question has edited the article and/or talk page both anonymously and as User: B. Navarro. I can't tell which of the anonymous edits from different IPs may come from the same user, but there's at least one other anonymous ID with similar habits.</p>
<p>This has been a very contentious page, and there are very different, polarized opinions. But, aside from the 3RR violation, I think there should be a stronger "official" response than there has been to a user who refuses to participate in consensus discussions and then makes disruptive, guideline-violating changes to the result of consensus efforts.</p>
