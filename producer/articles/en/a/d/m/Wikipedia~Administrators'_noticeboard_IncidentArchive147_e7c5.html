<li>This seems to already be resolved, other than Arbusto/oo's efforts to interfere with the resolution. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelical_Rift_177d.html" title="User:Helical Rift">User:Helical Rift</a> had removed <a href="../../../o/r/t/Category%7EOrthodox_Jewish_communities_b497.html" title="Category:Orthodox Jewish communities">Category:Orthodox Jewish communities</a> from the article <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedarhurst%2C_New_York_2740.html" title="Cedarhurst, New York">Cedarhurst, New York</a>, based on his interpretation of the category implying that the location was 100% Orthodox. After clarifying the scope of the category based on the examples of the communities already listed therein, Helical Rift was given several examples of communities with both Irish and Orthodox communities that are labeled as Irish, despite being under 100% (or 50% for that matter). Helical Rift then modified the description of the category to require a majority population. After several attempts at deleting and restoring the category, Helical Rift was told that the article has an explicit source for Cedarhurst being an Orthodox community. Helical Rift, then proceeded to remove all references to Cedarhurst's Orthodox community from several locations within the article, and then claimed that "article does not mention orthodox jewish communities..." in the edit summary. Helical Rift was warned that such removal was vandalism, removed it again and was warned a second time. After re-offering a suggestion that we label Cedarhurst as both Orthodox AND Italian, we were able to agree that this soultion would address our mutual concerns. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> seems to have created this ANI in violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. This issue seems to have been resolved with the user in question, but Arbusto/oo seems to have inserted himself into this issue, goading <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelical_Rift_177d.html" title="User:Helical Rift">User:Helical Rift</a> into further action after the situation seems to have been successfully addressed, even after Helical Rift pleaded to end this argument. Arbusto/oo has persisted in misinterpreting an explicit source that specifies Cedarhurst as an Orthodox community, deciding that the source is not valid because it does not state the exact words that <b>Cedarhurst is an Orthodox Jewish community</b>, a nonsensical standard that is not applied anywhere else in Wikipedia. This issue should be closed immediately, assuming that Arbusto/oo has no further need to interfere with the subject. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 08:44, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I just saw this as I posted the new incident below. I had already seen the altercation between them and warned them both about 3RR. They both deserve to be temporarily blocked for edit warring / 3RR and at least one should be cautioned for bad language. I have also nominated the category in dispute for deletion. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmadilloFromHell_83a4.html" title="User:ArmadilloFromHell"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Armadillo</b></font><font color="#000000"><b>From</b></font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Hell</b></font></a> 08:51, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to say that yes, the issue has been resolved but Arbusto did not "goad" me. I had strong feelings on the matter and discussed it with <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a>. To me, the matter is closed and I apologize for my bad language. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> was also changing the Cedarhurst page as well every time that I did so we are both at fault.

All that stands open now is Arbusto/oo's efforts to stir up a false claim that the article does not meet the category's standards, after all, based on his blatant misinterpretation of an article that explicitly provides the needed source.

Contrary to Arniep's feeble effort to spin it, this was an effort to reveal my supposed "identity." My understanding is that purporting to reveal the actual identity of an editor is a bannable offense whether the "outing" is correct or, as in this case, wrong. I've been attacked right and left in an attack website and tabbed the identity of a well-known author because of my edits in articles unrelated to this one. Arniep picked up those attacks and harassed me with it. He should receive the appropriate penalty, which is an indefinite block. P.S.

<dd>I think all people involved in this behaviour - whether it be incivility, false accusations, personal attacks etc, need to step back and stop editing the areas of the site where they are coming across these issues for a while.

<p>Arniep has also harassed me. He is a regular poster to Wikipedia Review. He engaged in what he saw as an off-wiki "investigation" into what he thinks is my personal life. He decided he knew who I was in real life, and he started posting what he thought were personal details about me on that website. He then passed what he thinks is my name to Daniel Brandt. I know it was him because he e-mailed to tell me. He said he didn't pass the information to Brandt directly, but did it via a third party, but I have no reason to believe him. However, even if that's true, he's still responsible for it. It doesn't surprise me at all that he is doing this Mantanmoreland. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:39, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is considerably more than a content dispute, and telling three editors not to edit a page because one of them harasses and makes threats is ignoring the actual problem.</dd>

Arniep has attempted to "out" at least two editors here, and shows no remorse nor desire to amend his ways. He has harrassed me, accusing me (without offering <i>any</i> diffs or examples to support his accusations) of wikistalking. I have had limited contact with him, and every single instance has been him making wild accusations against me while ignoring policies, up to and including replacing a signed message by me with content of his own, leaving my signature. He has never acknowledged any error, and his attitude throughout has been of a bully who attempts to paint himself as the "victim" whenever his actions have been criticised. I see no reason for an Rfc; this user is not suitable for interaction with others. Unless someone makes an incredibly strong case for <i>not</i> indef blocking him for harassment, "outing", and disruption, I will do so.</dd>

When applicable policies are given to him, he claims "harassment" or "stalking" or some other wrong is being done <i>to him</i> - and conveniently fails to respond to his own violations.

<dd>I agree and support the block. In this instance it is important to remember that this Amriep had had <i>zero</i> previous contact with me. I had never even heard of him before.

<dd>Support. If anything his already questionable behavior has been only been deteriorating.

<dd>At the risk of a pile-on, I'll just add that Arniep was, I thought, trying to bait Avi on my talk page by deleting a joke Avi made there and insinuating that it was somehow an attack on me by Avi (which it most clearly wasn't).

It was only in this context that my remarks were made and the affected user, never willing to discuss my perceptions on his motivations, started victimizing himself and wikilawyering on all this. Right now the article is under full protection.</p>
<p>It's also maybe convenient to notice that another user (<a href="../../../l/s/l/User%7ELSLM_2f47.html" title="User:LSLM">User:LSLM</a>) was also treted this same way by the same administrator, with even harshest warns for simmilar alleged faults (again not supported by PA or CIV policies).</p>

<dd>It's difficult to say, specially for me who was the one making those comments. I can only say that all them were relevant to the discussion (a new user, mass-editing a page with a large history of the same kind of attacks, with clearly that POV) and, later, the "aggraviated" user came to my user talk to push the issue further. Being my reply on my own user-talk page used as main evidence in the case, if I understood correctly. It's all still there if you want to check.</dd>
<dd>The ideological matter is clearly relevant to the discussion and, informally, I was reprobated also (by the same admin) for using the terms in abstract: as descriptive of the ideology being POV-pushed. Much of the same happened to LSLM, who was severely warned, I think (none of the warns is sufficiently clear), for explaining in the dicussion page what Nazi Nordicism was and is, again relevant to the discussion. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 14:31, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, Sugaar, what do you want to happen? You were asked not to call anyone a Nazi (or a nazi).

<dd>It's worth noting by the way that PAIN cases are not held on the board for debates and disputes between either users or administratrs - that's what "user talk" is for. Pain cases are typically routinely archived (or rather, removed from the page to be found only through oldid's) soon after they have been dealt with by an administrator. There was no imprper action in your case with regards to that - just standard procedure. The WP:NPA policy is pretty specific about what is and what isn't a personal attack, and so arbocom or RFC style cases are not required.</dd>

<dd>As to the three opposing admin interpretations, I don't really see that they are each mutually exclusive. All three note a problem, two of them note strong statements made by yourself, and while one of those (Durova's) wasn't a clear ruling one way or the other, Shell's was a firm ruling. From that perspective, what's happened is that al three administrators have noted a problem, two of them have gone as far as to say that your behaviour was at least marginal, and one of those has gone as far as issuing a warnig in accordance with the exact spirit and intent of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 14:54, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As per the contraditing resolutions, I do find some fault in that: there is doubt on which one is the valid one. If one says my comments are valid (or somewhat valid), the other says the case has no relevance and the third warns me, there is a clear conflict of resolutions. I don't know how you manage this, but typically that should mean either discussion among the contradicting administrators to get a unique ruling or the lesser penalty for the alleged infractor, in this case me. Shell's ruling wasn't even in the case: only in my talk page. This is one of my concerns. Though guess I'm powerless to push it further.</dd>

<p>I would like to ask administrators for help at the article <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_art.html" title="Pop art">Pop art</a>.

<dd>I second this. It was posted over at the BLP noticeboard last week, which is when I stubbed the "So Appealling" article after Ottex had a rather long statement regarding McHale, and later a message to editors about apparent censorship of the position.

<p>The problem here is that according to my very favourite policy, WP:UE, the new titles are correct, so while the move method is not, I can't just revert him, instead there's a lot of admin bitchwork. --user:Qviri 04:33, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I merged the first one listed, but then I got to thinking, should these really be in English? Are they really best known to English speakers under the English translated title? <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fucking_%C3%85m%C3%A5l_0381.html" title="Fucking Åmål">Fucking Åmål</a> for example, has an English distribution title, but it's rarely referred to as that by English speakers. (and technically there's a whole page for requesting history merges, <a href="../../../s/p/l/WP%7ESPLICE_228e.html" title="WP:SPLICE">WP:SPLICE</a>).--<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 16:46, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for pointing out SPLICE, I shall use it from now on. With regards to titles, this is the first time I heard the English titles (maybe with the exception of Mr. Wołodyjowski). Further, a lot of these, especially by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanis%C5%82aw_Bareja_0950.html" title="Stanisław Bareja">Bareja</a>, feature lots of references that anyone not well-immersed in the Polish culture wouldn't get (thus wouldn't find the movie funny and watch it in the first place...), and someone who is immersed would use the Polish title. I'm obviously biased here as a Pole.</dd>
<dd>I think that we should do a merge (on pages needing one, that is; <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_-_Woman_Wanted_8f1f.html" title="Man - Woman Wanted">Man - Woman Wanted</a> obviously doesn't) and then let the naming get decided by a WP:RM. --user:Qviri 18:55, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I could be wrong about this, but I'm pretty sure that pasting user pages on the talk pages of articles is a no-no.

<p>I've nominated this one for deletion (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Memphis_Improvisational_Theatre_df21.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Memphis Improvisational Theatre">AFD here</a>). Looks like it needs to be deleted due to total lack of third-party sources. In the meantime, there's been an ongoing revert war on the article and sniping back and forth on the Talk Page and editors' Talk pages.

<dd>I think a month on each is excessive. Both the edits were obvious vandalism - they would only not be caught if the reverter wasn't paying attention. (I've seen vandals make a vandalistic edit, then make a minor non-vandal edit to hide it from the 'last diff' link, but that wasn't the case here). The IPs could be dynamic - as those were the only edits, I think the blocks should be shortened to ~24 hours. They can be lengthened if the vandalism is resumed. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 02:52, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Google hits must not be taken as a yardstick in Asian related AfD's. Newspapers of Vernacular Languages may have millions of readership. For example, in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> every state has its own language. There are more than 20 widely speaking native languages in India. But the news reports from the newspapers of such languages are not available in google search.Take the case of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayala_Manorama_e08f.html" title="Malayala Manorama">Malayala Manorama</a> Newspaper. Currently this <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayalam.html" title="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> language newspaper has a readership of over 9 million, with a circulation base of over 1.4 million copies according to Audit Beureu of Circulations. Manorama is one of the India's largest selling and most widely read news paper. There are more than 50 such newspapers in India. News reports from such dailies are not available in google eventhough it have millions of readership. But news reports from English dailies with 1000 or 2000 copies are available in google search. It is really misleading...Isn't it...? In this context of notability tests based on google hits may be a worthless, foolish effort. In such circumstances we must consider the words of native wikipedians with more importance.<b><a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENileena_joseph_bcd1.html" title="User:Nileena joseph"><span style="background:#0c0;color:#FFFF66">&#160;Nileena joseph&#160;</span></a></b><sup>(<a href="../../../n/i/l/User_talk%7ENileena_joseph_c9bd.html" title="User talk:Nileena joseph">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nileena_joseph_3551.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nileena joseph">Contribs</a>)</sup> 05:39, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I categorically oppose unblocking uncle mart, apology or not. I received quite a bit of trolling from this person and his various identities. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">crztalk</a></small> 18:18, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This just got bought to my attention so I suppose I should have a quick say in the matter... Firstly the original incedent was over me creating a page, the page was marked for deletion and things went silly, I should have at this point backed down and respected the original wiki admins word and I admit this was a mistake on my part, I would like to apologise to the admins I was rude to over this, im not going to make excuses as that doesnt excuse my behavior, after some time I decided that (reluctantly) I would accept the decision (and will continue to do so, the question of me making a page is no longer the issue and when Crzrussian decided to get involved this dispute was LONG over with). the next thing I know is that my talk page was deleted and replaced with an older version by Crzrussian, I went to his talk page and explained this and asked him to not edit MY talk page and said something along the lines of "this has been sorted out now", the next thing I know is that im banned, not only by account but by IP. Obviously this was unfair as I never actually broke any rules whatsoever. I then thought I should create a new account and speak to another wiki admin about this unfair treatment, I made a new account, made a user page and before I even had the chance to contact anyone Crzrussian had taken his vendetta to new extremes and decided to use the "sock puppet" excuse, despite me having edited any other articles than my own user page. Now I dont know what "trolling" he's talking about to be honest, because the orginal dispute with the other admins had finished long before he got involved, perhaps he thinks he has more authority than other admins and that they handled me badly, well he was very off the mark, despite my original bad behavior I can say the original admins were friendly from the start, reasonable and did everything they could to explain it while being fair and neutral, CrzRussian on the other hand.....</p>
<p>Suffice to say that im not really interested in getting my account back but I would like the pages he locked deleted as these contain my real name and despite the saying "all publicity is good publicity" I would rather not have my real name posted here as I also have an alias and an artist name, which I would not like connections to be made between.</p>
<p>I would also like to request that Crzrussian be removed from being a wiki admin as he clearly cannot perform the duties that the other admins are, he has the rouge thing on his page and after looking on google it appears that the man is pretty hated in general, being hated is one thing but when you're hated because you cant do a simple job properly will cause problems for wiki (its lucky he decided to attack me as I dont consider defacing pages to be smart or clever like he does, but there are plenty of people out there that im sure he will annoy in the future that will take their anger out on wiki, which is not good for anyone). Im happy as the situation stands in my area, I dont need my account back but I would like to apologise to the original admins for my bad behaviour, I was out of line and I admit it, however Crzrussian gets no apology as I've got nothing to apologise for. Its up to you guys what you want to do now because personally, I dont really care, I'll still use wiki, I'll still donate to articles but only on the condition that Crzrussian doesnt harrass me like he has in the last two days. Im afraid he is a detriment to the site and I think its pretty clear to see that from his talkpage, he is also a perfect example of someone who abuses the little power he has in life. Thanks to the other admins, and the people who came to my defence in this, I appreciate it very much, however this is my last words on the subject, I dont hold wiki responsible for his behavior and still view wiki as one of the neatest things to happen on the internet, but I hope that wiki can see that people like Crzrussian only ruin this great site. One other thing I thought I should mention is that crz banning every single IP I happen to use doesnt affect me at all, my IP changes very fequently, this is something I cant help and is not to avoid bans, but by dong this he is stopping many potential wikipedians from using the site just because of some silly childish vendetta he has against me. Anyway, thats my say on the matter and im sure its in good hands providing no more of my posts I make go missing or change. Martin Tibbs 85.178.238.225 19:01, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just want to add something quickly... "I categorically oppose unblocking uncle mart, apology or not. I received quite a bit of trolling from this person and his various identities." I dont want unbanning for one, and thinking you would get an apology is pretty laughable im afraid, but you're welcome to keep hoping. My other point about the Various identities, hmmmmm, well you see if you check the account that you banned you'll see it only edited its own userpage, and nothing else so I have no idea where you get this various personalities from, I think you probably attatch more importance to yourself than you deserve, I started an account after and you banned it, you saying you got abuse from me is laughable as it simply didnt happen, but to be honest I wouldnt expect something truthful to come from you anyway, its clear that you saw the situation had ended and I wasnt banned, and yet you decided to deface my talk page to try and provoke me into breaking a rule so you had a reason to ban me, you couldnt manage that so you banned me anyway. so once again, im not requesting an unblock, im not requesting my pages unlocked, im just requesting and stating that you do a terrible "job" here and wiki would be better off without you. Peace out. btw, when replying to me, try to remember I wont be reading this as I have more important things to do, thats not meant as a jab but you have wasted quite alot of my time already and I dont have anymore for you. 85.178.238.225 19:51, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You say to someone "please stop adding Nazi propaganda" and expect them to discuss matters with you? Can I suggest you merge your version into his rather than revert again.

<p>A vandal who has vandalized my page twice with personal attack phrases and also other pages many times has been caught. Poor guy he forgot to turn off his signature script and the user is none other than a registered user who previously vandalised the Velupillai Prabhakaran page - SnowolfD4. Note the ones below:</p>
<p>1). Please check this topic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASudharsansn&amp;diff=87989520&amp;oldid=87965997" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASudharsansn&amp;diff=87989520&amp;oldid=87965997" rel="nofollow">"F..ing Demalu, we want you all dead. Your and your NCSLC bull. Need some good 'ole lynch. --snowolfD4( talk / @ )"</a>. He has vandalized my userpage and talk page with foul language and racist remarks. He had to do two changes, one with his signature and the other with his signature removed and both of them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=208.101.4.34" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=208.101.4.34" rel="nofollow">from this IP 208.101.4.34</a>. He is caught redhanded trying to vandalize pages with his signature turned on by mistake.</p>
<p>2). His post in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sudharsansn&amp;oldid=87989520#Stop_Picking_on_Lahiru" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sudharsansn&amp;oldid=87989520#Stop_Picking_on_Lahiru" rel="nofollow">my talk page</a> which is clearly personal attack/vandalism</p>
<p>3). FYI, the user has already been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Snowolfd4" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Snowolfd4" rel="nofollow">blocked thrice in Wikipedia</a>. He has resorted to using abusive language and 'Demalu' means 'Tamilians' and he basically wants all 'F** Tamilians to die, which quite evidently is a bad racist remark and also my WP:NCSLC project closed, which goes completely against Wiki policies.</p>
<p>4).

<p>Zedo page has a note stating that this Zedo description looks like an advertisement and needs editing. One user DoGooderjohnnyD stated in its discussion page on October 6 that he has notified zedo that this page needs correction because it is their product and they know it best how to edit it. I take the liberty of reproducing the DoGooderJohnnyD statement below:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I notified Zedo so that they can correct this article. I'm sure they could do a much better job than I could of describing their products and services. -/s/ -User:DoGooderJohnnyD|DoGooderJohnnyD 21:24, 6 October 2006</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is obviously a violation of Wikipedia policy of independence of the wikipedia content. The vendor himself can't be relied upon to provide an independent and correct description of content describing itself.</p>
<p>I've reviewed the following Wikipedia Content Technology-Internet-Adserving and find that the whole section is completely in correct. There is no mention of the fact that the ad serving companies place the ads of their clients on the web pages with the permission of the the publishers of the web pages and they share the revenues produced when the visitors to the webpages click on those ads with the publishers of the web pages. I edited the content of adserving to reflect the point. DoGooderJphnny called it defacement and reverted it. Further he has provided a list of companies that he calls ad serving companies. All these compnies can't be verified as Ad serving Companies except by the statements made by these companies. Indeed the search engines (Yahoo, Google, AOL, Iwon) call all these companies as Adwares, Trojan Horses that invade the web sites and instal their software without the permission of the publishers of the websites. For example see the keywords zedo-adware, powered by zedo, remove zedo, zedo trojan horse and so on.</p>
<p>All these companies are doing tremendous damage to the reputation of Wikipedia to promote themselves in search engines. For example Zedo has gotten itself listed together with Wikipedia under the Keyword Zedo-Wikipedia (adserver).</p>
<p>I do believe this matter deserves Adminstrator attention and intervention <a href="../../../f/a/k/User%7EFakir005_57af.html" title="User:Fakir005">fakir005</a> 21:42, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks like I'm the actual culprit, as Charles points out above. I removed the section because it was primarily a solicitation for an AfD vote, and not a policy discussion at all, and thus irrelevant to the policy village pump page.

<dd>In WIki terms, what is vote soliciting?

<p>The account looks quite fishy to me — not at all like a genuine newbie. He registered in July and made one edit, but the account really came to life on 30 October. So, for the purpose of Wikipedia experience, it's two weeks old. Yet he's taking part in deletion reviews, AfDs, and even an arbitration case that he is not personally involved in — and is doing so with extraordinary confidence. Complaining about being stalked while following his alleged "stalker" around and showing up on articles he has edited does not add to his credibility. Also, his edit to his own talk page on 7 November seems to be an simply a way of "getting round" the prohibition on linking to a website that attacks Wikipedians. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:13, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've just come across this user while on speedy deletion patrol, and I'm amazed by the amount of flak he/she's getting just because he happens to edit a website critical of wikipedia. Mongo, although I've often (quite rightly) been criticised for biting, I'm <i>astounded</i> by the way you're treating this, and other, users. Looking at the diffs you provide, I see you've made a threat of blocking a user who tried to defend him, just because he linked to the "don't be a dick" Meta page? You've then been <i>incredibly</i> rude to both Gentgeen and Luna when they didn't agree with your arbitrary block.

<dd>One very tedious method would be to take each diff in turn (not counting reverted edits as they don't contribute to the final state of the article), edit out each one, and use it to reconstruct the entire edit history minus copyvio on the talk page, starting with the most recent revision and a history on the talk page (which is permitted by GFDL).

<p>The so-called "sib-wiki" is a disgrace of the Wikimedia foundation that was deceived into hosting this obscene project which is nothing more than a combination of smut and hate-speech. The so called "Siberian language" is a one man project of Yaroslav Zolotaryov (<a href="../../../y/a/r/User_talk%7EYaroslav_Zolotaryov_b3d2.html" title="User talk:Yaroslav Zolotaryov">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yaroslav_Zolotaryov_463a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yaroslav Zolotaryov">contribs</a>) who carried his crusade at different places, most recently at <a href="../../../l/i/v/LiveJournal_40d6.html" title="LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a>, but now moved his lobbying to the various Wikimedia projects. His view that Siberian langauge exists as a feasable one is not a subject of the discussion at WP:ANI. Nor there is any interest to discuss his one-man crusade to codify this imagined language, also so far unsuccesful as not a single book on or in such language was published. In any case, should the foundation have decided to grant him the resources to promote his interesting linguistic exercises, few people would have been conserned about that. That's why his initial proposal to get himself a Wikipedia hosted by foundation met little opposition. But what grew out of it is a disgusting site filled to the brim with frivolous articles at best and the propaganda of ethnic hatred at worst.</p>
<p>Some examples from this "Wikipedia":</p>
<ul>
<li>an article about <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>, (<a href="http://ru-sib.wikipedia.org/wiki/Хамлет" class="external text" title="http://ru-sib.wikipedia.org/wiki/Хамлет" rel="nofollow">ru-sib version</a>) includes Zolotaryov's own translation of this great work of world literature. The original line (Marcellus: Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!) is translated in this article as "Motherfucker brought his ass here again")</li>
<li>an article about <a href="../../../p/u/s/Pushkin.html" title="Pushkin">Pushkin</a> (<a href="http://ru-sib.wikipedia.org/wiki/Пушкин,_Лександор_Сергеевич" class="external text" title="http://ru-sib.wikipedia.org/wiki/Пушкин,_Лександор_Сергеевич" rel="nofollow">ru-sib version</a>) tells you this about his <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Onegin_c7bf.html" title="Eugene Onegin">Eugene Onegin</a> novel. "A novel about a noble who has nothing to do so he screws the chicks around him."</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all funny and may even seem almost harmless but there is more.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a ru-sib Wikipedia article called "<a href="http://ru-sib.wikipedia.org/wiki/Москальска_сволоч" class="external text" title="http://ru-sib.wikipedia.org/wiki/Москальска_сволоч" rel="nofollow">The Scum of Moscow</a>". The article uses horrific expressions and threats from Zolotaryov to "Muscovites"</li>
<li>Another article is called "<a href="http://ru-sib.wikipedia.org/wiki/Кода_времьо_прийдат" class="external text" title="http://ru-sib.wikipedia.org/wiki/Кода_времьо_прийдат" rel="nofollow">When the time will come</a>" This "article" makes serious death threats directed against several ethnicities such as "from <a href="../../../u/r/a/Ural.html" title="Ural">Ural</a> to <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chukchi_Sea_8906.html" title="Chukchi Sea">Chukchi Sea</a> all the land will be ours and lest the death meets the rest" and also "We will cover our path with corpses".</li>
</ul>
<p>Need I say more? Wikimedia's sites hosting obscenities, hate speach and even death threats are bound to undermine the reputation of the foundation. If we allow such Wikipedias and links to them, why not allow their own wikiepdias and links to <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Socialist_White_People%27s_Party_0994.html" title="National Socialist White People's Party">National Socialist White People's Party</a>? This entire project is the disgrace to the foundation and is now finally under the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects/Close_Siberian_wikipedia" class="extiw" title="meta:Proposals_for_closing_projects/Close_Siberian_wikipedia">vote to close it</a>. But even while it is yet open, linking the articles about medieval histories to the sites that promote the hate speech is unacceptable.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with censorship. I will welcome the article about Zolotaryov's movement with refeferences to his statements, if he is deemed notable. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 03:26, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am second to Irpen. Until this ru-sib Wiki is cleaned up and radically improved interwiking to it is the spamlinking in tis worst. I think we need a formal RfC to decide if we want any links to it. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 03:36, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Do you have a link to the meta? I'd like to look at the vote; also, if you have any online russian translators, it would be helpful (because, if you say that siberian isn't a language, and can understand it, I imagine I can just type it into the russian translator).

The online RU-EN translator may be found at translate.ru but it will be of no use to you since the so called "siberian" used by Zolotaryov entirely consists of <i>distorted</i> Russian words. So, the online translatior won't recognize a thing. If you doubt that the translations by me are honest and want to verify, you can ask other users from <a href="../../../u/s/e/Category%7EUser_ru_627b.html" title="Category:User ru">Category:User ru</a> (make sure you pick those at the level of ru-3 to ru-n since intermediate speekers won't be able to deconstruct Zolotaryov's distortions). You may also check the discussion I had with another user at <a href="../../../a/4/_/User_talk%7EA4_1c98.html" title="User talk:A4">user talk:A4</a>. Some of it is in Ukrainian as the other user insisted in not using English but from the English parts you can figure the rest pretty easily as I used English specifically to make this discussion available to anyone interested. If you have questions about any particular article in ru-sib, feel free to ask me at my talk page. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 04:41, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How <i>does</i> everyone feel about a community ban on SPUI? After two blocks for adding the SQUIDWARD edit summaries he stopped. But as soon as he returned, he was blocked for 31 hours for a 3RR violation. It's becoming very obvious that he is coming to Wikipedia to disrupt with every edit he makes and not to contribute positively. <i>semper fi</i> — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 19:08, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All prior warnings, notices, and recommendations that he stop become covered by an admin. Yes, you can revert so that it is visible, but when its been covered several times, recovering becomes an incredible hassle. Looking at his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SPUI" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SPUI" rel="nofollow">block log</a> and his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=SPUI" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=SPUI" rel="nofollow">recent edits</a>, it seems as if he does not want to constructively contribute to Wikipedia after "leaving."

<dd>His 3RR block is kind of odd. He reverted the featured article of the day 4 times by removing what he considered was unsourced original research, and then reported himself on the en-wiki mailing list. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 19:27, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Categorizing his recent 3RR block as typical of any past disruption he may have been involved with is not fair, IMO. Even the best editors go into 3RR from time to time, and this specific instance involved enforcing the Wikipedia original research policy on the article that sat on the front page all day. Whether he's exhausted the community's patience, I have no real input on, although I think he does valuable work here. But let's not try to frame this specific instance from yesterday as part of anything greater than what it was. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:28, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly, and we have no real method of knowing which contributions are constructive. The page moves did nothing but create mass controversy and led many editors to quit in disgust. It's even worse when one or two admins reverted his blocks because he was such a good editor. I'll repeat what <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> spoke of during some controversy that SPUI created: "No one editor is indispensable to the project." If SPUI becomes a nuisance, then he should not be able to contribute in that manner; yes, he made good edits, but so have we, and the project continues forward. Whether or not we have SPUI is irrelevant; there will always be other editors to take his place, as clearly demonstrated today. After his "leave", we still have editors on road topics throughout all 50 states that do fine without SPUI. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 21:52, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe because we're here to contribute? On a more serious note, I don't see what exactly is bannable here. Prior to the V 3RR thing, he got blocked for using weird edit summaries on edits that either attempted to remove OR marginally-encyclopedic material or were RfA votes. His second block was for squidward edit summaries on two talk pages. How is this significantly more grounds for banning than using no summary at all? Are people <i>that</i> bothered to see "squidward" on the RC list twice in two days (in latter case)? I agree with Jeff on the description of the V incident. --user:Qviri 20:49, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, it's because the case is not made at present. If the guy is reporting himself for 3RR, then it may be WP:POINT, but it's hardly serial disruption. Basically, we can't see how he's going to behave after the last block. He has built up a lot of animosity from some people, and they're very ready to get the gallows ready, but I don't see him currently earning the noose. I think it has to be an unrepentant pattern, and the only unrepenting problem was the edit summaries, and now he's repented. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:41, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Absolutely: it should not be overlooked, and I wouldn't advocate turning the other way. The question isn't, I hope, all or nothing. I just didn't see anything going on since that nasty episode. If it does, I'll be on board with a community ban, but I think community bans should be when the other person isn't acting out of an interpretation of what's best for Wikipedia. When the other person is misinterpreting or being petulant about their views of policy and practice, ArbCom's deliberative process should be best. When a person is just exhausting everyone by insisting after a clearly settled issue or pride or a desire to play gotcha with someone or a desire to settle political scores (real life ones, like the nationalists and monomaniacs), then it's community patience. That's my view, anyway. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:07, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's my take on the situation. Give him a block that will actually prevent him from disrupting (a few days or so). See how he acts then.

<dd>A short block with the intention if we can bait a user into sockpuppeting is not something I could ever support. However, a permanent community ban for SPUI, who has committed many, many times more infractions and disruptions than plenty of other permabanned users, has ignored countless requests, decisions and judgements, and is bizarrely and inexplicably supported by some admins (is he nice to them on IRC?), and has driven good editors away from Wikipedia, is something I would get behind.

<dd>I'm not sure what a short block would solve either. While I've given SPUI blocks in the past to try to get him to stop being disruptive, maybe those just don't work with him. On the other hand I DO think he adds value and would hate to see him permanently banned. Is there nothing else? No other way to reach him and get at whatever the root issue is? I guess I am more willing than some to keep trying with SPUI. But in the end Wikipedia is not... a lot of things, including a selfhelp org for those that don't want to change, or a babysitting service, or a group therapy session, or a twelve step program, among others. If there is no change possible then, so be it. One more chance maybe but, really, no more. (as an aside, I totally reject the notion Badlydrawnjeff advances above, that "even the best editors go into 3RR sometimes" I've never, ever, ever done that...) ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 12:32, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok... so when the huge edit war over road names he was involved with wound up with a decision he opposed being forced through in unusual circumstances despite a lack of true consensus (again, there were reasons this <i>had</i> to be done and as one of the people who backed it I am here criticizing <i>myself</i>) the 'massively disruptive' reaction he had was to continue making valid contributions, but using the edit summary "SQUIDWARD". For this heinous crime he was blocked... twice. Then, when asked to stop using such summaries... he did! Dastardly. Instead, he went and explained that he was making changes to a new page to remove original research... some sort of theory about how the 'V' in 'V for Vendetta' was probably a reference to the roman numeral for five. That looks like original research to me. Removing it with explanatory edit summaries was therefor... proper. Edit warring when it was re-inserted was not, but seems hardly grounds for a community ban. It seems to me that SPUI is giving his detractors thin pretexts to demonstrate their bias and animosity towards him... and they are happily obliging. SPUI is not being a model Wikipedian, but as reactions to brow-beating and tossing consensus out the window go this isn't exactly the end of the world. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:35, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You ask 'how far'. My standard is quite simple... 'has it reached the point where it seems clear this user will never be a positive contributor'? I look at 'squidward', a 3RR violation in pursuit of 'no original research', and ducks in a pram and see 'silly git'... not 'irrational monster beyond all hope of redemption'. Everything else you list up there is what, months old? And many of them seemed, to me, as much over-reactions and misrepresentations as the accusations of 'blatant vandalism' which accompanied his silly 'squidward' edit summaries (despite no vandalism actually being involved). To put it another way... SPUI made positive contributions, but put a silly 'squidward' edit summary on them. He was then <i>falsely</i> accused of vandalism and a community ban called for. His reaction? He issued no personal attacks, made no disruptive edits, and stopped using the silly edit summary. Where I come from that's called a phenomenal improvement in behaviour compared to the SPUI from months back you describe above. So where the indication that he is a bad bad man who will never do any good? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 18:47, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your framing assumes that blocks for 'squidward' edit summaries were valid. I don't believe they were. 'How long without being blocked' isn't much of a standard when blocks are placed for things which represent no real 'damage' or 'disruption' to Wikipedia at all.

<dd>The only reason the blocks for the squidward edit summaries may not have been valid is because he was never warned about it. After sternly warned, yes, he stopped.

<dd>Agreed, but we might as well take it back to ArbCom. It should not be "300 strikes and you're out", and he's been blocked enough times to make anyone realize that he isn't going to do much of anything that's actually constructive. I'm not 100% sure ArbCom would be able to solve the problem, because they've dealt with him before, and he doesn't seem to have any respect for their decisions. It could still be worth trying, since ArbCom could just decide to indefblock/ban him. An ArbCom block/ban would be less likely to result in a wheel war. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><font color="green">des</font><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat">at</a></b> 00:33, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think this matter can be handled without involving ArbCom. The terms are simple: I think we are all agreed that his behavior needs to improve, that he needs to make a serious &amp; sincere effort at playing by the rules; the disagreement appears to be whether he can be convinced to improve or that he is beyond all hope &amp; we have no choice other than to ban him from Wikipedia. As constructive as he might be (I haven't followed his edits, but for the sake of argument let's say he is), if SPUI -- or any Wikipedian -- is being disruptive to the point that he has received multiple blocks yet no one cares enough to intervene &amp; save him from a permanent ban, then the community has made its decision &amp; clearly wants him gone. So is there anyone who is working with SPUI offline from Wikipedia with the aim of improving his behavior &amp; avoid having him banned from this project &amp; losing his constructive contributions? If there is, I hope that would be enough to convince the "Ban SPUI" faction to have some patience &amp; give him one more -- even if it is only his last -- chance. If there is not, &amp; no one is willing to volunteer to help SPUI from being banned, then it's hard not to conclude that the proper solution is a Community Ban. All it would take is for one person to volunteer to work with him to keep him; otherwise, silence is consent &amp; it's clear, despite what some may say, everyone wants him gone. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 01:24, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think that CBD's summary of the cause of the current situation is very apt. The 'highways' situation became extremely unpleasant -- SPUI was basically at one point being told that not only would he be sanctioned for not abiding by a non-consensus decision, but that he'd be sanctioned for <i>pointing out</i> that it was a non-consensus decision. (Admittedly he was pointing it out rather frequently, but when a bare majority is repeatedly mischaracterised as a "consensus", a certain feeling of frustration is somewhat understandable.) There's been lots of nonsense and silliness from SPUI before (I've been on the end of a small portion of it myself), but this seems to me to be different. This is sheer surmise and speculation, take it for what it's worth, but it appears to me more that he essentially quit the project over that issue, but due to on-going wikidiction and/or wishing to express residual resentment, isn't quite able to go "cold turkey", and so is making periodic forays back. I'm not especially hopeful this will end well, and in the circumstances, I doubt that "area bans" will be at all useful (since if I'm correct, it'll just force him to find other ways to vent, which he'll rise to the challenge of). I'd urge the community not to take any far-reaching steps just at the moment, but if he doesn't knock it on the head immediately, I'd be in favour of a "medium length" block (a week to a month or two, say) to stop him digging himself in yet deeper in the meantime. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 08:00, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have opposed this there, for what it's worth. SPUI can't be banned for a year by that arbitration committee ruling until he has been blocked justifiably under its probation restrictions five times. I count four, at least one of which I feel was unjustifiable. I also feel there is not consensus for a community ban; there is, from what I see, considerable clamor for one, but also some opposition. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 08:33, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You know, as long as SPUI watches it and contributes productively I have no problems with him around. Actions such as the Squidward edit summaries will result in an immediate block from me though. In short, as long as SPUI doesn't mess around, I welcome him here. If he wants to be disruptive, then we have to think about measures.

<dd>I've found that in most cases once SPUI is blocked once or twice about an issue he stops doing it.

However, I truly think that if there has ever been or will ever be a time to permablock SPUI, now is definitely not it. Every edit he's made since blanking his userpage and talk page (with the exception of the ducks in a pram, which doesn't matter since it's his own talk page) has been in good faith. The SQUIDWARD edit summaries on <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shunpiking.html" title="Shunpiking">shunpiking</a> proved he was a "silly git" as someone else said, but the edits themselves were removing original research. Had he used a productive edit summary as he did on <a href="../../../v/_/f/V_for_Vendetta_4f55.html" title="V for Vendetta">V for Vendetta</a>, it would have been more obvious that he wasn't actually committing page-blanking vandalism. His SQUIDWARD RfA votes -- while they did slightly reek of continuing to fail to accept the consensus of <a href="../../../s/r/n/WP%7ESRNC_8601.html" title="WP:SRNC">WP:SRNC</a> -- expressed his honest opinion of what he honestly thought would benefit the Wikipedia community. The highway naming debate that sparked 99% of the SPUI-related controversy has been resolved, and now he's sitting in a corner doing nothing worth commenting at all. If we wanted to impose a permablock, the time to do it was when he was disrupting literally hundreds of highway pages, not when he's minding his own business. It didn't happen then, and it certainly shouldn't happen now. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 20:41, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>He's passive aggressive and has a persecution complex. He complains about abuse, but refuses to police his own behavior (when he moves lots of pages for example, he claims it's not his responsibility to clean up double redirects - it's the responsibility of the person complaining to him about the moves). He needs to be heartily beaten with a clue stick. Maybe a permablock with an out that says "If you apologize for every troll you've made, you can come back with a clean slate" would work, but I very much doubt he could swallow his faux pride. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 10:26, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Various incivil and inaccurate statements above aside... the matter at hand: Tobias Conradi got into some content disputes with Evertype. Both were incivil and edit warring. Various people warned both of them about this. Tobias Conradi removed one of those warnings from his talk page and Nandesuka restored it. He removed it again, she restored it again, et cetera... then she protected his talk page. He called this abusive and Naconkantari blocked him for that as <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>.</dd>
<dd>Frankly... edit warring to keep warnings on someone's talk page is harassment. I've held that position for a long time and I'm not alone in it. Protecting a page you have been involved in editing is one of the few things admins are specifically told not to do. Protecting user talk pages specifically is generally discouraged as it cuts off communication and thus is only supposed to be used in the most extreme cases of vandalism / profanity / releasing personal info / et cetera. Thus, protecting a user talk page you have been edit warring on to enforce display of a message you know the user doesn't want to have there is, <i>at best</i>, a 'very bad idea' &lt;tm&gt;. Tobias Conradi calling it 'abusive' was certainly incivil, but within the realm of semantically feasible descriptions. Blocking him for a week over that seems to me excessive.</dd>
<dd>Put Tobias Conradi in opposition with any other user who also trends towards being obstinate and incivil in disagreement and you have a problem. That's a valid issue which needs to be addressed, if possible. The fact that some of those other users are <i>admins</i> is also rather a problem, and vilifying Tobias for complaining (vociferously) about improprieties doesn't make them any less improper. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:34, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Correction to my summary above - Tobias did <i>not</i> actually remove the warning again after Nandesuka restored it. What he did was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATobias_Conradi&amp;diff=87183214&amp;oldid=87155156" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATobias_Conradi&amp;diff=87183214&amp;oldid=87155156" rel="nofollow">move</a> it up on the page to a section with another warning he had been told to keep displayed. Thus the 'lie' he referred to was Nandesuka's statement that she was protecting the page because he had deleted the text again... he hadn't.

<dd>I'm torn on this. On one hand, he often makes useful edits and he's very productive. On the other hand, we're all volunteers here and quite frankly, he's shitting all over a bunch of people who really don't have to be here, and that's just poor chess. This is not a job, and we're not paid to put up with abuse. As he has shown no interest in speaking civilly with people he disagrees with and responds to just about everything that isn't glowing praise with baseless accusations, I think an RfC is entirely appropriate, and perhaps a ban is a proper possible consequence of the RfC. AN/I probably isn't the right venue for determining this editor's future, though. I don't really have the time right now to put together a representative case, but I'd be willing to assist. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 16:53, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Quite a coincidence on the unblock request thing, given it was posted about an hour before my comment above and about a month after the incident. I can't say any run in's I've had with this user particularly stand out in my mind. Looking a few diffs beyond that one I see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=81455542" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tobias_Conradi&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=81455542" rel="nofollow">this</a> which seems to back up some of the sentiments above, agreeing with a blocking admin when it's against his view point is somehow "mobbing". He was clearly entitled to query my reasoning behing denying the unblock later something which my talk page clearly shows he hasn't (Though given there is a subjective nature to disruption It's also more than possible he still wouldn't be happy with the response, nor would I perceive an endless debate to be useful). Being frustrated at a denied unblock is understandable, but to my mind maintaining such lists a month after the event without seeking any input seems pretty unhealthy and certainly seems to require some action, if this can be getting to (and resolving) the root cause or an outright ban is debatable, though some of the comments above seem to suggest the former is unlikely to be attainable. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 17:14, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How about a mentorship, in the context of a probation, then? I honestly don't think CBD is the right person though, I'd pick someone (on Tobias's enemies list, frankly) that has a widely held reputation as reasonable but firm, and who doesn't have the reputation of being a coddler, and put it to Tobias "either you let this person mentor you, and take their input and advice on board, nicely, and without arguing, or... you're gone...". ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:54, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Chairboy's insinuations about 'enabling' abuse by Tobias are a curious way of describing my objections to the abusive treatment he has been <i>given</i>. I've been 'mentoring' Tobias to avoid incivility consistently, but it is difficult when various users falsely accuse him of vandalism, say he knows nothing, et cetera... and then he gets blocked for any incivility in return. Theoretically, I could block the other people violating policy... but as we've already established I'm not a big fan of blocks unless they are really <i>needed</i>. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 22:32, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If Tobias can't get along with someone that he disagrees with, Wikipedia isn't the place for him. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperMachine_4dd5.html" title="User:SuperMachine">SuperMachine</a> 01:26, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Um, yeah. Seriously folks, the idea that the proper person to mentor Tobias Conradi is one of those who has called him "a ridiculous petulant child", "almost pathological", "utterly ignorant", et cetera seems like a less than feasible plan. Oughtn't his mentor on civility be someone who can abide by it themself? If not being able to get along with people who violate Wikipedia's behavioural standards is a bannable offense then half the admin-corps would have to go.&#160;:] As to <i>politely</i> suggesting that Tobias be civil "not working"... I assure you that it works considerably better than the alternative, and is not itself a policy violation. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 02:53, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Only a person previously uninvolved could be a mentor in the case. Neither CBD nor any of the admins who have blocked him should do it. Anyone who has previously tangled or wrangled or enabled or whatever him already has an opinion, and he of them.

<dd>Assuming such could be found, sure. But I still think someone on his list (that we agree isn't really deserving of being there) is a good choice. For instance I don't think I ever used "a ridiculous petulant child", "almost pathological", "utterly ignorant" in my dealings, and, frankly, I don't buy the incivility charge that CBD is so fast to play loose with when he characterises EVERYONE on that list... my point being that there are those on there who clearly don't belong in any such category. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:25, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fine now that eveybody agrees about Toabias having a mentor. But does it matter who this mentor would be? IMHO, it doesn't because being soft or tough, a mentor is a counselor. I just don't think that this person <i>should</i> be on the list of Tobias' <i>adversaries</i>. The important is that the mentor should be trusted on his voluntary job. True, we don't have to ask Tobias for his view about this because of the circumnstances but we should be neutral (let's remind ourselves that our concern is neutrality). Nothing more, nothing less. I suggest then to go further and settle this issue for now. <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="SteelBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 10:55, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes it does matter who it is. It should be neither anyone on his enemy list or CBD (or anyone involved in prior disputes, on either side.)

<p>Thanks Lar. <i>Better to be lucky than good.</i> Tobias is currently taking a short break. I don't think that makes me his mentor but I do think he needs a friend. I don't know if he accepts me in that role either but for argument's sake, let's say I am that friend.</p>
<p>So, I'm going to ask, very politely and with no grounds at all, that in the course of the next few weeks if you should question something Tobias has done, please bring it to me <i>first</i>, if at all possible. Feel free to email me if you like, though I check my talk more often. I certainly can't be responsible for any other human being, bar possibly my wife and daughter; but I do take on the responsibility for myself of hearing complaints and seeing what little I can do to address them. We are not going to throw away this editor because one of his edges is a bit ragged. Let's be sure we've exhausted all possible remedies before we put him down the chute.</p>
<p>I have promised Tobias that he can work to curb abusive admins <i>when</i> he manages to regain our community's respect. This does presuppose there <i>are</i> abusive admins and I think nobody doubts this is true. It does <i>not</i> presuppose that any particular involved admin has been abusive to Tobias; I don't know and don't care. I will do all I can to steer him onto the <b>now</b>. If someone takes the opportunity to kick him when he's down, I will be concerned.</p>
<p>I can't tell anyone to do anything but I do suggest that it may not be helpful to land too much conflicting advice on his talk page. I urge you all to address your concerns directly to me; I assure you they will get top priority and prompt attention. Thank you. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">John&#160;</a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reid_5801.html" title="User talk:John Reid">Reid</a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_Q4ArbComminee_a803.html" title="User:John Reid/Q4ArbComminee">&#160;°</a> 18:18, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"if you should question something Tobias has done, please bring it to me first, if at all possible"... that's basic mentorship process... everyone should indeed do just that, until and unless it's clear that the mentorship failed.

<dd>Based on his past, I suspect he may be gaming us right now, but I hope that's not the case. I'm one of the maaaaaaany admins he has accused of abuse, and while I heartedly hope he can be recovered, I have a certain amount of skepticism as to his good faith status. He may have more than one 'rough edge', and I hope the perception has not been set that we are trying to 'throw him away', but care needs to be given to keep him from chasing users away and becoming a time sink. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 15:57, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We just discovered many Primetime sockpuppets, some dating back to January (he was banned <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_12.html" title="May 12">May 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/block?page=User%3APrimetime" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/block?page=User%3APrimetime" rel="nofollow">[84]</a>).</p>
<p>Virtually every significant contribution Primetime has made is plagiarized. When confronted, he lies, blusters, and refuses to add sources or produces oddly formatted bibliographies of old books. Typical sources for him are online reference sources (World Book, Grove's Music, etc) that require special access and are not searched by Google. He'll keep insisting he has written the material himself until confronted with proof, when he becomes contrite and promises to repent. Primetime is a true troll, picking fights to cause disruption.</p>
<p>His general areas of interest recently have been encyclopedias and other reference works, letters of the alphabet (esp. A, J, T), the Spanish language, Latin America, World Heritage sites, Third World countries, and China. He has participated as a staunch inclusionist in AfDs, especially those for list of slurs. He's even created MOS guidelines (also clearly plagiarized) and tried to get them adopted.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Wikipedia%3AManual_of_Style_%28tables%29&amp;timestamp=20060711045521" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Wikipedia%3AManual_of_Style_%28tables%29&amp;timestamp=20060711045521" rel="nofollow">[85]</a></p>
<p>This new crop of sockpuppets have been accused repeatedly of adding inappropriate material or even plagiarism, but no one guessed the connection. Anytime we suspect plagiarism and it's being vigorously denied we should consider that it may be the work of Primetime. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:41, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../n/e/e/Neem_Karoli_Baba_4ab7.html" title="Neem Karoli Baba">Neem Karoli Baba</a> was given an AfD tag by a very new editor (18th edit). The tag was removed by another editor, and then replaced by the tagger. This appears to be an abuse of the deletion process, since the subject has several books written about him, and is extremely well known in the yoga community in the U.S. and in India. Can an admin speedy keep this? It seems that just having the tag stay on the article longer than neccessary is inappropriate.

<p>Out of interst, if a deletion tag is added as pure vandalism (for example a "pure vandalism" tag being added to an article that clearly isn't pure vandalism), is it OK to simply revert the page as you would do if the page had been vandalised with abusive language etc, or does it have to go through the normal consenus proccess? <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfectblue97_ef11.html" title="User:Perfectblue97">perfectblue</a> 11:53, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think under the rules you're supposed to let the AfD run its course no matter what, but if someone put an AfD tag on an <i>unquestionably</i> notable article like <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> or <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> that would seem to me to be a perfect example of when to apply <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 12:00, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>That seems to be be two different things - if a Speedy tag is added and it's nonsense, then as long as you are not the author of the article, then I'd say remove. However if it goes to AFD, then I'd like the community speak (if even it's a speedy keep) - mainly because it then provides an AFD to point to when dealing with POV-pushers and the like. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 11:56, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, let's be more specific. Earlier, I went to the page <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECitation_templates_28d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citation templates">Wikipedia:Citation templates</a> and found that user IP 208.108.100.94 placed the following tags on it
<pre>
{{Vandalism}} and {{content}} 
</pre>
. I determined that the edit was pure vandalism and deleted the tags, leaving a message in the discussion page to explain why I had deleted the tags rather than left them up to the comunity. I'm just checking (all be it after the fact) that I did the right thing (in case I run across something similar again).</dd>
</dl>
<p>That IP's edit history shows that it has made a lot of nonsence edits, and has also placed vandalism or similar tags on a couple of user pages and made a couple of nonsence edits to templates too.</p>

In many cases his edits appears to be totally correct, but in other cases changes are made that disrupt or distort articles. He has strong POV's regarding certain issues like the word <b>disease</b> that are inserted into changes. The result is that many articles are left in a state of uncertainty, I am often suspicous that he has made changes that are incorrect, but unless it's obviously wrong, I have no grounds to revert.</p>
<p>There are continuous problems with overlinking unimportant words, creating red links for no reason, creating red links because of spelling errors, linking to DAB pages, linking to the wrong article, etc. Also changes to train station routes that left trains going nowhere and edits that appears to hve no validity. Several UK editors have had to spend time reconstructing articles as a result. About 300 articles have been changed by him, some (as I stated above) without problems, but other really require review to ensure their validity.</p>

<p>Hello, before you all get your panties in a bunch, let me explain. The disambig page needs to go at cork, and it needs to go there now so the rest of the mess can be straightened out. In order to do this, I picked an arbitrary city name amd moved it so the disambig page could be correct. Now you can fight about what to call the city article, as I really don't care in the least what you use. So go fight about that, but the disambig page is correct now <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 01:16, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I really don't care"...the new policy must be "screw process" when you dont have a consensus but want to push things thru'. The reason why consensus is important is that guidelines are just guidelines and not policies and guidelines do not often agree or are not always absolute for every stutation. Is their an admin in the house, please! <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 01:17, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Putting a disambig page in the correct place is not screwing process. The city had to be moved to something in order for that to happen. Use whatever process you like to decide the name of the city, I don't care. However, the disambig page belongs where it is. You have to start somewhere to clean up the mess. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 01:25, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I realize that you guys just had a difficult fight over this one, but sometimes Manual of style considerations are most important. Also, please see <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> - I personally care nothing either way for cork material or for the city, which is more important. However, this page deserves to be a disambig. It won't hurt anyone looking for the Irish article. Having the article at Cork, instead of a disambig page, was creating confusion, as should have been clear by the fact that the newbie thought it deserved to be moved. It's fairly standard on Wikipedia, if there is confusion, to not just link to the more popular article (which county cork could only arguably be): see <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Bush_24e4.html" title="George Bush">George Bush</a>, which could just point to "W.", as he's probably the most popular search, but it properly links right to the disambig page, in case we're looking for "H.W." (Father), or another. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 01:35, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As i said before, fight amongst yourselves about what the city should be called, but cork is the proper disambig page. As much as you guys think Ireland is important, the city is not the most common use of the word. Consensus, and or lack of it does not trump common sense. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 01:43, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, the recent RM discussions were mainly about whether the city should remain the <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html#Primary_topic" title="WP:DAB">primary topic for DAB purposes</a> (which would suggest the city remains are <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork.html" title="Cork">Cork</a>, like <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> which is not a dab page). Both discusssions ended up with no consensus to move the city from <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork.html" title="Cork">Cork</a>, so the recent move was controversial and lacked any consensus. (It also breaks about 1,200 internal links too) While personally I'm neutral on whether the city is the primary topic as there are cases to be made (and have been made) either way, I don't think it's appropiate for two discussions that said "no agreement to do X" to be followed up by doing X anyway, as that will simply cause more ill will in the long run. We are supposed to be <i>encouraging</i> discussion to resolve disputes, but ignoring discussion outcomes will do the exact opposite.

<dd>I did not participate in the discussions, so accusing me of ignoring them is silly. This is a simple thing. Cork referring to the city is not the most common usage of the word in English, therefore, Cork should not point to the city article.

<dd>I see your point, but let me point something out. Pepole that monitor a page often are fans of this thing, and they keep the page fairly biased. The people that voted in Cork looked to be trying to support their hometown rather than keep Wikipedia correct. If people monitoring the Mohammed page decided to change the text to say "it's a proven fact that Mohammed was the Prophet; worship him or go to Hell", it still wouldn't mean it's not NPOV, just because it was consensus. To be honest, consensus is normally the way to go, but if it trumps policy, guidelines, and common sense, then perhaps an outside source needs to step in. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 01:54, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As the user who moved the Cork article, here is why I did it. I typed "cork" into the Wikipedia search box, with the intention of reading about the material. However, I was redirected to an article about a city in Ireland. I've never heard of this city before, whereas almost every English speaker knows what a cork (material) is. So I decided to move the city article without reading the talk page.</dd>

<p>I've seen this thread only after I reverted all things as were before, but nevertheless I stand by my revertion. I see the RM being re-debated here over and over, but has anyone take a goddam look at <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Cork_424c.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Cork">Special:Whatlinkshere/Cork</a>? 99% of the stuff is meant for the city, and it takes a bot to sort out; it would take few hours even with AWB. The arguments <b>were</b> put forward at the RM, and I don't see all of those can be attributed to "Irish nationalism". Breaking things that ain't broken is the just wrong way to do. Satisfying few people looking for <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_%28material%29.html" title="Cork (material)">Cork (material)</a> means pissing off many other people and many articles.

<dd>Please prove that the most common usage in the English langauge, all over the world is the city name. Otherwise, I will move it back. There are a lot of links here because we have a lot of people working on Irish related articles. Moving something and leaving a redirect does not "break" links or require a bot to fix. That's the whole point of redirects. But I'm serious here. You need to back up your assertation that most people seraching for cork mean the city. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 13:03, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>pschemp. We had this debate already - twice. And covered exactly the topic you note above. If you move the page without consideration to the previous discussion, or without attempting to gain some concencus/agreement, then any change you make will likely result in the same "request for admin" as this one did. Please don't make the change without opening a discussion in according to the appropriate renaming policies. <a href="../../../g/u/l/User%7EGuliolopez_903d.html" title="User:Guliolopez">Guliolopez</a> 15:41, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not an Irish nor I particularly care where the Cork city article resides. I was merely the closing admin at the RM who had the page at the watchlist, and was trying to extinguish the fire created by the unilateral move. The arguments for the move were <b>not</b> dismissed as a bad idea: actually, one of strong arguments against the move was the job involved in fixing all the links and suggestion that the move wasn't worth the fuss, and that following WP:MOS to the letter would be process wonking not worth the trouble. May I remind you that people come to articles more often by following a link from another article, than by typing into a search box? I can't prove (or disprove) what's the Average Joe's expected target when typing "Cork" in the search box, but I can prove that it's not Average Joe's expectation that he ends up in a dab page by following a link from elsewhere.

<p>I don't think a couple of dozen editors&#160;!voting demonstrates anything much, even when I'm one of the in the majority. The fact that this has come up again, now with added wikidrama here, suggests that moving Cork-the-city to somewhere and Cork-the-dab-page to Cork may not be a bad idea after all. As for Philadelphia, I think of the stuff in silver plastic tubs, but what does that prove&#160;? Having said that, leaving 1500 wikilinks pointing to a dab page is a Bad Thing. Any move needs to be conducted in a transparent-to-readers way. Decide where to move to; change the current Cork-the-city links to point there; move Cork-the-city there; move Cork-the-dab-page to Cork. No fuss, no drama, no big deal. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 16:03, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Great. As I said before, I have no opinion on what the name of the city article is. However, leaving a disambig page at an incorrect place because people can't be bothered to agree about the city article name is not a good reason to do so. Also, not moving something to the correct place because it will require work is hardly a valid reason either. I'm not going to sit around and wait a year to fix the disambig page because of a petty argument about the city article name. So, please, pick a name, any name but <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork.html" title="Cork">Cork</a> and get it fixed. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 18:15, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Perhaps one of the most fundemental qualities of an admin is someone that can step back from an issue that they have an interest in {your comments make it clear that you believe that the city is not at all entitled to be at <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork.html" title="Cork">Cork</a>} and not make the final decision. Let another, hopefully independent admin, make the final decision - if and when that point is reached.

<p>I created User:PHDrillSergeant/WikiCouch. I copied it to project space (Wikipedia:The WikiCouch, leaving User:PHDrillSergeant/WikiCouch behind in case the essay (not even a policy. An essay.) didn't go over well. Which it didn't.</p>
<p>So after the projectspace version was gone, I decided to continue working on/improving The userspace version. I figured, <i>it's an essay! It's opinion. I can keep it there until it's improved.</i></p>
<p>On the same MfD as the projectspace version, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7EThe_WikiCouch_da09.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:The WikiCouch">Cyde began to argue that the Userspace version should be deleted too.</a>. Well, who the hell am I to argue with an admin? So I put {{db-author}} on it and it was deleted <b>at my request</b>. I had saved a code copy on my computer, and fixed it up, <b>requesting</b> <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">User:Gurch</a> to recreate it. He did so.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, I had changes and altered and improved the essay at this point.</p>
<p>Today, Cyde <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=User:PHDrillSergeant/WikiCouch" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=User:PHDrillSergeant/WikiCouch" rel="nofollow">deleted the page for recreation.</a> This action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is not right since it was a seriously atered version of the page</li>
<li>Is not right because it was userspace and follows different deletion guidelines</li>
<li>Is not right because I had deleted it in the first place</li>
<li>Is not right because I was not notified and had no say in this second deletion</li>
<li>Is not right because it is an act of <a href="../../../w/h/e/WP%7EWHEEL_fbcc.html" title="WP:WHEEL">Wheel-warring</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know how many people are aware of the ongoing incident with the Genmay article. It was tagged for speedy-deletion and I had the misfortune to be the one to evaluate it and delete it. Twice in fact, the first for the hasty reason that it appeared to be nonsense (I failed to check the history properly), and the second time when it was recreated on the grounds that the original and the repost fell under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">A7</a>. Through the protests that ensued, I discovered that this was a repost after a delete-consensus AfD under a different name. (See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_General_Mayhem_6a4e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/General Mayhem">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/General Mayhem</a>.)</p>
<p>Since then I've been the target of mass harassment by the members of the forum. They have <a href="http://www.genmay.com/showthread.php?s=0768460fcc9731920328552c21f94164&amp;t=693067&amp;page=104" class="external text" title="http://www.genmay.com/showthread.php?s=0768460fcc9731920328552c21f94164&amp;t=693067&amp;page=104" rel="nofollow">a thread</a> where they organise and boast about their vandalism and harassment of me and my family, as well as the results of their attempts to Internet stalk me. Their mods seem useless and their site owner seems to take a hands-off approach. Worse, the results of their stalking have turned into bounties on my home address and phone number, as well as proposals to enable a member to track me down where I go to school to assault me. The user "Straw Man", who is very likely <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Straw_Man_0d51.html" title="User:The Straw Man">The Straw Man</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Straw_Man_cf04.html" title="User talk:The Straw Man">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Straw_Man_88f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Straw Man">contribs</a>), in the above thread: "so who's going to beat him up, then? I'm sure we have Vancouver [M]embers". Regardless of whether their stalking has turned up the right "target", this is seriously out of line and way beyond illegal.</p>
<p>I've already blocked User:Genmay for posting what's intended to be contact information for me, but I know it's been spammed across many articles. That was a clear-cut block (inappropriate username) and deletion, but I shouldn't be the judge of the rest of the sockpuppets and meatpuppets as I'm their target.</p>
<p>Their thread has hit over 1500 posts about me and this page's deletion, and they don't seem to be anywhere near to losing interest. They've tried spreading their harassment attempts beyond Wikipedia and their forum to <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/Wikipedia_s_Mod_Saxifrage_deletes_Genmay_page" class="external text" title="http://digg.com/tech_news/Wikipedia_s_Mod_Saxifrage_deletes_Genmay_page" rel="nofollow">Digg.com</a>.</p>
<p>I can take a lot of this garbage, though pulling my family into it is bad since I can't shoulder it for them. What I can't accept lying down are the bounties on my location and the threats of bodily harm. What does one do in such a situation? — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 00:34, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you genuinely afraid for your person or family? I think the chances of some nerd actually hunting you down and killing you with a replica Klingon sword or bad body odour or something are extremely slim; but if I'm wrong about this then I really wouldn't want to have been the one to be complacent about it. But the number of death threats made by forum geeks vastly outweighs the number of murders done by forum geeks by something approaching infinity to one. It's a lot easier to threaten to do something illegal when you know that you're completely incapable of it, physically and mentally. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:43, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To be honest, I've had a number of people threaten awful violence against me on Wikipedia, as I'm sure almost any of us who does counter-vandalism has. But if they're trying to post your home address, and they have a thread about you with over 1500 posts to it, then that's pretty over the top.

<dd>Um ... excuse me? In the first place, no one gave in anything to anyone; the page is still deleted. (I have never seen the underlying page, and have no opinion on the deletion.) In the second and far more important place, and with all due respect, I am afraid I have to strongly question any reasoning that prioritizes rigorous adherence to the deletion review procedure over the issues raised in this thread. The repeated and credible threats of real-life harassment and retaliation against an administrator (or any user) as described above are extremely serious. The need to deter and mitigate the effects of such conduct is of such importance as to supersede consideration of such matters as how long a deletion review is supposed to last. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:53, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't once pushed my point of view, the piece on anarchists was already in the Communism article. I simply gave it a section heading to make it easier to read<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Communism&amp;diff=82459108&amp;oldid=82458507" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Communism&amp;diff=82459108&amp;oldid=82458507" rel="nofollow">[95]</a>. Another editor asked me to source it properly, so I did just that. Anarchist Communism is a very important part of communist history and it's POV-pushing to remove it. As for the socialism article, my so-called "POV pushing" has been to add a wikilink to a description already in the article. Wow! 172's objection is that the term is a neologism, despite <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a>'s post that he can show a use of the French translation socialisme libertaire from 1894 and I've shown a modern use by Chomsky (the person who has popularised the term) from 1970.

<dd>It's not about content, it's about a disruptive editor who has rejected an offer to enter mediation. 172 continues to remove sections of the Communism article without consulting any other editor (I'm not the only one to have reverted his changes). I've shown the seven times he's done the same edit. Is the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Disruptive editing</a> guideline a guideline or not? If so, 172 has rejected mediation, which was my attempt to go to step 4 (Request an Wikipedia:Requests for comment or other <i>impartial dispute resolution</i>.), thus it is now at step 5 when the guideline states "Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents administrator intervention: warning or temporary block as appropriate." <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 22:45, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

And the vandalism warning had been placed in the article itself, so I removed that, as well as the paragraph that was unsourced, unverifiable, and POV. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENationalparks_868d.html" title="User:Nationalparks">Nationalparks</a> 00:21, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Centrx made that mistake with me once, when I was a newbie, he reverted too far back, and a lot of good contributions were lost. But I never said anything, and it was a mistake of his, and so I can't blame him.

The infobox was the only thing that was lost. I agree that ideally, the original edit would be restored to the article's history, but since a) I made that edit originally, and have made it again, b) I didn't compose the infobox myself in the first place, but copied it from the talk page while the page was protected, and c) restoration of a single edit is, frankly, a pain in the butt, I think it's OK for the purposes of the GFDL to let this one slide.

<p>Yes, I have seen a number of editors trying to POV that article, including an instance where they created a POV fork and tried to get the original article deleted in bad faith. They have also tried to load the article with emotional content that does not add anything to the facts. We have NPOV standards for a reason, people. Aecis, I have warned user Notaweasel about his behavior as well and asked him to calm down, but I understand how hard it is to deal with rampant POV-pushers and especially people like bsnowball, who (along with his friends) spend much time trying to deliberately bait their opposition. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 17:27, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We have an editor who keeps inserting instructional poorly written cruffly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dark_Reign&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=88414912" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dark_Reign&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=88414912" rel="nofollow">guidegames</a> material into this article.

<p>Dear Admins, I have recently encountered problems with <a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELance6968_1f77.html" title="User talk:Lance6968">User talk:Lance6968</a>. This started with his placing a question that amounts to a personal attack on my user talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Str1977&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87692242" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Str1977&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87692242" rel="nofollow">[105]</a> (I had no alteraction with him for quite a while so I am unaware of might have provoked this). I reacted by warning him about personal attacks on his user talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lance6968&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87723204" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lance6968&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87723204" rel="nofollow">[106]</a> and he removed my note (which is his right) by calling it "vandalism" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lance6968&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87740495" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lance6968&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87740495" rel="nofollow">[107]</a>. I didn't mind the removal much as I only wanted to inform him, though I resented it to be called "vandalism" and I told him about that in another post <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lance6968&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87742827" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lance6968&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87742827" rel="nofollow">[108]</a>, which he again removed as vandalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lance6968&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87743579" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lance6968&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87743579" rel="nofollow">[109]</a>. After this prelude, he recently popped up at <a href="../../../h/o/s/Host_desecration.html" title="Host desecration">Host desecration</a> and made various controversial edits. I reverted him and he reverted me back. I then explained my objections on the talk page to which he has replied with giving quotes and references (of questionable connection to his points and my objections). He also, and that is what I want to complain about, mixed in personal attacks, this time equating me with "Holocaust denial kooks." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Host_desecration&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=88390427" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Host_desecration&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=88390427" rel="nofollow">[110]</a> and also posting various speculation and niceties about my "superstition".

<p>On his talk page, <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:ScienceApologist#Asmodeus_equals_Christopher_Michael_Langan.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:ScienceApologist#Asmodeus_equals_Christopher_Michael_Langan.3F" rel="nofollow">attempting to reveal personal information regarding me</a> in violation of WP:HARASSMENT. Over a week ago, I politely requested that this user remove the information in question, but to no avail. This user claims that (1) since he put his accusation in the form of a question, it is not really an accusation (despite its clear association of my username with a putative RL identity); (2) he has reason to make an exception to WP:HARASSMENT, namely, (that I supposedly have) a pattern of non-NPOV edits to certain Wikipedia articles. However, since no such pattern exists, ScienceApologist is unable to substantiate this allegation. Furthermore, in repetitive violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, ScienceApologist has attempted to insert <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Michael_Langan&amp;diff=83537124&amp;oldid=81676647" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Michael_Langan&amp;diff=83537124&amp;oldid=81676647" rel="nofollow">biographically irrelevant information</a> on one particular affiliation of the Wikipedia bio subject to whom he accuses me of being identical, evidently as a means of dismissing or discrediting his views (this also constitutes a violation of <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>). Accordingly, I am requesting that the personal information in question be removed. If it is not, then I will regard this as exhausting the normal means of dispute resolution in such cases. (Since this user has recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pseudoscience/Proposed_decision#ScienceApologist_placed_on_probation" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pseudoscience/Proposed_decision#ScienceApologist_placed_on_probation" rel="nofollow">drawn censure</a> from at least two members of the Arbitration Committee, I would ask to be spared any general AGF-type rationalizations of his/her hostile behavior.)

<li>To clarify (without naming names, though the name involved is easily discovered), it has been suggested that Asmodeus is in fact a certain notable individual with a Wikipedia bio, who has been actively promoting theories developed by that individual on Wikipedia in contravention of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> and such. SA has asked if Asmodeus is indeed this individual, claiming similarity in certain known biographical details about Asmodeus and the individual. Asmodeus--well within his rights--has refused to answer the question.--<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 18:30, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree it looks like a bot and it looks like it's operating again. I blocked for another week, but should we contact the school district?

He (at least I presume it is he, editing anonymously) has now deleted all indications of these difficulties from his user talk page.

<p>I still think his user page has much of the makings of a good article about him, but not if it is going to be nothing but his ego trip, and he won't agree to let others work on it.</p>
<p>Again, I'm at a loss for how to deal with this. He is a figure of at least some importance, though I strongly suspect not as much importance as he claims. I'd love to get accurate articles about him, and about the Young Lords, and I'm sure that if he wanted to he could be very helpful, but he seems mainly focused on using Wikipedia to stake out a claim to his own vast importance. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 19:48, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>He clearly shows bias when reporting information on Wikipedia. He Doens't show any sense of impartialiy.

<dd>Legal threats and incivility on this user's talk page, including threats to take legal action and/or seek newspaper publicity based on the fact that some of our administrators (or editors the user believes are administrators) are minors, require immediate attention. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:11, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In defense of "66", I fail to see where he has "threatened to take legal action". He has mentioned that such a possibility exists, but mentioning said does not imply threat anymore than telling someone they have cancer implies that the cancer exists because they created the affliction. Also, I've noted that he's attempted to settled the differences via an e-mail dialog, as he notes on his Talk Page, but so far "Matthew" has refused to participate.</dd>

<dd>Note also that while I'm not really wanting to get myself into a war with "Matthew", I will however submit that he does possess an excessive number of complaints about the severity of his editing on his own Talk Page. This should be taken into consideration regardless of whether or not the complaints against "66" are valid. I submit that it's highly arguable that "Matthew" has brought this derision upon himself, although I'm also willing to accept that he may have done so unwittingly. His contributions to the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost.html" title="Lost">Lost</a> pages are considerable and commendable, but do the ends truly justify the means here? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffrey_Mitchell_656c.html" title="User:Geoffrey Mitchell">Geoffrey Mitchell</a> 01:02, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is incorrect. What was -asked- was that you be open to the possibility that you are wrong. If you'd like, I can post the e-mail contents verbatim, but that still doesn't explain your lack of response. An honest effort was made to open a dialog in hopes of resolving this in a mature, professional manner *without* unwanted interference from detractors/supporters of either side. If you're still willing to discuss and work out the issues we have with one another, the door's still open. I'm sure everyone here who's sick of the dispute would appreciate your participation. <a href="../../../s/i/x/User%7ESixty_Six_19e5.html" title="User:Sixty Six">Sixty Six</a> 07:51, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This thread you are responding to is from yesterday, and I believe the situation has calmed somewhat since then. On reading over the page in question again, I still believe statements were made that, at least, could reasonably be construed as legal or other threats and were therefore inappropriate. It is also submitted that your comments in the second paragraph of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sixty_Six&amp;diff=88279963&amp;oldid=88279798" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sixty_Six&amp;diff=88279963&amp;oldid=88279798" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> are also unhelpful.

<dd>Regardless, no legal threat was made, period. Pointing out the possibility, or warning that someone else could take a particular course of action is *not* a threat of said. Claiming so is simply a case of "shooting the messenger", and if you want to play that game you'd better bring a pretty damn big gun&#160;:-)&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/i/x/User%7ESixty_Six_19e5.html" title="User:Sixty Six">Sixty Six</a> 07:51, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Am I missing something? This whole story seems to have been triggered when Karcha misspelled Khorshid's name as "Khorshit", and InShaneee obviously saw that as alluding to the English 4-letter word. From Karcha's incredulous response, I find it possible that this had not been intended or even thought of, and was an honest misspelling. Karcha is Turkish, and in Turkish there is some frequent variation between name spellings in "-d" and in "-t" (like Mehmed/Mehmet etc.), and "Khorshit" seems to be a possible, legitimate name form (<a href="http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;q=Khorshit&amp;btnG=Suche&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;q=Khorshit&amp;btnG=Suche&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[158]</a>). <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 10:42, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looks like an AIV matter to me also, if you think the admin who removed them missed the point somewhere you can always ask them on the talk page. Similarly you can always issue a final warning/blatant vandal warning, if they are vandlism only, then it won't be long before you'll be able to re-report, for the amount of vandalism we get, delaying slightly (albeit just to jump through hoops) shouldn't be a big deal. You can always then discuss it further later in order to avoid similar misunderstandings later. No matter how much I agree with your assesment of the situation the last thing we need is people getting turned down in one forum and just moving it to another... --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 09:53, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
