<dd>That seems to have been an exception, an attempt to express a close call decision humorously.

<dd>I was surprised to find this here, as I was searching on my own name in response to another issue on the noticeboard. If you have feedback regarding my contributions Zoe, I'd suggest approaching me directly with your feedback. While I've made a lot of contributions regardng AfD's, I've also contributed significant content for articles like <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPG</a> and have provided valuable additions to things like <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a>. While I'd prefer not to receive templates on my talk page, I'd request that if you think that some of my comments have been "bizarre" that you could approach me about such comments directly. As for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Nick_Cater_6542.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nick Cater">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nick Cater</a>, my comment there is more of a typo that argues more for not contributing when tired moreso than for my misunderstanding of Wikipedia (yes, I'm well-aware that we're not a dictionary.) <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 16:48, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I'm posting this here instead of <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a> because it affects many articles. I noticed a pickup in vandalism to TS, and found *www.tourettesguy.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=7* (de-linked due to address now on blocklist) Not only is <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourette_syndrome.html" title="Tourette syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a> being hit more frequently now, but also the several articles about the fictitious "Tourettes guy" that have been AfD'd (and DRV'd). I reluctantly concur that <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourette_syndrome.html" title="Tourette syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a> may need semi-protection for a while, and a closer eye may need to be kept on the TS daughter articles, and the various Tourettes Guy articles.</p>

She recently indicated she would be contributing to Wikipedial much less over the next week, which I think is the ideal time to discuss the situation again, as opposed to timing of the previous AN, where she attacked everyone who even hinted at having a viewpoint she didn't like. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 17:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>She does not realize that Wikipedia doesn't deal in <b>truth</b> - we deal in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V"><b>verifiable facts</b></a>. And when I point this out to her, she provides <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">links</a> that are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.</li>
<li>The opposing editors in the dispute have been doing the same thing, which seems to be ending up in a tit-for-tat dispute where both sides are just going to come out of the matter looking very, very bad, and possibly blocked.</li>
<li>Ilena is very used to being on the defensive, after harassment by some of these editors in real life and on usenet. People have brought baggage onto Wikipedia, and this has fed her defensiveness. This leads to the unfortunate side effect where she gets in this mindset where if someone is not for her, they are against her.</li>

That said, harassment is a two-way street, and Ilena's not exactly an innocent victim here.

It's a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> and also very disruptive to import a real-life feud into Wikipedia (which, after all, is ostensibly <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a battleground</a>).

<p>The thing is, I don't think censure of Ilena will be constructive, as it's just going to mean that a biased article is going to stay biased. For the most part she has been "playing nicer" by staying to the talk page, minus an incident of baiting.</p>

<dd>I don't have any Usenet baggage either. I have always deliberately steered clear of her. Keep in mind that it was her making the first attacks (myriad) that started her problems, both on Usenet, in the courts, and here. That doesn't justify harsh replies, but "who started it" is an important factor here. Before she came here, the editing was getting along just fine. The Barrett v. Rosenthal article wasn't even started by any Barrett friends as far as I know, and that's how she found it. It had been started apparently by some lawyer types (or others interested in California law cases) who were interested in the case. She immediately started violating multiple rules here, and when anyone advised her, she replied with attacks and claims of POV reverts against her as a person, when it was only trying to get her to follow policy. Let's not start attacking the victims of her attacks.</dd>

I had just discovered the article by chance. I think a block of the named editors (the victims of her attacks) who be a gross injustice to editors who had been working just fine before she started attacking all of us and violating multiple rules here, while editing in a severe COI situation, which means it is her who should be blocked from editing the article, and be limited to civil discourse on the talk page.</dd>

Blocks and bans are meant to prevent problems, not be punative. That said though, I'm inclined to agree with you Peter that if this silliness is continued, everyone involved in edit-warring here, particularly those who are actually connected to this outside 'Pedia should be slapped with a topic ban on anything related to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrett_v._Rosenthal_4883.html" title="Barrett v.

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Guy</a>; maybe mediation is an appropriate next step. Many of the content disputes are actually relatively minor (6 reversions on whether to call a publicist a "publicist" or not, without any actual sourcing?!?) They don't exactly require ArbCom's attention - all that's needed is potentially some third-party input to smooth things over. I think <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a> considers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ilena&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96668250" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ilena&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96668250" rel="nofollow">me one of Barrett's minions</a>, so I don't think I fit the bill.

<dd>Full on topic bans all around is the nuclear option; I don't think we are there yet. Better to start with an RfC and move on to RfM if that doesn't help. I've had my own experience being referred to as a shill of sorts on another unrelated topic and I'd say, yes that probably much excludes you as being an acceptable 3rd party. I'd be willing to have a look and make a few suggestions as a completely uninvolved party (I'd never heard of the case or any of the personalities involved here until it started showing up on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>.

<p>I think you misunderstand my proposal. Allow me to clarify. Article bans are a preventative measure, not enforced by blocks unless the editors break them. The idea is to give a "cooling off period" to diffuse a dispute, and I think such a period would be helpful.

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a>. An RfC may well be a constructive tool (NOT a forum to attack Ilena) to air the case and allow Ilena to learn more about wikipedia ettiquette, as well as the principle of truth vs verfiability. I think a soft ban of users from the Barrett related pages would be premature. Especially for editors such as jance who do not appear to have any direct connections to the topic outside wikipedia or have not shown any bad faith editing. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 21:51, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not to put too fine a point on it, Ronz has heckled Ilena with <b>excessive (imho) &amp; tortuous policy reading</b> usages since she showed up that can be very anatagonistic, having had milder heckling issues with Ronz' policy broadsides myself that I considered to be with little merit if not provocative. My take is that sometimes "pro-Barrett" editors are playing with fire on WP:BLP issues with respect to Ilena w/o any recognition. I strain to identify, understand and address some underlying issues although I think that I am fairly aware of many relevant factors. I am hopeful that the "baggage problem" of several can be analyzed, mediated and defused to the general betterment of WP and editors.

<dd>As someone who's been trying to help Ilena, I take great offense at these personal attacks against me. Now's the time to revisit, when it's obvious there are still serious problems, when she's tried to give herself some time to cool off (which I think is admirable), and when the editors that have been helping her feel there's little more they can do without further help or other intervention. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 00:06, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It exists specifically to address such situations, and to prevent the importation of outside interests/feuds to Wikipedia. Ilena's had umpteen chances, and we're still hearing the "Ronz/Fyslee made her do it" argument. At some point, that dog won't hunt anymore and Ilena needs to edit responsibly or face a community sanction.

<dd>Peter, this makes no sense. If there are two or more have a conflict, then consider them. However, your arbitary selection of editors does not. Why do you suggest that I, for example, and not MastCell or Ronz, be blocked? I have no more conflict than MastCell or Ronz, even Arthur. So you need to articulate your reasons for your 'selection', and you have not. I am getting real sick of your dragging me into this. Jance 01:29, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Rosenthal">BvR</a>? or the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackwatch.html" title="Quackwatch">QW</a>/ <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Barrett_fdb7.html" title="Stephen Barrett">SB</a> / <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_National_Council_Against_Health_Fraud_ce1a.html" title="The National Council Against Health Fraud">NCAHF</a> series articles too?) perhaps very late in the article's process. I felt like we were close to necessarily coming to closure on the BvR, SB, NCAF articles, when Ilena was already leaving the field, and that someone filing this premature AN/I has unnecessarily turned it into a free-for-all (as above), jeopardizing a quality closure on the articles, &amp; tearing up a lot of hard earned collaboration from over the holidays.--I'clast 13:40, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>None of this has anything to do with Ilena's relapse in behavior, nor relates to it. I've listed 20 of Ilena's last 50 edits (covering only 3 days) as problematic. Perhaps you should take your personal gripe with me, which you show goes back a month and spans over 1,000 of my edits, to an appropriate venue. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 16:43, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe the best solution for now is to drop this entirely, and see what happens. I do agree wtih MastCell that the Barrett article(s) are near stability. I don't like the idea of talking about one editor when she is not here, and not causing disruption. Further, in <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAHF_c50a.html" title="NCAHF">NCAHF</a> , both "pro" and "anti" Barrett editors agreed that one editor was a problem- the article was unlocked, and if that editor causes disruption again, presumably he will be dealt with by admins. I suggest we adopt that plan for this situation, as well.Jance 20:30, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that's a fine idea. If there's further trouble at the articles, I'd suggest a formal <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERfM_d120.html" title="WP:RfM">request for mediation</a>, since the content disputes tend to be fairly minor. I do want to emphasize that we need to stop making excuses for <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a>. This is not about Fyslee, or Ronz, or other editors - whose behavior has at times been provocative. Right now, Ilena has had umpteen warnings, in plain English, and has been cut a massive amount of slack. It's fair, at this point, to ask her to take responsibility for her own edits and actions, stop blaming others, and follow Wikipedia policy. If she feels she's being harassed, or that Ronz/Fyslee are misbehaving, then bring the matter here, or get an advocate (eg <a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_6d1a.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon">Peter Dodge</a>) or an outside admin to help. That's how things work, and she's been on Wikipedia long enough now to understand that and start playing by the rules. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 23:54, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

While the deletions of the reposted content were by Coredesat, I was the one who did the block. I chose an indefinite block because of one of the summaries Nkras used to recreate the content.

<dd>I'm also of the opinion that the indefinate block is an excessive time period. <a href="../../../n/k/r/User%7ENkras_e8e8.html" title="User:Nkras">User:Nkras</a> has a strong opinion on the subject of marriage and what is the definition of marriage. I came to article when a <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> was placed granting full protection and later removed that same protection after discussions on the article talk page had taken place. During those discussions Nkras was an active participant but he was also able to agree to a IMHO reasonible compromise see <a href="../../../m/a/r/Talk%7EMarriage_186a.html#First_line_goes_right_against_WP:NPOV_and_should_be_altered_ASAP" title="Talk:Marriage">this discussion</a>. Whist a block for his actions were necessary IHMO is that a short term block to enable him to consider his actions would have been sufficient. Additionally Arbcom set a precedent of restricted editing to other editors who have strong opinions than Nkras which should also be considered like at <a href="../../../j/y/l/Talk%7EJyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy_cd81.html" title="Talk:Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy">Talk:Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy</a> with <a href="../../../r/a/p/User%7ERaphael1_183b.html" title="User:Raphael1">User:Raphael1</a>. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 07:43, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am <b>Strongly Oppose</b> this indefinite block. I was one of the users who was both affected by (and highly irritated by) his contentious edits. However, the fact remains that he was the principal author of the compromise reached about the opening section of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Talk%7EMarriage_186a.html" title="Talk:Marriage">Marriage</a> article. He drafted the text that now stands, with input of several other editors. It is a classic example of how Wikipedia is supposed to work. Yes, he has made several mistakes in his time at Wikipedia, but he has learned from them, and I have seen him grow. As to his recreation of the traditional marriage article, as has already been pointed out, it was substantially different from the article that was deleted. While the admins who acted against the recreation may not have known this, it goes a long way towards clarifying his intentions, and his frustration at seeing it deleted once again. I would like to add that this entire situation has been highly stressful for many editors here. <a href="../../../g/m/s/User_talk%7EGMS508_7342.html" title="User talk:GMS508">One user</a> has already left the project due to the block of Nkras, and I am considering leaving myself.

<li>The block was totally appropriate, especially given the edit summary for the recreation and the statement <i>"I will not agree to any "consensus""</i>. <b>I fully endorse the block</b>. Zscout should not be in any way sanctioned for what i deem to be a perfectly appropriate block of a user who specifically stated they will ignore concensus achieved and judged upon by a neutral administrator at AfD, and go and recreate an article after specifically being told not to (but rather to go to DRV) three times! However, I would agree to an unblock in a week's time or so, on the provision that if he recreates the content, or acts disruptively in any form related to Zscout, Cored. or any other editor involved, he is blocked indef. <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel.Bryant</a> <sup>[&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel.Bryant_8f7b.html" title="User talk:Daniel.Bryant">T</a>&#160;.&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Daniel.Bryant_a73d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Daniel.Bryant">C</a>&#160;]</sup></b> 12:13, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I absolutely agree with you on two points: no sanctions against Zscout370 (it was one, isolated overreaction in good faith) should be taken, and that when an if Nkras will be unblocked, his next action against consensus should result in indef or something close to that.

It's why we have <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, and I think Zscout is entitled to a lot of it, and Nkras a little bit as well&#160;:) Also, see Mangojuice's comment below - he sums up the distinction between "indefinite" and "infinte" quite nicely; this misunderstanding is probably cause for most angst. <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel.Bryant</a> <sup>[&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel.Bryant_8f7b.html" title="User talk:Daniel.Bryant">T</a>&#160;.&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Daniel.Bryant_a73d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Daniel.Bryant">C</a>&#160;]</sup></b> 12:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

With this knowledge the community wants to extend to Nkras the opportunity to again participate as such I think an appropriate warning to Nkras that further such actions wont be tolerated and that the indefinated block will be reimpossed if he repeats such actions. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 13:14, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

But until then, I see no reason to allow him to return to editing after time off -- time seems unlikely to settle his behavior. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:55, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have emailed Nkras, and urged him to email Zscout to discuss this block and how to have it removed.

<dd>While I fully respect the decision to block any user with repeated disruptive edits on "hot" topics that claim to "ignore consensus". However, I cannot help but feel that a few things were a little off with the way it happened. First, ZScout said at the RfA discussion that the user's eit summaries were "taunting the admins". I've got the feeling that Nkras's edits were not the main reason why ZScout blocked him, but more because he refused to respect the admin's "authority". Then, the "consensus" citation is off context, as Nkras was making a very good point, per <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. Furthermore, while I like the technicity and poetry of the infinite/indefinite disambiguation, it not fair to the blocked user (nor is it textually correct: "Infinite block" wouldn't apply to its duration, but to all its aspects, so it couldn't apply here): There is a reason why we have 24h, 1weekand 2 weeksblocks. Else we could just indefblock everyone and be done with it. An indefblock makes a user feel at the mercy of the first admin. That's good sometimes: some people need to understand that there is a regulation mechanism here; but right now it's a tad too much.</dd>
<dd>Now, I'd like everyone to understand me real good: I don't like that guy, and if after his 1 week block and some good explanations about why there are talk pages he went back to disruptive edits, commentsand summaries, and <i>then</i> was bloocked indefinitely, I'd be more than happy. But <i>after</i> a short block to let him browse the policies and guidelines, and make his own mind as to wether he wants to be a part of this or not. Not before.

<li>I endorse the indef block of Nkras. He is not a bumbling newbie. He appears to be an upholder of 'absolute truth', which explains his refusal to accept consensus. As such, he is unlikely to accomodate himself to the policies and guidelines of Wikipedia, where, after all, verifiability comes before 'truth'. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 15:20, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree, Donald. Nkras has been here for exactly 2 months, and of his 289 edits, only 76 are to articles themselves. The vast majority are on various talk pages, which doesn't really give one experience in consensus building or constructive editing. In my eyes, he is relatively new, and deserves a chance to learn from his mistakes. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 15:30, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Being unlikely to accomodate" doesn't mean he won't. Unblocking the guy after a week, and watching him closely won't cost much. If he really is the absolute truth upholder you say he is, it won't take two hours after that to ban him once and for good.

<li>I think part of the issue here is that some of you don't have the perspective admins have. I have had the experience in the past of giving a user the benefit of the doubt and trying to monitor their behavior. Several times, in fact. I've learned to be conservative because, let's face it, the upside to any one editor being honestly involved in the project is usually small, but there's a very big downside to disruptive ones. A couple examples that spring to mind are User:Hurricane Devon and <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquafish_f9d6.html" title="User:Aquafish">User:Aquafish</a>, that I was personally involved in. The truth is, <i>one</i> admin watching closely means that they have to divert a good portion of their attention, and be on-wiki 24/7, and spend a lot of time analyzing borderline behavior, agonizing aboud whether to reblock, possibly discussing with other admins, whereas that time could be spent much more productively if the user was simply blocked. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 16:23, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

As to the block itself- yes, an indef block does seem rather long.

If he says, "I am very sorry and promise to always work towards concensus constructively in future," a shorter block might be appropriate.

<li>He has edited numerous times since the block; in my opinion, the tone of those edits is not at all an improvement and more clearly delineates his role as a POV warrior. Check his contribs.

<p>(losing indent) I am not happy with the last sentence. I will not agree to his terms so to speak. However I do think he should be unblocked. I propose this - we unblock for a different time period - say a week (or even straight away if you like) . We <i>advise</i> him to read up on the relavent policies. He can choose not if he likes, I don't care. When he comes back if he engages in further disruptive edits we block him indefinately - end of discussion. That way we don't have to negiotiate with a problematic editor or have to concede to him some power to be the arbiter of truth, and still give him a chance to learn to edit in cooperation with others.

<dd>I will probably let this ferment for a day or two, since you, myself and another person told him about the last sentence. While it is good he is addressing the block, I just do not see anything that convinces me yet of if the block should be shortened, let alone lifted. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 03:17, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am very disappointed at Nkras' reaction. The last sentence he wrote in his "unblock proposal", <i>User:nkras reserves the right to edit and discuss articles based upon objective truth and fact without retaliation by Admins or Editors.</i> suggests that he will continue the same practices that led to the current situation we find ourselves in. Though I have been one of the most vocal proponents of having his block rescinded, I don't feel it is up to Nkras to dictate the terms of his reentry to the community. Nkras has been given a very thorough hearing, and I am now satisfied with whatever decision the administrators wish to return. &lt;sigh&gt; <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 05:44, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am uninvolved, but after reading his skewed proposal, I will have to say I will <b>vehemently reject</b> it. His last sentence is an equivalent to upending not only his entire proposed "compromise," but also core Wikipedia policies with it with his "I'm-right-and-you-better-get-the-hell-out-of-my-face" attitude. Sorry, we're not here to mollycoddle one single editor that the community barely trusts anymore. We're not here to be forced onto a negotiating table with an editor who has blatantly and steadfastly refused to accept consensus as a benchmark for inclusion in Wikipedia, detailed ad nauseum in various pages spanning Wikipedia and beyond. --<sup><a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhysicq210_4b59.html" title="User talk:Physicq210"><font color="#000000">210</font></a></sup><b><a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0" face="Comic Sans MS">physicq</font></a></b> (<i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Physicq210_25e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0">c</font></a></i>) 06:09, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As to the block itself, I have no comment; I'm just trying to clarify things. He considers "kosher" important as an example of language usage. To understand the point he's trying to make with the example currently on his talk page, one may need the context of the preceding discussion.

<p>I've decided to try unblocking him. I feel generally that indefinate blocks are for hopeless cases and I don't (yet) feel he is one. Although my discussion with him hasn't been 100% what I asked for, it has gone well enough. He is not IMO the sort of nut that needs to be permenantly banned. What he does now will prove me right or wrong. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 01:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

A series of them were blocked, based on a checkuser report (see most recently archived case from 3 January, 2007) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Art_Dominique" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Art_Dominique" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>.

The declining checkuser didn't want to explain why it was impossible.

<dd>I can think of a case where you might get blocked for this. Say you edit under your registered name then also as an unregistered IP. If you then violated 3RR under your registered name (against your unregistered one) it would appear to Admins as if you were edit warring and you could indeed be blocked (IMO).

For your information, Racial Reality isn't a "neo-nazi" site you anarchist loser with no hope because your life is meaningless and you don't know ANYTHING on what you read about with these issues. RR is a neutral point of view that seeks to refute neo-nazi, white supremacists, multi-racial, race-denier, assimilationist, biased opinions that influence works including the authors of those books you mentioned.

This could be characterized as a content dispute, except I believe the accepted method of handling things like this is discussing and reaching consensus on the talk page, and the user simply does not respond to messages I leave him on his user talk; he simply keeps reverting the page back to his version. While it is only one user, I feel the article should be semi-protected so he will at least be required to discuss the issue in some fashion before making his changes. By the way, he was previously blocked by <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini">User:Kukini</a> for adding false information to <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cammy.html" title="Cammy">Cammy</a>; one of his first edits when the block expired was to add that false information back in. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 02:52, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The user <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> uses several accounts to terrorize Wikipedia's articles, which fact can be shown clearly by much evidence. That is the reason why the matter has been brought up by users on the talk pages and elsewhere, including the Finnish Wikipedia (the signer of this message was not the first to request the blocking of user <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a>). Below, please allow an explanation and related leads (for the vandal control to catch this abuser of Wikipedia):</p>
<p>Loosing on the Continuation War <a href="../../../c/o/n/Talk%7EContinuation_War_08bf.html" title="Talk:Continuation War">talk</a> page debate, - in desperation - the user <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> appears to seek rescue by trying to blackmail and criminalize the opponents, by unfounded allegations of any sort. With false accusations, he appears to have now targeted the parties that revealed his actions not suitable for Wikipedia (in the talk page comments).</p>
<p>In the Continuation War <a href="../../../c/o/n/Talk%7EContinuation_War_08bf.html" title="Talk:Continuation War">talk</a> page on Dec 24, 2006, the user <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> was pointed out - with evidence <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96302817" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96302817" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> - of having used a couple of user accounts in a highly unjustified manner.</p>
<p>At this point user <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> came to defend himself with an us-signed message: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=96312456&amp;oldid=96311093" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=96312456&amp;oldid=96311093" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> (his IP address was registered as <b>68.39.144.136</b>)</p>
<p>Simultaneously, his alleged duel account, <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiskey_76ec.html" title="User:Whiskey">Whiskey</a> (e.g., the two accounts used the rare and personal <i><b>nah</b></i> word, nine weeks apart), left the crime scene for days, to quickly establish a user page for his protection, after three years of solid and continuous strong POV pushing to the articles relating to Finnish wars of the 20the century.</p>
<p>Three of the users' main accounts, <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiskey_76ec.html" title="User:Whiskey">Whiskey</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoobit_fcfe.html" title="User:Roobit">Roobit</a>, had up till then fiercely fought to push un-sourced POV, propaganda, claims (lies) of the Cold War period Soviet Union to be included in the Continuation War article, and related articles.</p>
<p>At 18:31 Dec 24 (UTC), the several user accounts of user <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> were discussed in light of initial evidence <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96302817" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96302817" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> (more came later).</p>
<p>At the same time, the user <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> was asked to please revert <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96294411" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96294411" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> his vandal style action where he archived messages of other users <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=96088212&amp;oldid=96062276" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=96088212&amp;oldid=96062276" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>, while refusing to archive a highly radical POV article written by his alleged sock puppet account <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoobit_fcfe.html" title="User:Roobit">Roobit</a>.</p>
<p>Despite of continued pleas for the user <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> to revert his action and to also remove the radical article by "<a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoobit_fcfe.html" title="User:Roobit">Roobit</a>" from the top of the talk page, in manner accptable to all parties, he refused to cooperate (relatet pleas can be seen e.g. in the history file of the talk page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;limit=250&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;limit=250&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>  <i>"Please, archive in chronological order"</i>).</p>
<p>Instead, the user <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> has continued fighting fiercely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=96312456&amp;oldid=96311093" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=96312456&amp;oldid=96311093" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> to keep the text on the top of the talk page, by all means.</p>
<p>Thus, administrators, please help: see to it, that the text <i>Request to move or delete article</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Continuation_War" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Continuation_War" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> will be finally transferred to the archives, where much newer and appropriately sourced writings have been placed by the user <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a>. Please, also see to it, that the user <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> will no longer get to terrorize and dominate the talk page - or related pages - in question, by clearly playing against the rules.</p>
<p>Despite of the clear evidence provided on Dec 24 of misuse of user accounts by the user <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> in very unacceptable manner, he was not reported further. Instead, he was asked to begin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=96322848&amp;oldid=96322337" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=96322848&amp;oldid=96322337" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> cooperating from thereafter. He appeared to agree (except that he wanted to finish off by making a "check user" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96329955" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Continuation_War&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96329955" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> of someone on the opposing site first).</p>

<p>A bit closer look to the related user contributions by the accounts in question reveal a pattern of same wordings between the accounts. A number of other characteristics common to his user accounts are easily noticeable as well, such as use of space in the beginning of typing when editing is done etc. (more evidence against the puppeteer is available on the talk pages and in the Finnish Wikipedia, as well), also the smileys and signatures:</p>

Why this rampage, even worse than normal? The reason is the very same, as in his contacting the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_IP_check_0d7a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/IP check">checkuser</a> - see here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Husond&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98161341" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Husond&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98161341" rel="nofollow">[65]</a></p>

<p>This was <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a>, who was upset about this proposal to end the deadlock:</p>
<p>From the piece of conversation copied below, one will be able to see, how the user <b>accidentally uses his "wrong user account"</b>, <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoobit_fcfe.html" title="User:Roobit">Roobit</a>, when he intends to answer to a questions as <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> (this has happened before): <i>"… I did?

<p>Besides, under all three main accounts of his in the Continuation War concersation, the user uses offending and threatening language, which is not suitable to Wikipedia:</p>

<p>A user, <a href="../../../b/m/7/User%7EBm79_c438.html" title="User:Bm79">Bm79</a>, brought to my attention yesterday that most of the <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan_%28Iran%29_b612.html" title="Azerbaijan (Iran)">Azerbaijan (Iran)</a> article was originally copied from <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/az/AzerbjIrn.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/65/az/AzerbjIrn.html" rel="nofollow">The Columbia Encyclopedia</a>.

<dd>Hum. My advice would be...
<dl>
<dd>a) Leave <a href="../../../a/z/a/Azarbaijan.html" title="Azarbaijan">Azarbaijan</a> as redirect; knock <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan_%28Iran%29_b612.html" title="Azerbaijan (Iran)">Azerbaijan (Iran)</a> back to just before the copyvio was merged in (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Azerbaijan_%28Iran%29&amp;oldid=35871550" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Azerbaijan_%28Iran%29&amp;oldid=35871550" rel="nofollow">[74]</a>), and work from there; then</dd>
<dd>b) see if you can find any other articles the user who pasted it in did this to.</dd>

<dd>No, we actually can keep it. Ideas themselves cannot be copyrighted, only works. Reference articles are already not very unique, and if they're re-written, then you've basically used the original work as a reference, plain and simple. It's not the same thing as re-writing something like a poem, which would be a copyvio.
<p>I think it's important to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Avoid_copyright_paranoia" class="extiw" title="meta:Avoid_copyright_paranoia">avoid copyright paranoia</a>. It's also important to take into consideration Wikipedia's position as a non-profit entity and the use of this material for educational purposes vis-a-vis copyright law.<sup><a href="http://www.nolo.com/article.cfm/ObjectID/612A23E4-4728-4B08-85B3072753D47721/catID/DAE53B68-7BF5-455A-BC9F3D9C9C1F7513/310/276/FAQ/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nolo.com/article.cfm/ObjectID/612A23E4-4728-4B08-85B3072753D47721/catID/DAE53B68-7BF5-455A-BC9F3D9C9C1F7513/310/276/FAQ/" rel="nofollow">[75]</a></sup>--Beautiful Scars 04:55, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did read it before posting those comments; it was clearly a ripped-off version of their text. The "rewriting" was re-ordering a couple of sentences and tidying it up; the "history" section read like a second draft of the original. If people had taken the source material and rephrased it in their own words we would have no problem - but they hadn't done this. We were reprinting Columbia's article and passing it off as a) our own and b) licensed under the GFDL, which is plain and simple copyright violation. This is not "copyright paranoia", it's a plain and simple fact.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia's educational and non-profit use gives us much latitude wrt fair use, but it doesn't give us the ability to <i>relicense other people's material as free content</i>, which is what we were doing here. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 05:03, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would like to bring to your attention of the recent activity on the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bharatanatyam.html" title="Bharatanatyam">Bharatanatyam</a> page. Some of the users once in a while will take off information from the site such as the origins of the dance from <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_Nadu_d7a5.html" title="Tamil Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, also some of the historical mentionings of the dance in <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_literature.html" title="Tamil literature">Tamil literature</a>. There seems to be some kind of POV advocacy which pops up once in a while. Also, there are some users whom are posting links to advertisements. Furthermore, I have noticed that these users do not have their own user name page. Below are the following user names which have been involved in such activity:</p>

</ul>
<p>I have also posted messages on the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Talk%7EBharatanatyam_5e91.html" title="Talk:Bharatanatyam">Talk:Bharatanatyam</a> page after each incident. Much work has been put into this topic with cited sources. This continuous POV editing, deletions, and Spamming does not help the article one bit and is becoming a nuisance. Hopefully this will stop.</p>

<p>I have indefinitely blocked User:Cool maestro, who has uploaded scads of obviously copyrighted images tagged with {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGfdl-self_62d8.html" title="Template:Gfdl-self">gfdl-self</a>}}. He specifically claims to own the copyrights. I hadn't communicated with the user prior to blocking, but others (such as <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">User:BigDT</a>) had, and I noticed Cool maestro had blanked those messages off his talk page without responding and was continuing to upload more material. I invite review from the community on this; I've been deleting his image uploads that are clearly copyrighted (and ones that aren't, such as Image:Cool indian.jpg and Image:China dude.jpg) are probably copyrighted but not obviously so. It's my position that if I hadn't blocked him right away, he would continue to upload images he almost certainly doesn't own and create a huge mess that would need cleaning up. Whereas, if he somehow actually owns copyrights to all those movie posters, and yet uploads images with names like "Cool indian", it can be worked out through email, and permissions@wikimedia would need to get confirmation anyway. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:27, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

He was asked to stop disrupting by other editors including myself. I sent the page to RfC and I explained the main reasons why I thought the "piss christ" reference was both irrelevant and trivial. I also explained that it was better situated on a general article about <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desecration.html" title="Desecration">desecration</a> rather than the article about a specific incident of Quran desecration that occurred at Guantanamo Bay. He never bothered to add the link to the general desecration article, but insisted that it belongs on this more specific article, even though his main argument is that they are both forms of general desecration and/or religious intolerance. This suggests to me that the only reason he is making the change on that article is to "get back" at me by reverting a change I made rather than because he actually believes his own arguments. I feel that such behavior is disruptive and I asked him to stop. I stated that if he felt strongly that "piss christ" was something specifically related to the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an_desecration_controversy_of_2005.html" title="Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005">Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005</a> then he should be willing to write a couple of sentences indicating what the link is between the two and enter those sentences in the article, so that the reference does not seem to come out of nowhere. He refused to do so. It seems his only interest is in one-upping me, and indeed, in another dispute a few weeks ago, he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Conflict_of_interest&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94809596" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Conflict_of_interest&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94809596" rel="nofollow">admitted as much</a>. Instead of allowing other editors to comment on the RfC, he has continued to repeat himself on that section of the page, without responding to the arguments I brought up. That section has become a long mess of tit-for-tat arguments, making it unlikely that many other editors will take the time to sort the arguments out there and actually move the dispute forward. It is alarming to me that such energy has been expended over something that seems to me utterly noncontroversial -- adding the words "piss christ" to a totally unrelated article.</p>
<p>While this dispute was ongoing, I made an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qur%27an_desecration&amp;diff=97871310&amp;oldid=97709530" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qur%27an_desecration&amp;diff=97871310&amp;oldid=97709530" rel="nofollow">edit</a> to the article <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an_desecration.html" title="Qur'an desecration">Qur'an desecration</a>, another article that Isarig had never edited before. Again, he showed up out of the blue just to revert me, and has already reverted me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qur%27an_desecration&amp;curid=1901444&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qur%27an_desecration&amp;curid=1901444&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">three times</a> in 24 hours. I asked him to stop stalking my edits and he threatened to report me (which to me was the final straw, leading to this report). This is a pattern in my interactions with this user -- he revert-wars over petty items; he refuses to acknowledge any POV other than his own, he accuses me of personal attacks while at the same time personally attacking me. He constantly threatens to report me over minor infractions while at the same time engaging in personal attacks that are often vicious (witness, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Juan_Cole&amp;diff=88544636&amp;oldid=88524749" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Juan_Cole&amp;diff=88544636&amp;oldid=88524749" rel="nofollow">this comment</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Juan_Cole&amp;diff=88552896&amp;oldid=88551664" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Juan_Cole&amp;diff=88552896&amp;oldid=88551664" rel="nofollow">this comment</a>, from a while back, where he specifically attacks me for my occupation, tells me that I am not fit for employment in my job. While those comments are from a while ago, he again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Qur%27an_desecration_controversy_of_2005&amp;diff=98018679&amp;oldid=98017924" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Qur%27an_desecration_controversy_of_2005&amp;diff=98018679&amp;oldid=98017924" rel="nofollow">brought up my occupation</a> as a means of attacking me -- a direct violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, which suggests that personal attacks include "Using someone's affiliations as a means of dismissing or discrediting their views - regardless of whether said affiliations are mainstream or extreme." Throughout the discussion on that page he charged me over and over with "insulting other editors" yet never cited a single example of where I had done so. I am tired of being sucked into arguments with him over petty reversions. I am here to improve the articles, not to get into shouting matches and ego battles with other editors. I don't like reporting people to WP:ANI because I prefer these matters be settled in discussion; however, when he threatened to report me for accusing him of stalking - which he has demonstrably been doing - I felt the time had come to make a report. I hope his disruptive editing, and previous blocks for incivility (in particular, a libelous comment made a while back about the subject of a WP:BLP) will be taken into account when determining how long of a block his behavior merits. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 22:29, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Conduct unbecoming the dignity of the academic profession? I'm sorry, but this has absolutely nothing to do with my profession, that was my point. And if you have a complaint about my behavior in the classroom, or other aspects of my profession, please take it to my supervisor -- I will happily provide you with all the personal information you need about me to register your complaint. In the meantime I will ask that you, Isarig, and anyone else, refrain from using my profession to personally attack me.</dd>
<dd>In your "rebuke" you said neither side was above reproach, and <b>I agreed with you.</b> I did not cite the older incidents above to make the same complaint again -- I cited them to establish that Isarig's reference to my profession was out of line and followed from a historical context of such comments; that it was not just a single offhand reference. I most certainly did not expect to receive a similar insult from an administrator. I am not "forum shopping," and I resent the accusation. I cited the older incidents only to establish the history of the current dispute. Please note that when you "rebuked" me you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=89145609" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=89145609" rel="nofollow">removed your comment</a> specifically directed at my "aggressiveness" and that I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=89145700" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Personal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=89145700" rel="nofollow">responded to you</a>, explaining why I responded to Isarig the way I did.

Meanwhile, he stalks me on the Quran desecration pages, making arguments that seem tongue in cheek at best if not complete sophistry. I have opened an RfC on the Quran page, and presumably that will eventually reach some resolution, but what is to stop him from stalking me to another page and starting this whole mess over? I am trying to follow your advice from before and not get sucked into these wars, but he is pursuing me relentlessly. I feel that your approach is to reward the more abusive user by signalling that his abusive actions will be successful (and even joining in on the insults directed to my profession!) I don't know what you do for a living, but how would you like it if I started saying that your conduct on Wikipedia made you a disgrace to your profession?

<dd>All I'm asking for is the objectionable behavior to stop. I could go through and point out the distortions in his comment above (e.g., my first edit to the Said page was not a revert of anything Isarig did; in fact I had no idea he edited that page at all until he reverted me -- which is why I thought he was stalking me there [something he subsequently did on other pages; see above]; or I could point out that the admonition to "grow up" - the one thing that I said that could be characterized as a personal attack in the recent disputes with him - is something I subsequently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Middle_East_Media_Research_Institute&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=97870236" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Middle_East_Media_Research_Institute&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=97870236" rel="nofollow">struck out</a> and I asked Isarig to show good faith and strike out his accusation that I was a "liar", which he did not do). There is currently mediation on one of the pages we have a dispute over, and there is now an RfC on another page -- I think individual disputes will eventually be resolved but my problem with Isarig is that it has become personal and he is now following me to unrelated pages and reverting things out of what seems to be spite. If he is willing to back off, I am too. But someone besides me ought to tell him that this behavior is objectionable.<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 07:50, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please stop the false accusations Isarig. I did not stalk you on any of those pages, as you are well aware. You demonstrably stalked me on two pages about Quran desecration -- the only reason you showed up on those pages was to revert my changes and to pick a fight with me in talk. The above "3" only identifies one instance of actual incivility and it is one I struck out and apologized for. (I had not seen that you struck out the word "lie" as you never mentioned it in your comments; I thank you for that, and perhaps we have some basis from which to move forward). I have the "gall" to complain about your behavior because it is beyond the pale, and because you continually threaten to report me for nothing while at the same time relentlessly violating the very rules you accuse me of violating. As I said above, all I want is for this behavior to stop. I just don't have time for this.

<dd>Every single one of those pages I have mentioned are pages where I had been editing, and you had not, and you suddenly showed up shortly after one of my edits there to either directly revert one of my edits, or introduce a change in a section I had been editing that is contradictory to what I was writing. By your own definitons, these constitute stalking. Each one of the 3 above constitute an instance of incivility, and if you don't think that saying that an editor who defends a certain position is "not in his right mind" is uncivil, then that is perhaps the root of the probelm - you have no concept of what civility means. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 23:13, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I never showed up to a page that I had not been editing just to revert you. On the Said page I edited for the first time; I was reading student papers at the time that were about Said's work, and it occurred to me to take a look at his wikipedia page. As I stated above I had no idea you edited that page before me - I don't always examine the history page before editing a page - and as another editor has confirmed, I did not revert you -- it was you who immediately reverted me. Stalking does not mean editing the same page as someone else -- it goes to the motivation for the edits. When you are going to the page specifically to revert war against someone that you had another edit war with in the past, it is considered stalking. The MEMRI page, as you know, I first went to the talk page and engaged the discussion; I did not revert you until it became pretty clear that your position in the discussion was indefensible. And you are really distorting things on the Karsh page - my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Efraim_Karsh&amp;diff=72937835&amp;oldid=72910566" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Efraim_Karsh&amp;diff=72937835&amp;oldid=72910566" rel="nofollow">first edit there</a> appears to have been fixing a name problem on the Juan Cole link that another user had created. My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Efraim_Karsh&amp;diff=81104411&amp;oldid=81092192" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Efraim_Karsh&amp;diff=81104411&amp;oldid=81092192" rel="nofollow">first edit that you objected to</a> was a month later, and it was an edit that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Efraim_Karsh&amp;diff=81104830&amp;oldid=81104411" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Efraim_Karsh&amp;diff=81104830&amp;oldid=81104411" rel="nofollow">you immediately reverted</a> without discussion. All of that was months ago; to say I stalked you there is absolutely untenable. However, your actions on the Quran pages are clear cut -- you appeared there out of the blue and focused all your energy there on reverting warring against me, and you got quite abusive in the talk section. Your claim that I "have no concept of what civility means" is rich; it is itself more uncivil than the comment by me you claim is uncivil! When I said I don't think anyone in their right mind would go to the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an_desecration_controversy_of_2005.html" title="Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005">Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005</a> looking for information about the <a href="../../../p/i/s/Piss_Christ_af32.html" title="Piss Christ">Piss Christ</a>, I was making a rather obvious point that the two have nothing to do with each other, not attacking a particular editor. Can you say with a straight face that if you wanted to know more about a controversial artist from the 1980s you would type in <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an_desecration_controversy_of_2005.html" title="Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005">Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005</a>?

<dd>I don't know what your motivations are (or were) when you appeared on the pages you had editied shortly after I did to introduce a different POV than mine. Perhaps it was all an inoccent coincidnce as you allege here - orperhaps you were wikistalking me. The point is - that the same is ture of my actions. You have no idea what motivated me to edit the Quran desecration page (and never bothered to ask), you just assume I was stalkign you given the same set of circumstance that apply to your own 3 cases of stalking. Either all of them are, or none of them are. The when I defed a certain edit (as I did), and you say that whoever defends such an edit is not in their right mind you are attacking me, and being uncivil.

<dd>I didn't say it was an "innocent coincidence" -- I said you were distorting the facts, and as I have shown, they are extremely different in the instances you cite. My POV was obviously quite different from yours long before we started editing any of this stuff, so POV difference is not evidence of any stalking. Specifically showing up to start revert wars is. I did not say you were not in your right mind; I said nobody in their right mind would come to the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an_desecration_controversy_of_2005.html" title="Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005">Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005</a> looking for information about the <a href="../../../p/i/s/Piss_Christ_af32.html" title="Piss Christ">Piss Christ</a>.

It is amazing that you immediately accuse me of misrepresenting things when you know for a fact that I was not. You are right about the other link but it is not a personal attack -- I said "I cannot believe anyone in their right mind would defend the addition." I did not say that anyone who defends the addition is not in their right mind. You could infer that but you could also infer that I don't believe you; given our prior interactions that would be the more obvious conclusion. But in any case it is a ridiculously minor point - there is nothing "damning" about any of this. The real issue here is the aggressive edit warring, the smearing of other editors, and the wikistalking. On the first two of those charges at least, it is pretty clear that I am not the only editor who has found your actions unacceptable. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 01:51, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Isarig on some points and disagree on others, but his/her smearing and slander really has to stop. Isarig is far too eager to call other Wikipedians "liars" if they disagree with him and I am willing to pass on to an administrator proof that his similar past accusation against me (which remains unretracted) was false. <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamousdog_bfbc.html" title="User:Famousdog">Famousdog</a> 19:01, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Isarig behaves like a pathalogical edit warrer, bringing the brutal methods of the Israeli Arab conflict to the pages of Wikipidea. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 20:28, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Abu Ali brought this to my attention, presumably since I was involved on the Said page. Obviously I don't know the full situation, but I can say a couple things: 1. Sloat's first edit on <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Said_407a.html" title="Edward Said">Said</a> wasn't a revert of Isarig, but an edit of information put up by Jayjg.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Said&amp;diff=96355971&amp;oldid=96198967" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Said&amp;diff=96355971&amp;oldid=96198967" rel="nofollow">[78]</a>. 2. Isarig then reverted Sloat and has proceded to edit war against a number of editors on that page over several days, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Said&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Said&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[79]</a> including Zero0000, Sloat, Filius Rosadis, and me. I'd note that Isarig's last comment in talk on that page is on Dec 29,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Edward_Said&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Edward_Said&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[80]</a> which was responded to, while he has reverted the page four times since then.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Said&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Said&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[81]</a> That's all I can really say about the situation. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 21:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't been following these disputes, but I see little wrong with the 3RR warning Isarig left on Jgui's page, mentioned by Lee Hunter above. I also find Abu Ali's comment above to be way out of line, and possibly indicative of the kind of attitude that Isarig has been up against. There's an increasingly concerted effort by a number of editors to blacken anything to do with Jews, Judaism, or Israel, often involving violations of WP:V and WP:NOR and poor editing in general. Some of the criticism is perfectly legitimate, of course (when it comes to Israeli government policies), but some of it definitely isn't, and it often veers toward apparent hatred of Jews in general. In addition, there's often obvious sockpuppetry involved, and therefore a reminder not to bite the newbies misses the point.</dd>

<dd>The 3RR warning was a polite explanation of the 3RR rule, and a request for self-revert, as a gesture of courtesy for a newbie. There was nothing blunt nor rude about it, and it is probably much softer than WP's standard 3RR template. You come here to complain about uncivil behavior, and you call my edits a "hissy fit"? Have you no shame? Or at least, a decent mirror? The user removed the warning with an edit summary that called a valid warning for an acknowledged 3RR violation "a bogus threat". <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 00:12, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Abu Ali, my comments were deliberately not aimed at individuals — for obvious reasons, but also because my intention was simply to highlight the problem in general. Regarding your own edits, I'm not familiar with them. My only criticism of you is that your comment above was out of order ("Isarig behaves like a pathalogical edit warrer, bringing the brutal methods of the Israeli Arab conflict to the pages of Wikipidea"), and perhaps illustrative of the hostile atmosphere Isarig finds himself editing in. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:15, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

And racism and prejudice of all kinds, as well as appalling incivility etc. SlimVirgin as someone who is easily identified with Jewish and Israeli topics is better placed than most to notice an increase.

<dd>I'm staggered that you can actually condense this whole thing down to "a bunch of editors out to get the Jews". Where the heck is that coming from? One of Isarig's (and his "teammates"') most egregious rv wars is his belligerent insistence that the Juan Cole article include a defamatory insinuation that Cole is literally a protocols-of-scion anti-semite and that the article must not include Cole's response to the charge. I'm offended by your remarks. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 00:09, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

What matters is that there is an <i>extremely hostile editing environment</i> around some of these articles, as Abu Ali's comment to Isarig amply demonstrates.

<p>My opinion on this was solicited. I personally have not had any problems with Isarig. There were some disputes between Isarig and others on the talk page for <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a>. There were disputes between many people on that talk page. But it seems like the disputes have been resolved in the last few days. I think, though, that part of the problem I am feeling from reading the incident noticeboard, and various talk pages, is that people are taking sides, instead of attempting to maintain <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> wikipedia pages. I urge people who have strong viewpoints about the issues on such highly-charged topics dealing with the Arab-Israeli conflicts to set them aside while editing wikipedia pages. I hope people from all sides of these issues sign on to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Arab-Israeli_conflict_784c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Arab-Israeli conflict">Wikipedia:WikiProject Arab-Israeli conflict</a> and pledge to work on related wikipedia pages in an NPOV way. NPOV does not favor or block viewpoints on the Arab-Israeli conflict pages. NPOV allows all significant sourced viewpoints to be put on those pages. Some people from all sides have been favoring particular POVs by selectively censoring or diminishing other sourced viewpoints. And some of the discussion on those pages has been really over-the-top instead of being focussed on the article content and meeting wikipedia guidelines. People have been making too many reversions without discussion. Resulting in slow-motion edit wars. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 00:26, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not understand why a complaint about <i>"bringing the brutal methods of the Israeli Arab conflict to the pages of Wikipidea"</i> is considered out of line but a complaint about <i>"an increasingly concerted effort by a number of editors to blacken anything to do with Jews, Judaism, or Israel"</i> is not. I would say we'd do well to avoid both. I would add, however, that I've seen relatively few statements like the former, and when they do appear it's usually from some short-lived crank like Kiyosaki. Statements like the latter, on the other hand, are routine on articles related to Israel/Palestine, and they are quite common even from influential editors with administrative powers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for Isarig, he and I have had our share of encounters. I think he can be a wilfully obstinate, baldly ideological revert-warrior (in the current Juan Cole dispute, he is claiming that Cole's dismissal of charges of antisemitism as "outrageous" constitutes an <i>ad hominem</i> rebuttal, and therefore cannot be included alongside the article's coverage of said charges). Beyond that, however, I've never once even suspected that he might be stalking me, and as regards personal remarks I've never found him to give worse than he got, and I'd know. I think csloat is a good and reasonable editor, and we share a position in the Cole dispute, but I don't think the stuff about Isarig's personal attacks amount to much. Csloat says hey you'd fail my class, Isarig replies hey maybe you're not qualified to teach - this is all just rhetoric. Who says talk pages can't have a little verve and color.</dd>

I did not tell people to contibute to the ANI report or tell them what to say. The charge that I was "soliciting negative input" is false. The comment to the effect that this is a "severe vioaltion of numerous WP policies, including <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>" is baseless, and coming from Isarig, hypocritical.

<dd>I haven't been following these disputes, but I see little wrong with the 3RR warning Isarig left on Jgui's page, mentioned by Lee Hunter above. I also find Abu Ali's comment above to be way out of line, and possibly indicative of the kind of attitude that Isarig has been up against. There's an increasingly concerted effort by a number of editors to blacken anything to do with Jews, Judaism, or Israel, often involving violations of WP:V and WP:NOR and poor editing in general. Some of the criticism is perfectly legitimate, of course (when it comes to Israeli government policies), but some of it definitely isn't, and it often veers toward apparent hatred of Jews in general. In addition, there's often obvious sockpuppetry involved, and therefore a reminder not to bite the newbies misses the point.</dd>

If someone has been edit-warring inappropriately, how else do you uncover this other than through the comment of those who were invovled?

<dd>Daveyweeb, Ali's quoting the actual title of the section on this page there, not writing those words himself, so it's a little unfair to say he's leading people on with that comment. I also don't know of any wikipedia policy against letting other users know about WP/ANI reports about users that they have had negative (or positive) interactions with in the past. Finally, Slimvirgin, can you explain what any of this has to do with antisemitism? I found your comment only tangentially related at best to the earlier dispute when you posted it the first time, but I fail to see any connection at all to the dispute here. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 23:04, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Csloat, my concern is that there's an increasingly hostile editing environment around articles to do with Jews, Judaism, and Israel. I've been editing for over two years, and while we've always had that problem, it's clearly getting worse, and the lines between legitimate criticism of Israeli government policy and antisemitism are becoming ever more blurred. A good example of that was <a href="../../../k/i/y/User%7EKiyosaki_cbdf.html" title="User:Kiyosaki">User:Kiyosaki</a> who turned up a few weeks ago to disrupt <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a>. It was obvious to many of the editors used to editing these pages that Kiyosaki was a bigot, pure and simple, but it wasn't obvious to some of the anti-Israel editors on the page. It took us some weeks to work out whose sockpuppet he was, but he was finally exposed as the account of an old-time, well-known antisemitic editor. During the time he was editing that article, however, he caused a lot of disruption and bad feeling.</dd>
<dd>That example isn't isolated. We see antisemitic editors all the time trying to take advantage of anti-Israel POV to cause ill feeling and problems for editors they perceive as Jewish. Usually they out themselves over time, because they get more and more extreme, but not always. It's a problem I would hope all editors of goodwill would help to look out for, because it affects both "sides" of the Israel debate equally. It makes editors who tend toward support for Israel feel stressed and under constant attack, and it makes editors more critical of Israel look bad when they find themselves supported by antisemites. It makes Wikipedia look bad to have these articles veer back and forth between POVs, with bad-faith sockpuppets gleefully holding sway on talk pages and threatening regular editors with the ArbCom. The same problems crop up, for the same reason, on pages to do with Jews and Judaism. I see it as a problem we should all work on together. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that antisemitic editors should not be welcomed here, but I just don't see how it's relevant to this particular discussion. I'm not anti-semitic or anti-Israel myself, and I haven't seen any evidence that anyone else in this discussion is. True, Abu Ali's comment comparing Isarig to the Israeli military was over the top, but it wasn't anti-semitic. I think we could all stand to take a deep breath and relax here, and I'm going to volunteer to be the first to do so.<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 23:39, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was Abu Ali who has tried to switch the focus to antisemitism, but it's not only a question of that. It's that there are concerted efforts to make Israel and Jews look bad, for whatever reason. The motive is sometimes antisemitism and sometimes an unexplained obsession with making sure that Israel looks evil. The motivations don't really matter just as the individual accounts don't. What matters is how we deal with it, because Wikipedia isn't here to make Israel or Jews look good or bad, and that was the discussion that I was trying to open up. I see the complaint against Isarig as possibly an example of the problem, given Abu Ali's inappropriate comment. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:50, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Excuse me, but it was <b>you</b> who brought up the false accusation of antisemitism. And I note that you have not apologised or retracted your accusation, on the grounds that you are not familiar with my edits. (look here <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Abu_ali_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Abu ali">Special:Contributions/Abu_ali</a>) Several edit wars with Isarig and his friends from <a href="../../../i/s/r/WP%7EIsrael_effa.html" title="WP:Israel">WP:Israel</a> concern their insistence on inserting libelous accusations of anti-semitism or association with anti-semites to discredit authors who are critical of Israeli government policy. Any accusation of antisemitic behaviour should be thoroughly investigated and dealth with. But accusations of antisemitism (or of any other form of racism) should not be thrown around in a light minded manner. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 10:11, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Agree with csloat, Abu Ali and Mackan79 on these last points. I'd add that if <i>"the lines between legitimate criticism of Israeli government policy and antisemitism are becoming ever more blurred,"</i> it is in large part because editors like Slim are tenaciously blurring them. Indeed the whole point of alluding to <i>"an increasingly hostile editing environment around articles to do with Jews, Judaism, and Israel</i>" is precisely to blur those lines. I have been involved in a lot of contentious pages related to Israeli-Palestinian issues, where Isarig and Slim have also been heavily involved, and with the exception of a couple of sideshows produced by cranks like Kiyosaki, I have never seen this <i>"concerted effort by a number of editors to blacken anything to do with Jews, Judaism, or Israel."</i> On the other hand, on any of these pages one can find a concerted effort to blacken anything to do with individuals - Jewish, Arab, or other - who are prominently critical of Israeli occupation policies. Isarig is involved in one such blackening effort right now at the very article that precipitated the present discussion (he's arguing that the article on Juan Cole should include an accusation that Cole's writings "resonate powerfully" with the central argument of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_1249.html" title="Protocols of the Elders of Zion">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>, but should exclude Cole's dismissal of the attack as "outrageous"). Slim has tended to either condone or actively participate in blackening efforts of this kind, often by "blurring" lines as she has done on this page, and creating an incredibly specious spectrum of guilt by association, beginning at one end with anyone who disagrees with her about the root causes of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and extending all the way out to the antisemitic fringe.--<a href="../../../g/-/d/User%7EG-Dett_8e52.html" title="User:G-Dett">G-Dett</a> 15:28, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the allegations of antisemitism are actually irrelevant and beside the point here. I am an anti-Zionist Jew, and I am being stalked and harassed over the pages of Wikipedia by a series of one-off accounts and sockpuppets who do not like my edits to articles on Israel-related subjects. Every day, I have to search to find which articles have been vandalised with derogatory comments about me. Today, it was <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilad_Atzmon_eb06.html" title="Gilad Atzmon">Gilad Atzmon</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Roberto_Rosselini_aad8.html" title="Roberto Rosselini">Roberto Rosselini</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pig.html" title="Pig">Pig</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camel.html" title="Camel">Camel</a>.

And there have been dozens more. The person responsible (and I'm definitely not pointing the finger at Isarig) is not making antisemitic attacks on me, but is certainly making a concerted effort to make me -- a forthright critic of Israel and Zionism -- look bad. So when SlimVirgin notes "an increasingly hostile editing environment around articles to do with Jews, Judaism, and Israel", she should recognise that it is not only supporters of Israel who face this hostility and abuse. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 00:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry you've had to put up with that. I've blocked the latest account that was attacking you, and you should feel free to let me know if it happens again. You're right that the hostile environment affects everyone. The problem is not only antisemitism. It's also that some editors feel that using Wikipedia to paint Israel black is a legitimate way to use the encyclopedia, and of course it isn't. We end up with toxic talk pages, terrible articles, and editors who feel victimized and bullied. It would be good if good-faith editors on all sides could try to come up with a solution together. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:26, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the second part of this entirely; I just wish people could acknowledge the extreme partisanship on all sides of these issues. In my view, there's simply an extreme shortage on the assumption of good faith. People immediately revert edits without making any attempt to follow the guidelines in <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7ERevert_be8e.html" title="WP:Revert">WP:Revert</a>. If they've seen something generally similar before, they simply assume its included for the same dumb reason. All in all, many seem to have stopped caring, if they ever did, about the spirit of editing on WP. I think this failure to be civil and assume good faith, much more than any latent bigotry of WP editors, is the source of hostility. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 03:07, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Abu Ali was simply performing a useful service in alerting me and others to this complaint. Isariq has been relentlessly belligerent and the displeasure of his fellow editors should be addressed. The fact that he has offended such a wide swath of the WP community is evidence of the disruption he has caused. There are many other editors who share Isarig's POV and sometimes his stubborn streak, but they don't create nearly the unpleasantness. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 01:23, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lee even if you got the "alert", showing up here to to put the boot in regarding Isarig's belligerence, is a bad look when one could arguably call you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Juan_Cole&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=88738376" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Juan_Cole&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=88738376" rel="nofollow">even less civil</a> at times and note your own hair-trigger rv button. Isarig has little patience for weak arguments and off-topic soapboxing on talk pages. If his opponents refuse to "stay down" and keep coming back with more of the same, usually peppered with personal attacks, instead of staying on point and forming <i>better</i> arguments, he won't let up and will keep knocking them down. The problem for them is that most of the time he's right. True, perhaps not the paragon of civility, but on the other hand, I've not seen him attempt to suppress anything contrary to his POV so long as it was reliably sourced and written according to policy. This can not be said of the editor who filed this ANI, and the "wide swath of the WP community" you refer to, are for the most part, composed of trolls like <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill314159_8d98.html" title="User:Will314159">User:Will314159</a> who you didn't see fit to comment on.

<dd>If I <i>approve</i> of anything, it's that from what I've seen, Isarig generally stays on point and makes <b>better arguments</b> than his opponents. The problem is that most people, when they lose an argument, especially when it's shown to be weak, turn their embarrassment into anger at whoever "beat" them. This in my view explains a lot of the hostility for Isarig here. I believe that, like <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelix-felix_6e81.html" title="User:Felix-felix">Felix-felix</a> below, "I don't think he ever gave worse than he got" and I've also seen cases of him giving a lot less. Should he be more civil -sure. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt;-armon-&gt;&gt;</a> 12:19, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well call me Isarig the Second, because I didn't see that as an example of being uncivil so much as firmly pointing out to Elizmr the absurdity of asking for "respect" for her suggestion that Cole was, as she put it, "internalizing" the themes of the protocols of Zion. I don't mind saying that anyone who proposes such an appalling and incendiary idea will lose my respect immediately. Regarding Will314159, I don't know anything about him and I don't know why you bring him up. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 15:55, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>She was making a <i>general</i> comment in response your protests (or sloats) that Cole objectively couldn't have "internalized the themes" because his is a prof. The inability to respect anybody who doesn't share one's POV is likely an insoluble problem for a lot of editors, but it's not something to be proud of.</dd>
<dd>As for Will314159, we edited the same pages with him for months and you didn't notice how out of line his behavior was? OK, but it amazes me. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt;-armon-&gt;&gt;</a> 12:19, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, that is incorrect. The only person who talked about "internalizing the themes" was Elizmr and her comment came completely from left field and out of context with the previous discussion. She wrote: "And to throw my 2 cents in, like it or not, it is a well known fact that (very unfortunately), the protocols are very prominent in the ME media. It is not suprising that ME historians and scholars would have internalized some of these themes." This after demanding that we respect her opinion. Respect is earned, it's not a God-given right. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 20:05, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Armon, calling most of the people who commented here "trolls" is uncivil at best. Your claim that Isarig has not tried to suppress anything contrary to his POV is incorrect; as you know, you and he are involved in mediation on that very issue on the Juan Cole page.

<p>I don't know where the podium <i>is</i> but well i can speak throughout the window. It's a pitty that the discussion has taken this way. In brief, i have to say that SlimVirgin's statements are not helpful and harm the community IMO. I read that and feel that there's much bias when you say there exist some antisemitic editors. I feel bad because the scope of the accusation is so large. Please give us names Slim. Abu Ali was clear on his accusation though i don't agree with the <i>brutal ways</i> of Isarig. That accusation was directed to one user who could of course reply or rebute that. Yes, true that Abu Ali started it but let's not forget that it was directed to someone who can easily respond to it and not to a group of <i>phantoms</i>. The problem w/ Slim's accusations is that nobody can reply. It is a kind of unsourced edits in wiki jargon. But i will do reply and say that whether there are an orchestra made of anti-semitic editors and their fans or not over here, remains irrelevant. I will ask about names indeed especially when Slim uses the term <i>obvious</i>.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that i've heard the same accusations re anti-arab and anti-islam editors for more than a dozen of months. Have we reached a solution to catch those anti-x (in case there are) wherever they are here in wikipedia? Unfortunately No! Why? Because established editors and concerned admins think the phenomenon got only one side and is only limited to the side admins think they are victims. That's wrong, anti-x editing is well-spread around wikipedia but i don't believe there's infamous orchestras. There are individuals who carry much POV and fight for that and don't risk banning as account recreation is made easy. So let's stop making vague accusations and be concrete to try to get rid of these problems. At least, let's try it.

<p>For the record, I've had recent and fairly brusque encounters with Isarig, who, as outlined above is an obsessive, ideological, and pretty rude edit warrior.(on the <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Kamm_8051.html" title="Oliver Kamm">Oliver Kamm</a> page) However, much like G Dett, I don't think he ever gave worse than he got, but I haven't experienced stalking by him, to my knowledge.<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelix-felix_6e81.html" title="User:Felix-felix">Felix-felix</a> 16:56, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I find this comment by Isarig to be offensive: "This 'useful service' [soliciting comments] has already been described by several editors here as harassment. And here you are applauding it. No more needs to be said about you or your contributions to this debate."</p>
<p>I was one of those editors solicited. I had not had any negative interactions with Isarig, and I so noted that here. I noted that I thought some disputes had been resolved at <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a>. Boy was I wrong. Today, there have been 2 mass reversions. One by an admin. I would appreciate if this utterly toxic atmosphere would end. If it keeps up I will be making an incident report here , and I will be soliciting comments from others who have had interactions with these 2 editors. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 02:48, 6 January 2007 (UTC)(-&gt;)</p>

<p>This particular dispute has always been tough to adjudicate. The main participants are well informed and highly articulate, yet some of their methods violate policy in ways I rarely see among editors who know how to spell. The mediation looks like it may indeed succeed at its own narrow aim. Yet the dispute is larger and spreading. I find it oddly appropriate that the <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Said_407a.html" title="Edward Said">Edward Said</a> biography has joined the affected pages: during his years at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> that English department had a reputation as <i>street brawling for Ph.D.s</i>.</p>
<p>In specific reply to csloat, my rebuke spoke to that dichotomy. The debate about libel and slander touched an area I studied in graduate school and your knowledge of that subject does appear to be professorial as does your articulate writing style. Topically these are high level discussions. That contrasts with forum-shopping, personalizing disputes, bad faith assumptions, incivility, edit warring, and deceptive complaints - behaviors more characteristic of a weak undergraduate. My criticism has nothing to do with how you conduct a classroom and everything to do with this website where expert contributors in the humanities are uncommon and too many of the weak undergraduates I normally referee are eager to assume the worst of any authority figure. If the opinion hurts your feelings I am sorry; I know of no milder way to express this earnest evaluation.</p>
<p>This does not, however, vindicate the other parties. Normally I would wait for mediation to work but this particular conflict has seeped onto too many pages and accumulated new disputants as it spreads. The main question I confront now is not whether but how to open an arbitration request: who and what are involved? <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 06:21, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the record I think both SlimVirgin's veiled insinuation and Abu Ali's outrageous rhetoric are damaging to this whole enterprise. For me, this issue boils down to the speed with which Isarig assumes bad faith, makes and then repeats baseless allegations. From my own experience: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Middle_East_Media_Research_Institute#Reynolds_BBC_article" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Middle_East_Media_Research_Institute#Reynolds_BBC_article" rel="nofollow">[83]</a> A secondary issue is the fact that the Wiki guidelines on reliable sources are frankly open to interpretation, for example, terms like "expert" are weasley worm-can openers and the massive "previously published work" loophole doesn't help the issue. Finally, I, for one, was not "rounded up" by anybody. Cheers! <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamousdog_bfbc.html" title="User:Famousdog">Famousdog</a> 15:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Isarig is one of a small group of editors (the others are Amoruso and Shamir1) who <i>endlessly</i> push a particular pov into mid-east-related articles. A large fraction of their edits are reverts, usually to reinstert the junk they have copied from worthless propagandistic sources. It would be a tough assignment to find any substantial improvement to any article due to their efforts over months. The proper place for this discussion is before the arb ctte. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 09:24, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Generally IP addresses should not be indef blocked, as they may be dynamic. To find out if any abuse is coming from this IP address, you will have ask a checkuser. Try crossposting this question to the <b>Requests for IP check</b> section of <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a>. They won't disclose the names of users on the IP, but should be able to determine if any current or recent users of that IP have been vandalism. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:33, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well that's the thing. It was indefinitely blocked by a checkuser. Dmcdevit blocked it on December 10 as a result of the checkuser. My concern is that now that I unblocked the IP because of the autoblock effects on The Showster, a user who is possibly innocent and just got caught up in the checkuser somehow, other accoutns can be used on this IP for further vandalism. That's why I'm posting this here, to see if the block should be reinstated as a more soft block, allowing The Showster to use it without allowing new vandals to be created. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 02:43, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, you should definitely ask Dmcdevit, then. Since he's on light duty for a couple more weeks, I would also ask Mackensen, who is pretty active. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 12:16, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
