<p>David sez: <i>This user has been blocked from editing Wikipedia for violating Wikipedia's policies, most notably WP:NOT: Wikipedia user pages, signatures, etc. should not be used for advocacy.</i> He then blocked <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERookiee_acb7.html" title="User:Rookiee">User:Rookiee</a> <i>indefinitely</i> and deleted, and then protected Rookiee's user- and talkpage. The "other policies" alluded to here were not mentioned anywhere, and the <i>indefinite</i> block apparently followed Rookiee readding of a link <i>once</i>. He was not warned following this.</p>
<p>David's allegation of "signature advocacy" apparently stems from the devious <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subliminal_message.html" title="Subliminal message">subliminal message</a> Rookiee uses in his signature, and, ironically, David also had a links his homepage on his userpage. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayW_e416.html" title="User:JayW">JayW</a> 18:40, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>?!? Not only does he have "the authority", it's part of every admin's job description to protect the project, which this clearly falls under.

<dd>..here's a scenerio. I'm an admin. I go TheLand's userpage and discover s/he enjoys the violin. And as it happens, a violin raped my father last week. So I burst in hir talk page and declare - without any community discussion - that, should "TheLand" not censor her page immediantly to suit my delicate sensibilities, I'll single-handedly block her - without even asking others or a "warning" block - <i>forever</i>. Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> of course, nothing to do with my personal prejudices... (I might even throw in a vague death threat, just for good measure.)</dd>
<dd>..and all this is despite the fact that hundreds of other people are also violating "NOT," yet they're still free to edit.</dd>
<dd>Within my rights? Y/N?</dd>
<dd>Of course, in the real world, violins are not blamed for everything imaginable, so this analogy <i>might</i> be just a little off.</dd>
<dd>"given that Fred Bauder is a member of ArbCom."</dd>
<dd>uh. It's unfortunate you don't know what the ArbCom is? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayW_e416.html" title="User:JayW">JayW</a> 20:25, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My suspicion is that the above is an attempt to entertain yourself. If you're genuinely confused, you can find more information at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee</a>. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 21:23, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"If you're genuinely confused, you can find more information at Wikipedia:Administrators and Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee." The point was that the ArbCom <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">doesn't have shit to do with anything</a> here and if you believe it does, you clearly don't know what it is. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayW_e416.html" title="User:JayW">JayW</a> 23:04, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They would be the place for an indefinitely blocked user to appeal the block. Again, you can find out more information about how dispute resolution works at the above link. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 23:09, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly: ergo, your point is ridiculous and Fred still doesn't have the right to bypass the wiki community. And you're yet to explained why a ban is more appropriate than a simple page protection. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayW_e416.html" title="User:JayW">JayW</a> 23:28, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I used to think that Wikipedia's 'neutral point of view' policy suggested a sort of 'free speech' approach which allowed all viewpoints, however unpopular, to be expressed. The 'userbox wars' suggested that this was not the case where the existence of 'potentially inflammatory' userboxes in the template namespace might be taken to suggest Wikimedia backing of such... as opposed to the appearance of similar sentiments directly on the userpage where it was then ascribed only to the user. <i>This</i> incident now seems to suggest that even things which are clearly only the user's individual views are to be suppressed if they are heavily disliked. If we are going to have this as a practice we should do so formally to avoid understandable confusion as to why 'pro abortion' statements (equally hated by some) are allowed but 'pro pedophilia' statements are not. Both are completely legal in the United States, where the servers are hosted, so this is presumably not a 'legal concern', but an 'image concern'... we don't want Wikipedia to be in any way associated with ideas offensive to the vast majority of our users. Does Nazism make the cut? Homosexuality? Does it vary by language (homosexuality being <i>much</i> more unpopular in some cultures than others)? The last time this came up some people <i>were</i> suggesting that homosexuals should be similarly censored... and you take this concept to the Arabic Wikipedia and I think it very likely that will be the case. Should expressions of support for 'Falun Gong' be barred on the Chinese language Wikipedia? Are 'pro pedophilia' individuals allowed to be users if they don't state their views or attempt to bias articles, or should they be banned entirely whenever identified (even by off-wiki blogs and the like) as some have suggested? We should spell it out. If Wikipedia is going to have a censorship practice we should have a censorship policy. Otherwise this will inevitably look (to those impacted and strong supporters of free speech) like individual admins enforcing their own biases. This is <i>clearly</i> censorship and thus I think we need to have some sort of guidelines from Wikimedia on what should be censored and to what extent. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:38, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To me this seems like hiding behind a fiction rather than being up front about the realities of the situation. 'We are removing non-encyclopedic userpage material' may sound nicer than 'we are censoring pro-pedophilia views on userpages', but it isn't accurate. It paints a false picture of how Wikipedia works and opens the door for further confusion and conflict on this issue down the road. If this is going to be Wikipedia practice then we should have the courage of our convictions and <i>say so</i> rather than hiding behind a pretext which only gets used in specific instances. We don't blank user pages and indefinitely block people for saying they support gay rights, various political positions, and a hundred other sorts of advocacy... and thus it is absolutely clear that this isn't about removing non-encyclopedic advocacy in general (which I agree would be preferable to doing so selectively), but rather about censoring a particular topic. If we don't have the integrity to say so openly then you can't very well blame people for not knowing or not believing individual users on this issue. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:08, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

If this <i>IS</i> activity against proselytising in general then by all means let's say so and treat everyone the same way (right down to the indefinite block if need be)... but if it is activity against pedophilia in particular (as seems to me the case based on statements of the involved parties) then we should say <i>that</i> too and make it official that we censor users on that topic.

<dd>You're right, I misspoke slightly. From the NAMBLA article you referenced: "The American Civil Liberties Union stepped in to defend NAMBLA as a free speech matter and won a dismissal based on the fact that NAMBLA is organized as an unincorporated association, not a corporation. John Reinstein, the director of the ACLU Massachusetts, said that although NAMBLA 'may extol conduct which is currently illegal', there was nothing on its website that 'advocated or incited the commission of any illegal acts, including murder or rape'." That implies that advocating or inciting the commission of illegal acts would have been grounds for continuation.

<dd>If, as you appear to be arguing, this <b>is</b> supposed to be a 'legal issue' rather than an 'image issue' then it (obviously) ought to be handled by the foundation's lawyer rather than individual users who have no legal background and/or are not legal representatives of Wikimedia. However, I don't believe that to be the case because there is really no legal issue here. Your claim that he "advocated and incited the commission of illegal acts" just does not appear to be true. There were no statements encouraging anyone to engage in any illegal activity. Rather there were statements of his beliefs that it should not be considered illegal / immoral... which are protected speech. The distinction may be difficult to see, but it is very real in terms of the legality of speech.

I am sure there are many legalize marijuana users on wikipedia as well. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 16:11, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I finally figured it out. Look, before we start anything else, I'm not a troll or a sock. I do honestly love the admins that are here and I want to show gratitude towards them by showing how incredibly awesome they are. I thought about it real hard the last few days, but I think Alphachimp, Crzrussian, Yanksox, and Tyrenius are like the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deadly_Viper_Assassination_Squad_b21b.html" title="Deadly Viper Assassination Squad">Deadly Viper Assassination Squad</a>. They will kick yo ass and you won't know what happened. Of course, this leaves the opening for Bill.

<p>I believe <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">User:Abu badali</a> is unfairly harrassing me!

<dd>This is a continuation from an early incident in which Ivan asked for administrative assistance. Some people do not agree with Abu's tagging, while it seems it does follow policy. I would have hoped after the issue comnig to AN/I that Abu would have ceased interacting with Ivan as it was clear Ivan felt it was malicious, however during the AN/I discussion it seems Abu went ahead and kept filing for Ivan's image uploads to be deleted. It seems to be at the very least a bad judgement call and did no good in helping to difuse the situation or ease a fellow editors worries. If Abu is randomly going through the list of images that needs tagging and finding Ivan's I guess that is fine, however if he went through Ivan's contribs to find image uploads then that may be a different issue. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 16:50, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We got thousands of image upload each day. Many of these are copyright infringements. There is a small number of people who understand the copyright laws, wikipedia copyright policy, the tools we have to facilitate the dealings with the images. Some of them devoted most of their effort to the unthankful job of sorting the images. Sometimes they are named the image police. Sometimes they are rude, but we can not live without them. Please do not make their life more difficult by harassing them, just provide the necessary info and try to be nice and maybe they will be nice in return. Unfortunately the demand for Abu Badali to leave you along is similar to the demand to traffic policeman to leave you alone.

<p>More information: This user is persistently creating articles that are copyvios. He has four {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENothanks-sd_0210.html" title="Template:Nothanks-sd">nothanks-sd</a>}} warnings, two {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENothanks_4240.html" title="Template:Nothanks">nothanks</a>}} warnings, and one warning from me asking him to stop copying and pasting content. Since that warning from me, he has created one more copyvio article. He's also doing something extremely strange: he's copying existing Wikipedia articles (e.g., <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hub_Power_Company_0d4b.html" title="Hub Power Company">Hub Power Company</a>) and creating new articles with the word "Limited" appended to it (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hub_Power_Company_Limited&amp;oldid=77910883" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hub_Power_Company_Limited&amp;oldid=77910883" rel="nofollow">Hub Power Company Limited</a>) even if that's not the name of the company. I can't remember, but I don't think that Wikipedia policy uses "Limited" or "Inc" in the titles of articles, but even still, he should be creating redirects. (I mean, he clearly knows those articles exists, since he copied them, formatting and all.) Nearly all of his edits are copying and pasting material (either copyrighted or from other WP articles). Since repeated warnings have not worked, perhaps a 24 hour ban? -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope">Merope</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerope_f738.html" title="User talk:Merope"><font color="#003366">Talk</font></a></sup></small> 19:40, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This kind of worries me and I think a policy needs to be made regarding gathering of information. As a previous debate raged here earlier I think you have to tag the page as the start of an RfC or something to the liking. I think users shouldnt keep "attack" pages but I think we need to draw a clear line eventually as to what constitutes one. Considering the information is sourced with dif's I dont think its really an attack page. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 16:55, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are legitimate concerns on both sides of the issue... on the one hand suppression of dissent and on the other possible aggravation caused by being included on such a list. As such, I'd suggest we encourage people to keep such lists privately 'off wiki' for future reference and express dissent in written form rather than as a list of disputed actions. Some sort of consistent response to these would be a good idea though since it comes up fairly often. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 19:07, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The "aggravation" stems from the admins actions. Nobody is included there id he did not violate policies. If someone has killed someone, well you can decide to mark him on the forehead as former killer or not. You can also go and say, we keep it only in an archive, and don't mark the forehead. What I see here is a perpatuation of a two class WP society. The admins can leave there markers on other peoples forehead, whether valid or not.

<dd>I do not think this is complaining about a MfD but about the proccess being undertaken to eliminate information from Wikipedia that normally would not be removed. People have half completed RfC's all over Wikipedia and I doubt any admins are specifically hunting them down. However since an admin who is on the list found this it got sent to MfD. I believe this came up earlier and was stated that pages like this needed to be tagged as RfC's in proccess or something similar. As for disruption I don't really see how its disrupting anythnig if someone would have never taken it to MfD in the first place and left it alone. Perhaps if he moves it and removes the wiki-linking of names that will help, then noone will stumble on it? --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 19:45, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user has copied the entire contents of the abuse page, word for word onto the MFD. I replaced it with a link (note it is already linked at the top) and he reverted. It is a complete duplication of the abuse page and a link would be better to include as there is no point posting the same information over and over again. I won't revert again since I'm obviously one of the abusive admins, but for the sake of clarity and readability and just plain common sense, can someone please remove the duplicate material and replace it with a link? <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 19:53, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>the fact that I copied it to the MfD, is that the orig may be altered. I have an updated version on my user page now. So I really would like to know which of the facts are wrong on the original page. That's why I copied it. Annotations can also be made better if the stuff is copied. Please go and say what is not violation of policies. Golbez who brought this to MfD right now, has done so only after he abused again. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 20:03, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Seriously, it isn't admin abuse to want a readable page without the same exact information as the page proposed for deletion pasted in there again. I'm writing this now because I fully expect someone to come along and tell me that removing duplicate information and repleacing it with a link to the exact same information is harassment. Which it isn't. The whole point here isn't whether it is true or not. No one is going to go through and annotate anything. This issue is whether its appropriate to be sitting around in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:10, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A user/editor believes they are being targetted by admins who are attempting to hide information ... this situation is indeed not helpful at all.

<p>Putting an entire page that is up for MfD ON the MfD is just NOT our practice. Tobias has inserted it three times already, and it has been removed by three different discussion participants.

<dd>Are they all admins, are they all people voting delete? I mean if they are you would see why according to this discussion he all see's them as one. If people who are on this list are removing it then ... well it kinda goes toward his point, not that I agree. I just think he should keep the page without the wiki-linking so noone can claim they stumbled on it or its distracting anyone, and he should tag it as a future RfC. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 20:46, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not going to argue this point with you, but the information has already been immortalized in the MfD log now, so whatever was attempting to be accomplished is now really moot. The discussion here is about admins deleting pages that contain misdeeds. As for Secret Admin Cabals, if you do not believe any admin would work with another admin for a negative purpose then you probably do not believe in meat puppets either or two users working to circumvent 3RR. Same principle, not every admin has to be stewing over a bubbling cauldron plotting world domination for their to be an issue. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 20:56, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is our friend in North Carolina. He just dropped a note on my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAntandrus&amp;diff=77838321&amp;oldid=77825683" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAntandrus&amp;diff=77838321&amp;oldid=77825683" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> asking me to help. I think he is genuinely "trying" to give up the vandalism habit, but doesn't quite get it, i.e. is not taking full responsibility for his actions, and is failing to recognize the harm he's done. Since I'm disinclined to be his babysitter at the moment I'm ignoring him for the time being, but do as you please. By the way there are probably at least a hundred "sleeper" socks of his around such as the one you found, and the one that moved his own MFD page just now. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 03:27, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have received a complaint from Josh Humphries that the deleted page "Josh humphries is clearly GAY" has apeared among the top Google results for his name. I don't think anything can be done about it now, but for the next time: when you protect a page with an offensive/attack title against re-creation by vandals, be careful to delete it after a few days before the search engines and/or Wikipedia forks catch it. - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 08:15, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a broader issue, maybe we need a "temporarilly protected" template in addition to the longer-term {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeleted_2eb9.html" title="Template:Deleted">deleted</a>}}. The short term one could be deleted after 48 hours or so... just used to stop a vandal on a creation spree (which as I recall does happen quite a bit).

<dd>Could be just a user experimenting with Wikipedia; this sort of thing happens all the time.

<dd>It should be noted that the inappropriate comment left in this case (calling <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Moyles_d980.html" title="Chris Moyles">Chris Moyles</a> an obscenity) probably is not a legal issue (you can't sue someone for libel just because they call you naughty words); plus, old article versions aren't indexed/followed by search engines (at least those which pay attention to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robots.txt.html" title="Robots.txt">robots.txt</a>).</dd>

<dd>Whenever I've seen it, I've assumed it's someone seeing if wiki really works, and, when they find out it does, deciding they don't want their comment their after all.

<dd>Another plausible theory (I don't know if it applies in this case) is that the edits are being made by two different users behind one router, such as in the case of a school's computer lab.

<dd>Based on the IPInfo and Traceroute tools on the IP talk pages, it looks like Maggie's using Korean proxies. Maggie's obsession with disrupting Wikipedia is getting a little frightening.

<dd>Are you saying that I can use a resolution process to resolve my disputes? How am I supposed to do this without using proxies if you keep blocking my ip address? Also, Geogre, it would be nice if you didn't make personal attacks against me by saying things like "is not attributable to her genius". Okay. I'm asking for a mediation or an arbitration to resolve why I was indefinetley banned the first time for making a personal attack against RyanFreisling. If I had been (rightfully) blocked for a week or even a month, I would have learned my lesson, and I never would have made all these socks. The <i>indef</i> ban was wrong and I am asking for a resolution. <i>Maggie</i>

<dd>I don't know anything about why you were blocked originally, but your account Lingeron was headed for an indef block on it's own, aside from the fact that it was a sock.

<p>I issued the original indefinite ban in May of this year and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive97#User:Thewolfstar_and_the_community.27s_patience" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive97#User:Thewolfstar_and_the_community.27s_patience" rel="nofollow">here</a> is the original ANI discussion of my proposal to do so. Maggie's the most abusive and unreasonable user I've ever encountered, for my part. She wasn't in any "disputes". Not unless you count it as a dispute that she would like to turn the encyclopedia into a political soapbox, and the community wouldn't let her. Each of her socks has been disruptive in and of itself; that, taken together with her rather narrow subject-matter, is how we recognize them. Here's an <a href="http://earthhopenetwork.net/Banned_Indefinitely_Censorship_on_Wikipedia.htm" class="external text" title="http://earthhopenetwork.net/Banned_Indefinitely_Censorship_on_Wikipedia.htm" rel="nofollow">attack on Wikipedia</a> posted on her site. Maggie, that you have a hatred of Wikipedia doesn't constitute a <i>dispute</i>, you know. How exactly do you see it being mediated? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 20:30, 26 September 2006 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>That malicious attack was ungrounded and unsourced, Bishonen, and doesn't speak well for you. I have a dispute, and that is that your indef ban on me was unwarrented. And since when do disputes get resolved on ANI? As for the accusation of how "abusive" I am, I find you the most abusive admin that I have ever encountered. The article I wrote was a direct result of repeated admin abuse to me, personally, and to others, and I delayed posting it on my site for a couple of months -- until it was obvious that nothing was going to change. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive97#User:Thewolfstar_and_the_community.27s_patience" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive97#User:Thewolfstar_and_the_community.27s_patience" rel="nofollow">ANI smearfest</a> speaks for itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was never given the same opportunity through dispute resolution that any other user gets -- no rfc, no mediation, no arcom. Similarly, when I was banned, my page was protected so that I wasn't even allowed to defend myself there. And although I am ready to admit my part and my wrongs, I am also ready to dispute the indef ban, as opposed to a temp ban, and to show how it was done wrongly, out of process, and not a <b>community</b> ban at all.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Another important point, Bishonen, is that you told me that you were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dot_Bitch&amp;oldid=54695484" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dot_Bitch&amp;oldid=54695484" rel="nofollow">giving me another chance to edit, under another username, and promised me that you, yourself, wouldn't block me</a>.

Because of WP:BLP these sorts of unsourced claims must be removed. But the constant petty vandalism makes it hardeer to stay on top of.

<li><b>Quibble</b>: Let's suppose that this was a computer class having "fun." If so, the block should be for three months, not six, as semesters end and kids get shuffled. My feeling is that they'll hit the block, get dissuaded, and won't try again. Therefore, a 6 month block is definite overkill, and 3 months is possible overkill. Of course, folks can continue to <i>use</i> Wikipedia while blocked, but not edit it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:07, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Tobias did go over the line by insulting the "processing power" of your brain, but is this enough to warrant banning him? You did provoke him by accussing him of knowing "nothing about Indonesia." Please be kind to each other and nicely form a consensus on the naming of these articles. You might try explaining why you like your preferred title for the article and then politely asking him what he thinks is better about his preferred article title.

<dd>I suggest you take a look at the history of this guy. He has a history of this stuff and has been blocked many times before. There are alot of people in the Indonesia wikipedia community who are tired of him moving pages around (using just he move button) and we have asked him to stop. He is continuing on his merry way, and the only thing we can do to get the pages moved back is for every single page to go though the long and painful "request move" process. We're becoming tired of his antics and he needs to be stopped. (<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelJLowe_6191.html" title="User:MichaelJLowe">MichaelJLowe</a> 06:18, 27 September 2006 (UTC))

<dd>Yes, i think that is the main concern really, rather than a block. Although i am also sympathetic to Michael's frustration that resulted in a perceived "provocation". He's been adding value to numerous Indonesian articles almost daily and knows his stuff.

<p>OK, so we have now had five people comment on the alleged bickering. But, what about Tobias' insistence on moving articles around unilaterally without waiting for consensus or procedure? This is the real issue. He has been busy at it since we first mentioned here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Tobias+Conradi" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Tobias+Conradi" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> He has specifically said he will do what he wants in this regard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tobias_Conradi#Article_moves_and_disambiguations" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tobias_Conradi#Article_moves_and_disambiguations" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 12:50, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Can a neutral admin look into this please? If Tobias is moving pages without consensus, this behaviour needs to stop, so do the fair thing and warn both parties that their behaviour is unacceptable, rather than ignoring it. I can't do this since I'm a previously listed abusive admin by Tobias, but bickering or not, if people are behaving badly and disrupting pages, they *ALL* need to told to cut it out, not just MichaelJLowe. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 13:47, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>CBD is trying to defuse the entire situation. If I remember right, CBD was the admin who protested the treatment of Tobias the last time there was a blow-up, and asked to be given a chance to handle the situation more gently next time. Well, it's now "next time", and he's giving it a try. IMHO he should be given a chance. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 16:11, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>CBD counts as person looking into the situation. I just want to make sure someone is, and so far, there is no note here that someone is. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:07, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you people. I don't have anything against Tobias but I would like to see a more collaborative approach (although Michael was (justifiably?) annoyed yesterday, he is a reasonable person from my experience and is likely to share my sentiments on reflection). I will also be extra careful do what i can to avoid or diffuse any more "spats". I know people have better things than to be referees, but i think working together on important changes it is important - particularly given the high volume of articles affected. Thanks again. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 22:11, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As stated before Abe, many of your edits were childish vandalism, pure and simple. Secondly, I am well aware with what a content revert is and go through great lengths to avoid them at all costs. Lastly, there is an RfC, so I think we should allow the community to decide this one. If you will swear off editing this article until a consensus has been reached, so too will I , and it can be unprotected so others can continue to work on it. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Torturous Devastating Cudgel</a> 20:03, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As stated above Abe, comparing the work of a well know historian to the fictional movie <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dawn_afbf.html" title="Red Dawn">Red Dawn</a> and then fighting like hell to keep this joke in the article, is vandalism, plain and simple, and removal of it is not a content revert. Condensing lengthy quotes and adding sources is also not a content revert. I would also add, then I even went so far as to self revert yesterday when questioning my own actions just to remove any perceived impropriety on my part. Any admin reading this would do well to take Abe’s vandalism and the talk page of the article in question into account before acting on this.

<dd>I think both of these users need to cool off and realize reverting shouldnt be used as a blanket swipe. Antaeus Feldspar has reverted cited information from articles Blainetologist has edited, yet alot of what Blainetologist added to the Scientology article in particular is personal opinion and should have been removed. So I think both are at fault, Blainetologist needs to read up on WP:OR and Antaeus Feldspar should be careful of removing cited content. I hope since blind reversions are the issue you have issued blocks to both, as for Wikipediatrix I did not see any edit warring with you or the other user, I think that issue isr elegated to the warnings. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 20:57, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fred, can you possibly be speaking to Geogre, who has been an admin for several years and is a massive contributor of top quality content? He writes an article a day and has created some of our best Featured articles. If I were one tenth as productive as Geogre is, I'd be proud. If <i>you</i> were a hundredth part as productive as Geogre is, you'd be... not sure how to finish that sentence, except you'd be better placed for criticizing him than you are.

<dd>No, although I was not aware of his editing. All I know is my own story, which is that if I start doing a lot of editing (or anything else) I soon fall behind on arbitration work.

<dd>Take a look at the discussion there, Fred. You could offer valuable evidence. It's true that outside work can eat up all one's time, and each of us has to make choices, but I feel a bit irresponsible if I go too long editing and don't do the mopping up that I do have time for (mainly CSD, in my case, as it rarely entails long arguments, but sometimes DRV and less often AfD), and I can assure you that, if I were to be in a more involving duty, I'd feel creepy if I went too long without doing <i>some</i> editing. I, personally, find that disrespect is the real subtext here, and that disrespect comes from either ill will or ignorance. We can't stop the one, but we must stop the other. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:06, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Doesn't that tell you that you ought to <b>investigate?</b> Wouldn't that be particularly true if you were having to assess the validity of the comments? I won't comment on the logical weakness of insisting that 30 hr a week spent any way is the same as 30 hr a week spent a productive way. If you don't know the players, you could at least take a look at the program. Also, if someone were to be arbitrated for "tagging for CSD ianppropriately," wouldn't you want to know that that's "candidates for speedy deletion?" <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:18, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fred, I want to say this with all due respect to your 30 yours of volunteer work reviewing and adjudicating the "worst and most intractable" disputes. It's a nasty job but somebody has to do it. I understand the argument that admin hours and editing hours are mutually exclusive. Some admins do little editing and some editors have no desire to do admin work. Some people do both and there is a continuing debate whether admins should also be good editors and do substantial editing work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But, here's what boggles my mind, how can you be an arbitrator and not know what <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> are? These are fundamental concepts of the deletion process which is a core Wikipedia process. Perhaps the acronyms didn't ring a bell so you didn't remember. Or, perhaps you feel that because you are an arbitrator, you need to stay out of <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AFD</a> and DRV discussions to maintain objectivity?</dd>

<dd>My lack of awareness is very simply explained. If I spend hours poring over the edits involved in arbitration cases the users I become familiar with are the users involved in those cases. I don't learn about the users who are busily editing and administering without being involved in the disputed matters that become arbitration cases. If I don't spend my time on the arbitration cases, I don't do a very good job, there is a big backlog and a feeling arises that the only way to solve a dispute is by main force. There is a very good reason I never heard of Geogre. He hasn't been making a lot of trouble, up to now anyway. I do edit some anyway and certainly don't hang out or IRC. I really don't think I'm a very good example of the problem Where I fall down is not doing anywhere near a normal share of administrative duties, or checkuser.

<dd>Heh... maybe what we need is some sort of 'job rotation' program.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As had been stated here up above, I'm just not sure that's a good idea. As admins, we really are completely in control of what we want to do. It's a given fact that as you get more and more into admin stuff, you literally have less time to do anything else. My story is that I got too involved in admin stuff...it was effecting my personal life...so I backed off and started doing more "real" editing. But you know what? That's my choice. People like Fred have jobs on here that are much more complex than mine. He made a choice at some point that he wanted to do stuff like the arbcom. That's fine and that's his choice.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One of the main problems I have with this "rotation" idea (and the idea that admins should be stripped of their powers a couple of months a year) is that admins are here for a reason. As Fred said, if he gets too involved in editing, then he falls behind in arbcom stuff and people complain and then he's really doing a disservice to the encyclopedia. Let's say we do this rotation idea or the idea that admins lose their power every 2 months. That would mean that about 1/6th of the admins (if not more) would be unavailable for a long period of time. Does anyone patrol any of our "backwater" admin pages? Can you imagine if we lost that many admins at once? I'm talking about <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERfPP_5542.html" title="WP:RfPP">requests for page protection</a>, <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">requested moves</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">personal intervention noticeboard</a> and the like. It'd be chaos. We already have one hell of a time keeping up on those pages. I don't want to think of how bad it'd get with more admins.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And the other major problem with these ideas is that forcing admins into roles like it is being proposed is going to be unworkable. It's almost impossible to "police" anything like that on here. Admins will find a way around it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So do I have an answer? No.&#160;:) I do agree that more admins need to edit. I just don't think that these are the answers. And btw, before anyone asks me, about 80% of my edits are non admin related. But again, that's my choice. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 08:44, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Woohookitty. Actually I wasn't really thinking of a 'forced' sort of thing and creating gaps in admin coverage and all that. More like admins voluntarily being moved around to cover each other's tasks for a short while... if 'Admin X' handles alot of speedy deletion requests and 'Admin Y' is currently creating stubs for every species of bat in existence (which I keep meaning to get back to) and they both 'signed up' to do rotations they might end up taking over for each other for a couple of weeks. Obviously it would have to be something the person <i>can</i> do (which would limit non-admin users to certain tasks) and in all probability they wouldn't be as good at it as the person who does so regularly, but while a bit odd it <i>could</i> serve as a way of breaking down barriers and getting people familiar with things they might never have looked into otherwise. They might even find they like some of them. Obviously 'ArbCom duties' wouldn't fit into this, but maybe someone could be assigned to do clerk work for a week or two while the arbitor was doing cleanup on <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP%7EWP_9509.html" title="WP:WP">WP:WP</a> and thereby finding out what CSD, BLP, DRV, RfPP, PAIN, and the rest of the 'alphabet soup' were all about.&#160;:] --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 14:14, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dunno. With all the grief we've had over admins who use their administrative powers in content disputes, maybe no one should both edit and adminstrate.

<dd>As long as I can remember, Admins are at the least <b>strongly discouraged</b> from using their Admin powers in a conflict over an article. I think it has been proposed formally at least once as a guideline or rule, but it has never gained any serious support. And it doesn't take much thought to see that when an Admin protects the version she/he favors during an edit war, it merely wins a battle at the risk of losing the war. However, it might be interesting to see what happens if an Admin protects the version she/he <i>doesn't</i> favor. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:32, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sadly, I'm not sure you see things as they really are. I'm hardly and expert on Vitalism (and hence don't edit the article itself), but I do note that KV's rewording of cited information tends to distort, change, alter, misrepresent (you pick a word) the information, and that he does in fact have a specific POV that he tendentiously pushes. I would suggest that you look at the corpus of his work, including the <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">Pseudoscience</a> article (especially his dogged determination to insert chiropractic anywhere and everywhere (yet another subject I have no real opinion about) before wading into the fray. I doubt that some of the other editors there (i.e., not those currently involved in vitalism) can be accused of having a POV.</dd>
<dd>The alternative of course, is that all of us who have found KV's edits to be tendentious and POV are wrong. Is it possible? I suppose. Is it likely? No.</dd>
<dd>Finally, if you're going to put Vitalism on your watchlist (which would be a wise decision), I'd suggest that you do so with an eye toward mediation.

<dd>Its pretty simple really. Chiropractors don't want the majority view shown on the pseudoscience article (chiropractic theory is pseudoscientific). They made a big deal about it and called me a pathalogical liar on the PS page. When I suggested RfC they backed off. I calmed things down by not presenting the majority view on chiropractic theory on the PS article. I went to the vitalism article to put it straight. Gleng turned up and added defensive OR about chiropractors no longer believing in pseudoscientific vitalistic ideas. I added nothing about chiropractic, just corrected his OR. Gleng (with the abusive support of other chiropractic supporters) added lots of testimonial-like and OR stuff about vitalims coming back into fashion. I have been trying to put it all into majority-minority-fringe proportion. Any help from impartial outsiders is welcome. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrishnaVindaloo_27e9.html" title="User:KrishnaVindaloo">KrishnaVindaloo</a> 11:16, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The heat about chiropractic arose from KVs insistence in declaring that chiropractic was pseudoscientific because it was used to cure homosexuality. That was met with utter bemusement, expressed buy one chiro as "Why would anybody want to cure homosexuality" and was just a bridge of denigration too far. The storm was only broken when an editor actually wrote to the author of the cited article to find out what he actually said, and printed the author's bemused (outraged) response. KV then declared he really meant to cite another paper, which turns out to be in a Society newsletter written by a private sex counsellor (though nobody actually seems to have seen the original either except KV as the issue is missing from the Society archive).</p>
<p>KV also tried to make the argument (on pseudoscience) that chiropractic involved a vitalist principle, vitalism was pseudoscience, therefore chiro was pseudoscience. It doidn't wash for many reasons, one of which was that the vitalism neither mentioned chiro nor did it declare that vitalism was pseudoscience, and no V RS could be found.</p>
<p>KV tried then to export his views on chiropractic and pseudoscience to the vitalism page. Here I got involved, because reading the vitalism article I recognised that it had virtually no sources and fom what I knew was almost entirely wrong (regardless of chiro/PS). My edits there were interpreted by KV as POV pushing. His I didn't interpret as anything very much because it turned into repeated efforts to a) track down his references b) read them c) display on the Talk page that they didn;'t say what KV had claimed they said (in some cases they said the opposite).</p>
<p>What is not funny is the way that throughout, KV has attacked the motives of every editor who disagrees with his edits, labelling them (not their edits, them personally) as biased, motivated by POV, not legitimate, in a conspiracy, pseudoscientific..... this is not funny, and I will not stay on WP if WP cannot stop this type of personal attack on editors integrity.</p>
<p>KV will certainly and rightly note that I have attacked dishonest editing, and expressed outrage in particular at the issue related to his miscitation of Ford; I found it, simply, saddening.<a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGleng_c015.html" title="User:Gleng">Gleng</a> 16:00, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gleng. I have made no personal attacks on anyone on any article. I have been on the receiving end of personal attacks (pathalogical liar<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APseudoscience&amp;diff=74313124&amp;oldid=74310371" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APseudoscience&amp;diff=74313124&amp;oldid=74310371" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>) incivility<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pseudoscience&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73930737" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pseudoscience&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73930737" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>, racist slur (mahatma)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AVitalism&amp;diff=77795490&amp;oldid=77791779" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AVitalism&amp;diff=77795490&amp;oldid=77791779" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>, and other such censorship motivated attacks. Chiropractic is used to treat homosexuality. I have presented reliable peer reviewed articles that show this very clearly. I did confuse the authors and corrected myself. Then, despite my clear explanations, you and other chiropractic pushers repeatedly called me a liar. In order to appease the more convicted chiropractors, I did not place the supported fact in the PS article. I apologised for confusing the authors, Ford and Christianson. No apology was forthcoming from those chiropractic supporters who attacked me with accusations of "pathalogical liar". None! I calmed things down further by applying for a wikiquet alert and outside comment. I then went to the vitalism article to remove OR about PS notions of vitalism being scientific. You then followed me there and started placing OR about chiropractic<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vitalism&amp;diff=76571847&amp;oldid=76571002" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vitalism&amp;diff=76571847&amp;oldid=76571002" rel="nofollow">[60]</a> (I never added anything about chiropractic there at all). When I corrected your OR (about chiros not believing in vitalistic innate any more) I got more abuse from you and the other chiropractic supporters. Your edits have been weighted extremely in favour of your promotion towards chiropractic. Your promotion of fringe has been extreme. Literature supported corrections on your OR have induced you towards abuse. You have encouraged it from other followers.

<dd>Evidence: Here is the reference that shows that I am telling the truth. It states clearly that chiropractic is used for reparative therapy (treating homosexuality). A Re-emergence of Reparative Therapy. By: Christianson, Alice. Contemporary Sexuality, Oct2005, Vol. 39 Issue 10, p8-17, 10p; (AN 18639497). That is a pseudoscientific application of chiropractic, which has only minor sci support for the treatment of some back conditions. No messing around with google searches. Academic premier database has Contemporary Sexuality listed as a peer reviewed journal publication, and the sub-title reads "a peer reviewed publication for contemporary sexuality readers". It mentions Ford, (The Pseudoscience of Reparative Therapy). It fits NPOV policy on reliability and verifiability. However, in verifying the fact that my edits were truthful, Gleng will also be also be verifying that chiropractic is used to treat homosexuality. So Gleng's accusations of dishonesty continue. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrishnaVindaloo_27e9.html" title="User:KrishnaVindaloo">KrishnaVindaloo</a> 04:55, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>I apologize. I listed this on the wrong board</i> As a member of the Good Articles project, I left a notice on several current articles of a change in the good article criteria regarding the mandatory use of in-line citations and enhance attention to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. A copy of what this notice is can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Good_articles#GA_Re-Review_and_In-line_citations" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Good_articles#GA_Re-Review_and_In-line_citations" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Being the Good Article project, we obviously want articles to stay as GA and as such the notice was meant to make the editors aware of this change and possible improve the article prior to a reviewer coming and de-listing it. The User ScienceApologist has responded to this notice in a rather uncivil way, including adding a warning to my <a href="../../../a/g/n/User_talk%7EAgne27_a02f.html" title="User talk:Agne27">talk page</a> about "hurting wikipedia". My first suspicion was that he simply misinterpreted the notice of a <i>pending review</i> as a review in itself and I sought to clarify that it wasn't. I even requested that he voluntarily remove the "warning" he placed on my page, however at this moment he hasn't. At this point, I am choosing to walk away from dealing with this user rather then contribute to the fair and possible become uncivil myself. I would, however, like an admin to consider this matter and remove the warning from my talk page and possibly give ScienceApologist a warning for being uncivil. His actions are rather counterproductive in building a quality encyclopedia.

<dd>What's happened is that the Good Article criteria has changed recently, so users like Agne have been going around warning articles which don't comply with the new criteria, namely that in addition to being well-referenced, an article must have inline citations. So for instance, if you had an article which listed 25 books at the bottom and had no inline citations, its good article status would be forfeit, how is anybody supposed to know the article actually used those books as references or just pasted them on to make it look more authoritative? But anyway, Agne seems to of been warning a few articles which SA patrols, and SA seems to think Agne is just randomly complaining about articles or something, and it turned into an argument. <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 18:36, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Putting an uncivil (and frankly unfounded) warning on a users page <i>is personal</i>. As I explained to him, my role was a messenger in giving a notice of recent changes and a pending review. His accusations of being "vague" seemed to insinuate that he was interpreting the notice as being a review. Despite my attempts at clarifying this, he continues to accuse me of doing damage to the Wikipedia project with imprecise criticisms. The notice above linked to what the Good Article criteria was, where the change in criteria was discussed and more importantly pointed to expectations of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> that the article will be held to for GA consideration. That was not vague and because I did not go through each and every article to give a full review <i>prior to giving notice</i> of an upcoming full review, does not mean I deserve such uncivil treatment from another editor. I took good faith that it was just a misunderstanding at first on his part but unfortunately, while grateful that he took down the warning, he is being persistant in my "damaging vagueness". <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 18:44, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

While some of us are happy to improve the article, one week is a ridiculously short time to meet the changed guidelines. We have taken months just to get the first paragraph right, and the subject is deep and wide ranging, involving many editors. Our aim is to reach FA status, but a year is a more realistic timetable. So perhaps the message to take back to the GA people is that giving more notice would be more productive. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 19:05, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>But Agne has been tagging articles that have inline citations!

<dd>Your first example only has 2 inline citations in the entire body. That is kind of lacking, perhaps in that case its meant to encourage more inline citations.

<dd>2 inline citations is more than zero and the criterion doesn't state anything about a minimum number. Nevertheless it was stated as unequivocal fact in the post that the article would be delisted according to criterion 2b even though that clearly would be debatable. Inline referencing to common knowledge facts in science articles is actually not the best editorial practice according to most science editors here (e.g. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Physics_a4a8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physics</a>). I find counting the number of references in an article and making blanket statements about article quality to be not only small-minded but nearly insulting to editors who may have thought very hard about what facts should be inline referenced. There is no discusion of what facts the editors want to reference, only a blanket statement that "2 is not enough". I, for one, think that kind of rhetoric is very unhelpful to the Wikipedia project. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 20:48, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look, I'm sorry but instead of removing decent articles from the GA list, people should be working on evaluating the ones that are already waiting. There is a huge backlog of articles that need to be reviewed. It would make much more sense to get that done and then go back and nitpick about how many citations an older article needs and if 2+2=4 needs a citation. The whole delisting movement has its priorties backwards and has come under the influence of the insane citation police. It is much more damaging to leave decent articles languishing than to have a fight about citing basic laws of mathematics. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:35, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is that many of the articles being delisted don't have to do with just the inline citations requirement, many of them are just plain not well-referenced, and many of the older ones especially are really quite bad articles overall. <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 21:46, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's what GA review is for. Warning people that articles may or may not be "not well-referenced" is a subjective discussion that is best left to the actual review process. The warning seems to function more like a harrassment over someone's opinion about what constitutes a "well-referenced article" rather than any sort of straightforward evaluation. You alone, Homestarmy, are not supposed to unilaterally declare an article "quite bad overall" without proper review. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 22:48, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The two examples given above are are to poorly cited articles, that should not be GAs - it should be abundantly clear that two inline citations are not adequate for either. Yes, an article can be GA today, and not tomorrow, because the GA process is flawed. Anyone can promote an article to GA, so it means little, particularly if GA can't be removed as easily as it is bestowed. Bludgeoning an editor who calls for better inline citations does not bode well for building a better encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 03:24, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks like SA has removed the material that caused offence. Shouldn't that be the end of it? I know he can be blunt, perhaps overly blunt at times, but by removing the warning he showed he is big enough to admit he was wrong to say what he did, regardless of different views about the actual merits of the articles. All the rest of this discussion is about how the GA project should work, which is not appropriate for discussion here. I don't see anything for admins to do at this point. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 02:05, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I asked for a source and his reply was that Arab names are hard to illiterate and so they probably made a mistake. I kept removing the information asking for a second source, if he just made up this connection or if anyone has made this link before. He has yet to provide one and instead simpyl reverts.

Is this vandalism? is this against "Wikipedia: No original research"? Am I wrong to keep removing it? This user is adamant that this information is to stay.

You have stated these people are unrelated and have not shown that anyone was confused over who they are. Its almost a stereotype that you would assume that people with the same last name and name Muhammed that are arabic in decent would be confused with eachother ... You have not shown anyone citing confusion over these people, anyone alleging they are the same person, just your own research that says Saudi's went to Guantanamo before (no proof) Arab names are hard to illiterate (dont see connection as the names are far different) So the Saudi's must obviously be confused on who he is (where is the connection here).

<dd>If he has stopped, great; crisis over, we can all get on with our wiki-lives. Personally, I think the whole BCE/CE thing is a bunch of politically correct mumbo-jumbo that most other civilizations don't bother with in their own, endogenous date systems, and I absolutely refuse to use it in any new articles that I create, but once it's done, it's done. Undoing the changes would essentially be revert-warring over dates, which the Arbitration Committee said was harmful and shouldn't be done. If he does it again then a revert and a warning is in order. If he doesn't do it again, great; discussion and consensus have won the day. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 22:15, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, what is the harm in allowing them to stay the way they are? He violated one of Wikipedia's arcane rules (there are several hundred by now, hence the saying "process is evil"), and now he won't do it again. There are other things far more important than date changes, which is what the Arbitration Committee appeared to have been trying to communicate with their ruling. Also, "colour/color" is a different case - there are fairly clear standards for when one or the other applies, depending on the predominant style of the region most associated with the article's topic, or, failing that, according to the majority style of the article. Seriously, that ruling was made to end an issue. I'd recommend just letting it go. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 22:34, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No harm, of course, but why his edits are allowed even if are against rules, while other edits of the same kind are promptly reverted (and the user blocked, sometimes)? And the Arbitration Committee did not say "there are other things far more important than date changes", but rather "When either of two styles are acceptable it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change" (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Jguk_d4af.html#Optional_styles" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Jguk">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Jguk#Optional_styles</a>).

<p>We don't revert changes as a method of punishment. We make changes to improve encyclopedic content. If someone is making changes that are neutral in their effect on encyclopedic content, we can block them if it is causing ongoing annoyance and disruption (though I've never understood why people actually get annoyed about these petty things); however, we don't cause further disruption to the encyclopedia by reversing changes when doing so won't actually improve the article in question.

<dd>The best thing to do if you want to change the era style is to first simply <i>ask</i> on the Talk page if anyone cares. If no one objects within a reasonable amount of time (say 5-7 days), go ahead &amp; change the style BC/AD -&gt; BCE/CE or BCE/CE -&gt; BC/AD. Whichever you prefer. If someone objects, then the person pushing for the change <i>ought</i> to discuss the matter. This is a contentious issue, &amp; many Wikipedians are aware that opinions run hot on both sides of the issue, so simple courtesy &amp; respect for each other dictate that people ask before making this change.

<p>The <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_fuel_cell.html" title="Water fuel cell">water fuel cell</a> is a device that was proven to be a scam: its "inventor" was found guilty of gross and egregious fraud for deceiving people into investing in the idea. Over the past couple of days, a mild edit war has been raging on the article, as someone keeps adding nonsense to it, and reverting changes which portray the device in a less than flattering light. Even though the 3RR rule has been broken many times over, no-one has bothered going through the red tape to report it. However, twice now (I reverted the first one), this user has placed a ridiculous set of paragraphs at the top of the article, which ends in the statement that "Spreading malicious lies about patent protected technology which in under license is illegal, and opens the Wikimedia Foundation to libel suits and a host of other nasty legal proceedings" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Water_fuel_cell&amp;curid=1030561&amp;diff=78225828&amp;oldid=78225708" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Water_fuel_cell&amp;curid=1030561&amp;diff=78225828&amp;oldid=78225708" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>.

<p>Some of you who deal with vandalism may be aware of someone who's been hitting the microsoft-related articles, often replacing S with $ and c with ¢. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../m/s/n/MSN_Hotmail_eefe.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../m/s/n/MSN_Hotmail_eefe.html" rel="nofollow">example</a> using shared singapore IPs.

See <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#User:No_more_anonymous_editing_-_something_odd" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">AN discussion on User:No_more_anonymous_editing</a> for that one. There's also a user I've suspected for awhile to have something to do with it, <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHildanknight_74fc.html" title="User:Hildanknight">Hildanknight</a>, who gotten into a conflicts reguarding restricting anonymous editing. Well, my suspicions were confirmed recently. Jayig's use of checkuser ties all these together as one. Hildanknight is vandalising in his spare time to try to influence negative opinions on anonymous editing by vandalising himself. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Hildanknight_dff7.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Hildanknight">Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Hildanknight</a> for checkuser evidence. Could an administrator please deal with Hildanknight at this point? He's caused <i>large</i> amounts of semi-automated vandalism in his attempts to somehow get anonymous editing banned from wikipedia. While its not a difficulty to quickly mass revert his vandalism, it needs to end.

For the record, however, I'm told that the IP he uses is just about the only IP in singapore, so blocking it would impact many other users, so caution should be taken in that respect. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 16:55, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If what you say is true, the block will trigger an autoblock, which will be rapidly lifted, meaning he can still disrupt to make a point as an anon or a new username (until we figure it out again).

<p>The following was posted on <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a>'s page because he's experienced in AfD.</p>
<p>I need a second opinion on an admin ruling, and I wonder if you would be willing to help me out. I know that you are an extremely reasonable man. The admin above removed my speedy delete A3 tag on List of insular languages, saying that the AfD should run its course. I think that's a waste of admin time and editor time. I've seen him do this before, and it's extremely frustrating. I've never seen another admin do this. I've found that it's customary to tag things at AfD with a speedy delete tag if they qualify. I'm going to put up the tag again, and maybe you could delete it. Thank you. If you would like me to contact another admin on the matter, I will. This is an unacceptable situation, as the article is clearly crap and speedily deletable. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Blythe_7728.html" title="User:Billy Blythe">Billy Blythe</a> 13:04, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. I'm not Guy, but I was stopping by to check on something else. Speedying something already up for AfD is certainly unorthodox; once it's up for community discussion the common way to indicate that you think it should vanish immediately is through a comment on the AfD with "Speedy Delete" in bold. If you look through the AfD logs, you'll see them come up. But I think Future Perfect at Sunrise was correct to take it to AfD rather than speedy, as the prod was contested. Speedy deletion is only for when it's obvious junk. User Fg2 felt it wasn't obvious, so the AfD looks appropriate. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 13:33, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think its an obvious speedy but as William stated above it was put up for AfD and once that happens it should be allowed to follow proccess. Unfortunatly I think it is a waste, but how much resources are really wasted if it results in WP:SNOW? So while I agree with you, I am more concerned with people sticking to proccess. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 13:44, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm widely rumored to be a deletionist, and yet I always feel that, once something is up at AfD, we might as well let it run its course, <i>unless</i> it is an obvious candidate for speedy deletion or causes harm in some manner. Merely taking our time is not, to me, an argument, as, if it's an obvious delete and SNOWball, then it's going to be deleted anyway. The only reason to avoid that process, in my view, is if one believes that there is going to be a big astroturfing campaign. I doubt this will happen here. If it does, that's a separate matter and a separate complaint. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:16, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey, I just see I've come to be honoured with a rogue-admin complaint on ANI when I'm not even an admin!&#160;:-) Just to give my version of the story, I first attempted to do a PROD, that was contested, so I put it on AfD, and I removed that speedy notice out of a sense of due process because like JzG I actually don't think CSD A3 applies. Nothing else happened, no reasons for getting upset. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 14:35, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did respond to this at my tazlk, but as far as I can see it's not an unambiguous speedy - it may be that an experienced linguist will ocme along and tell us that actually it's a valid term. Given that it's already at AfD I see no pressing reason why we should not let that run, there being no harm done by this article that I can see. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 22:03, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First this editor added an article on himself (as a business writer, he probably merits an article) and then he added links to his various websites.

<dd>He actually seems to be right. <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> 2, says "Articles about any organization, person, web site, or other entity should link to the official site if there is one." So at least his official page should stay. Linking to 3 "official sites" is debatable, but I'd give it to him as well, it's not as if he has 20.</dd>
<dd>What's more, since the article says: "He also publishes a small business accounting web site with several thousand pages of small business tax, computer and accounting information including free pdf versions of half a dozen of his books, an LLC formation web site that provides do-it-yourself limited liability company formation kits for all fifty states, and an S corporation setup web site that provides do-it-yourself S corporation setup kits for all fifty states." - writing that without giving the actual links seems kind of perverse. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 18:01, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>user:Robertjkoenig and his multiple sockpuppets have been banned for abuse of Wikipedia. He frequently posts on the entrly for <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAA_01b4.html" title="USAA">USAA</a> or on other very loosely related pages; his posts usually refer to litigation regarding USAA, as well as the fact that it is unincorporated. He believes for some strange reason that the CEO of USAA is out to steal billions of dollars from the association and that anyone who disagrees with this outlandish unsupported accusation must be employed by USAA or is somehow otherwise compensated. He and/or his sockpuppets will begin to attack anyone who disagrees. Lately, he has tried to use the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reciprocal_inter-insurance_exchange.html" title="Reciprocal inter-insurance exchange">reciprocal inter-insurance exchange</a> page to continue his non factually based crusade against USAA; he also edited my user page. Lately, one of his socks <a href="../../../l/l/m/User%7ELlm1017_3c05.html" title="User:Llm1017">user:Llm1017</a> has started to post exclusively on the reciprocal inter-insurance exchange page in a manner extraordinarily consistent with Robert J Koenig's writing. Most telling is his contention that I am an Attorney for USAA; if you read his blog at <a href="http://rent-a-shills-at-wikipedia.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://rent-a-shills-at-wikipedia.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[81]</a> he makes similar accusations about myself and others.

<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<dl>
<dd>I got a message for my wikapedia that they thought i was vandalizing. However it was an experiment and i further read after i recieved your message. Our professor dropped a groups presentation grade because of citing wikepedia because the site can be changed. I was experimenting with the nonsense page on feces to see how long the content was aloud to stay. As i read on it was only aloud to stay to view for 5 minutes. I do not know much more other than your comments on stating it cannot be guaranteed for it content. I myself use it to look up words and appriciate it. When i asked the teacher again today he said he does use it but tries to use it as a spring board and then research on for reputable sites. Sorry for the inconvienience this may have caused you. As a college student i know i should have read first but i am extremely busy. Thanks and sorry again. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.64.21.185 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.64.21.185.html" title="User talk:72.64.21.185">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.64.21.185_00e5.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.64.21.185">contribs</a>) 00:00, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

However, there are also innocent users using it as well.

<dd>The thing is <b>it isnt</b> an open proxy.

<dd>I just checked that page using GWA and the XFF info is correct: It shows my normal home IP addy. It'd be preferable to use GWA's XFF ip when selecting the ip-edited-from for a user. GWA, while annoying at times, isn't a simple open proxy, nor does it perform anonymizing services: It's designed to accelerate your internet connection. I imagine the best solutions would be either 1) allow passing of Google's XFF to Wikipedia (the devs would have to handle this) or 2) block all GWA IP ranges, preferably with very large and obvious note explaining why, pointing out the security vulnerabilities, and explaining how to disable GWA for Wikipedia. <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 21:05, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And blocking him indefinantly without warning of evidence doesn't give him the chance. Generally you take a user aside before accusing them of being a sockpuppet, without presenting evidence, and telling them to behave.</dd>
<dd>Sure i've gotten in heated arguments with Jakew before - that's because he's gaming wikipedia rules to censor information he doesn't like. which is something I already have another admin looking into <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordkazan_5201.html" title="User:Lordkazan">Lordkazan</a> 16:17, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>who ever said the truth is civil? from everything i've seen of them it's absolutely true that Jakew is gaming the system, he's even been warned by ArbCom before for pov-pushing edits. Avraham jumps to Jakew's defense in a moments notice, often half cocked - including improperly accusing me of putting those SPAs (see my talk page). Jayjg always walked the line of suspicion in my mind until today when he unilaterally and arbitrarily came down on <i>tit for tat</i> without sufficient justification. In my expirience what I said about them is true - and in my book the truth comes before being civil. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordkazan_5201.html" title="User:Lordkazan">Lordkazan</a> 16:37, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>that is a straw man. The correct statement would be <i>"According to kazan, something that is true, and that he can backup by citing evidence such as wikipedia diffs, cannot be a personal attack."</i>. The Truth is not an attack, it is the truth. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordkazan_5201.html" title="User:Lordkazan">Lordkazan</a> 16:53, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Furthermore the diff you cite is about my opinion of an ACTION.. ACTION. I recommend you consult <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> yourself. Opinions of an <b>ACTION</b> are not personal attacks. It is an <i>opinion</i> about an <b>action</b>. I'm getting sick and tired of people trying to use wikipedia to enforce their personal viewpoint and abusing the rules to do so. My purpose here is to improve articles and keep them nonbiased. I express my opinions on the talk pages, I only put non-biased information into articles (to the best of my ability). Current Jakew is, by intimidation mostly, driving off editors and frustrating the persistent ones who would undo the bias of articles like <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">Circumcision</a> which is completely ignoring many of the significant health and physical effects that Jakew doesn't like to talk about because they challenge his position - i have no problem having my position challanged, and i have no problem presenting the other sides argument. I want controversial articles to represent all viewpoints, and ones related to medical issues should CONTAIN ALL MEDICAL INFORMATION, not just the medical information that favors one side of the argument. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordkazan_5201.html" title="User:Lordkazan">Lordkazan</a> 17:09, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>President Bush is a warmonger. That's the truth, but it's also an attack. What's key here is that there's both no need to say it on Wikipedia, and if the need arose, there's more tactful ways to address the subject (it has been a staple of Bush's precidency to use military action more than has been seen in recent american history).

<dd>Semantics. I could say <i>"Administrators Jayjg and Avraham, have in my expirience, shown a significant amount of bias in Jakew's favor in all my interactions with the three of them. In all my interactions with Jakew and my research of his past interactions with other editors I find there to be a consistent theme of him intimidating other editors (by improper citation of the rules) into not adding well-cited information to articles that challenges his position and that he has been warned by ArbCom in the past for this."</i>.

However, the tone of this editor and the method of argument looks to me like it's somewhat different, and the sudden shift of topic seems illogical - if WikiWoo was going to dig into the sock drawer and get right back to work, one would have suspected he would go back to the articles he targeted originally, and not jump over to a school board dispute. I'm not sure if there's enough for a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">checkuser</a> case here or not, but that might be the way to go. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 18:37, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was under the impression that we can't do a checkuser if one of the users hasn't logged in since a while back? I'm biased, but the identity seems fairly obvious to me, and he didn't exactly react <i>innocently</i> to my direct question as to whether he is WikiWoo. (Should have asked if he <i>was</i> WikiWoo, my bad. And yes, I do know it is no proof either way.) Also note how the editor seems to be falling into a WikiWoo cycle of first losing it ("neo-nazis", the board being uninterested in educating students) and then regaining composure and asking to work together. This happened earlier, when he said he was satisfied with my wording (back when the article spoke of only one issue with the board...) only to "add content to expand Wiki" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regional_Municipality_of_Peel%2C_Ontario&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67813021" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regional_Municipality_of_Peel%2C_Ontario&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67813021" rel="nofollow">cough</a>) the next day.

<dd>Just to make a point here: I'm not an admin, so I'm just offering thoughts. I just find the sudden change of personality and target as somewhat out of his character.

That strikes me as a very uncollegial means of dealing with the problem, if a problem exists. I'd like to point out that Wikipedia has been mocked mercilessly over the last half week or so over the handling of the Publicgirluk situation... turns out that they probably were good-faith uploads after all.

<dd>Replying to both JoshuaZ and Ck: No consensus was formed what to due with the publicgirluk photos, but were they restored? I don't believe they were. The reason they were deleted in the first place was because it was possibly a hoax. If they were good-faith, I'll be the first in line to ask for the undeletion of the photos. But it's sort of risky to assume good faith that a user whose first edits are uploads of "themselves" nude, and then they never edit again. Ck, I didn't bother to contact the uploader, true, but the two uploaders User:Nnixon and <a href="../../../c/p/7/User%7ECp79_f872.html" title="User:Cp79">User:Cp79</a> have left Wikipedia or they aren't bothering to come back. Nnixon only made two edits, the upload and adding the pic to an article. Likewise with Cp79, who also engaged in <i>some</i> talk page discussion, but left the following day. Why leave a message to a user telling them of thier Image deletion if they are apparently not coming back? If someone gets in contact with the users' and it is 100% certain that they are the models in they photos, we can readd them, but it's too risky otherwise. — <span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva"><a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#CD2626">Moe Epsilon</font></a></span> 23:31 September 27 '06

<dd>I've seen a number of users who start out by making a few edits, don't edit for a while (even a month at a time), and then start editing regularly again. I've got several on my watchlist at the moment, actually. A couple of them started off by making rather controversial edits. It was also around the time of the users' creation that a Wikitruth article on the topic went up, and a number of Wikipedians read Wikitruth. Anyway, it's worth it to at least make an attempt. If it has to be after the fact because of potential legal problems, then it has to be after the fact, but in the meantime not bothering to inform the original uploader strikes me as very problematic. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 02:05, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Furthermore I find it laughable that anyone respectable would mock wikipedia for removing a nude picture that was uploaded by a person who outright refuses to provide any sort of evidence that they are really who they say they are. It seems obvious that the entire ordeal was either a hoax or someone either making a point or trying to get wikipedia in trouble, and the people who defended the user mainly seemed to be doing it out of excitement of the possibility of having contact with a intelligent and beautiful woman who likes to post sexual pictures of herself. I should clarify that I don't have any problems with the pictures themselves, but the fact that the user was possibly not who they said they were really made me worry about the possibility of legal issues.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 00:30, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The woman in the photos is porn model, Anna, aka "Linda Lust". You can see photos on http://galleries.anna19.com/lollyanna/n/1022766 and (large download) http://www.babeindex.se/showthread.php?p=1661#post1661. The latter site includes the photos submitted to wiki.</p>
<p>Both Encyclopedia Dramatica and Wikitruth have made much of the Publicgirluk incident to mock Wikipedia in general and Jimbo Wales in particular. Interestingly Wikitruth claims, "We contacted her and got her permission to put up these photos", so either they're not so truthful after all, or else they knew the source and still went ahead to castigate Wikipedia, which is also not very truthful, but worth recording in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitruth.html" title="Wikitruth">Wikitruth</a>. No doubt both these sites will be withdrawing their remarks and offering an apology.</p>
<p>Anna is stated to be Swedish, and Publicgirluk claimed to be English, so one of them's telling porkies, and, in the likely event that the model did not upload them, they are a copyvio. It all points to the need for strict verification of authenticity.</p>
<p>PS Linda Lust on <a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Lust" class="external text" title="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Lust" rel="nofollow">Swedish Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>PPS Wikitruth state in their article talk page that it is indeed Linda Lust, whom they had asked permission from and that they were "pirvate (sic) photos taken by her boyfriend".</p>

<p>Yes indeed - all of us 'Puritans' who, out of sexual panic, wanted to 'bite the newcomers' are very glad to see that their copyright concerns regarding these images were valid.

Furthermore, we still have no <i>definite proof</i> that it was not the model who uploaded them. Wikitruth claim they have contacted the model and gained permission for the photos' use (and also that this particular set were "out of hours" pics by the boyfriend, though that is not necessarily of any import). They managed to discover the model's identity, so maybe they do know something. Some students work as escorts and also make porn. She wouldn't be the first porn actress to contribute to wiki. I don't know for sure whether Linda Lust is Swedish as nationalities are easily fictionalised. Publicgirluk said she didn't have a website (but then she doesn't as PGUK). Per the current discussion on <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cff4.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia talk:Biographies of living persons</a>, we need to exercise restraint on what we do say here.

<dd>For our purposes, all of that is irrelevant anyway. I wouldn't like the new information to (re)create divisiveness. Users on both "sides" were genuine and had serious concerns. Let us respect each others' motivations, and find a place to meet in the middle in order to work together to resolve such situations harmoniously. This involves both better and earlier dialogue with such uploaders directly, as well as the need for verification of origin before such images are used.</dd>

<p>Hi, I'm unsure what to do. Recently there has been a lot of controversy on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EGood_article_candidates_da1f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Good article candidates">Wikipedia talk:Good article candidates</a> about the appropriate way to provide references for certain articles which are standard textbook material. I have been trying, without much success, to mediate an informal compromise.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClairSamoht_1970.html" title="User:ClairSamoht">User:ClairSamoht</a> seems to have gotten a bee in his or her bonnet about this. First the user is adding noncompliant tags to (featured!) articles like <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_bang.html" title="Big bang">big bang</a> with edit summaries of "vandalism" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78409778" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78409778" rel="nofollow">[85]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Redshift&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78403546" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Redshift&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78403546" rel="nofollow">[86]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physical_law&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78375125" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physical_law&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78375125" rel="nofollow">[87]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Static_universe&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78375648" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Static_universe&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78375648" rel="nofollow">[88]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physical_law&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78375125" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physical_law&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78375125" rel="nofollow">[89]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creationism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78374567" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creationism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78374567" rel="nofollow">[90]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milne_model&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78374047" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milne_model&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78374047" rel="nofollow">[91]</a> (and more). This is clearly in violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Moreover, ClairSamoht is encouraging seasoned users to leave Wikipedia for disagreeing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Good_article_candidates&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78368566" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Good_article_candidates&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78368566" rel="nofollow">[92]</a> which seems to violate basic standards of civility (not to mention that Wikipedia already seems to be having a problem with experts getting frustrated and leaving). Look, there is a genuine disagreement here, and peoples hackles are getting raised, but this is unacceptable in my book. Can someone have a look at ClairSamoht's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/ClairSamoht" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/ClairSamoht" rel="nofollow">contribs</a> and comment?

<dd>I asked ClairSamoht why he/she tagged "Creationism" with an "unverifiable" template, as the article has copious references and footnotes, and he/she responded that there were certain sections which he/she thought should have references but didn't. IMO this is a clear mis-use of the tags, and is in the end <i>not</i> helpful — if an editor has specific complaints, there are ways to indicate the area of problem with far more specificity, and in any case blanket tagging without taking the time to explain the complaints is lazy and ineffectual. It does not help the project to indiscriminantly tag articles without real explanation, and I don't think posting a generic and inspecific template to a talk page counts as explanation. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 00:58, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> policy says that "any reader must be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source". Yes, I have placed tags on several articles I've run across recently, for the reasons that the tag was created:
<ol>
<li>the tag warns readers that the articles do not meet Wikipedia quality standards, and the articles may have untrustworthy content</li>
<li>the tag recruits editors to work on the articles, and bring them up to Wikipedia quality standards</li>
<li>the tag asks readers not to form a bad opinion of Wikipedia on the basis of the deficient article.</li>

<dd>The <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy allows any editor to challenge or remove unsourced content. In some of the articles I've tagged, there have been stretches of paragraph after paragraph without a single source being given.

<dd>Every page needs references, but not every page needs prominent boxes warning readers that the content is problematic. In the absence of an actual dispute over content, the warning boxes should go. Further, templated messages saying that an article needs more references is not a helpful addition to a talk page. Every contributor can see whether or not the article has appropriate citations without the need for blanket reminders. If you have something specific to add to the discussion, or particular facts that you dispute, then talk about them. Better yet, go look up some sources and add more citations.

<dd>Also, I suggest you delete the {{noncompliant}} and {{unsourced}} templates so that other users will know that articles should be peppered with scores of little tags instead of one big one, because they are less disruptive. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClairSamoht_1970.html" title="User:ClairSamoht">ClairSamoht</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check_47bc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check">Help make Wikipedia the most authoritative source of information in the world</a> 03:09, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just added some references to <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a>, mostly by going to the daughter articles which are themselves well referenced and using copy and paste. I suppose that improves the article somewhat, but if I had, say, wanted the correct references for <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscillatory_universe.html" title="Oscillatory universe">oscillatory universe</a>, I might have just clicked the link. (<a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a> seems to agree that this is OK – not that I'm claiming that all the daughter articles are thoroughly referenced.)</p>
<p>The real point I want to make is this. A bunch of science editors are trying to get a clear picture of what an appropriate standard for referencing is, particularly on uncontroversial topics. We certainly think that a page like <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancaster_County%2C_Pennsylvania_7b3a.html" title="Lancaster County, Pennsylvania">Lancaster County, Pennsylvania</a> is both excessive and unrealistic, as is the failure to reference anything in recent article I wrote (not yet finished) <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structure_formation.html" title="Structure formation">structure formation</a>. Some things people did earlier in the week got a few people, myself included, riled up. But <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClairSamoht_1970.html" title="User:ClairSamoht">User:ClairSamoht</a> is doing this to make a point – it is obviously to make a point, because otherwise he/she wouldn't be selecting only articles <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">User:ScienceApologist</a> edits – is counterproductive and likely to prevent a consensus from being established on this particular issue.

It got reverted with an edit summary of "reverting vandalism". I'd like user ClairSamoht to understand that editors may differ in opinion, but that discussion should be used as a prime resolver of disputes, and that plates such as those that she liberally sprinkles on Wikipedia should only be added AFTER they are discussed.

<dd>I believe those are linked to outdated procedure. I normalyl go by Talk page etiquette</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Actively erasing non-harassing personal messages without replying (if a reply would be appropriate or polite) will probably be interpreted as hostile. In the past, this kind of behavior has been viewed as uncivil, and this can become an issue in arbitration or other formal proceedings. Redirecting your user talk page to another page (whether meant as a joke or intended to be offensive or to send a "go away" message), except in the case of redirecting from one account to another when both are yours, can also be considered a hostile act. However, reverting such removals or redirects is not proper and may result in a block for edit warring. If someone removes your comments without answering, consider moving on or dispute resolution. This is especially true for vandalism warnings.</p>
</blockquote>

<dd>It is, very much so. Traditionally, users control their talk pages and If a user blanks a warning it is OK to assume they've seen it and you are justified in going to the next level if there is further difficulty. But if it's a different admin that comes along, not knowing, they may give the first level warning again, confusing the issue. In the cases where I leave warnings for particularly obstreperous editors, and it's already not the first time I say "and if you remove this warning right away I'll block you for it" which may not be exactly right, but it's what I do, because while I recognise the tradition of a user controlling their page (within limits, this is a wiki and no one owns their pages) I think it's more important that other admins not have their time wasted. It's a trade off... busy admin vs. troublesome user... I come down on the side of making the admin's life easier. Myself, with a user I've not been working with before, I try to remember to look at the history of their talk page looking for warnings. Which is why admins ought to use good edit summaries like "3rd warning for incivility at mumbletopic" so you can spot them quickly. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:19, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the information, perhaps a time limit is needed, like "warnings should not be removed within 24hours of them being issued", something that will allow particularly disruptive users to not skate away with multiple first warnings, yet still retain some basic idea of control over their userpage.

<dd>This may be an example of the blocking code failing - I don't think you were supposed to be unblocked until October 26.

<p>Hi, I am trying to contribute to Gulen page. The page is reverted back to an ancient version by a user barouqque. S/he is reverting back to his long discussed and corrected version as documented at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Fethullah_G%C3%BClen#Changes" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Fethullah_G%C3%BClen#Changes" rel="nofollow">link</a>. All corrections and discussions are getting lost for about a year.</p>
<p>The people doing this are using a tactic to keep others away from the article. They blame others being a puppet. Unfortunately some admins are not checking the histroy page carefully and being part of this game.</p>
<p>I would like to raise the issue to the attention of community. Please help to keep a version of the article long discussed, corrected and neutralized.</p>

<p>In addition, I'm beginning to question her block reasons. The sockpuppettering is already proven. (with all of the accounts that came up here on ANI. But vandalism??? Where's the vandalism here???

<dd>Does anyone think this is enough to get her unblocked?

<dd>I initially believed that this user deserved another chance. The behaviour since the block was placed between this user and the numerous sockpuppets, some of which were created after the block, has shown to me beyond a shadow of a doubt that this user has no intention of becoming a good editor and has no compunction against blatantly flaunting Wikipedia's rules and regulations. While this is clearly an opinion, I am firmly against unblocking this user's account. If the user cannot even be trusted to behave while a block is in effect, what possible reason do we have for believing the user will act properly if unblocked? Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me fifty times and I'm a moron. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 00:55, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this situation is becoming corrupt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cute 1 4 u was blocked for being a certain age, as stated in her block summary. As far as I'm concerned, whatever is in the block summary is the basis of her block.</li>
<li>She wasn't going to vandalise <b>Wikipedia</b>. She planned to vandalise the sister projects, but not Wikipedia. There's a difference. The admins at the appropriate sister projects should have been notified.</li>
<li>We're making wild assumtions that Cute 1 4 u keeps making sockpuppets. I know that she admitted to some of the socks, but what if the accounts were controlled by her siblings or relatives or something? At her original userpage, Cute 1 4 u established that she had siblings (I think).--<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_06df.html" title="User:Ed">Ed</a><sup><a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_8c3a.html" title="User talk:Ed">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ed_3469.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ed">c</a> <b><font color="green">E</font></b></sup> 23:13, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>She said she wasn't going to vandalise wikipedia. She's already shown a willingness to ignore our rules by creating socks. There are no wild assumptions when she's admitted to some of the sockpuppets. If one of those accounts really was a family member, that is unfortunate, but really too bad. Sometimes someone does something that ruins it for everyone. If the family is really that bent out of shape over it, they'll have to take it up with her. Maybe she'll learn something.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 13:14, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your <b>continued</b> blatant abuse of Wikipedia (continuing to bypass blocks and continuing to create abusive sockpuppets) shows quite clearly why you should be blocked. At this point, I'm in favour of instantly banning any sockpuppets on site and providing long-term blocks of any IP address used by this user. Continuing to edit the Wikipedia while blocked is abusive behaviour. No ifs, ands, or buts. Additionally, we should consider additional steps to prevent the continued abuse from this user. I'm not sure what else can be done, though. Perhaps a block of the entire IP range, though that has a high possibility of hitting innocent third parties (in which case, it is clearly inappropriate). Perhaps contacting the ISP and having them terminate the abusive user (though I'm not sure if this is kosher). --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 22:46, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(Edit conflict) To get through to you, a bit, Ed, THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THIS CONVERSATION, AMIRITE? We are trying to figure out a way to deal with Cute 1 4 u, which may just end up getting her (and by proxy her parents') internet subscription cancelled for a period of time, and this would force her parents to input parental controls so that she cannot utilize Wikipedia, but this would have to be done at some point through legal actions, and I don't think Brad or any of the other Wikimedia legal reps wants to have to sue an 11 year old girl. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 18:54, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just to be clear, although I believe Cute 1 4 u's abuse has gone way out of hand, I don't think it is realistic to seriously consider suing her. There's virtually no potential upside as far as I can see, and substantial downsides. Plus <a href="../../../l/e/g/WP%7ELEGAL_8608.html" title="WP:LEGAL">WP:LEGAL</a>. Also, blocking all of Chicago isn't a good plan because it would affect editors like Ed, though if we could find a way to do so <i>without affecting other users</i>, I would strongly advise that action. I wonder how difficult it would be to contact the ISP and report the long-term deliberate abuse, and whether it would result in any change. Apart from that, the only other option I see is permanent bans on the sockpuppets and long-term blocks on any IP address used by this long-term vandal. Perhaps IP blocks of a month at a time, until and unless we block a legitimate editor accidentally (not just another abusive sockpuppet). --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 19:01, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

Indefblock registered users that are proven after either edits, an RFCU, or an autoblock, and long-term block IP addresses that she claims to use, which may sadly end up blocking the Chicago area's SBC users. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 19:05, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I knew the situation is going to end up like this months ago when I discovered the Raven Symone sock. Then Cute 1 4 U uses another sock User:Gemini to defend herself. I contacted Fred Bauder (who laugh it off) and discuss the presence of children on AN/I, no one took much notice/attention. Anyway this seems like a classic case of wikilawyering similar to the case of User:PoolGuy (creating endless socks and continue to push the the idea that he did nothing wrong initially). We don't even know if Cute 1 4 U is really 11 or not. She might faked her age so some users will be more lenient on her since she's a kid. Anyway, rules are rules. Age, sex, and other backgrounds are irrelevant. If we make a bad case by unblocking Cute 1 4 U, guess what? Next time all the vandals are going to disguise as elementary school kids. She should stay block indefinitely as well as any IP/accounts she alledgely uses (similar editing pattern etc). Gaming the rules and circumventing blocks are not constructive.

<p>I like to point out that Crystal is not even allow to edit here with her IP on the ground that she is indefinitely banned. The only place she is allow to communicate is her personal talkpage. Editing with her IP in order to gain sympathy and support is another violation of her indef. block. Another issue is that we have no way of knowing her real age, I remembered a thread from Fred Bauder back in early August saying Crystal claimed to be 15 on myspace and 13 on blackplanet. Age is irrevelevant in this issue. I highly doubt her "contributions" to the project will be missed.--<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonafide.hustla_8457.html" title="User:Bonafide.hustla">Bonafide.hustla</a> 03:29, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems like she should have the right to defend herself in this discussion concerning her. Also she cannot edit her personal talk page because it has been protected. She apologizes many times. She is interested in continuing as a wikipedian here. A vandal would have just forget the discussion and make new accounts to vandalize with. She really wants to be here.

<dd>Yes, that's what a vandal would do and that's what <b>she</b> has done, over and over and over again. If she had served one month without vandalising, I'd be willing to support her coming back.

<p>It is not clear to me why one administrator, Sarah Ewart, has created so much red tape over one short article. It appears as if she has intentionally complicated things. The subject I wrote about is published and very well known in the engineering field. She is identified on numerous webpages and websites. Wikipedia is an online Encyclopedia. There are numerous living and accomplished people from all over the world who are listed in Wikipedia. The subject of the article I submitted represents one of millions of these people. What is it about the subject that is causing problems for Ms Ewart and the team of administrators she has rounded up to review this... or maybe there are other elements that I need to now consider? Please let me know because her actions are truly inappropriate. I am trying to work with her, follow her suggestions, identify why the subject is important and noble, and yet she seems to escalate things without resolving them. She indicated that she now requires the advice of her peers when she abruptly locked and deleted the article. This demonstrates that she may not be qualified to be an administrator, let alone, a volunteer. In fact, it shows that she may have reacted too quickly and harshly in response to my earlier emails (in capital letters) and my lack of experience navigating the online communication of Wikipedia. The fact that she also called upon and identified an American and an engineer to further review my article demonstrates concern about anti-Americanism because the subject is an American. This was not an issue until she raised it and allied with Guinnog, another non-American administrator. Should I now be concerned that Ms Ewart and her administrator friends will go on a speedy deletion spree and remove every one or more of my contributions that I volunteered and spent countless hours on? Will I now face bans or scrutiny on Wikepedia? These are legitimate concerns that warrant formal complaints. Furthermore, I am amazed by the camaraderie among the network of administrators. I am posting this complaint because I cannot seem to get one impartial administrator (who is not associated with Ms Ewart and Guinnog) to respond to my request for a complaint on my talk page and for a resolution of this problem Ms Ewart created. This is not what Wikipedia is about. Wikipedia is a wonderful tool. Such administrators should not ruin it for the rest of us. Administrators need to respect all people- including Americans- who freely contribute to Wikipedia. We are *all* volunteers.</p>

<p>NYer and SandyStrauss have the same IP because they probably share computers or networks in the offices. They are not the same person because I know of both. So it is astounding that everyone seems to be attacking them. So maybe one of you should try to work with them and put an end to this? It is possible they did not know the rules of Wikepedia.

<dd>Guinnog, I checked what you said and it seems that the IP is banned so any user would use a telephone if no other contact information is provided. That seems rather logical. I think the issue is with NYer who seems to have started this discussion. Not Strauss. This seems like a no-brainer to me, especially when IPs and computers are shared all of the time. (All computer savvy people know this.) The right thing to do is to lift whatever IP bans were put up and communicate directly with Strauss. I know I would certainly be upset enough to telephone EngineerScotty too if anyone anywhere wrote what he did about Strauss. He could have made his point directing it at NYer rather than Strauss. He did not need to totally identify and completely itemize everything associated with Strauss if he wanted to take issue with NYer. This is crystal clear, even if Strauss originally authored her own bio. Lots of people do it on Wikepedia or have others they know write it for them. You need to stop whining and work with others in a positive and productive way. You can't deny it or stop this type of bio writing. You can police it but how many of you are out there to police this? So what if two users made some mistakes by not reviewing or knowing all of the Wikepedia rules? So what? I am sure it took a long time to learn the ropes on Wikepedia. I don't see where Strauss and NYer were frequent or long-time users of Wikepedia. NYer seems to have just joined. Right? Strauss contributed a few articles and pics. Big deal. Then again, who cares? Do anyone of you get rewarded for any of this information? Stop wasting time and start helping people on this thing. Stop talking and start working. Do something positive. Make a difference.

<dd>If you don't think its very important, why are you and your colleagues spending so much time and investing so much invective in pursuing this? A number of editors with long histories of making substantial and positive contributions to Wikipedia are being attacked without basis and in the most personal and vicious ways by Strauss and her cohorts, yourself included. Screaming "anti-American" and "bully" at every turn rather than trying to work with other editors is not making you any friends. Sarah Ewart and Guinnog went out of their way to explain the way Wikipedia works, and got hate-filled accusations thrown at them. Are you surprised that this was not welcomed with open arms? Try making any single contribution to the encyclopedia yourself before throwing around accusations about making a "positive difference". You have made none.</dd>
<dd>On a technical note: <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">User:EngineerScotty</a> can be contacted by email even from a blocked IP address, so the claim that a telephone call was the only way to contact that user is, like so many of your wild claims and accusations, simply incorrect. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 17:53, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have another question for all of you: This issue of privacy seemed a wee bit wobbly (if I may say that). Each of you except two women (Strauss and Ewart) seem to have aliases. Why not use aliases to protect their identities? This only seems fair. NYer should never have used Ewart's name but maybe there was no alias. Strauss seems to be an innocent victim here (apart from making the terrible mistake of writing an autobio and the having a colleague post it). Why not remove names of both ladies and refer to them under aliases? Each of you seems to have an alias on this and I think it is the right thing to do to help these ladies. Let's all pitch in to patch things up. JPeter2 18:06, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please, these socks are getting tiresome. If I wanted to be referred to by an alias, I would use an alias. I cannot understand why you keep adding to this thread, stating your name numerous times, and then emailing me repeatedly demanding I delete it because "mentioning of [your] name" is not permitted. You say you feel stalked by various people here, imagine how you'd feel if people started calling you at home! It's completely unacceptable. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 18:58, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am sorry, Sarah, but I only noticed this now. Judging by your reply, it seems that this was probably asked before. It just seems so logical that almost everyone on this thing has an alias. So you may not mind having your name referred to but maybe others do. About the home calls, all I can infer from this is that Strauss was unable to reach EngineerScotty. Not everyone knows how to send emails through Wikipedia, especially when there are obstacles to navigating through the site. The fact that many of you know shows that you have experience that others on Wikipedia do not. I agree with you though. These threads are getting tiresome. Rather than continue to discuss Strauss and NYer, why not try to work with one or both of them now? (I'm starting to feel like a moderator or advocate now but I am not.) Or end this thread or case? (If there is such a thing.) That seems like the right thing to do rather than to waste so much time digging up old news, old accusations, files, and defenses. Why is there such a need for each of you to continue to defend your actions? It's over. Just do something positive and help people on this thing already. Why is that so difficult? It's the right thing to do on and off Wikepedia. JPeter2 19:26, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look, please, settle on one account and stop creating new socks. If you don't want to be known by your real name, then don't sign up for an account in that name. It's not that hard. As for Scott, you went off and looked up his phone number and then tried to call him. He did not give you his number or consent to you calling him. What you did was completely inappropriate, whether you can see that or not. Agreed, not everyone knows how to send emails through Wikipedia, but you sure don't have that problem. You've sent me numerous harassing emails containing defamatory imputations against me, Zoe and Scott, emails to the board, the foundation...you don't have a problem with your ability to send emails.

<p>I vote to have all names of businesses, business owners, and products deleted at once so that we do not promote the very people and things that we define as wikispam. This should be a very easy and quick task for any administrator to undertake now and within this article because we are definitely promoting several products and businesses and business owners here whether or not any one of the authors realizes this. Any names identified in this article, "anti-americanism" appear in search engines and generate interest in businesses, products, and peoples. It is to the benefit of the very people we do not want on this website. WikiklEnr 00:34, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, so you want to remove all names off businesses? How are you going to have information about Enron? Or Microsoft? Or MCI? Or about all those characters at HP and their recent antics to control people's lives? Certainly a bad idea to have the name of, say, the American Cancer Society (they are an incorporation after all). Would anyone in government, say Al Gore, who takes a position in Business be deleted from the Wikipedia? Have any of you actually read any of the previous nonsense in this discussion? It reads like a bunch of Narcissistic ADHD children. Information is being shared and all you want to do is go on a witch hunt against each other? Huh? Take a deep breath. Exhale. Another breath - longer this time. Exhale. Now ... Think about the concept of sharing information. Now think about the wiki being for that purpose. Now think about the deletion of such material. Makes no sense. And what's this using a wiki page as a threaded discussion; someone write an extension that makes sense with automatic dates, threading, etc.</p>

<p>I have spoken with Sandy Straus extensively on the phone yesterday. Given her attitude towarrd using Wikipedia for self-promotional purposes, her suggestions that this discussion was a "hate crime," her use of meat puppets after she was warned that this is unacceptable, her calling of an admin at his home, and her utter disregard for the norms of our project, she, NYer, and JPeter2 should be banned indefinitely. I have already done so with JPeter2. Furthermore, her request that her user name be changed so as too protect her reputation was and should continue to be rejected. We do not reward spammers by changing their user names to make it easier for them to strike again. My suggestion is that all contributions by them, including innocuous ones in which their company name appears, be removed from Wikipedia. Let's not open the door to yet another subtle form of advertising. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 12:18, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

This seems like a very one-sided view represented by a majority of administrators who are freely attacking three people (NYer, Straus, and WikiklEnr) WITHOUT allowing one of them to respond to these preposterousaccusations. Soon no one will want to fund or support Wikepedia. I completely support the request of WikiklEnr, who was also just banned and mislabeled as a vandalizer. I now vote to have all names of business people, products, and company names removed from this entry and only this entry, titled “Anti-Americanism” IMMEDIATELY in support of the three people who these administrators are unnecessarily attacking (NYer, Straus, and WikiklEnr). Straus is especially being viciously and maliciously attacked by the above administrators due to a bio she posted and then had NYer, a colleague, post when it was removed. NYer also started this entry- not Straus. Wikepedia also refuses to change her username and she is the only one on this entry whose name, products, andbusiness are being published. Everyone else has an alias. This is beyond unacceptable behavior for any online encyclopedia.</p>

Who is funding Wikepedia and do they know about this abuse of power? Listing the name and also the location of Sandy Straus on this page is breaching her security and every woman’s security. Just change her user name too if you have the authority to do this. Revise this page to reflect these changes, since you do this all of the time, and stop marketing the company products on this page (see products listed by EngineerScotty and Zoe) and stop making false allegations of sockpuppetry, meat puppetry, and spamming when there is common knowledge that IP addresses and computers are always shared between users (as JPeter2 said before he was banned with a few others on this website). Stop adding fuel to this fire. And stop silencing and banning people who want to rebut these false allegations about Sandy Straus, USer:NYer, and User:JPeter2. Stop abusing administrative power on Wikepedia. Be calm and realize such hostility is simply detracting from the contribution the wikipedia could offer. Folks, just be above it all and make it right.</p>

<p>It looks like a better sentence in the prose.

<p>I still fail to see the advantage of de-linking any dates, but as far as I know, there's only a general agreement to de-link solitary years, e.g. <tt>[[2006]]</tt> → <tt>2006</tt>. Month'n'day pairings should remain linked whenever possible, exceptions being if it's part of a proper title or direct quote, etc. where a particular format is intentional. —<tt class="plainlinks"><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Freakofnurture_77c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Freakofnurture">freak</a>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>)</b></tt> 14:44, Sep. 29, 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks to all above for the comments. Looking at the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Incorrect_date_formats" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Manual of Style</a>, I see the following under the heading of <b>Incorrect date formats</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Use consistent date formatting throughout an article, unless there's a good reason to vary it.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Do not use ordinal suffixes:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Incorrect: "February 14th" and "14th February"</i></li>
<li><i>Correct: "February 14" and "14 February"</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Do not use articles:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Incorrect: "the 14th of February"</i></li>
<li><i>Correct: "February 14" and "14 February"</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The only exceptions are for direct quotations, disambiguation pages and section headings, none of which apply. The opinions of Centrx and Danny Lilithborne above, that the change was for reasons of prose style therefore carry no validity beyond personal preference.</p>
<p>As some will have noticed, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Insomnia_Festival&amp;diff=78379131&amp;oldid=75364274" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Insomnia_Festival&amp;diff=78379131&amp;oldid=75364274" rel="nofollow">Jayjg's edit</a> was one of a series of reversions of my edits, in which I changed date formats in articles related to British subjects from month-day-year American Dating to day-month-year International Dating, as specified in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Date_formats_related_to_topics" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">relevant Manual of Style section</a>. It is my understanding that rationalising date styles in accordance with the MoS is acceptable, along the same lines as changing measurements in articles dealing with American subjects to feet and inches, or metres in French subjects. Blanket changing styles to personal preference against MoS guidelines, such as in the Jguk case, is clearly unacceptable. I have <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html#Let.27s_make_a_date.2C_mate" title="User talk:Jayjg">raised this matter</a> with him, but he has not yet responded to some points, and on others I think he is mistaken in his views.</p>
<p>With all due respect to Jayjg, it looks to me like he's dropped the ball on this, and rather than have policy determined on the run via user talk pages, or left undetermined in the hope that it will go away, I'd like to get some advice as to where I should turn for the next step in the resolution process. Mediation? RfC? I should also stress that I am quite happy to abide by a formal ArbCom finding; I merely want the situation clarified to the point where I do not have to depend on contradictory comments made by individual ArbCom members on random user or article discussion pages. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 19:09, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>There is nothing in the Manual of Style section you cited about a <i>range</i> of dates, which I'd say is an issue that needs to be addressed.

<dd>As you say, there is nothing in the MoS to cover Jayjg's specific edit at all. I think you have hit the nail on the head there.

I know I've succumbed (answering questions the user name asks in witty ways, etc) which, really, isn't a good idea but hey, people do it. I'd rather a witty block message than no block at all, if it came to that.

Maybe if there names was PopNFresh and they were told "Back to the oven you go", that would be witty, but the comment left was actually quite abusive. I think if Wikipedia wants to earn a greater respect from those on the outside they need to present a more mature and educated front for those looking in. For someone to think "yeah editing an encyclopedia sounds like fun and educational", to be met with people running around calling eachother trolls and telling others to "fuck off an die", is not really the image we would want to present. Especially if as the worry goes, someone else with the same IP, if its dynamic, may get struck with that on their very first attempt to visit/edit the site. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 12:33, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>That block happened at 5:04am (UTC) and the user's name was "[removed]" (DakotaKahn is an existing Wikipedia editor)</li>
<li>Freak also blocked him under a minute later with no block summary with the username <i>[removed]</i></li>
<li>However just one minute before Freak's "controversial" block summary I also blocked the <b>same guy</b> with <b>no</b> block summary (I often just leave it out when dealing with complete trolls - tho sometimes I dont depending on what I feel is going to be most effective), this time as <i>[removed].</i></li>
<li>4 minutes before that another admin blocked <b>the same guy</b>, this time as <i>[removed]</i> with the block summary "..."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Now, given that the "WP:DENY" summaries (nothing and "...") did zero to slow this clown I think Freak acted perfectly in trying another approach. It is ludicrous to state such summaries can look bad as almost no one sees them except the vandal (especially true if a soft block allowing user creation is used - and I have checked the autoblock logs and <b>no one</b> else has been affected by that block some 6 hours later - and no one will be autoblocked by it either). Also, this particular troll is with AOL he generates new users the immediately creates another one (often not even waiting for the first to be blocked) - and given that a new account was created just moments later he wouldnt have even seen the summary.</dd>

<dd>I am not sure if you are replying to me, but if there was a summary stating "fuck off and die" then its quite juvenile no matter how many times they were blocked before. I realyl don't get your arguement if you are attempting to counter that people should act like adults in order to show Wikipedia as more professional and not discourage others from participating in it. When a location such as this, an official channel on Wikipedia, is reported to have admins, people who are suppose to be helpnig Wikipedia, running around cursing cause they cannot maintain composure, it does not reflect well. I find it odd anyone, any adult at least, would argue that its ok to run aroudn cursing and blow their composure. This is not work and you are a volunteer to this project, just like everyone else, and as a volunteer you should not do anythnig that makes Wikipedia look bad. If you volunteered for Red Cross and ran around cursing and blowing your temper, you would be asked to leave. So again my point is that people should act like adults and "fuck off and die" is not very explanatory nor an educated reaction to a situation. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 15:36, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Glen is right, more context would definitely have been good. In this case I support the block as written.

<dd>This entirely miscontrues the issue. <i><b>Nobody</b></i> is giving ANY "sympathy" to the blocked user. No one disagrees with <i>issuing</i> the block to the slightest degree. However, if you think that "fuck off and die" is <i>ever</i> a good way to communicate you are seriously mistaken. No matter how annoying someone is, sinking to that level just makes the situation worse all around. Calling such an acceptable form of "trying another approach" or "escalating response" is dead wrong. It's inherently detrimental and there is just no reason for it. Making excuses about 'oh but they deserved it' or 'why are you taking their side' are either complete failures of understanding or deliberate avoidance. It doesn't <i>matter</i> how much 'they deserved it'... <b>doing</b> it is bad for Wikipedia.

Mr. Carnildo, who has yet to overcome a presumption that he is a paid sock-puppet [wiki-shill; rent-a-shill] for Robert G. Davis, the attorney in fact for United Services Automobile Association, commits perjury several times in his report (below).</p>
<p>First: the "threat" which Mr. Carnildo theatrically refers to is <a href="http://67.55.35.135/wikipedia/carnildo/ltr_rjk_to_carnildo_30_sep_06.pdf" class="external text" title="http://67.55.35.135/wikipedia/carnildo/ltr_rjk_to_carnildo_30_sep_06.pdf" rel="nofollow">this letter</a>.</p>
<p>And the principal bolded italicized paragraph of the letter reads as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><b>I am writing to find out from you (perhaps after you have identified yourself and disclosed any conflicts you may have in this matter) exactly how I can arrangefor the encyclopedic history of True v USAA and thereferences to the pertinent documents to be "articled" on Wikipedia.</b></i></li>
</ul>
<p>The letter does go on to explain that the cloud of apparently USAA-financed and USAA-directed Wikipedia administrators who hover over the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAA_01b4.html" title="USAA">USAA</a> and <i><b>instantaneously revert</b></i> any edits, <i><b>by anybody</b></i>, which point out either that <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Services_Automobile_Association_8d5b.html" title="United Services Automobile Association">United Services Automobile Association</a> is <i><b>unincorporated</b></i> or that True v United Services Automobile Association is a law suit which will bring about the collapse of USAA (and the loss to members of billions of dollars) serve only to <i><b>intimidate</b></i>. If that initimidation is carried out <i><b>in concert</b></i> and <i><b>in a centrally controlled manner</b></i>, with the principal purpose of intimidating so ad to suppress constitutionally protected free speech about facts - then several Federal Laws have been violated.</p>
<p>The principal mathematical and inescapable proof that a conspiracy is taking place is the repeated used of a group of USAA-financed wiki-shills who gang-up to revert an article: this means that the individual author quickly runs up against the 3-revert rule - while the USAA-financed gang of wiki-shills gets away scott-free.</p>

<p>Now listen - and listen carefully: Robert G. Davis's <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Services_Automobile_Association_8d5b.html" title="United Services Automobile Association">United Services Automobile Association</a> is either incorporated or unincorporated. That is a fact which can be ascertained, conclusively, by any reasonably competant researcher.

<p>Could an admin with Checkuser access please help me provide his University his IP address and other pertient information, as I am making a complaint through that channel. I believe I've tracked down his University, but he might also use an ISP so we need to be sure, and the IP address will help the University (University of Ontario Institute of Technology) track him down, because his felony criminal actions online are strictly against their network fair use rules. And if he does use an ISP, I don't think their fair use policies include death threats either (see above for the whole case, or Sahands. I can be e-mailed at jkorkala@gmail.com on this. I do not wish the hell of a full blown police investigation on him (at least yet) so I'm trying to go through the ISP channels to make sure he will not continue this kind of online criminal activity. That is why I will need some help from the administration here. I have made a checkuser request on metawiki as well, not being sure which is the right place.</p>
<p>This checkuser request is based on Wikipedia privacy policy section 5 and fullfills it's requirements.

<dd>First off, I'm trying to centralize this discussion. The two or three of you jumping from page to page and user talk page to user talk page is downright annoying.

I'll repeat what I said recently: I see no evidence - yet - that <span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> (<a href="../../../t/e/c/User_talk%7ETecmobowl_35a4.html" title="User talk:Tecmobowl">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tecmobowl_44ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tecmobowl">contribs</a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">page moves</font></a> • <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Tecmobowl_abbf.html" title="Special:Blockip/Tecmobowl">block user</a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">block log</font></a>)</span> is a sock of Spotteddogsdotorg or DisplacedBrit.

<dd>Yes, please. Everyone just chill out. wknight is right: there's no need for claims of sockpuppetry with no evidence. Don't you understand, when you get so paranoid that you start lashing out at other editors, claiming they're socks with no evidence you are playing right into the puppetmaster's hands? It's clear from D.B.'s last post that he <i>wants</i> CFIF to be paranoid, randomly tagging people's pages as sockpuppet accounts so CFIF will get blocked.

<p>There is no convincing evidence at present that Tecmobowl is a sock. For a start, it would require him to be acting in concert with at least one other account to cause false impressions on the relevant talk pages. I don't see that happening.

(It probably should have been a month rather than 48 hours.) The only contraversial thing I've done (other than not blocking him for long enough) is that I've blocked his IP for the same length of time. I suggest the IP be blocked, including blocking user creation, for at least 6 months.

<dd>I'm extending the block to an indefinite one. Bypassing a ban and continuing the same behaviour is <i>not</i> acceptable. His editing behaviour is extremely sketchy and simliar to the banned user, and his name is similiar. If he has evidence to the contrary, he can voice it with an {{unblock}}. Adding false (but reasonable sounding) material to articles is very distruptive. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">talk</a>) 06:45, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And yeah, I'm now aware that the user is no longer indef-blocked on the other account. However, creating a new account could essentially constitute trying to unfairly clear his name, and it's also clear that he is not willing to undergo reform.

<p>This doesn't seem like the best place for this issue but I can't find a more fitting one, even after scouring the Request for Comment pages. So, if this is best moved, please tell me.</p>
<p>That said, here's the situation (omitting specific names unless given the ok to add them later): I've come to learn recently that an editor's real job probably makes it impossible for him to objectively edit articles that he has been the primary editor of. In other words, he's attempting to fill a sort of arbiter position on a couple of controversial topics that have been the subject of past editing wars, when his real employment should likely disqualify him from doing so.</p>
<p>I don't know how to give the additional elaboration that this specific situation seems to require without revealing more than might be allowed, so I'll wait for guidance before elaborating.--<a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECave_Bovum_cfdf.html" title="User:Cave Bovum">Beware of Cow</a> 09:02, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
