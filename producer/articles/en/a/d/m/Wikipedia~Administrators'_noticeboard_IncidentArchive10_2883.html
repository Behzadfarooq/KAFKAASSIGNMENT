<p>The last few minutes I've been blocking and cleaning up after a vandal from New Zealand who ignored my initial request to stop vandalism. Since then he's shown up under similar IPs (two of them vandalizing Jimbo's user page.

<li>Before anyone looks at the history and think I violated, I did not. I revert to the redirect version two times, but then made two edits taking the template in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ASisterproject&amp;diff=10770325&amp;oldid=10769887" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ASisterproject&amp;diff=10770325&amp;oldid=10769887" rel="nofollow">new direction</a>. Itai's fourth revert stands, since I didn't want to take any chances until this was posted. If anyone likes the new usage, feel free to revert to it. About the personal attacks in the edit summaries, I would think that alone also calls for a block of some additional time. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 18:11, 2005 Mar 4 (UTC)</li>

<dd>12 hours. Personal attacks are slightly irrelivant to the 3RR since admins do not have the power to block for them. You were edit waring Netoholic your tactics were straight out of how to push someone to break the 3RR 101.

<dd>That's bold. The pages are fine for days, and then Itai comes in and pushed through his versions. I revert, and you say I am edit warring. What am I to do? Each time he returns, I leave notes on his user talk: and the other talk: pages. I also offer new suggestions and fully document the reasons for my edits. What <i>more</i> can I do? I cannot file an RfC because I am not aware of anyone that wants to co-sign. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 19:05, 2005 Mar 4 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And another page move vandal, and to add to the fun he replaced his userpage with a direct redirect to the Main page of the kr: wikipedia, which he defaced (abusing RickK's name) with a goatse-style collage. Still cleaning up his mess, keep out a look.

<dd>Back in those heady days of June 2004 when we fought the vandalbots as valiantly as we could, didn't the developers impose a temporary threshold for page moves -- accounts had to be at least 1 months old and have x number of edits, or something along those lines? If so, perhaps we can propose to reinstate that threshold on a permanent basis? Certainly the page movers (good old Willy on Wheels comes to mind) are our most disruptive vandals. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 00:36, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rhobite, Silsor, I was under the mistaken impression that <a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIrate_d7f6.html" title="User:Irate">User:Irate</a> had renamed the actual <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> article to Jiunkrn Ireland; instead what he had done was to rename the little-used redirect <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland_013e.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a> to that nonsensical name, apparently for the purpose of stealthily nominating it for a speedy-deletion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>So that was why I "flexed my muscles" with a very strongly-worded warning and threat to block, because although any page-move vandalism is still page-move vandalism, it would have been much more serious to do it on a highly-visited article page than on a little-used redirect page.</p>
<p>I originally took this to the /Incidents page because User:Irate was extraordinarily combative — it's not often that a neutrally-worded message on someone's talk page get an immediate "cretins like you" response.</p>
<p>The talk page record is preserved here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Irate&amp;oldid=10884508" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Irate&amp;oldid=10884508" rel="nofollow">User_talk:Irate</a> ("Cathedral names" section) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Curps&amp;oldid=10884551" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Curps&amp;oldid=10884551" rel="nofollow">User_talk:Curps</a> ("Stop vandalising" section).</p>

<p>A poster by the name of AndyL has consistently inserted misleading and disparaging information into this article and has petitioned Jaing to lock it until the issue is resolved. I do not believe it can be resolved because he has shown that his agenda is to provide slanderous, POV information into the article.</p>
<p>For example: He has stated as a matter of factly that the Lehi faction was inspired by Italian fascism and Spanish nationalism. This is hardly the truth as Lehi has different streams, some corporatist some socialist. It was a movement very hard to pinpoint.</p>
<p>Secondly, he has deleted crucial information about the split of the Revisionist movement within Israel and the Diaspora and the fact that Jabotinksy did not have any control over the Irgun faction. He doesnt seem to be interested in historical accuracy and most of his information comes from left wing websites, but he cites outragous and hotly disputed statements as facts.</p>

<p>A vandal, obviously annoyed by our anti-spam list (see the deleted version of his user page), created many articles containing nothing but a redirect to the infamous <a href="../../../a/u/t/Image%7EAutofellatio.jpg_1467.html" title="Image:Autofellatio.jpg">Image:Autofellatio.jpg</a>. As he obviously found hole in mediawiki (see <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656" rel="nofollow">Bugzilla 1656</a>) these redirects don't show up in the "what links here", and one is directly directed to the image without any "redirect from" message. Due to the second I accidently deleted the image, thinking I delete the redirect. IMHO this porn image does not need to be resurrected (I cannot do that anyway) and the drawing from commons is better, but as I remember quite a discussion about it I think I should note my mistake here. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 11:40, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Snowspinner, when dealing with what you consider troll behaviour, it is important to maintain your equanimity and the moral high ground; otherwise your actions as an administrator are apt to become the issue, and distract attention from the behaviour that you were attempting to deal with. As a result of your action, other administrators now have a more complex situation to deal with. For one thing, there is nothing in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Blocking policy</a>, so far as I can see, that sanctions a block in this case, and if there is, there is nothing that sanctions a 7 day block. The nearest section that could apply is "Disruptive behaviour", and the policy calls for a 24 Hour block in that case. It is somewhat a matter of interpretation whether following RickK around even qualifies as disruptive behaviour. I sypathize with your motivation, but it would have been much better to go through the RfC/RFAr process. You might wish for a less tedious process, but that is the process we have. If you consider Mr Recycling to be a troll, the prime advice is "Do not feed the trolls", and I'm afraid you have rather transgressed against that advice. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:55, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The previous 24 hour block clearly did not penetrate through The Recycling Troll's skull and into his consciousness in any form that affects his behavior. It seems that more force is necessary. If this is against the letter of the blocking policy, I can only say that common sense suggests that when a user shows up, has "troll" in their name (Which, while not in and of itself a reason to block, is still not insignificant), goes straight to the mailing list with his complaint, and follows RickK around, we are not dealing with a good editor. The question is whether to dither around debating the obvious, or to just shoot.</dd>

<dd>I think a week is too long. His behaviour is disruptive and he knows it, (there has been discussion on the mailing list, so snowspinner's block hasn't come out of the blue) Also he is not new. So let's not start escalating blocks beyond what policy allows. If one 24 hour block doesn't get the message through, then we try anonther (and another, and another). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(ask the rotten)</a> 06:38, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How about waiting till s/he does something that is against current policy?

He has also in this time done a lot of useful work in the Wikipedia namespace, not the least of which is his VfD participation. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:31, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm very confused by all of this. I know that an admin can, on his or her own, block an obvious vandal, permanently block an account with an inappropriate name, etc. However, I thought that pretty much anything else was supposed to go through the process of RfC, mediation, and arbitration, and that admins were simply supposed to enforce decisions once they have been reached. In practice, it seems to me that a lot of admins are behaving as judge and jury, and—what really worries me—doing so in cases in which they are personally involved. I don't know if we have a specific rule about that, but I would expect the same principle to apply to blocks over behevior as the one that says you don't protect an article on which you are an active editor. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:45, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I very strongly agree with Jmabel that you <b>should not</b> block users in cases where you are personally involved. Rick did the right thing, he could have blocked the RT himself, but that would have been wrong. Instead he brought up the issue here, so it is in the open, and we can form a consensus on the case <i>as a group</i>. We <i>do</i> have the authority to block disruptive users for up to a <s>week</s> month. Let us <i>use</i> this power, where it seems to improve the operation of WP. I do believe that admins dealing out this maximum "court martial" penalty should have some experience of precedent cases, so they can make an estimation whether their block is in line with the practice approved of by other admins. I propose that it should be made <i>binding policy</i> that admins should not use their power in disputes to which they are a party. But as long as the matter is brought up here, in the open, and people decide to act, I see nothing wrong in that. Of course, if there is disagreement and unblocking, the blocking admin should stand down and wait for other opinions. In the present case, I have no problem with the block. If the RT is a bona-fide user, he can <i>discuss</i> and try to explain how his behaviour is motivated. As long as he just stubbornly annoys Rick without arguing that he just happens to have opposite views, and that it's not really to do with Rick at all (go figure), I think we are justified in dealing with him as a troll. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 07:55, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>
<dd>ah, blocking policy on disruption has, <i>"such blocks should initially last 24 hours, but repeat violators may be blocked for a maximum of one month."</i>, so one week is not even the maximum. Arguably, Snowspinner could have gone from one to two days first, but a week does not seem excessive after the user had been blocked for a day already, and did not seem to have reconsidered his behaviour. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 08:04, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>This guy is obviously getting on Rick's nerves, which is bad, but he's also going around making (what I understand to be) valid edits after Rick, so I guess he is improving the encyclopedia in his own way. I'm reluctant to condemn that. I don't want Rick to be deliberately irritated by anybody, but this guy's behavior seems so utterly harmless and maybe even beneficial that I really don't see how it warrants a week's block. Surely the two can work out whatever differences they might have. There is no need for punitive measures when honest discussion could produce a better result. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:29, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>A random check of article edits shows that almost all of his "valid edits" are adding a few wiki links -- most of which, admittedly, lead to actual articles. The only actual editing I came across in my (admittedly incomplete) survey was changing Rickk's "...which had a claimed membership of 15,000" to "...which claimed a membership of 15,000 people". I'm not seeing any real editing here. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 08:45, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Calton, I think that's a bit of a harsh claim - there are many users whose primary contribution is to fix links and grammar. They do seem like good changes, and I don't think we can block people for the types of edits they make. Looking at it, I really think that we should probably be able to put up with someone systematically going through our edits and 'checking' them. If the edits s/hes making are constructive, then I really don't think theres any reason to block a user for doing that. Yes, it's annoying, but really, if it were Rick 'checking' this users edits, I don't think there'd be this outcry. As for voting on vfd, I don't think there can be any rule about how people do this. If some wierdo wants to go through my votes and vote against them, they pretty much can (many do in fact!). Let's try to separate being annoyed by it, and what will actually improve the encyclopedia. As far as I can see this user has done nothing but improve it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Richards_3ae7.html" title="User:Mark Richards">Mark Richards</a> 11:21, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's get this one straight. He can be banned because RickK doesn't like him and his votes should be ignored because he doesn't agree with RickK? I nearly always vote opposite to RickK, because he is a deletionist and I want the encyclopaedia to be inclusive. I don't resent him for it; I just think he's misguided. I know he doesn't like me too. Should I be banned for that? There's definitely something in the air here -- I note you have expressed it on your talk page although you withdrew it -- that admins are something other than just editors with mops, but have become an ungovernable moral force, untouchable and inviolable. RickK is very popular with a certain sort of user here and very unpopular with others. He reacts to the latter with anger and disdain. I don't think you should be encouraging that. Perhaps <i>his</i> votes should be disregarded for opposing <i>them</i>. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 01:39, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Theresa - how do you know they are bad faith? I really am not sure I see the issue here. Many people frequently vote against me on vfd, and, to be honest, I wouldn't have a particular problem if an editor appeared to vote against me on principle. That's why it is 'votes' for deletion. If someone wants to use their vote to express an opinion that others find strange, then that's how it is. The user seems to be making good edits, and I don't think there is any good reason to discount their votes. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Richards_3ae7.html" title="User:Mark Richards">Mark Richards</a> 12:30, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>has he even commented on his behaviour in a reasonable way? Valid editors can be expected to <i>communicate</i> and to justify their edits if challenged.

<p>Erm? That's a novel idea - I don't think any of the people blocking has asked him. I have to tell you, a lot of my irritation around this issue relates to admins simply not following the policies we have in place on blocking.

<dd>um, look, I'm not an expert on this case, but it looks like there was <i>some</i> exchange. RickK asked RT on his talk page and apparently got some reply along the lines of "I have to check your edits". There is the <i>disruption</i> policy. Yes, blocks based on that will be controversial, but we <i>need</i> it. We need to be able to use common sense as to who is just trying to take the piss out of people (a.k.a. trolling). Policy allows block ranging up to one month. At the moment we are looking at a week's block. I do not think any admin has violated policy here. It is very important that new users are approached assuming good faith. But it usually becomes clear <i>very soon</i> whether this assumption was justified. New users whose first edits consists of blanking articles or inserting BUSH IS A PRICK should maybe (no, probably!) not even initially be approached with this assumption. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 12:31, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>I agree with Mark Richards that this sends a very bad message, undermining most of what people keep saying about the status and role of administrators. On Wikipedia there are people being "annoyed" by, and annoying each others, left and right. Wikipedia is not a venue where people are especially civil to each other (does this news come as a surprise to anyone?), and there are disputes all over the place, including a lot of troll, and troll-like behaviour. It is an annoying place, and you better have a high threshold for being annoyed. Almost nothing is done about it. If one wants to try to do something about it, the process is long and torturous, and many of the people who use the process are the guilty parties gaming the system or semi-trolls (sometimes not so semi-) who like conflict and who are using the dispute resolution process to be even more annoying. Most people don't bother, and just develop a thick skin. Now we have a case where someone is doing something which is tame in comparison to a lot of what goes on, and because the "target" is an administrator and has friends who are administrators, the guilty party is blocked for a week, the week being justified apparently because the person in question is a "serial annoyer". There is no clear rule which even defines what is illegitimate about this behaviour. Is it policy that you cannot edit the same articles as another member in case you annoy him? We have many administrators and other volunteers monitoring the edits of newbies, and other suspect individuals, etc, and if the they find this annoying, it is too bad. Are administrators immune to being monitored? Can any Wikipedia member who finds another member "annoying" have that person banned for being disruptive? If you are a regular member, here is the message: develop a thick skin because not much will be done to keep people from annoying you. But make sure you don't do anything to annoy any administrators who don't have thick skins, because if you do you will be whacked. How does that square with: administrators are just servants of the community; they are janitors, the mop and bucket brigade? Etc.

<p>Look. He's been on the mailing list, howling at the abusive admins, claiming that they think checking other users' edits is harassment, and generally making straw men out of anything that moves. He's adopted an editing style designed to piss people off. And you want to wait for a policy violation? This is clearly not a stupid troll. If we tell him he's allowed to stalk and harass RickK but nothing else, he will be perfectly content to stalk and harass RickK. This is not a reasonable outcome. And just because the arbcom is now capable of closing cases does not mean every piece of disruption and idiocy that we are able to find something to debate about needs to go to them. They are <b>a</b> way of dealing with problem users. They are not <b>the</b> way, and this problem absolutely does not need to escelate to them when we have perfectly reasionable tools like big sticks that we can whack the problem with until it fixes itself.</p>

<p>Dab, my point is that even if RT is a troll, which seems very likely to me, the way to deal with trolls is not to let them provoke you into violating your own procedures and policies. In this case Snowspinner has taken a step which makes his own behaviour an issue. His response to provocation is more questionable than the provocation. No matter how sensible a policy is, trolls will find a boundary along which they can tread to be provocative without violating rules or policies. In this case, members monitoring others they find questionable is standard operating procedure on the Wikipedia. RT is doing nothing different from what administrators and others routinely do. The only difference is that he has picked on RickK, who is an administrator and a tad excitable, hoping to provoke an overreaction. In this case, RickK actually has kept his temper pretty well, to his credit. But Snowspinner has stepped in and blown it, giving RT what he wants (presuming that he is a troll). Trolls always go after the administrators, the moderators, etc, and the hot-heads. If they can find a moderator who is a hothead, all the better. The key with trolls, the advice in Wikipedia's article on the subject <a href="../../../t/r/o/Wikipedia%7ETrolls_b5e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Trolls">Wikipedia:Trolls</a> is: do not feed the trolls. That is, do not let them provoke you into a reaction that gives them attention and by making you look bad, sets them up for getting more attention. Certainly don't let them provoke you into an action that widens cracks in the community: such as suspicions that the administrators of the site are a "cabal", etc. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:26, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, it is only a 7 day block. He'll be back in 7 days, unless someone unblocks him sooner. He has already been protesting his blocking on the mailing list, and David Gerard has been provoked into blocking from the list. When he comes back, he will no doubt continue to protest his blocking and find other ways to be provocative. Since there is no policy against doing anything that he is doing, it basically looks like administrators are picking on someone who (1) has the audacity to have "troll" in his username; (2) is "annoying" to some administrators; and (3) protests when administrators single him out for discipline without good justification. This makes administrators look heavy-handed and more concerned about people who annoy administrators than about other behaviour problems. Other people who feel victimized have to go through a tedious process to have misbehaviour sanctioned, a process that also exposes their own behaviour to scrutiny. But administrators don't have to bother with that -- they can just impose a sanction directly, and apparently unilaterally. It looks like administrators are first-class citizens, and that everybody else is a second-class citizen. At this point, it would be better to just ban the RT account entirely because administrator mistakes have set this person up to be a real troublemaker when he comes back. I would suggest that this be done by the Arbitration Committee, however. It would have been much better to have ignored him and to have maintained the moral high ground until he did something truly objectionable. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:11, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BM is completely right. This user has not actually done anything wrong, and the responses to his (albiet annoying) behavior has ranged from blocks that breach policy through abuse and attacks. No one has given a coherent reason for why s/he should be blocked. This is making a mockery of the admins involved since they do look like they are more interested in protecting a cabal from being annoyed than anything else. Had people simply had the common sense to leave well enough alone untill / unless s/he did something actually disruptive, s/he would have got quickly bored with this and moved on. As it is, it has socked up a lot of time and energy, and resulted in the administration looking heavy handed and stupid. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Richards_3ae7.html" title="User:Mark Richards">Mark Richards</a> 17:08, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My interest is straightforward. RickK was bothered. RickK was, quite frankly, reasonably bothered. I say this as someone who has been cyberstalked - it is scary, it is unpleasant, and it is upsetting. A reasonable person would be bothered by being stalked.

<dd>I'd say it was the appropriate question originally, and I suggested to Snowspinner before this started that the normal dispute resolution process would be a better approach. Unfortunately, I think it's a little late to get that genie back into the normal bottle, so I'm not sure what the question is we should be asking now.

<p>Michael, thanks for agreeing with me, but what I'm asking for is an explanation (from someone who <i>disagrees</i>) as to either where I misunderstand policy, or why this required exceptional handling.

<p>I have to laugh. Netoholic is all upset that I'm disrupting Wikipedia because I'm making minor changes to the articles he's editing.

<li>Rick, if that's a response to my question, I don't see the relevance.

<p>Again, I don't wish to gain a reputation for being obstreperous, but this "hard ban" concerns me greatly. My questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can any administrator simply draw the conclusion without consultation or review by anyone that a particular account is a banned user?
<ol>
<li>Yes. The very reason that they are admins is becasue they are trustred to make judgement calls.</li>

<li>Why is David Gerard dodging the legitimate request for the evidence supporting his conclusion? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:48, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ol>
<li>He's not dodging it. The evidence is in the edit history of 142.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In what capacity is David Gerard operating here? Presumably, he is operating as a regular administrator, since Arbitrators have no special powers except <i>en banc</i>. If so, by what authority can a regular administrator permanently hard ban an established member of Wikipedia? Can any of the 400+ administrators do this, or does David Gerard have some special status?
<ol>
<li>A regular administrator. No only jimbo can hard ban people. He has hard banned 142. Administrators are expected to enforce this ban though. They are expected to block any account who in thier judgement is 142.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If any regular administrator can do this, then why do we have an Arbitration Committee?

Can any administrator do that, or does it just come down to raw power and who can get away with what? Are there any other God-Kings besides Jimbo and Mr Gerard that I should know about?

Is not an administrator who does that responsible at least to produce, when asked for it, the evidence he relied on to conclude that an account was an reincarnation?

<p>I respectfully disagree with anyone contending that The Recycling Troll is a reincarnation of the user who edited as 24/142.177.xxx.xxx/EntmootsOfTrolls. I think I can fairly claim to be quite familiar with much of this banned user's history and unique style of interaction, and I have blocked a number of his accounts in the past.</p>
<p>It seems that The Recycling Troll's posts to the mailing list are cited as being similar in style to 24/142/EoT. I have reviewed every one of those posts, and find very little to suggest that they are the same. Moreover, the mere fact of posting to the mailing list is strong evidence in my mind that they are not the same, because to my knowledge 24/142/EoT strictly avoided the mailing lists apparently as a matter of principle. What similarity exists is simply a generic similarity found in the postings of many users who have been blocked for disruptive behavior (i.e., professing complete ignorance of how anyone could possibly be disturbed by their actions, immediate escalation of rhetoric about abuse, etc.). The additional similarity of choosing a user name containing the word "troll" has also been tried by others besides 24/142/EoT, so it is hardly definitive.</p>
<p>If The Recycling Troll is attempting to imitate 24/142/EoT beyond the homage involved in the choice of name, and I doubt this, then he is a pathetically poor imitation. I do not think he should be blocked on the grounds of being a reincarnation. I decline to comment any further on whether blocks on the general grounds of disruption are justified at this point, and will defer to whatever outcome is decided on that question. I have reviewed his edits only enough to satisfy myself that this is not 24/142/EoT, but not enough to judge the extent of disruptiveness. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 23:17, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is clear that there is no consensus on this, and every block has been for different reasons. The complete lack of willingness to have any kind of accountability here is very disturbing. Snowspinner blocked him, people protested that the block was in breach of policy and unfair, so a friend of snow blocked him again, listing a different reason, etc. Please follow the procedures, and unblock this user. You are making a mockery of the policy we have, and making admins look like a bunch of cabalistic buddies covering for each other. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Richards_3ae7.html" title="User:Mark Richards">Mark Richards</a> 00:56, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The reason of the moment seems now to be that the user is a sockpuppet, and thus can be blocked on sight. Above, <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">User:Jayjg</a> quoted <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a>, where it indicates that sockpuppets that are created to violate policy can be blocked on sight. Unfortunately, Jayjg did not include the rest of the paragraph. I quote the entire section, since I believe it is relevant and I don't want anyone to take things out of context:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sysops may, at their judgement, block IP addresses that disrupt the normal functioning of Wikipedia. Such disruption is to be objectively defined by specific policies, and may include changing other users' signed comments or making deliberately misleading edits. Users should be warned that they are violating policy before they are blocked. For dynamic IPs, such blocks should last 24 hours. For static IPs and user names, such blocks should initially last 24 hours, but repeat violators may be blocked for a maximum of one month.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sysops may also block new user accounts that make lots of disruptive edits, for any length of time or permanently, at their discretion. Sockpuppets that were created to violate Wikipedia policy should be blocked permanently. However, blocks should not be used against isolated incidents of disruption from IP addresses nor against user accounts that make a mixture of disruptive and useful edits.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Reincarnations of blocked disruptive users will be reblocked if they continue being disruptive, or if they edit in a way which suggests they are likely to continue being disruptive—such as "YOU CANT BLOCK ME!!11!!" or "JOIN ME IN MY FIGHT TO DESTRY WIKIPEDIA!1!!1!!"</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Blocks under this provision are almost always controversial.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>If one considers that the user was disrupting the normal functioning of wikipedia, then according to policy, a maximum block (for repeat violators) is one month.</p>
<p>It is clear that this user made at least <i>some</i> useful edits. Therefore, according to policy, he should not have been blocked as a new disruptive user or as a sockpuppet.</p>
<p>The policy already warns us that this king of block will almost always be controversial -- and the blocking of this user has certainly proved to be that.</p>
<p>I have once again removed the block on this user, since there is at least lack of consensus on this controversial block. This user should not be blocked until a consensus is reached on that block. -<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERholton_b2db.html" title="User:Rholton">Rholton</a> 01:57, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

It seems to me that such a policy would have to require some sort of consensus building before action could be taken against the harasser. -<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERholton_b2db.html" title="User:Rholton">Rholton</a> 02:38, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Such a system might work. Many internet sites have a small number of moderators who can delete posts or, if necessary, ban people for misbehaviour, and most of them do not require that the moderators explain or justify themselves to non-moderators. Such a system has advantages and disadvantages. Actually, Wikipedia used to have this system: Jimbo was the God-King, and nobody could ban established members except for him; and while people could complain about his decisions, nobody could compel him to justify himself if he didn't wish to do so. If Wikipedia wants to return to that system, it can, of course. However, you shouldn't suppose that there would be 400 people roving around as cops/judges, and that every current administrator would have those kind of powers. There would be a few. Consensus that someone could be trusted with janitor/custodian powers would not necessary translate to consensus that someone could be trusted as an enforcer. Most of the current administrators would find themselves demoted back to regular user, or some intermediate janitor-level. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 03:06, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, other sites have those guys. But we don't. Or do we? Can Snowspinner or Dave Gerard just hard-ban anyone they think is a "fuckhead"? Is that the policy? Why don't Snowspinner and Dave Gerard just not involve themselves with "fuckheads"?

<p>Just for the record: I am totally opposed to this block, think it is wrong +++. I have not unblocked, simply to not inflame this all more, since we had already a "revert-war" going.

<dd>I suppose I should also add my voice to those opposed to the block, to further demonstrate that there is no "admin consensus". I also will not unblock the user (I don't know if he or she is presently blocked, anyway), but I don't believe anybody should be blocked unless they have violated policy. Making good edits that happen to make Rick uncomfortable is not a reason to block. Rick himself makes me uncomfortable with the general harshness of his demeanor.

<p>Let's try to keep "he's disruptive" separate from "he's 142". I admit that I would like to see some IP-related <i>plausibility</i> that he is indeed 142. Snowspinner didn't "hard ban" RT, he blocked him for 7 days. David hardbanned him, for different reasons. I defended the week's block as business as usual (unrelated to 142), I take no stance on the indefinite block, pending further evidence. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:00, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>IP-related plausibility that he is 142 was not found. Indeed, the IP evidence leans towards the assertion that he is <i>not</i> 142. See <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.technical/15877" class="external autonumber" title="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.technical/15877" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. No, this is not conclusive evidence, but it certainly does not support the assertion that the user is 142. -<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERholton_b2db.html" title="User:Rholton">Rholton</a> 15:12, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is why I did not include Snowspinner in the Arbitration request. One can argue about what "stalking" is, whether it is "disrupting Wikipedia" as defined in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a>, whether Snowspinner should have imposed a 7-day ban for it, and whether he followed the process called for by the policies. But, unlike the "142 reincarnation" allegation by David Gerard, we all at least know why Snowspinner did what he did. With David's permanent block for "142 reincarnation", we do not know the facts that support it. We are called upon simply to trust his comparison of the 142 edit history with the TRT mails to the mailing list. He won't give details about how he arrived at his conclusion. Neutrality and Cyrius in some ways are even more outrageous: they blocked a user permanently without even having evidence, simply because they trusted the say-so of another user. I don't think administrators should be blocking people unless they have seen the evidence themselves and have formed their own opinions. Groups of administrators acting in concert in a blocking war because they "trust" each other is cabalism. Administrators should be trying to serve the consensus not trying to force through the decisions of other administrators that they "trust". That two of these three were Arbitrators just adds to this concern. At this point, my suspicion is that the evidence was so weak that David is embarassed to produce it. He has already conceded earlier on this page that Michael Snow is correct in denying any connection between 142 and TRT, meaning that whatever the evidence was, David now concedes that he drew the wrong conclusion from it. This must be embarassing for Neutrality and Cyrius. It looks like they shouldn't be so quick to block people based on "trusting" David in the future. But I doubt that will occur to them. I note also that TRT is still blocked. At least, the expiry date should be changed to 7 days, on the basis of the "stalking" charge, which is the only one still standing. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:23, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One might say "this is not a democracy ... its feudalism" Or one might say "this is not a project to make wiki software; its a project to make a free encyclopedia". Of course, a free encyclopedia project can have a variety of forms of governance, and there is no obvious contradiction involved in being *both* a free encyclopedia project and a democracy. So "this is not a democracy .. its a free encylopedia" is a non-sequitur. Interesting that a non-sequitur is one of Jimbo's favorite expressions: one that rather begs the question as to what the governance system of Wikipedia actually is. After his pronouncement on the Arbitration case, I am not sure I could say what is the governance system of Wikipedia, except it obviously isn't democracy. Not that I was very clear on it before. The cabalism theory is looking more likely right at present, if you want to know. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:55, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Then there is Wikipedia the physical plant, name, etc which all belong to the Wikimedia Trust, and that is run by the Board of Trustees.

<dd>Ignoring the particulars of this case (which I admit are a bit troubling, though I'm not yet convinced this is the crisis some are suggesting it is), I think, BM, you're too hasty in calling Jimmy's comments a <i>non sequitur</i>. I think it's relatively clear from the general tone of his overall remarks that he's not implying there is a logical inconsistency in being a democracy and a free encyclopedia (how could such a remark be confidently made?). Rather, I take from his remarks that he is saying that our desire to be democratic and even-handed should not interfere with this project's true goals, and that, where there is a real conflict between democratic principle and protecting this site's goal to be an accurate and reliable source of encyclopedic information, democracy loses. I'm fine with that. I'm just not convinced that this is one of the occasions where there is, in fact, a real conflict -- I believe there was likely a more patient and democratic solution to the problem that did not significantly impact the ability of Wikipedia to continue its progress towards being the encyclopedia I (and most if not all of us) want it to be. If people here really are convinced that Wikipedia cannot be a truly free encyclopedia unless it is also perfectly democratic in nature....I'd say the line in the sand has been drawn, and like it or not, I doubt Jimmy will budge on that general principle. But if you simply feel that it is arguable whether or not <b>this</b> was a time to abandon democratic policy in order to preserve the project's aims, then I feel confident Jimmy will be open to dialogue on the topic. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 23:33, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not an unheralded precedent at all, in any way. Jimbo may already take any ArbCom decision he feels he should. Furthermore, this one was a case against an arbitrator - and both the original complainant (BM) and several others agreed it would be difficult for this case to be heard by the ArbCom and that escalating it may be appropriate. So no miraculous manifestation that defies science has occurred; Jimbo sorting problems out and determining who's being a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" class="extiw" title="m:Don't_be_a_dick">dick</a> is entirely according to existing policy and guidelines.

<p>I am very relieved that Jimbo decided to take this upon himself. It probably was the only way to achieve a satisfactory conclusion. I am also satisfied that TRT was banned by Jimbo. I am convinced that, if there had been some mechanism employed to gain consensus on the block on the user, TRT would have been banned with little controversy.</p>
<p>There are some questions that came up during or as a result of the conversation that remain unanswered. Now that the urgency of the situation is diminished, let's take the time to discuss some of these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a request for arbitration is brought against a member of the arbitration committee, should there be special handling?</li>
<li>Is there some way we can avoid a recurrence of this rather ugly dispute? Obviously, we cannot universally ignore any action by an admin that appears to be contrary to policy. At the same time, admins need to be able to use common sense in some circumstances. We don't want a repeat of this controversy every time that happens.</li>
<li>Do we need to consider some policy that directly addresses wiki-stalking?</li>

<dd>Arbitrators have been parties to cases several times before (I know I have been, at least twice if I recall correctly). It's never been that controversial -- Arbitrators aren't a close-knit community. Or at least, I think if you posed any Wikipedia policy question to mav, Fred Bauder, sannse, and Raul 654, you'd get 4 very different answers. So I don't see that the AC is particularly biased towards its own. I agree that your 2nd and 3rd questions are important to address, though. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 01:47, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems that there are a few senior admins who think that dealing with probable trolls like TRT is so time-critical that the policies that have been established by consensus must be swept aside in the interests of time. I think they are quite reasonable policies, and that if they impose any inconvenience on an administrator intent on disciplining another member, it is only a slight one, of no long-run consequence, and that there are more situations where that inconvenience is desirable than otherwise. In the case of TRT, whose trolling was relatively tame, there was no need for a big rush to banish him. It was just impatience and hot tempers. The policies could have been easily followed and consensus developed to block him in the usual way; the administrators in question simply thought the policies too much bother. If he had been a more dangerous troll, and it had been time-critical to eject him, and our policies interfered with dealing with him expeditiously, then Jimbo could have been called in to deal with him. (In the actual event, he was called in anyway.) People will accept that there is one God-King who can circumvent policies at need; 400+ administrators with their fingers on the blocking trigger thinking that they can circumvent policies is chaos. Misbehaving users, including trolls, need to be handled in a way that preserves the structures and norms that we all work under. If those are weakened, content-creation will slow to a crawl as unresolvable disputes proliferate and people leave in frustration. There will always be trolls, and we can't let trolls provoke us into weakening the social system that holds the project together and allows it to progress. If policies can be swept aside to deal with a troll, they can be swept aside in any dispute between an administrator and a good-faith editor. I hoped the Arbitration Committee would at least rebuke the administrators who were holding themselves above the community's policies (although I must admit I had my doubts whether they would.) What happened is that the Arbitrators could not bring themselves to reproach their co-Arbitrators, or apply the policies to them, and found one lame excuse after another to reject the case. These are people who must now sit in judgement of other users' behaviour under the policies that they proved incapable of applying to themselves. Still, the situation obviously was embarassing for them. Jimbo stepped in to end their embarassment. In my opinion, he did it in a way that needlessly weakened the consensus and social sinews of the project, and in the end hurt the project. A slightly annoying troll ended up doing a lot of damage. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:50, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BM, I appreciate your concerns are genuine, but I do think you are mistaken. We do not have "400+ admins on the blocking trigger". We have 400+ admins most of which do not even know each other, and who are likely to disagree on many issues. If an admin acts in bad faith, it is very likely that many other admins will yell at him immediately (or that Ed Poor will decapitate them with the <a href="../../../z/w/e/Zweih%C3%A4nder.html" title="Zweihänder">zweihänder</a> (sorry&#160;:p). Your concerns actually show how far we have advanced on the way of building an "ad-hocracy" (great word!) -- it seems normal now that every case, no matter how obvious or trollish, is dragged through rfc-arbcom, wasting everybody's time. Yes, RT has also managed to waste everybody's time, but that's mainly because you, and others, insisted that it should, thereby proving that if good-faith editors object to something an admin did, it <i>will</i> be an issue. The "slippery slope" argument is just as fallacious here than anywhere else. If we're curt with trolls, this does not in the least imply we'll be curt with anybody of good faith. If you can find us a case where a hot-headed, incivil, but sincere editor has been treated "outside policy", I will pay close attention and take the case seriously. But the fact is that we all have common sense to distinguish between users. I am sorry if you feel that good editors risk being bullied by admins, and I was going to suggest I nominate you for admin yourself, to add a less heavy-handed specimen to the crew, but you seem not to appear in the top 1000 editors-by-number-of-edits yet, so I suggest I'll nominate you as soon as you have &gt;1500 edits to article-namespace. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 07:41, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>A bot with this name created dozens of articles, each with the name of a random floating point number and redirecting to an image of pierced genitalia. He was blocked on sight, but I can think of no reason why he shouldn't try again. We obviously need a way of countering this. In the meantime help with cleanup would be appreciated. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 19:12, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

This is a blatant, and today, example. He makes a controversial edit, then tells others THEY are the ones making a revert war.

<li>he has only racked up 2/3 reverts (depending on exactly how you count it)<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 22:48, 10 Mar 2005

<li>how so? the category "Cities in China" (CiC) was removed at 17:17, 21:22, 21:37, and 21:53. in the middle of this CiC rv war he also added back an improper cat of "dependent territories" at 21:44. (UTC)

<li>the complex revert question again. I prefer not to block in these cases unless I am fairly sure that the user in question is doing to game the 3RR. Other admins think differently<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 23:31, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think you are right these were 4 reverts, slight complex, but nevertheless. I have put a warning onto his talk page and will keep a watch of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macau.html" title="Macau">Macau</a> a further revert will lead to a block - unless osmeone else has already blocked him. Trouble is there are two editors playing this game <a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">User:Huaiwei</a> has done the same (from the opposite side). I have warned him too. The next revert from either side should lead to a block. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 23:24, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was a reversion right enough. And by your comment you only clarify that you <i>are</i> gaming the rules. You (and <a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">User:Huaiwei</a> are both warned. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 23:44, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did not intend to game the rule. When I tried to upload the changes regarding the disambiguation notice, there was an edit conflict. In other words Huaiwei reverted my immediately previous edit. I saved my version of the text and the result was like a revert. I didn't want to hide anything and that's why I added the word revert in the edit summary. I didn't mean to game the rule and I am sorry about that. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 07:39, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Same as above. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">User:Instantnood</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">User:Huaiwei</a> are editwarrring on <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macau.html" title="Macau">Macau</a>.

<ul>
<li>if it matters, I'll note that Isntantnood, not Huaiwei, is purposefully making changes that force others to start reverting him. It's the focus of an RfC. Huaiwei, among others, just push back the POV edits. I know POV etc, aren't the focus of the 3RR board, but context matters when deciding who to block.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are wrong here it does not matter. Context is irrelevant unless there is vandalism. As far as I can determine no one vandalised anything. It is simply that three people can not agree what should be in teh article and what not. Hence I repeat, context is irrelevant. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 00:04, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

He's already caused a 3RR block against him and Adam Carr, and a brief block against Adam for a personal attack over the same issue. Skyring's position is that Australia is a republic and he won't let it go. No editor on the talk page agrees with him, and the issue has been discussed on the mailing list too, where there is also a clear consensus against him; nevertheless, he is now threatening to remove the entire head-of-state section (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGovernment_of_Australia&amp;diff=10999597&amp;oldid=10997874" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGovernment_of_Australia&amp;diff=10999597&amp;oldid=10997874" rel="nofollow">diff</a>).

<dd>We already had several words with him - see <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive9_b665.html#User:Adam_Carr" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive9">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive9#User:Adam Carr</a>. Frankly, if he doesn't violate the 3RR, there's nothing much administrators can do (unless people want us to start acting "arbitrarily" and "undemocratically" and "outside policy"). So file an RFA, I guess. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 01:14, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The user is pushing a POV, but is reasonable. I suggest we sort it out on the talk page. Please note I'm involved in this "dispute". He <i>does</i> have some cogent arguments. It's just a pity most took place on the mailing list. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 01:16, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think recent comments are beginning to fall outside any good definition of "reasonable", though I agree it's not clear exactly what policy they're violating. I've had stern words with the user which I hope will have the necessary impact, but if they don't, all we can really do is be good members of the community -- that is, go to the page, take part in discussions, promote consensus, progress towards the goals of accuracy, reliability, and verifiability. As admins, presumably we're good at that. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 01:50, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
