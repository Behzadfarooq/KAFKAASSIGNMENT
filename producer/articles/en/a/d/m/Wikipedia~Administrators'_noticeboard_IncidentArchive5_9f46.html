<dd>Jake this is yet another desperate attempt by Exploding Boy to wriggle off the hook with respect to the allegation he made that I had created "yet another" sock puppet. First he attempted to claim it was Dr Zen and now as a last ditch desperate move he is claiming it is Robert Blair. Attention is drawn to my request on wikien-l to which Tim Starling replied (on 10 Jan 2005) which linked Robert Blair to the IP range 207.69.13*.* which I subsequently posted to this notice board as evidence of a 3RR breach. There was no response from any of our esteemed sysops. Then I refer to my exchange with the belligerent Exploding Box where I stated that as a sysop he had the connections to establish who was or wasn't a sock puppet. Of course he declined to act (probably on the basis that he did not want to let some facts get in the way of some delightful innuendo). This is of course further evidence of the lack of good faith by EB in these matters. I would then state it once again and clearly that it is entirely within the ability of the people who make these allegations to put this matter to rest in a few minutes. The question that needs to be asked is why it is not. - Robert the Bruce 05:08, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Judging the revert is left to admins' discretion; I will not judge Everyking, since I couldn't care less, but I thought it might help the community to know about this. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 07:35, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Look, this is getting out of hand. How is it fair that someone is just allowed to remove information without consensus yet Everyking is not allowed to put it back? I'd advise that <i>no</i> action be taken here as Everyking has done <i>nothing</i> wrong. Perhaps he's a bit too enthusiastic with his Ashlee Simpson articles, but I think they are by and large of high quality (sure, I put one of his articles on VfD for non-notability, this does not mean that I dislike the other articles!) Please, let's not chase away a good contributor. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 21:44, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is all well and good, but I think the issue is that arbcom ordered that Everyking not be allowed non-vandalism reversions. <i>This means that at present Everyking is not treated the same as other users and may well have done something wrong</i>.<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 01:12, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But I didn't revert anything, so the point is moot. Surely it cannot qualify as a revert if it's discussed on talk and no objections are raised. Perhaps in the technical sense, but certainly not in spirit. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 01:48, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"Revert" has nothing to do with whether or not it has consensus.

<dl>
<dd>That's a rather problematic line of reasoning. That would mean I'm forbidden from ever restoring anything from an older version of the article, even if there's full consensus for it. I very much doubt that was the ArbCom's intent, as that would make it impossible to make compromise edits. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:15, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is exactly the ArbCom's intent, if you want to revert to a previous edit, you'll have to let the others with whom you've reached the compromise (if there aren't any others participating in the compromise it's not much of one) make the revert. If you don't like the ruling, appeal to Jimbo. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 02:18, 2005 Jan 31 (UTC)

<dd>Huh! I guess you read the ruling more thoroughly than me, because I don't remember anything about that. Where does it say all compromise edits must be made by others? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:26, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nowhere, nor did I claim that. I merely said that all compromise reverts must be made by others, which follows logically from the fact that you're not allowed to revert those articles. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 02:32, 2005 Jan 31 (UTC)

<dd>Can it be a compromise and a revert at the same time, Frank? I'm not sure that's possible. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:34, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Revert and consensus are entirely unrelated. Read the definitions. Or don't and keep claiming you're allowed to revert as long as you have consensus, I really don't care, just expect to be blocked if you revert and Ashley Simpsons article again. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 02:43, 2005 Jan 31 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I like the table. It gives a nice comparison of how the album sold in the US and Canada, which is interesting and factual, and for people like me who might not want to wade through massive paragraphs to find it...it's convenient. I don't like that it makes me scroll to the side, however. (Maybe we could cut it at 25 or 20 weeks?) But honestly, this isn't a restoration I'd get too worked up over, John.

<dd>Well, it should probably be converted to run vertically. When it was created, the length wasn't an issue, and I'm just not really savvy enough to undertake the task of changing the format.

<p>What a curious situation. If Robert Blair is not Robert the Bruce then he is not banned from editing. The AC ruling is for Robert the Bruce and his sockpuppets.

<dd>Do self reverts count?They don't normally, but this is hardly a normal situation. Anyway here's an interesting thought- If Blair isn't Bruce, then he will believe he can edit. An admin might believe otherwise and decide to block Blair and his Bruce sockpuppet. Two birds with one or stone (except of course the admin won't know that). Hey Blair might even decide to sacrifice himeself -If he felt that getting Bruce blocked was worth being blocked himself.

<dd>Frazzydee, your assumption of possible accidental 3RR violation is admirable (Good Faith Assumption and all that), but misplaced in this instance.

That I can promise you."</i> TDC 19:41, Oct 29, 2004 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vietnam_Veterans_Against_the_War#Deletions_by_user_TDC" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vietnam_Veterans_Against_the_War#Deletions_by_user_TDC" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> If you look at TDCs last 500 edits, you'll see that well over 50% of them are repeated reverts. His reverts aren't accidental. They are merely a tool he uses in his attempts to bully and frustrate other contributors. -Rob 21:12, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, Administrators. My name is -Rob, perhaps the least anonymous of the unregistered contributors to Wikipedia. I have interacted with many of you. I am the user that first brought TDC's rampant reverts to light on the <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a> page, thus spawning this little discussion here. Right up front, I'd like to say that I don't advocate harsh sanctions against TDC. I certainly wouldn't go as far as agreeing with <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">User:172</a>'s assessment that TDC <i>"is an overall good contributor"</i>, but I will acknowledge that he has made some acceptable edits. A "good contributor" doesn't resort to personal attacks; doesn't resort to personally threatening contributors; doesn't resort to using repetitive unexplained reverts to bully contributors, and, in my opinion, directs his energies toward the goal of producing accurate articles, instead of winning arguments at the expense of Wikipedia. TDC prefers to "work the system" instead of work with editors that have differing viewpoints. Despite all of this, I believe TDC can still make valuable contributions. Wikipedias existence and prosperity depends on contributors, and I see blocking and banning as extreme last resorts if there exists any other way to retain a users constructive input, while also curbing their bad behavior. -Rob 21:12, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>He is indeed persistent when it comes to advocating the changes that he wants made, but it is not hard to compromise with him. Unlike some contributors (like Libertas/Olliplatt), he does not pick fights with users with different POVs as a means to an end. In the end, it is the articles on which he is solely focused. After a couple of harsh exchanges with him myself, I found that once we got down to business we could work together cooperatively and after a while even cordially. It turns out that he has a good understanding of an NPOV product, and that he is quite well read and knowledgeable and capable of contributing a lot of good work to this site. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 22:09, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Admin 172 - you've gotten my goat, as far as your admin responsibilities go. While it is true that you did warn me in the past (In the interest of 'full disclosure' as you stated on your talk page) that you were on amicable relations with User:TDC, I didn't expect you to support disruptive behavior of Wiki editors. Do us all a favor and compare TDC's latest explanations for his reverts on <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Soldier_Investigation_f064.html" title="Winter Soldier Investigation">Winter Soldier Investigation</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_Veterans_Against_the_War_9e2a.html" title="Vietnam Veterans Against the War">Vietnam Veterans Against the War</a> to what actually got reverted. Explain to us just how such reverts (to versions created last year) are justified. The fact that you tend to lock TDC's reverts in place just MINUTES after TDC's edits tend to make me believe you have the articles on a watch list, and you selectively time your protections to coincide with TDCs most recent interactions. If I am mistaken regarding this, I will sincerely apologize to no end... but the facts of the situation are rather obvious. If you still maintain good relations with TDC, perhaps you can persuade him to collaborate on the articles at issue, instead of just revert them ad infinitum to ill effect? -Rob 23:32, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>To Admin 172:</dd>
<dd>You might also consider adding explanations to your Page Protections in the edit summaries, as well as adding your protection efforts to the Protected Page list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protected_page" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protected_page" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. If your intent is to prolong the protections by omitting them from the Protection List, rest assured that I won't let them remain unlisted. If your omission was simple oversight, then consider this a polite reminder of protocol. -Rob 23:54, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The function of protecting pages is to put an end to revert wars while the editors have time to settle their disputes. The time is not right now for listing the page protections because there seem to be no signs that the dispute is anywhere near being resolved. In the meantime, I suggest that you try to work out your diferences with TDC. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 05:18, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The "right time" to list the protections you implement is right when you implement those protections. Rule #4 of the protection policy detailed at <a href="../../../p/p/o/WP%7EPPol_0bed.html" title="WP:PPol">WP:PPol</a> -- perhaps you should review it. Fortunately, other Admins have taken up your slack, at least on the above mentioned articles. As for your strawman insertion of the function of protecting pages, that wasn't an issue. -Rob 20:40, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An appeal to the Administrators from -Rob:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) TDC likes to make ad hominem and personal attacks. For example, he has called me Idiot, Moron, Tard, Liar, and Stupid among other things. He has used the same epithets, and worse, against other editors. Having worked extensively in education with grade-school children, such attacks mean little to me, but I do feel such attacks may contribute to driving some editors away. Is there any way this behavior can be corrected?

<dl>
<dd>To Geni: The wikipedia dispute resolution process has been tried. Ask Theresa Knott. Do you have any other suggestions? As for the mediation portion of this process, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=9718518" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=9718518" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>:</dd>
<dd><i>"As mediation seems to be at the crux of this, I'd just like to note that, as a member of the MC and apparently its future Chair (unless someone decides they want the job), we don't have our act together right now and are unlikely to in the next several weeks. While certainly mediation can occur outside of the MC, I think it's fair to say that right now Wikipedia doesn't have a fully functioning formal mediation process, though it certainly should by this time next month. I don't know if that impacts your decision, but thought you'd want to be aware, at least."</i> Jwrosenzweig 22:35, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>2) TDC likes to cite a single perceived problem in an article, such as an alleged plagiarism or copyright issue, and use that as an excuse to implement a revert to an article version many edits old, thus wiping out factual and legal contributions with which he personally disagrees. He likes to use this tactic on the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Soldier_Investigation_f064.html" title="Winter Soldier Investigation">Winter Soldier Investigation</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_Veterans_Against_the_War_9e2a.html" title="Vietnam Veterans Against the War">Vietnam Veterans Against the War</a> articles in particular, which are currently protected due to his antics. Is there any way this behavior can be corrected?

<dd>3) TDC likes to use subtle deception to achieve his goals. TDC depends of the general apathy and laziness of the Admins to serve his purposes. Take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=8983993&amp;oldid=8983941" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=8983993&amp;oldid=8983941" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> for instance. TDC knows that most of you won't actually click on the source he provided. TDC knows that most of you won't see the subtle mis-quote he has inserted to support his position. It is very subtle, and very devious, but some of us are smart enough to catch what TDC is doing. I challenge you, Admins, to look at the link he provided and compare it to the actual text TDC claims to have retrieved from that source. Do you see the subtle difference? TDC's version would lead you to believe that use of all Public Domain information might be plagiarism, while the <b>actual</b> text of the cited quote clearly states that the use of simple facts doesn't constitute plagiarism at all. TDC obviously hopes you won't notice this extremely subtle mis-quote that he makes. I'd wager, until I pointed it out here, that you didn't notice it. Kudos to TDC on his attempt at pretending to quote a source, but it ultimately failed. Is there any way this deceptive behavior can be corrected? -Rob 23:03, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>There is a "major edit war."</i> Or more accurately, a revert war. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">User:TDC</a>, since October of last year, has done nothing but revert the articles at <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Soldier_Investigation_f064.html" title="Winter Soldier Investigation">Winter Soldier Investigation</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_Veterans_Against_the_War_9e2a.html" title="Vietnam Veterans Against the War">Vietnam Veterans Against the War</a>. No edits, no collaboration, nothing but massive reverts. Have you bothered to look at the edit history?</li>
<li><i>There has been violation of the 3RR rule.</i> Read the top of this page to discover that <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">User:TDC</a> is presently blocked due to violation of the 3RR rule. I do not anticipate that such temporary sanctions as blocking will solve the actual problem. I was asking for more constructive suggestions. Are you suggesting arbcom as the only recourse? And if so, on which (of many) grounds listed above? Veiled threats? Ad hominem and personal attacks? Subtle misquoting? Bullying editors with repetitive reverts? In the end (after sanctions), I fear you'll just end up with an editor that is even more disruptive than before. I was hoping for a more constructive suggestion. - Rob 03:50, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I want to know why CheeseDreams gets away with submitting a request for arbitration (universally rejected by all arbitrators) against Slrubenstein.

<dd>This seems to be a consequence of the refusal of the ArbCom to ban CD from submitting RfAr requests. The logic was that RfAr is a "last line of defense" and if denied to a contributor, makes them vulnerable to abuse without recourse. Consequently, the <i>potential</i> for RfAr abuse exists. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 17:31, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just wanted to note that CD has reposted the request for arbitration because one arbitrator rejected the request Ta bu mentions "with prejudice" (CD interpreted that to mean that the arbitrator was prejudiced against her) and another arbitrator suggested mediation (and mediation was attempted with Slr and CD until CD decided the mediation wasn't proceeding fairly). I don't know how to solve RfAr abuse (Dante's point is well taken) but this kind of thing is really going too far, and we need to have a way of dealing with it in common sense fashion.

<dd>The legal systems of various countries have this same problem, and they have a solution.

We could do a similar kind of thing - say that a "vexatious arbitator" cannot file an RFAr (or an RFC, for that matter) without prior approval from at least one arbitrator, with violation of this stricture to garner a longish block. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 04:19, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This <i>would</i> be the correct place to report <i>if</i> OneGuy was in violation of an arbcom ruling. As it is, the arbcom ruling 168.209.97.34 links to only identifies him with -Iothario-, putting him on "POV parole". OneGuy was "admonished" not to respond to insults in like fare. 168-whatever pursues a long-standing personal feud with OneGuy and is basically just playing the victim here. Since 168-xx is on "POV parole" only for <i>re-inserting</i> material (nice one, arbcom), but not for partial removals resulting in anti-Islamic bias, he is technically not in arbcom-ruling violation either. But, <i>as opposed to</i> OneGuy, who has a wide range of interests, 168's only mission on WP seems to be pushing anti-islamic pov, and giving everybody grief when a more balanced version is restored. As it stands, nobody violated any ruling, so this is best continued on Talk pages.

<dd>You state that the only reason I have to be here is to push anti-Islam related articles. I have asked you several times, without ever a reply, the question: Why do you ignore OneGuy's constant Pro-Islamic POV pushing. Come on, already! READ HIS POSTS!!!! He plays the arbcom against me, and yet when he attacks me if falls on deaf ears. When I point out his POV pushing it simply gets ignored. Dbachmann, please answer this question: "Do you think OneGuy posts Pro-Islamic POV articles?". Answer that honestly, please. OneGuy has started this "war" against ME, not me against him. That is why nobody else complains about me yet this page has a constant stream of complaints against OneGuy, which gets ignored. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168.209.97.34.html" title="User:168.209.97.34">168.209.97.34</a> 14:38, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As requested by 168.209 on my talk page concerning OneGuy's alleged personal attacks, I officially suggested OneGuy should not rise to 168.209's bigoted baiting.

<p>David Gerard, a arbcom member, is personally attacking me after my request that OneGuy be repremanded for making personal attacks on myself. Please see the above where Gerard says "168.209 on my talk page concerning OneGuy's alleged personal attacks, I officially suggested OneGuy should not rise to 168.209's bigoted baiting. As such, OneGuy should snicker at the baiting instead. I hope this satisfies all reasonable parties".</p>
<p>I have tried to reason with Mr Gerard in the past with no luck. I have tried to discuss issues and questions I have on his talk page and he simply replies with a one-line sarcastic remark.</p>
<p>Mr. Gerard claims that I am a bigot and was baiting, but please see <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamophobia_4ec1.html" title="Talk:Islamophobia">Talk:Islamophobia</a> for what I asked. Note that I was not directing my question at OneGuy, OneGuy decided on his own to jump in with his personal insults.</p>

<p>Thanks for the prompt action concerning Cheese Dreams. Now, I just found this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cultural_and_historical_background_of_Jesus&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=9830724" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cultural_and_historical_background_of_Jesus&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=9830724" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, a wholesale rewriting of the Cultural and historical background of Jesus article deleting everything I ever wrote, and accompanied by this explanation (as it were): "(Can you check this Clare? I'm still not sure this is quite right, but can you leave it until you come round for dinner on wednesday this time?.)" Clare = CheeseDreams (I know this because someone once left a message for her on her user page, calling her Clare). So I am guessing that this user is not a sock puppet -- but it is clearly a friend and it seems that s/he is in effect helping Cheese Dreams get around the ban. I reverted, but if this happens again I can easily see myself tempted to violate the 3 revert rule; I also hesitate to protect the page, not just because I have been involved in the dispute but because people of good will should be allowed to work on it.

<p>A couple of notes. About a week ago, I indefinitely blocked all of the CheeseDreams sockpuppets I could find. I felt this was the best response after CheeseDreams ignored her 8 day ban. Otherwise, it would force admins to hunt down 6-7 accounts every time she gets herself blocked. She's already wasted enough of everyone's time. Dante Alighieri later unblocked all of CheeseDreams's sockpuppets because he felt that these blocks were not supported by the ArbCom's decision. I think that it's common sense to block any other permutations of the name which CD creates, but apparently some people disagree with me. CheeseDreams has at least seven sockpuppets which I've seen, all of them slight permutations of "CheeseDreams", and all of them have been used to evade a legitimate block at some point. Several of them were used today to evade her current block.</p>

<dd>Just to make things clear, I objected to the banning indefinitely of all of CD's sockpuppet accounts with the stated reasoning being the ArbCom ruling. I did NOT object to banning any accounts which CD used to evade a ban with the rationale of the Sockpuppet "rule". I even suggested that they be rebanned, but with a proper rationale... no one did this. All this is aside from the fact that a rotating IP makes true enforcement impossible and the fact that CD can easily create COUNTLESS more variations (I think <a href="../../../c/h/3/User%7ECH3353DR34M5_28ad.html" title="User:CH3353DR34M5">User:CH3353DR34M5</a> is still available) makes it seem a bit silly to get worried about any specific sockpuppet account... especially given that CD isn't perma-banned. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 00:43, Feb 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The other note is that CheeseDreams uses a dialup and this makes it impossible to block her IP range.

<p>It's pretty clear that security is one of the most serious problem here. Developers should improve that part of software. The software should automatically catch all probable sockpuppet accounts and put them on a page that only admins can access. This is pretty simple to program (just keep the complete list of IPs linked with the user ID, and if one IP in the list matches the IP used by another account, it could be a probable sockpuppet). Why has that not been done? It should take less than 30 minutes for anyone familiar with the code to program that part. This would solves almost all the problems involving sockpuppet abuses. Also, there should be some better mechanism to deal with open proxies. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 08:19, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I can speak for the ArbCom in saying that sockpuppet abuse meaning the blocking of all socks is entirely in line with <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppets_376f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppets">Wikipedia:Sock puppets</a>, particularly if a sock is used to evade a block stemming from an ArbCom ruling. Multiple accounts are not considered good practice by the community as is; any abuse is really something that shouldn't be tolerated.

<dd>I know that. That's why I said "probable sockpuppet".

Currently apparently only <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> can do these technical analysis. Admins should not have to rely on Tim Starling. This should be done automatically by the software for all users, and the results should be posted to a page that admins can access (without revealing the private information to the admins).

<li>sure, if this is the consensus, keep it (but don't let IZAK see it:) I still see no reason to block Cantus for reverting, it's just a regular dispute, and the 3RR applies like for ever other dispute. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 09:06, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></li>
</ul>
<p>I think there are two issues here. One is a content dispute, and there's nothing wrong with that and normally Cantus's behavior would be okay. Looking at the talk page, he has a lot of people who agree with him on the content issue.</p>
<p>However, the other issue is the two arbitration rulings against <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantus_1468.html" title="User:Cantus">Cantus</a>, which he is openly defying and soliciting support for his defiance. As <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> said:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Cantus_1942.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Cantus">The first arbcom case against Cantus</a> said <i>Cantus is reminded to discuss matters in accordance with good Wikipedia:Wikiquette, and is instructed to not engage in personal attacks, harrassment, or provocation.</i>. Cantus's response to an attempt to discuss the matter on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Talk%7EAutofellatio_3258.html" title="Talk:Autofellatio">Talk:Autofellatio</a> was to accuse me of poor judgement.

Cantus removed the image at least twice in the space of about an hour.</li>

<p>Set the content dispute aside, and you have a user egregiously violating the terms of arbitration rulings. Do we have a new rule now?

<dd>your first point -- please... you are waving with an arbcom ruling because he said you have "poor judgement"? This is schoolyard behaviour. your second point: <s>yes, if Cantus violated a ruling by reverting twice, I suppose he will have to suffer a block for this.</s> as far as I can see, Cantus reverted <i>once</i> so far.

<p>NOTE: <a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">User:Fvw</a> had blocked CD for 1 week because of these "violations". I've reduced it to a 48 block on account of the peripheral and minor nature of the "violations". If we lay out a 1 week block for THIS we have nothing to use as incentive for her not to lay in to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a> article. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 17:50, Feb 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

I have no objections to the week long ban in this case. I'm implementing it now, the timing will be slightly off, I would imagine, but it will be roughly 7 days from fvw's last block. fvw, sorry for misunderstanding.

<dd>Good call on those not being related to Christianity (for anyone who doens't know it, Jesus is a prophet in at least two other religions). Now, if the edits had been about Jesus <i>in the context of christianity</i> or had been preaching or similar, that would have been a different matter and may well have made those edits Christianity-related. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 00:28, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fine. I fucking give up.

<dd>Christianity has everything to do with Jesus, but Jesus has <i>nothing</i> to do with Christianity. He didn't get a say in it, he was dead when they started it, you know. But this is irrelevant here, because CD's ban extends to <i>Jesus</i>-related articles, never mind Christianity. And of course any section entitled <i>Jesus</i> in any article is 'Jesus related' (Jesus!) <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:07, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

His <b>11:39, Feb 1, 2005</b> doesn't seem to be a revert. IIRC there's still no official policy regarding reverting certain information over specific portions of text, so this block wasn't backed by official policy (just like previous controversial blocks). Personally, I can't see why having both the Polish and Russian version of his name in the article is such a problem. If it's in use it should be noted. I'll see if I can try some unofficial mediation between the two users in this dispute. I think we can probably let both blocks run their course and see if they've had some effects on the editors in question. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:14, Feb 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I don't support Emax in this case and I'd rather he joined the discussion more constructively, I'm also disappointed with behaviour of <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_s_af0b.html" title="User:Gene s">Gene s</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a>. Not only did they file this complain in order to push their agenda rather than cool down and wait for the outcome of the discussion, but the latter also reverted my talk page three times in order not to let Emax ask for help. Whether or not to count the 4th edit by Emax as revert, I believe he should be unblocked, especially that the matter is tricky and we can go either way here. In any law-abiding state all doubts are settled in favour of the accused. IMO Wikipedia should act the same way. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 12:33, Feb 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While Emax should be punished for engaging in a rv war and breaking 3RR rule, I believe that Users Ghirlandajo and Gene s should also be warned that they should resolve their problems on the talk page and/or arbitration, and not by reverting. The fact is that they did the first change that lead to this silly rv war (aren't they all?), and working in tandem did more rv on the particular (silly...) name order case. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michal_Glinski&amp;diff=9855352&amp;oldid=9853905" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michal_Glinski&amp;diff=9855352&amp;oldid=9853905" rel="nofollow">this</a> for the start of the war (changing name order by Ghirlandajo).

<p>From my own experience, Chris 73 is a dedicated and sensitive admin who has tactfully edited on some highly controversial articles, such as <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> smoothing some of the nationalist and biased POV. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">GeneralPatton</a> 18:30, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We are certainly not critising Chris 73. His cleaning up of mine and Halibutt talk page was a bit irritating, but this is a minor and past issue not worthy of mentioning. However, I'd like to know if we have any policies concerning group reverts (as mentioned above)? Since our primary goal not to punish people, but prevent pages history from becoming warped by rv wars (and article from becoming confusing), I think that we must develop a related policy. If a group of users within a short period of time carries out several roughly same reverts (more then 3 reverts total), even if each of those manages to avoid breaking the 3RR, they should be all penalised as if each of them had made all those reverts. Otherwise, experienced reverters may form unofficial clubs (or create fake accounts, we already have history of using proxies in rw), thus becoming immune to 3RR and go on happily and safely vandalising history pages. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a> 22:30, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

</dl>
<p>No, we are not. But if it is, Cheese Dreams has gone to some length to create the impression that Tigermoon is a real and distinct person. There is a record of brief conversations between them on talk pages. I think the crucial thing is that Tigermoon is, <i>practically speaking</i> serving as her sock-puppet. His edit summaries, and comments on her talk pages, indicate that he is following her instructions, and seeks further instructions. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 17:03, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tigermoon (Ben) appears to be\a different user from CheeseDreams (Clare). (Is he Clare's gay ex-boyfriend she's mentioned? Anyway, that's just gossiping and not particularly relevant.) As Ben and Clare are friends, it's not surprising that they might share some views. There is nothing wrong in this. To ban Ben because he agrees with Clare would be an abuse of admin rights - and I'm quite sure it won't take them long to raise a quite justifiable RfC on you if you did!</dd>

<p>You are wrong. The ArbCom discussed this: "Use of proxy editors to evade a ban will not be tolerated. Give this person one warning and then if he/she does it again. block that user/IP as if it were CD.

<dd>The entries I have seen suggest that whilst Tigermoon has the same stance as CD, he is not a proxy - he has his own mind and does not just do what CD asks of him. There is a world of difference between CD asking Tigermoon to change something, Tigermoon considering it, coming to his own conclusions (perhaps in discussion with CD) and then editing based on his own conclusions; and acting as a proxy by posting something just because CD asks him to do it.

<p>And the entry I am concerned with suggests that he is most definitely a proxy. Not only did he essentially revert the article to the much earlier version CheeseDreams advocated, but yesterday he left this message for Cheese Dreams (who later deleted it):</p>

<dd>I have read your e-mail Clare, but I am not certain about some of the requests. What exactly is it that you want me to change? there seems quite a lot, and you know I don't have that much spare time since I moved in with Andrew. I do not know much about the subject area, so you will need to put it more precisely, so that I know exactly which sentances you mean. Can you show me when you join us for dinner this week? - Ben. 11:26, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>and Cheese Dreams replied,</p>
<dl>
<dd>You didn't get it quite right Ben, there is some stuff you forgot about Mandaeans, for example. I will show you on Wednesday. By the way, from the comment below, I think you must have logged out when you made the edit. Its quite important to fix this. If your phone is working again can you text me? CheeseDreams 23:33, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Clearly, this exchange suggests that Tigermoon didn't do everything Cheese Dreams asked -- but it also reveals that his intention was to do so, and that he had Cheese Dreams check to make sure he did it properly. This exchange, plus the fact that his edits involved deleting and rewriting most of the article; that his changes brought the article back to the state Cheese Dreams put it in before the article was blocked; and that he provided no explanation for his change, all suggests to me that he is indeed acting on her behalf. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 20:04, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the ArbCom truly did intend this, I really think that they should have been more explicit in their ruling. I have no real objection to this conceptually, if they do intend it. Although it may not be the wisest move, slippery slope and all... how can we justify this ruling and then say that people "ganging up" to avoid violating the 3RR is OK? My strong objection was what I viewed as an unwarranted extension of the ArbCom ruling. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 20:35, Feb 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tigermoon can still be Cheesedream's sockpuppet account. Trolls can go to a great extreme in creating multiple IDs and talking to themselves (even disagreeing and insulting themselves using different IDs). Anyone who has experienced dealing with trolls on USENET should know that. Why would Tigermoon reply to Cheesedream's email on her Wikipedia talk page? Why did he not reply via e-mail? Could it be because Tigermoon/Cheesedream <b>wanted</b> you to read the "reply" so you would think they are different people? As I suggested above, the software should automatically do some analysis (list of IPs used by an account, the time comparison, i.e. whether one IP was used by two accounts during the same day/hour or minute, email and password comparisons, etc). All this should be done automatically by the software for all the accounts, and the results should be posted to a page that admins can access (without revealing private information to the admins) <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 21:08, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>re 'conversations for the benefit of the eavesdropper', I had a similar hunch about Tigermoon being CD's sockpuppet, i.e. the Talk 'hi Clare - hi Ben - I'm moving in with Andrew - see you tonight' etc. seems just artificial. I don't put it beyond trolls to stage a whole soap to keep the sockhunters busy. It's all speculation, of course. Tigermoon was editing from a UK address when he 'forgot to log in' (in fact, it was mail.bpp.com). Are there similar known glitches of non-logged-in editing by CD? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 13:29, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>I received an e-mail from Tigermoon complaining that the block was unfair (I assume because I have previously undone what I thought were unfair blocks of CheeseDreams). It seems he didn't fully understand that the kind of proxying for banned users he was doing was not allowed. While he was warned that he would be blocked if he continued acting as CD's sockpuppet, he was not informed of the supporting policies or precedents, and since the warning came from an involved editor rather than a neutral third party, he may have thought it a personal threat rather than an official warning. I have explained the matter to him and reduced the block to time already served (about a day), which I think is a more appropriate block length for a first offense committed in partial ignorance. I have also informed him that he will be blocked again, and I will not unblock him, if he continues helping CheeseDreams evade the ban. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv">&#160;<sup><small>(Mirv)</small></sup></a> 20:19, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Two Users are repeatedly taking it upon themselves to delete the comments on this User's User page. I can't read Hebrew, so I don't know what it says, but they claim it's an attack on an admin on the Hebrew Wikipedia. I keep reverting it, and have blocked one of the Users for vandalism, because as I've told them they need to take this to an RfC and not take it upon themselves to mess with another User's User page. Heberw Wikipedia doesn't have much in the way of history on the English language Wikipedia (one item was speedy deleted), but it doesn't seem right to me that they can just keep messing with another User's User page without the backing of an RfC. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 19:37, Feb 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A followup. Please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARickK&amp;diff=9898720&amp;oldid=9882955" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARickK&amp;diff=9898720&amp;oldid=9882955" rel="nofollow">this set of edits</a>. It seems highly unlikely to mee that Krav-hanuka can, as he/she claims, determine every page that a particular User visits. Am I correct in this assumption? I am also fed up with people who are always trying to assume some sort of personal bias when a sysop performs the actions a sysop (or any other User) needs to perform. And just for the record, I never visited the page in question until just after I read these rants. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 00:52, Feb 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the monitoring question: well, I know a little bit about how the Internet works.&#160;:-) There would be only a few ways to do this in <i>exactly</i> the way he describes ("monitor any visit and write the I.P of any web page you asks" - i.e. monitor clients, not servers, and record any place those users go on the Internet), none of them likely, I think:
<ul>
<li>Mount an <b>extremely</b> widespread wire-tapping operation (something that the <a href="../../../n/s/a/NSA_54af.html" title="NSA">NSA</a> and <a href="../../../g/c/h/GCHQ_903b.html" title="GCHQ">GCHQ</a> couldn't desire in their wildest dreams) to tap traffic between any user they wish to monitor, and websites. This isn't plausible, of course.</li>
<li>Users who have e.g. the Alexa toolbar, which <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/traffic_learn_more.html" class="external text" title="http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/traffic_learn_more.html" rel="nofollow">counts</a> page visits, might somehow be vulnerable, <i>but</i>... those services almost certainly <i>do not</i> keep info on individual users (for privacy reasons - e.g in the EU it's probably illegal to do so), so they'd probably have had to break into the servers of those services (illegally, of course).</li>
<li>People who have spy-ware on their machine would definitely be vulnerable to having their site visits monitored, but of course that's a limited subset of the Internet user population.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So AFAIK they are blowing smoke. It would probably be easier to break into Wikipedia and add monitoring software, but their description says any server you visit, not just selected sites. And of course if you ask them <i>how</i> it is done, they'll say they "can't reveal it for security reasons". But you could always try - the response should be amusing, if nothing else! <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 21:09, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hate to be a tattle tale, but I think things might be getting out of hand. Everyking seems to be getting ganged up on. Everyking started a poll to try and get concensus on some bits for the page and User:Blankefaze added this section which Everyking most likely viewed as a personal attack (considering the history of the matter) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAutobiography_%28Ashlee_Simpson_album%29&amp;diff=9873617&amp;oldid=9873443" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAutobiography_%28Ashlee_Simpson_album%29&amp;diff=9873617&amp;oldid=9873443" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> I've deleted it, and made a note to play nice, I just thought it should be brought to admin attention.</p>
<p>Also, the polls being conducted there I believe will be subject to some extreme "anti-Everyking" bias. I'm not sure how well it's going to go until people cool off. Just a heads up. No action is currently necessary I believe.</p>

<p>I must be a sucker for pain, but here goes: I have blocked all the CheeseDreams sock puppets for a week.

You were ordered by the ArbCom:
<dl>
<dd>2.2) For a period of one year, Everyking is prohibited from reverting articles relating to Ashlee Simpson except in cases of clear and obvious vandalism (as per definition at Wikipedia:Vandalism), with penalties as per the Wikipedia:Three revert rule.

<dd>In my view, this was a revert and so I used my administrator's discretion to block you for 24 hours. It's nothing personal: I'm just enforcing an ArbCom remedy. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 03:35, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I'm going to be out of internet for the next week, so i ask the sysop's attention to the following articles: <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_S%C3%B3crates_5132.html" title="José Sócrates">José Sócrates</a> (the future PM, especially allegations about homossexuality, which are according to the man false) and <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_Santana_Lopes_1d94.html" title="Pedro Santana Lopes">Pedro Santana Lopes</a> (the current PM). These articles are not watched by many people around here and they will be <i>under attack</i> for the next week(s).

<dd>I just checked both of these and they both seem OK at the moment. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 03:34, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
