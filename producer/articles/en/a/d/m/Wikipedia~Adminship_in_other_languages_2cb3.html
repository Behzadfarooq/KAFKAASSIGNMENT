<ul>
<li><b>Candidate suffrage</b>: This is left to the opinion of the&#160;!voters. Criteria such as six to nine months, 1 featured article, or a percentage of edits to a particular namespace appear not infrequently.</li>
<li><b>!Voter suffrage</b>: At their judgment, bureaucrats may discount&#160;!votes made by relatively new users, and&#160;!votes made for reasons deemed spurious. Anonymous users cannot&#160;!vote.</li>
<li><b>Promotion</b>: The&#160;!vote lasts one week. At their judgment based upon the&#160;!votes, bureaucrats decide whether or not to promote the candidate. In practice, all candidates with at least 80% support have passed, and all with less than 59% support have failed. A significant amount of candidates fall between 59% and 80% support, and have been promoted or not promoted at bureaucrat discretion. Passing candidates with less than 75% support are rare.</li>
<li><b>Demotion</b>: No such procedure exists. Various proposals to this extent have been dismissed on the assumptions that such a process would be abused by trolls, and that in doing their tasks most active admins would make sufficient enemies to fail any reconfirmation process.</li>
<li><b>Abuse</b>: Cases of admin abuse can be taken to Requests for Comment, which is generally deemed ineffective for this purpose, or to the Arbitration Committee, which can pass judgment on an appropriate solution. In the past, such solutions have included demotion, censure, a ban from renomination, as well as specific restrictions on the admin's usage of tools or forums.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Candidate suffrage</b>: 3 months, 300 edits, as well as a valid userpage and e-mail address.</li>
<li><b>Voter suffrage</b>: 1 month, 100 edits.</li>
<li><b>Promotion</b>: 75% support is required in a vote, lasting one week.</li>
<li><b>Demotion</b>: Adminship is subject to yearly reconfirmation via this same procedure, but only if there are significant objections to the admin, which generally means about 4 or 5 dissenters. The most frequent reason for demotion via this process is inactivity, defined as having less than 50 edits over the past 12 months. Controversial admins are thus subjected to reconfirmation but usually still get the requisite support.</li>
<li><b>Other</b>: Not having a valid userpage or e-mail address is grounds for immediate demotion, after a brief grace period allowing the admin to fix this.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdminship_in_other_languages_2cb3.html" title="Edit section: French">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">French</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Candidate suffrage</b>: 3 months, 300 edits.</li>
<li><b>Voter suffrage</b>: 1 week, 50 edits.</li>
<li><b>Promotion</b>: Consensual support is required in a vote, lasting fifteen days. In practice, all candidates with 70% support or more have passed, all with less have failed. Note that the French Wikipedia regularly votes on motions and proposals, so it appears to have a reasonably well-defined numerical notion of consensus.</li>
<li><b>Demotion</b>: Abuse of tools has been strictly defined, and admins are warned for such abuse. In case of repeated abuse, an admin must stand for reconfirmation, requiring 75% support to retain his status.</li>
<li><b>Abuse</b>: Deleting a page when involved in an edit war over it is grounds for an immediate vote for reconfirmation. Repeatedly continuing an edit war on a protected page is grounds for immediate demotion without a vote.</li>
<li><b>Other</b>: A more specific system is under construction, which allows a group of at least ten users to make a motion to impose specific sanction on an admin who is part of a dispute. The admin may voluntarily comply; if not, the sanction is voted upon as above.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Candidate suffrage</b>: "significantly more" than voter suffrage.</li>
<li><b>Voter suffrage</b>: 2 months, 200 edits.</li>
<li><b>Promotion</b>: 67% support is required in a vote, lasting two weeks, with a quorum of 15 voters. It is explicitly stated that all discussion must be done on the talk page.</li>
<li><b>Demotion</b>: In case of substantial complaints against an admin, either for tool abuse or repeated incivility, a motion can be made to demote the admin for up to three months. In a vote, the admin needs 67% support to not lose his privileges for the specified amount of time. If an admin has already been subjected to temporary demotion, for a subsequent complaint a motion can be made for indefinite demotion.</li>
<li><b>Abuse</b>: Wheel warring or breach of protection policy is grounds for immediate demotion, which is temporary while the community decides how to deal with the person.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Candidate suffrage</b>: 2 months, 500 edits. A failed candidate may not be nominated again for 3 months.</li>
<li><b>Voter suffrage</b>: 1 month, 300 edits.</li>
<li><b>Promotion</b>: 80% support is required in a vote, lasting two weeks, with a quorum of 67% of the average amount of votes on the last four successful nominations.</li>
<li><b>Confirmation</b>: Admins must be confirmed every year. If 10 users oppose to the confirmation, the admin undergoes an election with the same methods as the first one, but with a 67% of support needed.</li>
<li><b>Demotion</b>: A serious complaint against an admin is discussed for a week. If at the end of the week at least five users with suffrage support demotion, the admin must either resign or stand for reconfirmation by the process above.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Candidate suffrage</b>: No specific suffrage, though candidates usually have several month's experience.</li>
<li><b>Voter suffrage</b>: 1 month, 50 edits in article space.</li>
<li><b>Promotion</b>: 75% support with a quorum of 10 voters. Voting lasts for 1 week, and can be extended by another week.</li>
<li><b>Demotion</b>: Admins that go 3 months without editing can be demoted.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Candidate suffrage</b>: Four months of activity, 1000 edits and—more vaguely—familiarity with Wikimedia projects, understanding of and agreement with the project's goals and familiarity with the routines on the Norwegian Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>Voter suffrage</b>: An account having been created before the vote started and having at least one edit in the seven days before the vote started.</li>
<li><b>Promotion</b>: 75% support is required in a vote with a quorum of four voters. In practice the quorum is always achived, the typical nomination gets around 20 votes. Most nominations pass unanimously without discussion but oppose voters usually explain their vote.</li>
<li><b>Demotion</b>: Inactive administrators are demoted after a certain period. Historically two requests for demotion were filed and voted, on but the process has fallen into disuse. There seems to be a general feeling that there are no abusive admins.</li>

<li><b>Promotion</b>: 80% support is required in a vote, lasting one week, with a quorum of 20 voters.</li>
<li><b>Demotion</b>: No such procedure seems to exist, but due to lack of a translating search engine I may have been unable to find it if it did.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Candidate suffrage</b>: Not explicitly stated, but ~1500 edits and two months suggested.</li>
<li><b>Voter suffrage</b>: Not explicitly stated.</li>
<li><b>Promotion</b>: Consensual support is required in a vote, lasting one week. If consensus is unclear, the bureaucrats will extend this period by another week. All candidates with at least 70% support have passed, all with 50% or less have failed. There are as yet no candidates with support between 50% and 70%.</li>
<li><b>Demotion</b>: Admins can (and do) voluntarily stand for reconfirmation when they believe their status is disputed, using the same process as above.</li>
<li><b>Other</b>: Unlisting a failing nomination per the equivalent of the Snowball Clause is explicitly allowed.</li>

<li><b>Candidate suffrage</b>: 4 months, 500 edits.</li>
<li><b>Voter suffrage</b>: 5 edits.</li>
<li><b>Promotion</b>: Consensual support is required in a vote, lasting one week. Bureaucrats are explicitly warned to double-check the candidate's recent activity. In practice, all candidates with at least 60% support have passed, all candidates with less than that have failed.</li>

<li><b>Candidate suffrage</b>: About 2 months of high activity, or about 9 months of low activity.</li>
<li><b>Voter suffrage</b>: Not explicitly stated.</li>
<li><b>Promotion</b>: 75% support is required in a vote.</li>
<li><b>Demotion</b>: Admins are subject to yearly reconfirmation via the same process. Additionally, a motion can be made to demote an admin, in which the admin requires 50% support to not be demoted. The latter process is being phased out in favour of an Arbitration Committee.</li>
