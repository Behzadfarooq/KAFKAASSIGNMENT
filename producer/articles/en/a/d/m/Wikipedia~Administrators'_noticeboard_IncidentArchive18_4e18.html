<p>Danny has taken it upon himself to unilaterally delete a large quantity of content from <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmeston%2C_New_York_1b7f.html" title="Edmeston, New York">Edmeston, New York</a> that was broken out into separate pages (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/delete" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/delete" rel="nofollow">the deletion log</a>). Danny came into IRC complaining that the pages were a violation of the goals of the project because he believes that they are an example of someone using wikipedia as a webhost. Despite disagreement from almost everyone involved, none of whom had any involvement with the creation of the articles, he simply started deleting them. I think they should be undeleted, and Danny should nominate them on VFD. There is valuable information there; it likely needs extensive refactoring and some should be ultimately moved to wikisource. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 01:15, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>good for Danny. Those were collections of quotations, not articles. Even rewriting them into actual articles would, in all probability, constitute original research.

<dd>RickK and MIRV are missing the point. The question isn't whether <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">User:Danny</a> was factually wrong in his determination that the articles should be deleted. It is whether he violated <a href="../../../d/u/e/Due_process.html" title="Due process">due process</a> by using his administrative powers to delete them with no opportunity for the creators or other interested users to comment on the appropriate <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> or <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a> pages. As an analogy, if a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_officer.html" title="Police officer">police officer</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> or most other Western countries is accused of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_brutality.html" title="Police brutality">police brutality</a>, he cannot defend himself from that charge by claiming that the individuals whom he brutalized were criminals or that they deserved to be in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">prison</a>. Be that as it may, the abuse of power is nonetheless unjustified. And so it is here. <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevelCheck_4bca.html" title="User:LevelCheck">LevelCheck</a> 03:22, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you feel that he has violated his admin powers then follow the dispute resolution process - Try his talk page, if that fails try RfC, the Mediation if apropriate, then if it absolutely comes to it take it to the ArbCom.

<dd>I hardly think that deleting information (which still exists, by the way, and can be brought back with a few mouse clicks) is comparable to brutalizing a citizen. (1) There is no "undo button" for police brutality: you can't heal the bruises, let alone the hurt feelings and the painful memory by any means whatsoever. (2) One case involves human beings and the actions of government officials; the other is just text in a volunteer project. I think that resorting to "due process" is a poor analogy. I've been here for 3.5 years, and <b>nothing</b> I've ever done at Wikipedia has been in accordance with (or in violation of) due process, because there are no courts or cops here: we're just volunteers writing articles.

<li>Thank you so much for asking. As you may or may not be aware, my account was blocked from editing (7) days ago (18:23, 11 Apr 2005) for casting a vote for inclusion of a school-related article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FJordan_Middle_School&amp;diff=12175749&amp;oldid=12173688" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FJordan_Middle_School&amp;diff=12175749&amp;oldid=12173688" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, a matter which will be addressed seperately. The 3RR was violated by Chriscf (6) days ago, less than 12 hours after my account was blocked. As far as I know, being blocked does not permit another user to vandalize pages of the blockee. --GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 22:24, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Invalid report</b> - this page is not an instrument of revenge. You also failed to notice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGRider%2FSchoolwatch&amp;diff=12226631&amp;oldid=12226263" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGRider%2FSchoolwatch&amp;diff=12226631&amp;oldid=12226263" rel="nofollow">this</a>. It should also be noted that GRider's description of the page as a project for "constructively improving the quality of school-related articles" is not so much a misrepresentation as an outright lie. For a page which aims at "constructively improving the quality of school-related articles", it offers surprisingly little assistance in achieving that goal. It is nothing but a list of schools on VfD, hence it is a deletion-related page and therefore GRider has violated his ArbCom parole again. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk back</a></small> 00:27, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is rather spurious. GRider claims that, since it is his userspace, his schoolwatch is exempt from normal policies such as Wikiquette, NPOV and <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Yet he does want action to be taken against another user's legitimate contributions to his page. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 12:20, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The 4 reverts did happen, I chose not to report it to this page and instead mentioned it to Chriscf on the <a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_Schoolwatch_ffd1.html#Reverts" title="User talk:GRider/Schoolwatch">talk page</a>. I think that the infraction is valid, no matter what GRider might have done; two wrongs don't make a right. But after I mentioned it on the talkpage, Chriscf apologized there and took a break from editing the page. So although this infraction is valid, I think it was a mistake that should not be dealt with harshly, considering the apology and the desisting from further reverts. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">BaronLarf</a> 20:25, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do actually agree with you - policies such as 3RR should apply in userspace as well as mainspace. I find GRider's listing it here an act of hypocrisy, because he selectively wants to apply certain policies in his userspace, but not others. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 09:56, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">User:Chriscf</a> would be kind enough to apologize to me personally for "sleeping at the wheel" so to speak while repeatedly reverting a page within my userspace, I would gratefully accept his apology and offer my forgiveness. This report was made as a matter of formality to document the abusive actions made and prevent any sort of relapse.

I'm also suggesting that your newfound concern for the appropriateness of Arbcom decisions, and in particular your intimation that they are all far too harsh, will undoubtedly be seen by others as a back-door way of insinuating that you were treated unfairly by ArbCom, and therefore discounted. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:33, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I criticized punitive logic among the ArbCom before I ever got embroiled in any controversy, let alone got penalized for it. For example, when I ran for the ArbCom late last year, I made that my central point. I'll grant you that I feel more strongly about it now that I have myself been victimized, but my basic opinion has been consistent. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 20:58, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comments:</b> A silly rvert war of a term in this disamiguation. I do belive that the edits by Gulielmus Cumrotae were in good faith, and that the reversion of siad eidts by Georgia guy were not. In exmanation of both useres talk pages on the artilce their seems to be little if no dialog, though Georgia guy does accuse Gulielmus Cumrotae of vandalism, and Gulielmus Cumrotae does ask him to stop reverting his edits. Perhaps Georgia guy needs to read <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>, also for all the vandalism that Georgia guy accuses that Gulielmus Cumrotae did to this article he never reported it to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_progress_33dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress">VIP</a> but instead decied to engage in a edit war in which laned him here. Note: I have left mentions on both useres pages as to the reporting of this and have directed Gulielmus Cumrotae to consider a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">Request for Comment</a> concering the actions of Georgia guy} if he wishes to dispute the reverts. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">comhrÚ</a> 22:39, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>User:GRider has edited <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGRider_Schoolwatch_74ee.html" title="User:GRider/Schoolwatch">User:GRider/Schoolwatch</a>, a collection of VfD links falsely claiming to be a project to "constructively improve" said articles. Instead of encouraging people to improve the articles, it encourages people to spam the VfD discussions with spurious "keep" votes. It also is notable for its lack of any tools useful in "constructively improving" articles. It is therefore deletion-related, and in direct violation of the current <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_GRider_e674.html#Remedies" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/GRider">ArbCom judgement against the user</a>. I believe extending this judgement to include his deletion-related user pages is justified, since the user has repeatedly refused to engage in any discussion about their activities, preferring to label as a personal attack anything that he can, and summarily ignoring anything he can't. 00:51, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is that how you respond to my question: to question my right to raise the question? The issue came up, so I was inquiring about the basis of the matter. As it stands, I seem to be gathering that GRider was banned for attempting to get other people to vote.

<p>Can we all keep in mind that GRider is banned from deletion pages for posting frivilous nominations, not for his voting practices. If he wants to make a watchlist of discussions under his user space, let him be. When there is a debate, such as this one, focusing on <i>the person</i> is no way to further the discussion. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 03:39, 2005 Apr 19 (UTC)</p>

<li>No, he's actually banned from deletion for posting frivolous nominations, refusing to accept the results of VfDs that he didn't agree with, disrupting the VfD process, playing the system to get a favorable outcome, and refusing to discuss any of the aforementioned when questioned. His editing this page is VfD participation by proxy, and the fact that it's in his user space should <b>not</b> have any bearing on this. To quote <a href="../../../u/p/_/WP%7EUP_7462.html" title="WP:UP">WP:UP</a>, <i>Community policies apply to your user space just as they do elsewhere.</i> Correct me if I'm wrong in thinking that disruption of VfD and polarising the discussions therein is against policy.

<p>Let's look at this through analogy. If Everyking were to make a user subpage about Ashlee Simpson, would that be forbidden? If he were to add a mention about how he liked Ashlee to his userpage, would that mean that he couldn't edit his userpage anymore? Both of these seem ludicrous claims, for the basic reason that, short of major policy violations, we pretty much let things go in the userspace on a general understanding of civility and not being dicks. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 04:16, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that's a valid analogy though. Everyking's hypothetical piece on Ashlee Simpson isn't systematically organising users to make the article about her look a certain way. The essence of the Schoolwatch is a program to (1) improve the quality of school articles and (2) to save them from VfD. Inasmuch as any projects to improve article quality are good, this one should be made truly collaborative by taking it out of a User's namespace. The ideal course of action would of course be to petition GRider nicely to merge his schoolwatch program with the one existing in the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_4cc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch">public namespace</a>. I have no confidence in GRider acceding to such a request, due to his practice of ignoring any kind of feedback. It's simply inappropriate for him to assert propritary control over this project given that its activities extend outside of his own user space and into other articles, and - importantly - in a fashion likely to antagonise other users. This proprietary concern means that GRider is free to revert and cry foul when any users legitimately question the aims and methodology of the project. The one-sidedness of the thing (in only accepting positive contributions) is a problem contributing to the ill-will that lingers against GRider's behaviour.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The appropriate analogy, in my view, is <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">Wik</a>'s infamous "hitlist": whatever you may think of the principle of "user control over userspace", it can generally be seen that using it to give <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctuary.html" title="Sanctuary">sanctuary</a> to material that riles other users is going to be poorly regarded. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 05:34, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the hit list is a poor analogy, since that was just content on his userpage, whereas this is a subpage. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 15:20, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Imho, GRider's schoolwatch program is both deletion related and inapropriate for userspace. If it were just a list of articles on schools then that would be fine, but it isn't that. Also look at the history of GRider's talk page, he removes any attempt at communication, often with edit summaries referring to vandalism. This indicates a complete unwillingness to discuss his behaviour with the community. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 08:46, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, I agree, this makes GRider look like a dick and confirms why it is he got arbcommed and sanctioned in the first place. It's bad, he shouldn't do it, if he can come up with some other bad things to do it'll make for a great GRider 2 case.

<dd>I'm not really decided on Everyking's usage of his userspace (I'd probably vote keep if the articles appeared on Vfd), but I don't think a Vfd listing should be seen as disruptive under <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> - if there's a grey area in our policies, creating a precedent case and trying to establish consensus one way or the other seems to be a good way of clearing things up. Listing all articles at once might be seen as extreme, but a single Vfd listing to see if it's possible to establish consensus seems perfectly legitimate. -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 14:34, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for the clarification of your <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> comment, Thryduulf. I don't know if nominating something on VfD is the best way of establishing precedent. People nominating articles for VfD have done so when they're not sure if it should be deleted, and in other unbiased situations such as removing an article off <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. I just wonder if there's a place (such as the <a href="../../../v/p/_/WP%7EVP_dc2f.html" title="WP:VP">village pump</a> or <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_5926.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia_talk:Votes for deletion</a>) where discussing precedents for deleting may be more appropriate.

<p><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_8-ball.html" title="Magic 8-ball">Magic 8-ball</a> says "reply hazy, ask again later." The Everyking ruling specifically referred to articles.

<p>But then, coming down to one word may satisfy the rules lawyers but somehow doesn't feel like a sensible and robust decision should.</p>
<p>The AC is not supposed to make rulings that outrage the interpretation of community norms, so the question is whether this one has done so in the case of user pages. I must admit the question of user space had not occurred to me during the vote.</p>

<li>Ths is a simple POV edit war of an artile that in it's current form i belive should either be sourced or deleted. My own opinions aside, their has been no dialog between the useres on this edit war on either the talk page of the artile or either the usere pages of the parties involved. Also as fo it being vandalism, no vandalism reports were offerd by any party involved, though each accused the other of vandalism several times in the edit summaries. I also belive that <a href="../../../d/g/_/User%7EDG_58ec.html" title="User:DG">DG</a> (<a href="../../../d/g/_/User_talk%7EDG_200a.html" title="User talk:DG">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DG_8260.html" title="Special:Contributions/DG">contribs</a>) has used a sockpuppet account of <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.99.6.125.html" title="User:207.99.6.125">207.99.6.125</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.99.6.125.html" title="User talk:207.99.6.125">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.99.6.125_66dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.99.6.125">contribs</a>) in order to subvert the 3rr, if an admin wish to contact me on this i am more then willing to supply evidence that would corrilate ther 2 accounts are the same user.

<li>User has past 3RR violation (see discussion of it on user's talk page, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristiaan_be1c.html#3RR_violation" title="User talk:Christiaan">here</a>). User has consistently skirted the 3RR violation, very much "artfully" avoiding technical violation. User is edit-warring, and has consistently been doing so. If you scroll through the article's history page, you'll see near-constant reversion by <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">User:Christiaan</a>.

<li>Jmabel is right. There's no way he can be blocked from a single page. Maybe he was blocked for a short period of time and was able to edit another page after his block expired? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:53, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for the replies. No, I could find no evidence of a relevant block. He now tells me that he can edit the Talk page again.

The first revert according to Fish Supper was actually when I reverted a one sentence change by Rev of Bru at 20:10).

Moreover, Fish Supper's edit summaries ("Naughty" and "Mouse Error") suggest vandalism.

At 20:22 Fish Supper reverted a number of changes I made, back to an earlier version by JimWae.</p>
<p>Fish Supper accuses me of violating the 3RR. I have made more than three reversions total, today, but concerning different passages (I reverted a one sentence change by Rev of Bru at 20:10). Fish Supper's first revert changed the entire introduction, and I reverted this change only three times.</p>

<p>I believe it is relevant that I explained all my edits on the article's talk page, and Fish Supper provided no explanations for his/her revert.

<p>Fish Supper continues to revert any edit I make to the article. If this goes on, the effect is the same as if I were blocked from the article. Since I have always provided reasons for my edits, and sources when necessary or requested, and Fish Supper never does, this amounts to harassment. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 22:04, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It would be a striaght forward 3RR by Slrubenstein however you are allowed to revert banned users. CheeseDreams is currently under an abcom ban.

<dd>So? That is irrelevant. The 3RR policy is not "do not revert 3 times, unless you mention it in the talk page in which case you can revert as much as you like". It is DO NOT revert 3 times in one day, <i><b>ever</b></i>. So what about (b). Stop trying to come up with flimsy excuses and sidestepping of the issue and actually answer the question.

<dd>I would not consider an unbanning by you to be "warring". I've made my position clear by banning. You would then make your position clear by unbanning. That's one "move" each. The fact that it results in Slrubenstein being unbanned if there's a "tie" is fine as I believe policy is that if there is a dispute as to whether someone should be blocked then we should err on the side of having them unblocked. It is only when one or both of us would seek to reassert our positions (by "reverting" to a different block state, for example) that it would be warring.

<dd>What I fail to see is why the end result of Fish Supper being banned, but Slrubenstein being free, is considered in any way either a fair or an even handed application of the 3RR policy. This points to total corruption by people such as Jayjg.

<dd>Oh, so its acceptable for Slrubenstein to push Fish Supper past the 3 revert rule by baiting Fish Supper by making 5 reverts, but not for Fish Supper to complain that Slrubenstein patently broke 3RR after Fish Supper's 1st Revert?</dd>

<p>Folks, in principle I do not mind being blocked. But I also do not think anyone should be banned simply because they violate the 3RR.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The 3RR says that they should. Thats what its about.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I see the 3RR as a way to call attention to a problem. But the problem has its origins in something besides the reverts themselves. I do not know who Fish Supper is a sock-puppet of. Can someone tell me how to find out?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ask Fish Supper?</dd>
</dl>
<p>In any case, the reason I reverted was <i>not</i> because I thought Fish Supper is a sock-puppet, but rather because Fish Supper was repeatedly putting false</p>
<dl>
<dd>Its your OPINION that it is false. The other 3 editors to the page supported its truth.</dd>
</dl>
<p>information into the article, without providing an explanation in the talk page, without responding to my questions about his edit, and without responding to my explanation for my edit. Now, I know there are plenty of times where two people get into a heated argument on the talk page coincident with a revert war concerning the article, and I can see the sense in blocking both parties. But in this case, there was no argument in the talk page because I was the only one making comments, and Fish Supper ignored al of them. This is an asymmetrical situation and I think anyone, especially a seasoned editor, can see that my edits were motivated by a desire to improve the article, and Fish Supper displayed not a single shred of evidence that he cares about the quality of the article; indeed, his edits reveal a desire only to be disruptive. Dante, I am not questioning your motives, but I ask you not to put the cart before the horse. Our primary objective is to write accurate articles. In edit conflicts you have to ask yourself, are both parties trying to improve the article (by the way this was clearly the case in an edit conflict between me and JimWae, and we reached a placxe of compromise), or is one person trying to help and the other, only to hurt? Please remember that our policies about editing are <b>not</b> ends in themselves, but <i>means</i> towards a substantive end. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 01:29, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand your motives, and they are noble. However, understand that it's <b>obvious</b> that you were being baited by Fish Supper. Your job as a responsible contributor (and an Admin, no less) was to NOT take the bait, report Fish Supper's unacceptable behavior, wait until it was recognized and remedied by 3rd parties, and <i>then</i> clean up the situation. I blocked you because you chose to instead engage in a (demonstrably) pointless revert war that could only result in either you both getting blocked, or else an appearance of impropriety by YOU remaining unblocked while Fish Supper is blocked for behavior that you yourself displaed. That being said, I agree that you are trying to make the article better and that Fish Supper is trying to be disruptive, but I still don't think you went about it the proper way. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 17:11, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bogan is a fairly new editor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;hideminor=0&amp;namespace=&amp;target=Ken_Bogan&amp;limit=250&amp;offset=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;hideminor=0&amp;namespace=&amp;target=Ken_Bogan&amp;limit=250&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">contribs</a>. He has the same user name and photograph on his user page as that of a convicted sex offender who is wanted for failure to register. The sex offender's details are on this law-enforcement website <a href="http://www.meganslaw.ca.gov/cgi/prosoma.dll?searchby=offender&amp;id=1869408347232" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.meganslaw.ca.gov/cgi/prosoma.dll?searchby=offender&amp;id=1869408347232" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>. Someone else using several different user accounts has posted to <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Bogan_a891.html" title="User:Ken Bogan">User:Ken Bogan</a>'s talk page, saying that Bogan raped his girlfriend and shouldn't be allowed to edit. Bogan admits that he is the rapist. The whole thing seems weird, as Bogan (if he is the wanted sex offender) could have used another user name, and need not have posted his photograph — that he used exactly the same photograph as the one on the law-enforcement website is odd too. It seems clear that he's trying to draw attention to his ID. It occurred to me that this might be a journalist writing a story about how the community responds, or it could just be someone larking around (though I don't see the point of it). But we probably need to sort it out because of the possible ID-theft issue. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:21, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even if the image is a copyvio, how do we know that he isn't really who he says he is? Just because somebody claims that they are famous (or in this case a criminal) doesn't mean that they should automatically be presumed guilty of impersonation. If there's no way to prove that he is or isn't, then I say leave him alone. It shouldn't affect what he does on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Maybe we could ask him to upload another picture of him that isn't available elsewhere (eg. taking a picture of himself editing Wikipedia) to confirm that he really is Bogan, if he can't do this, then block for impersonation. -<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrazzydee_a9f9.html" title="User:Frazzydee">Frazzydee</a>|<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrazzydee_457f.html" title="User talk:Frazzydee">✍</a> 00:57, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>First I think the two users are the same person, posting from work and home.</li>
<li>This started a few days ago, the user overwrote an article I had written at (now at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Revolution_%28newspaper%29_bfd9.html" title="The Revolution (newspaper)">The Revolution (newspaper)</a>), I moved it to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Revolution_%28radio%29_43cf.html" title="The Revolution (radio)">The Revolution (radio)</a> since the paper is much older than the radio station, and of significant interest to people studying womens rights in the United States, and told them not to overwrite articles. They then moved the newspaper article to The Revolution (newspaper) and stuck their article back at The Revolution. I warned again and as a comprimise made <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Revolution_e53f.html" title="The Revolution">The Revolution</a> a disambig. Since then they have repeatedly reverted my and other users revert/rollbacks, and broke the 3RR on the 19th. I don't think the best option is blocking the users IPS since this is the only disruptive behaviour they partake in, but protecting the page for a while may be the way to go--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 01:01, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The above user is engaging in un-Wiki like behavior over at the Pope article. His activities include 1)removing every single image in the article without discussion 2)removing copyvio tags on images that were questioned by other users 3)adding copyvio tags to legitimate images such as Vatican photos released under fair use 4)constantly reverting all changes made by others with regards to images. This, in my opinion, is vandalism.

<dd>Yet another followup to this. A lot of the questionable images had copyright tags changed to Vatican fair use after being questioned as copyright violations from Associated Press and so forth. It looks like users simply removed the copyvio tags (I wont name names). My understanding is that a user simply cannot go into an image or article marked for copyright problems and change it back without discussion or an admin clearing it. Here is an example of what I'm talking about: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Pope_Benedict_XVI.jpg&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12552897" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Pope_Benedict_XVI.jpg&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12552897" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>. My point...Admins need to check these images. A lot of them are very suspicious. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 05:03, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comments:</b> I came to the page as it was listed on RFC. Basically one anon user is listening to no one and insisting on a POV sentence that emphatically states, "<i>The practice of psychiatry is considered by Scientologists to be a form of <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extortion.html" title="Extortion">extortion</a> because it has no biological evidence to support it</i>" instead of the consensus that the sentence frame it as the beliefs of Scientologists, "<i>The practice of psychiatry is considered by Scientologists to be a form of <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extortion.html" title="Extortion">extortion</a> because <b>they believe</b> it has no biological evidence to support it.</i>" I left a warning on the anon user's talk page and saw several others have previously warned the user, but the user has simply deleted the warnings and continued to be disruptive. The user has already reverted again since I began this report.</p>

<p>Someone seems to think it's hilariously funny to create silly usernames (User:BJAODN) and declare on their userpage that they are sockpuppets.

<p>I have just blocked Patrick Reynolds for one week because his anti-Semitic attacks are tantamount to vandalism. Another user suggests banning him. If anyone wants to do that, I won't object.

<p>It's moot now, but why didn't anyone just unblock Francis Schonken, since SimonP said he wasn't going to edit the disputed article any more?

<p>I listed above the forks/deleted articles in Everyking's user space merely for informational purposes, but now I'm having second thoughts as to whether they're appropriate.</p>
<p>So I have to ask Everyking: what <b>is</b> the purpose of having those in Wikipedia space? Wikicities exists for that -- and the identical texts (sans Wikilinks) are found in your personal Wikicities Ashlee Simpson Wiki. So what possible reason can there be for those non-Wikipedia articles to be here? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:35, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm, personal whim or something like that, I guess. Maybe I'll use them as scratchpad versions of the article at some point or something. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 01:45, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I see absolutely no reason for Everyking not to have these in his user space. They certainly are not causing any trouble - in my opinion, we should just leave them be -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 00:23, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I see absolutely no reason for him TO have them in his user space -- except possibly for the bogus imprimatur of Wikipedia's prominence in search engines. They're duplicates of the Wikicities versions, so the scratchpad explanation doesn't fly either as a testbed, storage space, or edit history rationale. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:34, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They aren't exactly duplicates. I don't conceive of the Wikicities project as having identical objectives with the set of Ashlee articles here. In using them as scratchpads I'd be working on versions suitable for Wikipedia, whereas if I worked on Wikicities I'd be designing something suitable for that project. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 00:38, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>What's in Wikicities has absolutely no relevance to what's on Wikipedia - for a start, as Everyking says, Wikicities has different objectives - and no NPOV policy. And there is also absolutely no reason for me to have <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_photos_%28full_view%29_ada9.html" title="User:Sannse/photos (full view)">User:Sannse/photos (full view)</a> or User:Sannse/translation request or User:Sannse/Dogs - except that I want them and find them personally useful. We have always given some leeway on User sub-pages, as long as a user is not over doing it - in this case, I don't see that that applies at all. This really is a non-issue in my opinion -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 12:20, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. Let Everyking keep the articles in his userspace, there's no harm done to the main articlespace and only negligible hard disk space. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 18:04, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>WMC's third 3RR violation this month. First three are virtually identical, fourth one reverts out some quotes that were recently added. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin"></a> — <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin">Cortonin</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECortonin_dfe9.html" title="User talk:Cortonin">Talk</a> 09:57, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Connolley</a> 10:21, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)) I protest: number 4 is definitely not a revert: it removes a small amount of text, and is fully explained on the talk page. Cortonins trigger finger is too itchy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It removes 3 paragraphs that were just added in the edit right before yours, and a <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">revert</a> is defined as "a change or an edit made to a page that has the effect of undoing an earlier change or edit on the same page." If someone adds something, and then you remove it right away, then yes, that's a revert. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin"></a> — <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin">Cortonin</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECortonin_dfe9.html" title="User talk:Cortonin">Talk</a> 20:08, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>I just added revert 5, 6, and 7, to show that the part reverted out in 4 is part of a revert war. So that leaves two sets of 3RR violations, 1-4 and 3-7. Any way you cut it up, with or without edit 4, this is at least 1 or 2 violations of the 3RR. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin"></a> — <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin">Cortonin</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECortonin_dfe9.html" title="User talk:Cortonin">Talk</a> 21:30, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I moves one para, removes some grossly POV alnguage from another... well, just like the edit comment says. 6 and 7 are indeed reverts, and properly marked as such, but since there aren't more than 3 in a 24h period the 3RR rule doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added revert 8. So how many are you going to pretend aren't reverts? Even the ones you bothered to label as reverts put you well over the 3RR. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin"></a> — <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin">Cortonin</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECortonin_dfe9.html" title="User talk:Cortonin">Talk</a> 22:00, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>3, 6, 7, and 8 are all marked as reverts by you, and are all in under 24 hours. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin"></a> — <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin">Cortonin</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECortonin_dfe9.html" title="User talk:Cortonin">Talk</a> 22:25, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I excuse myself: the wiki clock and my system clock are 1 hour off (which I now think explains my previous bans too) so I thought I was OK with #6 (which you are calling 8). Well, I'll accept what the admins decide.</li>

<li>This user refuses to accept the concensus reached by various users on the Talk page (zen-master, Kelly Martin, Grace Note, Cberlet, Rama, Viajero, a.o.) and insists on restoring his own version of the text, done in steps, with just enough variation, so that his "reverts" appear not to be technically reverts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Viajero and sockpuppets including Kelly Martin, Grace Note etc. have seized editorial control of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_c079.html" title="Ward Churchill">Ward Churchill</a> and in so doing have inserted unencyclopedic language, made repeated unjustified reverts. The page should probably be protected again as little real progress is being made.

<li>I am not a sockpuppet of Viajero. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 18:52, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>My attempts to cite Viajero/Grace Note (his sock puppet) for the same offense has not been successful. I don't know if that's because Viajero deleted it or because (more likely) I didn't get it right. I was only aware of this 3RR page by looking at the list of Viajero's edits. This is hardly fair, he might have pointed it out in our discussions. I have been careful not to revert because I think that deletes a whole lot of changes at once, I much prefer making individual changes. I would ask also that the Ward Churchill article be protected before it descends into anarchy. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMarvin_acee.html" title="User:TonyMarvin">TonyMarvin</a> 16:55, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It should also be noted that Viajero is reverting to a version that includes emotive and inappropriate language including "kicking off" "lambasting" and a gratuitous reference to Bill O'Reilly. I have at length discussed all changes on the Talk page and invited and encouraged and responded to debate. Viajero and sockpuppets have not. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMarvin_acee.html" title="User:TonyMarvin">TonyMarvin</a> 16:57, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>In fact looking at the above links, they are not reverts at all. What is Viajero going on about&#160;? <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMarvin_acee.html" title="User:TonyMarvin">TonyMarvin</a> 17:00, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>LOL. I've been accused of many things, but this really is the first time anyone has accused me of being a sock! I'm thrilled. Look, Tony, you're not discussing things on the talk page and not being listened to. You're yelling that "O'Reilly must go" and then reverting. I disagree with Slim that you are not breaking the 3RR. I think you are. You're doing the sneaky, technical revert thing. Okay, I don't want to see you blocked, because that will just make you think that there's a conspiracy to silence you because there isn't. What I want you to do is put a list of the things that concern you on the talkpage, discuss them in good faith with the other editors involved, including their hosiery, and not get involved in a painful and protracted conflict. Look, one of the editors involved even began a process to avoid editwarring by putting the intro on the talk page and letting us fight over it there! A very good idea actually, because it leaves the article stable. Come on, Tony, you want your concerns heard so use the right road to expressing them. Revert-warring will just end in people's not hearing you at all.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 23:22, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I feel a bit uneasy about this too, but there's no doubt something weird was going on. I left him a note on his talk page when it first blew up, explaining there was a concern that he might have stolen someone's ID, and that I'd like to help him sort it out; and I said for reasons of privacy, he should e-mail me and we could talk about it. He never did, so he can't have been that bothered. He made almost no useful edits. He posted once or twice to the talk page of the supposed neighbor who was hounding him saying: "Stop telling people I'm a rapist," so <i>he</i> was spreading it as much as the neighbor was. Then giving his full name, including middle name, where he lives, and his photograph on his user page: very few editors do that, and you'd think wanted rapists might think twice. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:14, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Total troll bait. As the editor who raised this matter to the attention of both the board and Keb Bogan himself, I was nonetheless in favour of clarification (and, bottom line, technically, it didn't matter which of his accounts was blocked, so long as the ip wasn't) from him. Something as simple as another picture that isn't registered by a law enforecment agency. But he failed to produce it, and at any rate, the subject seems mute for now. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 09:07, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>having said that, the "KB temporary" explanation sounds somewhat credible.

<li>It shows nothing of the sort, and none of those editors are sockpuppets. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:53, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Only three of these edits are reverts and one of those is a rerevert because I reverted to the wrong version; there are therefore only two reverts within that time frame. I specifically refused to revert after the second reversion to avoid running into the 3RR; obviously there was no shortage of editors willing to revert the ongoing bad faith edits that led up to the protection. Yes, I made more than three edits to that article in a 24 hour period, but that's not what 3RR prohibits. Furthermore, 3RR (as I understand it) does not apply to reverting vandalism and other bad faith edits; I contend that <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMarvin_acee.html" title="User:TonyMarvin">TonyMarvin</a>'s edits to this article have been in the nature of bad faith edits. The reversions are clearly supported by consensus, as is evidenced by repeated reverts by multiple other editors prior to the page being protected. Finally, I have no sock puppets (unless you want to count my former user, User:Kmartin, which I simply stopped using because I didn't like how it was capitalized, and which has not made an edit in quite a long time; I'm not even sure what the password is anymore). I suspect (but obviously have no proof) that the sockpuppets who launched the edit war that led up to the page's reprotection belong to <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMarvin_acee.html" title="User:TonyMarvin">TonyMarvin</a>, based on the content of those sockpuppet's user pages, edit comments, and talk page comments, although it's possible that the sockmaster was simply someone working in concert with <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMarvin_acee.html" title="User:TonyMarvin">TonyMarvin</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I believe the reverts of Kelly Martin to be outside the guidelines permitted. It should be noted the Ward Churchill article has been subject to repeated editing wars, prompted by Kelly Martin's non-consultative style. Is there a way of investigating the connection between Kelly Martin, Viajero, Grace Note and the other users guilty of extreme POV promotion. It is their misconduct that led to the article being protected for the second time in a week! <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMarvin_acee.html" title="User:TonyMarvin">TonyMarvin</a> 23:11, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The links don't show reversions of the same material. Also, for future reference, instead of writing "time" after the diff, it's helpful to include the time and date of the edit, so that admins can see over what period the edits took place. As for the sockpuppet query, I'd say it's pretty clear that these are all legitimate editors, though a sockpuppet on the other side of the edit war today meant the article had to be protected. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:28, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Slim, how do I put the time in? and how do I show the reversions of the same material? I believe investigating all the sockpuppets and users acting in concert is essential for the integrity of the article. While obviously experimental in nature I would like to pursue this inquiry through. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMarvin_acee.html" title="User:TonyMarvin">TonyMarvin</a> 23:32, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>TonyMarvin, what you call extreme POV promotion, I call cleaning up POV vandalism. The article required protection because of the actions of sock puppet accounts and yourself. The talk page is for actually debating and discussing; listing the same thing over and over again to make it seem like you are interested in debate and trying to trick people into believing your extreme POV and suggestive word choices are valid doesn't count. There is near consensus that the current version is neutral, the only active discussion on the talk page is over minor items, especially when compared to the content you and the sock puppets are trying to add. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 23:35, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zen-master, be very clear. I have no sockpuppets. You have made edits in suspiciously close lock-step with Viajero, Grace Note, Kelly Martin and probably some others. Then there are vandals that seem to come and go. I am very much out on my own. I have no sockpuppets and it seems no friends in wanting a neutral article that discloses all pertinent facts. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMarvin_acee.html" title="User:TonyMarvin">TonyMarvin</a> 23:41, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I want to note that the three-revert rule applies to <b>pages</b> not specific material. You may not revert a <i>page</i> three times. We should not even be arguing about that anyway. Let's try to sort our differences out by talking them out, not by quibbling over who is reverting what when and how. What does that solve? Getting each other blocked doesn't actually resolve the issue. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 01:10, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
