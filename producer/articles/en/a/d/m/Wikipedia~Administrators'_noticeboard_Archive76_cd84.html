<p>I've seen it suggested by several people now that we have way too many <a href="../../../e/_/_/CAT%7EE_4edb.html" title="CAT:E">essays</a>, and that several of these should be removed, deleted or userfied. That probably does not include the dozen ex-proposals I mentioned earlier; it's more about the pointless rants or incomplete opinion pieces. However, <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMFD_9ce3.html" title="WP:MFD">WP:MFD</a> tends to be of the opinion that essays are harmless and should be kept. Apparently opinions vary. So, perhaps we should get some volunteers to userfy parts of CAT:E to the principal author? Or is it not worth or trouble? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:05, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd oppose this in general. In Cat:E is some light hearted pieces and some useful stuff that commands some support and certainly illuminates. Perhaps what we should have is a move to userfy stuff which is solo-authored AND quixotic (= opinion that hardly anyone agrees with). Perhaps a first step is do split CAT:E into</dd>

<li><b>Cat:General Essays</b> a 'category for essays that are (or may become) multi-author works and either balance differing views or represent views that held by a majority or very substantial minority of the community' all these must be in project space.</li>
<li><b>Cat:User Essays</b> = 'a category for most mono-authored pieces, or essays representing clearly small minority opinions' - this category should generally exist in userspace, although there can be honourable exceptions for pieces that are often used, clearly collaborative, amusing, or deemed to be of wider interest. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 12:20, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I foresee that splitting into "general" and "user" essays will lead to more tag warring over people who disagree that their essay is a minority opinion. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:26, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm of the opinion that essays that don't enjoy general support should be userfied, the move for an extra Category that Doc suggests would be a useful way for users with their own essays to advertise them. But generally any contributions shouldn't be deleted totally (just moved to user space) --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 12:22, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>There are almost no essays that "enjoy general support", since the whole point of essays tends to be to given an opinion.

<li>I predict that without some sort of a general consensus about this it is liable to cause a serious disruption. There should be a general consensus based upon some sort of criteria. One of the criteria could consist of a threshhold of a number of "What links here" link backs a given essay has with the thinking that the more links a given essay has the more liable it is to have community recognition/acceptance. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott"><span title="Leave me a message.">→</span></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey" title="Go to my userpage.">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 12:32, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would strongly support a move to userfy most essays. There is room for a fair amount of stuff in project space that's neither a policy or a guideline but the essay tag is over used and abused by people who simpy want to advertise their (non-consensual) opinion. People are free to express themselves (and even collaborate if they wish) in userspace there's no need to clog up Wikipedia space with conflicting opinions. However, I do support keeping userfied essays in a category to facilitate finding them, which can help avoid redundancy. Why express myself in an essay if someone else has already written a better one that I can refer to? I don't like Doc's idea of a two tiered category since I fear it would encourage <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWNing</a> of essays. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 12:43, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem with userfying is that they make what could be corporate works the 'property' of one user. There's another problem, even essays that are contravertial or minority can still be useful. Take <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> - yes a lot of people hate it, but snowballing happens - new users want to know what the hell that's about. WP:SNOW explains it - and can flag up the problems and objections. If we userfied it, we'd lose that resource and certainly the cross-space redirect WP, since that can't go to userspace. I suspect that there may be many essays like that. Even recording the arguments for a highly unpopular position can be useful. Perhaps the solution is to require essays in project space to be roughly NPOV - i.e. record the arguments for AND against the position and indicate levels of support or objection - no WP:OWNing. If you want to write an op-ed, then that goes in userspace.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 13:20, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><small>&lt;edit conflict&gt;</small>I think it's a good move. I can't see an issue with the <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWNing</a> of essays if you are already suggesting they be userfied. By userfying them you are indicating ownership. I support the split. I also think a few of our essays can be merged. <a href="../../../22/i/n/Wikipedia%7E_In_popular_culture__articles_a4c6.html" title="Wikipedia:&quot;In popular culture&quot; articles">Wikipedia:"In popular culture" articles</a> could be merged to <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIV_4692.html" title="WP:TRIV">WP:TRIV</a>, and couldn't all the Wikipedia:Don't... be merged into one?. God help me for suggesting it, but maybe we need a proposal method for Wikipedia namespace essays. Things like <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> are obviously immensely useful, in fact to my mind they'd be guidance, but we use a different definition of guidance on Wikipedia. I can't work out where our little area is of useful pages that do have a high level of support but which aren't guidelines should go, because essay imparts a polemical nature. Maybe a {{refpage}} tag for stuff like beans and independent sources and those listed above, stuff that gets referenced a lot and helps explain something on Wikipedia. "This page is widely used as a reference point across Wikipedia. If you have been directed here, it is because the points made on this page were thought relevant to a debate you are involved in or edits you have contributed. It is not a guideline or policy, but has wide community support as an outline of community opinion on the point in question." Something like that. I mean, <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> is certainly an expression of community opinion, I think we'd all agree with that even if there isn't wide agreement that it is a policy.

<dd>I guess it's an issue of quantity and quality. There's a LOT of essays, several probably should be merged, others that serve no real purpose should be userfied. It would be an exercise that at the very least would help us examine their content and make people think a bit. It may even lead to some revision of policy --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 13:45, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I continue to hold the (minority?) opinion that the policy/guideline/essay system is rather useless.</p>
<p>Tagging and categorization in general seem to be somewhat at random, and this is equally true in the project namespace.</p>
<p>This means that userfication would also be at random, and in the end, would likely be useless, destructive, or otherwise problematic&#160;:-P.</p>
<p>Much of the process bloat is due to people inadvertantly playing <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomic.html" title="Nomic">nomic</a> in the project namespace&#160;;-) something which I think is probably impossible to stamp out by now.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could move key sections of our guidelines to meta or elsewhere? --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 13:44, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe we should also look at it from the perspective of new users; There's a HUGE amount of (sometimes conflicting) policy, guidelines and essays. generally reviewing what we have now and trying to make sense of them would be a step to clarifying where consensus has got us. --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 13:48, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't overly disagree Kim, but I think lamenting the tagging and categorisation as being somewhat random is a poor reason to not unrandomise it. It may well be that the policy/guideline/essay system is rather useless, but so far it appears to be the best of the alternatives. I am not sure we can dump these off on meta either, I seem to remember them clearing out their space. Wasn't their a dispute over who should host <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a>, I seem to remember meta trying to foist that off on us? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:55, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Strong suggestion to let sleeping dogs lie</b>. Essays are a way in which people articulate their opinions and let off steam. Wherever they are located, at best they provoke thinking, at worst when misused we can say "don't misuse them" and deal with it on an as-needed basis. The level of irritation and friction between users on WP is already needlessly high; starting discussions---which I am sure will at some point be quite passionate---about "we will now rename/move/userfy/reclassify your essay" will generate friction far in excess of the benefit it will bring".

<p>This article has been subject to a prolonged dispute for several months. Recently this dispute got worse when one user, Randroide, made a series of contested changes to the main article and ignored all objections by other editors involved in the dispute. Despite this I have continued to make efforts to resolve the dispute following the procedures laid down in <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>. To date I have attempted to launch one RfC and two RfM’s. None of these initiatives have been able to get off the ground either because they were directly blocked, or because of other actions taken by Randroide. Last weekend we had a RfM ready to go with agreed bullet points and nobody apparently against. At the last minute Randroide halted that initiative claiming he now wanted an RFC. This morning, having agreed to the RFC, Randroide has coupled this with a massive undiscussed edit on the Aftermath article concerning the train bombings – in my view nothing more than an open provocation to the other users involved.</p>
<p>This dispute is dragging on and getting worse, Randroide is openly contemptuous of anyone who suggests he is not entitled to do what he likes with disputed articles and seems determined to impose his will on the other editors involved. It is now time this dispute was forced into arbitration so that we are not obliged to endlessly battle with a user who seeks any opportunity to evade having to deal with those who not agree with his point of view. I believe someone urgently needs to tell him to desist from unilateral and controversial edits while the disputed status of the article is sorted out. I hope someone can act to stabilise this situation and to make it clear that all parties to the dispute must be respected. Southofwatford 15:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would like to express my annoyance about the fact that an old list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Registered_bots&amp;oldid=108681504" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Registered_bots&amp;oldid=108681504" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> that was dated, but often accurate, was changed to (<a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Status_06fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Status">Wikipedia:Bots/Status</a>) with all bots set to "discontinued" and then every bot operator was spammed to update their status. And now one apparently risks having bots blocked for not following through with bureaucracy that was largely unnecessary to begin with. The way to update an old list is not to simply go through and declare every entry is discontinued until proven otherwise. A much smarter way would be to start by going through and checking which bots are still making contributions. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 23:08, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really wish people would think their actions through a bit more before reversing another administrator's actions.

<p>What, is this annual now? A massive wheel war in February? The userbox war just happened a year ago (February 6, 2006). I think the UBX could be a bit predicted, especially after the controversey surrounding admin deletions (Kelly Martin, MarkSweep, creation of WP:DRV/UBX), and the existence of Daniel Brandt's bio has been controversial also. I'd wager GNAA, but that was deleted a few months ago. Hbdragon88 00:16, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jimbo has long regarded wheel-warring as considerably worse than other forms of admin misconduct--it is indeed the only reason he has ever personally de-sysopped anyone.

<dd>Not really , on 2/14 there was a first harassment by anonymous 130.126.15.57 which I ignored until it was followed by a second harassment coming from 130.126.15.145. If this is not stalking, what is? You have two sockpuppets right in front of you (130.126.15.145 /130.126.15.57) why take "their" word over mine?

<p><b>Comment from ArbCom plaintiff</b></p>
<p>I find this whole matter deeply distressing, as it is brought by a supporter of my opposer in the ArbCom, has been introduced into the ArbCom situation, and is against an uninvolved person, and this all rubs off on me. This is very improper and ill-timed, though very strategically timed if one wishes to <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison_the_well.html" title="Poison the well">poison the well</a> against me by using guilt by association involving a likely innocent (and thus falsely accused) person. I have no idea of the truth or falsity of this matter, only that it is improper to make it a part of an on-going ArbCom, especially when it has nothing to do with me, and even if the charge is true against Shot info, only has relevance if it can be proven that it involves improper editing. -- <i><b><a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee"><font color="#004000">Fyslee</font></a></b></i> (<b><a href="../../../f/y/s/User_talk%7EFyslee_First_law_33a5.html" title="User talk:Fyslee/First law"><font color="#990099" size="1">collaborate</font></a></b>) 11:43, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Note: This COI issue is secondarily focused on the very relevant RfArb question of whether Ilena "jumped or was pushed", and to a degree exculpates any negative interactions assigned to you, on a percentage basis. (The later primary issue is the COI's impact on QW-land articles and altmed editors in general.) The real timing issue is that it is still somewhat premature <i>for me</i>, that I have less data, analysis and preparation than <i>I prefer</i> (click, full auto nail gun) for such a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk%3AShot_info#Interesting_development" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk%3AShot_info#Interesting_development" rel="nofollow">possible</a> confrontation.

<dd>There is no implication that you are pre-involved, it does not even make logical sense and I didn't notice it. If a "super secret agent" is going in under deep cover, one doesn't tell an evangelist or extrovert about it. It is not that you will deliberately mention it, rather just that at some point, your conversation will likely assume or otherwise radiate it to watchful eyes. Think if I had informed Ilena what I thought 6 weeks ago...

<dd>Unfortunately for Shot_info, he is in a difficult position between loyalty to organizations &amp; family and my insistence that he now come clean about this COI, after participating in provocative edits earlier this week that affects an editor subject to a RfArb. His challenges to me as bluffing could not be more mistaken, I am loaded, my personality not a natural attacker. I often wait too long and have given him extra, progressive hints about my concerns over the last 5 weeks, primarily readable by him, and extra chances to avoid confrontation as I think his voluntary handling would be most efficient and least compromising to him and those whom he feels strong loyalty to.

<p>I found the blitzkrieg DRV on Daniel Brandt curious enough to go to the #wikipedia-en-admins channel to find out if people there know what's going on. I found it even more curious that the editors who voted endorse on the DRV where largely the same editors who were present in the channel. It turns out that the link to the DRV was posted, but there was no soliciting for meat puppets. Anyway, after a mass of editors from that channel voted endorse, the DRV was quickly closed per WP:SNOW.</p>
<p>This brings up a problem with WP:SNOW and IRC. Many editors hang out in various IRC channels, and links to deletion and other discussion inevitably get posted. If those channels contain likeminded people, we get a big influx of votes for the same position at once, before the general readership even gets the chance to review the case. If such a discussion is closed early, we can't really tell what the final result would have been, so WP:SNOW should not apply.</p>
<p>The other thing is the #wikipedia-en-admins channel itself, or rather its name. I was told that it's no longer an admin-only channel, but rather "an informal gathering of interested, trustworthy and influential people". Without going into the actual trustworthyness and influence, I question whether the channel should keep its current name, which implies that it's something it isn't. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 17:17, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The only response I can manage here is to wonder where you were a month ago when all of this was publicly discussed by prominent members of the community, including non-arbitrators.

<li>This has nothing to do with that debate, and it would probably have been better if I brought it up in two separate comments. There's no implication that the deletion was planned or anything in #wikipedia-en-admins, it could have been any other channel and we would have the same problem with WP:SNOW.</li>

<dd>I do wonder sometimes if an issue is ever actually dead on Wikipedia. I think that Brandt and Peppers prove that. And so does this. It's not a cabal or anything close to it.

<p>The IRC channel didn't really have anything to do whatsoever with the Daniel Brandt wheel war mess. That all started from on-wiki. Actually, if anything, the IRC channel helped alleviate the issue. I saw several people being dissuaded from continuing the wheel war by strong admonitions such as "Don't do it, you'll get de-sysopped" ... which ended up being eerily accurate. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 21:45, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Indeed, the same thing came up on #wikipedia-spam-t and I remember saying "Don't go an inch near that whole mess if you value your sysop bit, because it's just going to get messy" which seems to have been a similar realisation to Cyde's. ✎ <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_M_Dodge_b77b.html" title="User:Peter M Dodge"><font color="#669966">Peter M Dodge</font></a> (<a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_M_Dodge_3d4d.html" title="User talk:Peter M Dodge"><font color="#669966">Talk to Me</font></a>)</span> 22:04, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Errr... I was talking about a problematic interaction of IRC and WP:SNOW. As I say above, it could've been any other channel. I obviously screwed up by including the other issue in the same comment. So please, forget cabal talk, and think about how a single announcement of a poll in IRC, followed by earnest application of WP:SNOW can cause problems. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 00:55, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could someone please take a look at Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Robotam, please? It's been created and "certified" by three editors - one of whom has under 50 edits, one that has three, and an anon.

<p>I've left a notice at <a href="../../../p/a/s/User_talk%7EPastorwayne_f54c.html" title="User talk:Pastorwayne">User talk:Pastorwayne</a>, due to multiple situations, requests and comments, both in the past and present.</p>
<p>It would seem obvious he's well-meaning, but he's also apparently forcing his POV.</p>
<p>And even though he's been warned several times, he's continuing his disruptive creations.</p>
<p>To make it clear this is a history of <i>many</i> categories, over a period of months.</p>
<p>However, I hesitate to block. for a couple reasons:</p>
<p>1.) "How much is too much" could be considered subjective. (The cry of: "That's what <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECfD_3468.html" title="WP:CfD">WP:CfD</a> is for...", rings in my ears.)</p>
<p>2.) I think this could set a precedent that could be abused, related to the above. ("You created x number of categories which went up for CfD, so now you're blocked.") - Though I honestly can't imagine an admin doing such a thing, I've been surprised in the past&#160;: )</p>
<p>3.) If blocking <i>is</i> appropriate, then we should probably discuss a community ban, since it's been an ongoing issue. (At least from methodist, or even christian-related categories.)</p>
<p>4.) I want to give some time after the warning.</p>
<p>Interested in others' thoughts.</p>
<p>PS - I don't think I would oppose a short block by another disinterested party.</p>

<dd>First off, that is a very good post you made on Pastorwayne's talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To the issue at hand, I think you made a fair and valid warning. A block would only be appropriate if continued disruption occurs after the message, so that the user is prevented from misbehaving more while the discussion of appropriate action is undertaken. I don't see a block at the moment for preventative reasons- no dialogue+disruption= a day or two. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 04:58, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am one of the people who has seeked administrative assistance regarding Pastorwayne. I read through jc37's comments, and I think he missed one key point. Some of the categories that Pastorwayne has recently created are effectively the recreation of deleted content, which is clearly disruptive. See the discussion at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_Log_2007_February_15_4494.html#Category:Methodism_in_Ohio" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2007 February 15">Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2007 February 15#Category:Methodism in Ohio</a>.

<p>Well, rather than address my concerns, he created another category. He could have explained his reasoning behind the primate categories, but instead, seems to have ignored the warning and created another one. I think that he qualifies for a block based on at least the two following criteria on <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Wikipedia:Disruptive editing</a>: "Is tendentious" and "Rejects community input". I think that this also brings us to step 5 at <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html#Dealing_with_disruptive_editors" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Wikipedia:Disruptive editing#Dealing with disruptive editors</a>.</p>
<p>Based on that, I'm instituting a 24-hour block. I <i>do</i> welcome further comments on this. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 15:20, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also good block. Will give the user time to respond and re-think. Probably could have done with even shorter, or an unblock if they're willing to discuss. If no discussion and the same repeated problem editing repeats, then escalate the blocks. I've seen escalating blocks be very effective. Start with the minimum to mitigate the behavior and then increase as they continually repeat without improving. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 17:58, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Taxman suggested escalating blocks. This is where I plead lack of experience. My understanding is that IP blocks are a bit more complex. Also, at this point, he seems to have stopped, so he may just be waiting out the 24 hour block. This probably justifies a notice, and perhaps an extension of the block? While I've read the various pages, I think I would rather err on the side of caution and ask someone more experienced in IP blocks, for suggestions. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 07:40, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>After doing some reading, and giving this some more thought, I think that the best next course of action would be for one of you to start an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RfC</a> concerning pastorwayne's category creations/inclusions. I would prefer that it not be posted until after he in unblocked, however, out of fairness, giving him full opportunity to respond. While the block may have been justified, I think that for further action, <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> should be followed if possible. Though if he continues to be disruptive, or attempt to evade the current block, other measures may also be necessary. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 21:01, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some Wikipedians seem to have a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_ProtectionBot_d8bc.html#Oppose" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ProtectionBot">profoundly negative reaction</a> to the idea of adminbots. <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> operated the only "approved" adminbot in our history, and that approval is somewhat questionable since in addition to the widely known pagemove preventing functions, Curps also quietly added functions to block vandals and bad usernames. The response of the community to automating admin functions has been so poor in fact that, like Curps, many bots and bot-like tools get built and deployed in secret with little or no community oversight.</p>
<p>Personally, I like the idea of admin bots. There are a variety of places where they could be useful, such as deleting orphaned fair use images older than 7 days (<a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD</a> I5). Done well, they could perform repetitive tasks with greater care than real admins often do. To use the orphaned fair use example, they could a) verify that the image is an orphan, b) check the history to ensure the tag is at least 7 days old, c) check the histories to make sure no comments (that might be challenging the deletion) have been posted to either the image description or the talk page, and d) post a note to the uploader's talk page to explain the deletion.</p>
<p>However, we don't do these things well. Rather we do them in near total secrecy, and both deleting and blocking bots are run on Wikipedia with no transparency or openness.</p>
<p>What follows is meant to address the deletion part of that. I ran an analysis of a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/database_dump" class="extiw" title="m:database_dump">database dump</a> of our log files looking for unusual deletion patterns, and will report my results here. I am not doing so because I want to get anyone in trouble, but rather because I believe the secret use of highly automated deletion tools is bad for Wikipedia, and it is time these things came into the light.</p>
<p>After experimenting with some different approaches, I found one particular diagnostic to be especially useful. This I have defined as a "run", which for the purposes of the analysis below means at least 100 consecutive deletions each separated by no more than 1 minute. Of the 1097 admins who had made at least 1 deletion in the log, 95.4% have 0 runs. 2.9% have 1-2 runs, 0.3% have 3-4 runs, and the remaining 15 individuals (1.4%) have 5 or more runs. Now, deleting 100 items at a rate of 1 per minute is not an impossible feat to do by hand, and I certainly suspect that some people have done it by hand. However, some of those highest 15, shown below, have done it dozens of times and at very high speeds (typically only several seconds per item). It is this pattern of repeated, long sets of deletions occurring at high rates that I am using as a qualitative indicator of bot-like activity.</p>

<li>Total deletions is the number of logged deletions an account has performed through February 6th, 2007. The rank is where the account sits in the list of all-time most deletions. It is worth noting that 9 of the top 20 deleters in fact have 0 runs.</li>
<li>"# of runs" is the total number of runs detected. As above, a "run" is defined by the consecutive deletion of 100 or more items with no breaks longer than 1 minute.</li>
<li>"Fastest 100 deletions" is the shortest length of time in which the person was able to delete 100 items. This can happen at any point within a run.</li>
<li>"Longest run" is the run with the highest number of total deletions.</li>
<li>"Longest semi-run" is the most deletions detected at an average rate of greater than 1 deletion per minute, but pauses of up to 2 hours were allowed within a "semi-run" (provided the average rate including the pause was still greater than 1 per minute).</li>
<li>For all of these, deletions of old revisions of images where excluded from statistics. This is because "deleting all revisions" of an image produces multiple log entries for a single action, and if these had been included it would have skewed results.</li>

<p>There once was a time when prolonged, rapid-fire editing was the definition of a bot (regardless of how it was accomplished). Now <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT</a> is more circumspect so that if every action is "approved" by a human then perhaps it isn't really a "bot". In discussion with several of the people above, it seems this line is pretty blurry. Some are using "bots" in the sense that they instruct their computer to delete everything in category:X and the computer does so without further intervention. Some are using semi-automatic tools (such as <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~jude/delete.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~jude/delete.php" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>) that allow an admin to reduce the bothersome process of emptying out a category to one click per item (without needing to ever open the item to look at it). At least one of the people above even claims to be able to do the activities shown all by hand. Rather the detailing what I know (or have inferred) about each case, I am rather going to invite these people to explain their own methods.</p>
<p>Highly automated deletion tools can be problematic for a variety of reasons. For example, a semi-automatic tool created problems a while ago when it was used to empty out images marked as Fair Use Replaceable without checking if {{<a href="../../../r/e/p/Template%7EReplaceable_fair_use_disputed_a5fb.html" title="Template:Replaceable fair use disputed">replaceable fair use disputed</a>}} had been added, and hence the disputes went ignored. Similarly, I would note that some people using such tools appear to have been deleting old <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PRODs</a>, which certainly goes against the spirit that at least two people will <i>look at the item</i> and agree that it should be deleted. Regardless of how it is accomplished, any process that reduces deletion to a few seconds per item is not engaged in any meaningful sort of review. That may be okay in some cases, but we ought to discuss which cases those are.</p>
<p>I don't have anything against adminbots and highly automated tools, in general, and in fact would like to see their use increased. However, having such tools operate in secret is begging for problems as it means that there is no oversight in their design or their application. That is why I am posting this here. I don't want to get any of the above users in trouble, but I do think that we as a community need to confront the fact that automation is useful for dealing with the ever growing deletion backlogs, and talk about the best way to do that, rather than having individuals simply apply automation in secret. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 20:43, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is problem if there is a rule against bot use and it is detected that that rule is being broken. There is a problem if someone does something that hurts wikipeia and they are allowed to get away with it with the excuse that it wasn't them but that it was a bot. I see no problem with an editor using an detected bot if that editor takes full responsibility for anything that goes wrong, including being discovered using an unpermitted bot. If we can't tell its a bot and its doing no harm, what's the problem? Some people are very bot like. Bot like editing is no cause for alarm. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 21:42, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Bots? Sure? If I chose to simply ignore those which are not immediately self-evident, I could easily rack up a hundred deletions in no time at all when the CSD backlog gets up to 300 or more.

<li>You, JzG, have never strung together more than 40 deletions without a 1 minute pause, and your personal best for 100 deletions is over 13 minutes (compare with under 3 minutes for some of those above). Yep.

<ul>
<li>Maybe this seems obvious, but I'm not sure I understand. How are "runs" of less than a half an hour evidence of bot deletions? Can't just about anyone maintain a fast deletion pace for a half an hour? That seems plausible to me. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 23:29, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Says someone else with 0 runs&#160;;-). And when you do 1100 deletions in that half an hour? Yes, with the right aids, just about anyone could do deletions at the rate of twenty per minute and string hundreds together. That doesn't mean that having admins acting like bots is a good thing. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 23:53, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, well, I freely admit I'm slow at deleting, even at CSD. I'm automatically assuming people are faster than me because I <i>know</i> I'm slow, and I get bored easily.

<li>Javascript will do the trick nicely.

<li>Yup. And if I was apply to just accept that images in the "unsourced for over 7 days" category were unambiguously deletable, I'd be able to match that, because the deletion summaries would all be the same. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">JzG</a> (<a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">contribs</a>) 23:36, 24 February 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li>And then you would be a "bot", in the sense I intended, because you were deleting things without thought simply because a category told you to. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 23:40, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Absolutely not. I would be a human admin rapidly knocking off the easy ones and going back to the hard cases later. Which is not how I work, I go through alphabetical blocks. But others do it differently, assuming good faith of the taggers. I think we wait until we get input from the admins concerned. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:59, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To clarify, I know some people are deleting things from those categories without ever even opening the image description page to see if there even is a source claim, etc (because they have admitted as much to me). Doing that kind of thing turns an admin into a bot. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 00:05, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Indeed, DF, that raises a completely separate question. It would be possible to peruse the image pages thoroughly and still delete at, theoretically, any rate of speed at all, if you did the analysis first (this is how I do it, though since I rely solely on Firefox tabs I still can't get very fast). But if admins are skipping that stage, that's not so great (depending on which category we're talking about), but it won't be reflected in the rate of deletion. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 00:31, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Everyone I know has already been invited to the party, though none have commented so far. I suspect the urge to cut corners is strongly correlated with an urge to delete really, really fast. Whether or not that is really true, most of the people I know of who have admitted cutting corners in the past, said so during off-wiki discussions prompted by this analysis (over the previous several weeks), so they are certainly correlated in my sample. (Which is not to say that high speed deletion, necessarily requires cutting corners, or that everyone above necessarily did so. But let's wait for their direct input.) <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 01:19, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Do note that it is simple to inspect each in a list of pages and then "automatically" delete them all using the Jude tool. The deletions would appear to be "automated"—they would not be by hand, they would have uniform edit summaries and be done in uniform time period—but the pages themselves would have been checked. It would be useful to have an AWB-like tool that shows a page alongside its page history and allows quick deletion with a pre-selected summary. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 23:35, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, I think it shows he's very much not a bot. A slower time to 100 deletions than any of the people listed above. And while "9.42 hrs for 931 deletions" seems extreme... it's still well within what a human could do just sitting at his or her computer all day. The main thing is that he didn't have any "runs" which I do think is an indication of bot activity (though correlation is not causation). Maybe he's not a "normal" human but still human numbers.

<p>I can't help but note that the CSD image backlog is <i>nuts</i> at the moment and has been kind of crazy all day. If someone, anyone, has been doing something to keep it from being this way, and is not doing it at the moment, then whatever they were doing before bears some serious consideration. Not wholesale approval, but consideration. If I'm drawing a false conclusion here so be it. But it's a bit suggestive to me personally. And these image backlogs drive me a little nuts because I'm a total newbie at images and don't feel up to handling them at all efficiently.

I could have maybe done more but kept getting sidetracked (protecting pages from recreation, saving images / pages from invalid speedies, and castigating one very rude image tagger who kept mistagging pages for replacable fair use deletion and labelling any reversions of this as vandalism).

<p>Just sticking a note in here, and apologies if it was mentioned above and I missed it. Last summer, we had a serious problem on Commons with tens of thousands of unsourced and unlicensed images, all of which needed to be deleted because they had been in the "to be deleted" categories for a number of months. As Commons admins, we were concerned about deleting these images, as they woudl be unrecoverable; at that point, a push was made, and image deletions were made reversable by the developers. (If anyone has ever wondered why that came about when it did, there is the answer.) With such a daunting task before us, having to mass-delete tens of thousands of images outright, I had a toolserver tool written that produces "autodelete" links; basically, it creates a link that when clicked, automatically goes to the deletion confirmation page and fills in the summary. (As a side note, I let the Commons community know about this before it was used.) If you enable a javascript snippet in your monobook.js, the links will automatically submit as well. Additionally, there is an extension for Firefox which lets you open multiple links at once. If you use these tools in concert, you can open 100, 250, or 500 autodeletion links at once and have them all submit, in the course of a minute or less. Using this method, I deleted more than 10,000 unsourced and unlicensed images from Commons in a matter of about 24 hours. I point this out because there were no bots involved; only a lot of links, a couple lines of Javascript, and a Firefox extension. Even without the javascript and the firefox extension, this is possible; you can create the links in a text editor, load them into a wiki page, open them all, then go through clicking "ctrl + tab" and hitting "enter", the way Willy on Wheels vandals used to do page moves. When I was still active there, I used this method to delete all the old Quote of the Day archives at the end of each month. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 13:55, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If anybody wants to know, prior to July 2006 I did everything manually. I think maybe July2 or July 3 I did 500 manual image deletions in about 3.5-4 hours. I did use Jude's tool a lot after I was notified of it. The way I did it was to used Special:Recentchangeslinked on the category, to see if the tagging issues had been rectified in the week since, and then manually fix up the tags which were manually tweaked as a result. Then I would go through a sample of maybe 20 articles in the cat to see if the pictures were still being used in articles, and if the 20 I checked were all clear - ie, they had been machine processed by OrphanBot properly or by a human, cleanly, then that would give a statistically good indication that the rest of the pictures in that batch had been de-linked properly and I would use the script to mechanically remove them. It increases the speed by about a factor of two (I'm not using tabs) on my computer anyway. Having said that, I've not done much deletion duty this year since I read too many arbcom cases, but I will refrain from using the script if it is a concern. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 04:14, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Post-archiving, sorry I didn't see the invite to the discussion till now</i> -- I use a semi-automatic tool that loads up the image description page for each image in the unsourced category, asks me if it should be deleted, and then, after I have confirmed, for each and every image, that they should be deleted, it goes though and executes my actions (at bot speed). No deletion is done without a confirmation, after viewing the wiki-text of the image description page (and the last-edit time, and a few other things). The script is written in Python, using the pywikipediabot framework; I have not released the source for it because of concerns over vandal use, and mainly because of the lack of a clear sense of community consenus on the subject. I will send the code to anyone who asks, under a Free Software license (meaing they can post it if they wish). I haven't been using it much lately (as my log shows, mainly because I haven't been logging in to my account lately, mainly because the backlogs (VoA's tool makes them loom over my watchlist) are too depressing.

<p>Admins are currently using a variety of tools to aid deletion, with a wide range of automation. There is nothing wrong with using any tool to speed up the process as long as the admin makes sure to view each page (and relevant logs or whatlinkshere, depending on the process in question) before deleting. There is no consensus in support of total automation; there is also no concrete proof that anyone is using total automation, though it doesn't really matter, since none of us are pointing fingers here—the questions is what there <i>is</i> consensus for. However, any admins using completely automated processes should stop for now. It would be useful, however, to identify processes, as Dragons flight says above, that would work well with total automation. I think we all agree that RFA is not the place to get consensus for such a process, and ultimately it would probably mean running a script in a pre-existing admin account, Curps-style. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 23:53, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>What it all adds up to is some people are scared of things they don't understand. Wikipedia editors should use whatever tools they find useful in improving Wikipedia so long as they take full responsibility for their actions. If a tool is complex enough that you are not sure what it will do then you should not use it; but that does not mean you should stand in the way of someone else using it. I hit a key and know what will happen; John hits a key that executes 100 key strokes; Jane hits a key that conditionally executes keystrokes based on a simple if-then script; Bob hits a key that turns on his artificial intelligence device that guides him step by step in creating a great article. Let us not be afraid of tools. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 06:05, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

D. then accuses me of adding gibberish to the article in restoring prior content, resulting in collateral damage. What the fcuk is that? RE civility, that's more like hypocrisy. Anyhow...

<p>Hi guys - this is a strange one, but I am hoping you can help me out.</p>
<p>When I first started using Wikipedia, I created an article about the place I work (<a href="../../../n/m/u/NMUK_e859.html" title="NMUK">NMUK</a>) - which in hindsight was a stupid thing to do. Over-time the article has grown, and has started to get noticed by management. It has become used as a politcal sounding-board, etc. Now people are trying to find out who made it, etc. Almost like a witchunt. This has started to get me really worried, and I'm beginning to get stressed about it. If the dots are joined and my real world anonymity is breached (which is possible, because I haven't exactly tried to hide it up until this point) it could really cause problems for me at work.</p>
<p>So - I am asking for your help. What can be done? My personal preference is that the article (and therefore it's log) is deleted. If it's genuinely missed, then someone else will recreate it. It's not that good an article anyway. Failing that, can my username be stripped / changed in the log?</p>
<p>I realise what I am asking for breaks the rules of Wikipedia - but I am really worried. At the end of the day this is an online encylopedia - it's not life or death. And in situations where an article can cause problems for people in the real-world, can exceptions not be made?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time. John the mackem 17:08, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, so the Gator1 story has put me into Defcon1 paranoia mode - when I think of how lax I have been with anonymity in the past.

<dd>1) Sockpuppeteers aren't always indefinately blocked along with thier sockpuppets, it's up to the blocking administrator to decide what to do with them (and there is a difference between blocks and bans: bans come from Jimbo Wales, the Arbitration Committee, or the Wikipedia Community acting as a whole; blocks can be placed by any administrator for cause). 2) Removing warnings was once considered vandalism; the last time I remember it being discussed, I believe it was decided that users could remove warnings if they chose to do so. 3) If the edit summary was a continuation of previous conduct, then it may be cause for further blocking. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 21:37, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cross-posted from Yamla's talk page are my thoughts about the unblock:<br />
<i>Please do not overturn checkuser blocks without consulting with the checkuser that conducted the investigation beforehand. These blocks are made due to information the administration in general is not privy to and as such should not be overturned without discussion. In fact, I'm rather of the opinion that no block should be overturned without discussion with the blocking admin, but that's tangential. I would kindly ask that you please reinstate the block pending discussion with <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a>. ✎ <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_M_Dodge_b77b.html" title="User:Peter M Dodge"><font color="#669966">Peter M Dodge</font></a> (<a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_M_Dodge_3d4d.html" title="User talk:Peter M Dodge"><font color="#669966">Talk to Me</font></a>)</span> 21:40, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</i><br />

<li>Left hand not knowing...? Well, seems like it.

I unblocked in what I saw as an absence of tangible indication of new sockpuppetry - nothing concrete mentioned there, no recent entries in the checkuser archives, and the previous re-block at least partly owing to a self-admitted misunderstanding of the blocking admin about the timing. Apologies if I got it wrong, I'll have no objections against another re-block if there are any strong reasons for it. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 23:55, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The fact that all their contibutions since being unblocked are attacks on users, attacks on the checkuser process, and removing sock tags, does not fill me with optimism that he will have ANY valuable contributions.

<dd>You shouldn't remove items from categories you nominate for deletion, no matter whether or not you think it's meaningless, because then people say "delete as unused".

<dd>Sigh. I did not nominate the category for deletion. I noticed a meaningless redlinked category on a city article, that happened to be very similar to the ones that CyclePat had created previously which had caused similar problems with the template. When I saw that, I reverted the edits to the template. At that time, I had no idea that the category was nominated for deletion. Am I crazy, or is it now OK to go make edits that break templates? <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 03:35, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

But it still does not deny the fact that you often patrol CfD's and that this article was nominated for CfD prior to you making these changes.

<dd>So because I noticed the CfD immediately after editing the template, that somehow makes the edits that broke the template OK? Sorry, but I don't see the logic. I actually came across the CfD by checking your edit history -- you had responded to the CfD and and that is how I saw it.

<dd>We cannot host non-commercial only content since May of 2005 by order of Jimbo (the email is on my userpage, if you wish to see it). Pretty much, I think the problem we have here is a lack of documentation of where the image came from and if the license is correct. This is true for non-porn images. I believe in this case we need to be sure about the guys age, if the photo was taken by his request and he has authority to give it the license that he gave. I noticed he had other photos deleted before due to copyright issues, so I think this is a copyright violation. In short; delete unless we can truely say the guy is over 18 and the license is correct. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 08:12, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The image isn't non-commercial in the normal sense (assumming the uploader is legitimate, which is a fair question). The image would only be restricted from commercial use in certain jurisdictions where record keeping requirements apply. Other jurisdictions could use it as is. Let's be clear here though. If we challenge anything where 2257 might apply to a reuser, that is <b>a lot</b> of images. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 08:17, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I'd appreciate some outside people taking a look at this proposal for notability guidelines on churches. On the one hand people say it's necessary and useful because theology is an important academic field; on the other hand there's significant dissent against the proposal on grounds of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:instruction_creep">m:instruction creep</a>, overlap with <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, and the fact that it doesn't come up on AFD more than a handful of times per <i>month</i>.

It came to the point that I believe he was using multiple sockpuppets to insert fake vandalism into his user page as well as other user pages when he spammed the mental health template in many circumstances: (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Yells_at_soup&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110241855" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Yells_at_soup&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110241855" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yells_at_soup&amp;diff=91292453&amp;oldid=91290988" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yells_at_soup&amp;diff=91292453&amp;oldid=91290988" rel="nofollow">this (done under his new account)</a>, and most recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:I_luv_chutney&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=111131051" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:I_luv_chutney&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=111131051" rel="nofollow">this</a>). I feel this indicates strong evidence of what he was sneakily up to while editing Wikipedia. However, I would greatly appreciate if more experienced admins would review this.

<p>Wikipedia is a big target - almost too big for its own good. PR firms love control - it is their business, attempting to control information. To cut to the chase a man (Anthony) who owns a PR firm (Called <a href="http://www.eligo.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.eligo.net/" rel="nofollow">Eligo</a>) had created an elaborate and verbose article on himself, it was AfD'ed and deleted (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Anthony_John_Bailey_df98.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anthony John Bailey">Afd</a>). Another article on him at a different name page was created the day after his first one was deleted - it has now been speedied. One of the contributors to that article was 81.193.124.176 (<a href="../../../8/1/2E/User_talk%7E81.193.124.176.html" title="User talk:81.193.124.176">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.193.124.176_3816.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.193.124.176">contribs</a>). The talk page contains the following from <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax_Kaertner_7a3e.html" title="User:Max Kaertner">Max Kaertner</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/x/User_talk%7EMax_Kaertner_0fc9.html" title="User talk:Max Kaertner">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Max_Kaertner_777f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Max Kaertner">contribs</a>), -</p>
<p><i>"Anthony, a Royal Wedding (yours!) certainly merits notability! Time for Eligo to weigh-in and create a new Wiki article for HSH Princess Marie-Therese von Hohenberg! Don't forget to invite me!"</i>.</p>
<p>I brought this up on here a <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive74_a708.html#Fishy_Page.28s.29" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive74">couple of weeks ago</a>, and at that point identified a number of accounts that seemed to be part of a web - now we appear to have a comment suggesting that it is <i>"Time for Eligo to weigh-in and create a new Wiki article"</i>. How many accounts do they have? Advice on what should be done with all of this is welcomed - because it looks to me that a load of rich mens club PR operators are running around the controls we have in place to stop autobiographical input as well as conflicts of interests.

<dd>Well, the behavior is certainly unfortunate, but being the great-granddaughter of Archduke Ferdinand, whose assassination started World War Ii, is probably at least a good ice-breaker at parties. Since there seems to be not much to comment on in the lives of the betrothed, it might be incorporated into a single article on the descendants of the archduke. That would be too much like genealogy for some tastes, so it too would probably have deletion problems. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 03:30, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>More administrative eyes are needed at <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_Noah_a04b.html" title="Timothy Noah">Timothy Noah</a>. Noah is a journalist for <i><a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_%28magazine%29.html" title="Slate (magazine)">Slate</a></i> magazine who wrote an <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2160222" class="external text" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2160222" rel="nofollow">article</a> on February 24 about Wikipedia's notability guideline using his article as an entry point. Thereafter, Noah's article underwent an Afd (kept) and many, many edits. Today, Noah published a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2160644" class="external text" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2160644" rel="nofollow">follow up article</a> at <i>Slate</i>.

<dd>IMO, it's a newsletter. It's to inform people. Per WP:CANVASS, it could be construed as a "friendly notice" of what's going on in the <a href="../../../u/s/r/WP%7EUSRD_286b.html" title="WP:USRD">WP:USRD</a> world. I did not distribute this newsletter, but I would assume that it went to all those users who are listed as "participants" of the relevent projects, thus opting them in to receiving a newsletter that's considered a part of the project. And they are more than welcome to be removed from receiving the newsletters. To cite the arbitrator: "Briefly, I think a reasonable amount of communication about issues is fine." It was a newsletter provided by the main contributors of a Project to the listed participants of a Project, not to random users, that had a link to an article regarding current events. I don't think it qualifies as true canvassing. <b>--<a href="../../../m/p/d/User%7EMPD01605_77c2.html" title="User:MPD01605"><font style="color: #000099">M</font><font style="color: #FF0000">PD</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../m/p/d/User_talk%7EMPD01605_0e7e.html" title="User talk:MPD01605">T</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPD01605_89a1.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPD01605">C</a></sup></b> 05:24, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, first of all, AfD is not a vote, even if a hundred people voted keep and all they said was I like it and the few that said delete had valid points where it violated policy, it would still get deleted. AfD is a discussion to come to some type of consensus, it's not a democracy. Secondly, notifying other members of a WikiProject that one of the articles of said project is being nominated for deletion is good practice. I am not "watching" every article, so I may not even know an article is nominated since people that nominate articles do not post anything on the WP talk page, which I think they should be required to do. AfD is a process to improve Wikipedia, not to just get rid of articles that someone doesn't like. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolderca1_0bcb.html" title="User:Holderca1">Holderca1</a> 16:01, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Flamviper actually has a pretty interesting suggestion on his talk page right now. He suggests the creation of a template that banned users can use to get the attention of an admin when they have a request other than unblocking.</p>

<p>He wants to call it Template:ATTN, although I think Template:Helpme-admin might also work. Does anyone else think this has merit?

<dd>Is it just me or does the combination of Flameviper and "banned using wanting attention" seem to go rather well together. What's the point? They either want to appeal a block in which case we have the unblock template and mailing list. Or they want to appeal a ban, in which case they email arbcom. What other attnetion is it that a banned user may require? If we banned them why would we want to let them continue to have influence over the project by proxy?

<dd>I can think of a situation where a blocked user would have a legitimate request that something be posted. If he's temporarily blocked while having an RfAr against him, he should have some ability to have his comments (or evidence) listed in the procedings. Not <u>admin</u> action, per se, but something that should only be done by someone who is <b>sure</b> that it wouldn't be proxying.

<dd>Agree 100% with Pgk on this. Any user can use email if they have a request other than unblocking, including requesting an Arbcom case, unprotection of their talk page or right to vanish (which would seem to be the only valid requests, anything else would be a request to proxy). In this particular case I can assure everyone from experience that Flameviper is willing to use email, but the thing about email is that it only gains you the brief attention of whoever you send it to up until the point they delete it. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 10:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those pages leave many questions unanswered. For example, if an account is <i>indef-blocked</i>, but not <i>banned</i>, can that person simply open a new account and continue editing? Can this new account be then blocked as <i>reincarnation of a banned user</i>, or can the new account continue to edit if the behavior that caused the original block is not continued? If a logged-in user edits (or appears to edit) from an open proxy -- even once -- can that <i>user</i> (rather than the <i>ip address</i>) be indef-blocked for open proxy use? Also, if a user is indef-blocked for any reason, and unblock is declined, can that user appeal to WP:ANI or elsewhere? It appears to me that indef-blocks (vs. bans, which are community reviewed) are subject to a lot of potential abuse. - <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEMET-MET_6981.html" title="User:EMET-MET">EMET-MET</a> 17:25, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm beginning to think that the random article link in the navigation box on the left of the screen probably causes more harm than good. It makes it easy for vandals to find obscure pages to vandalize, many of which will likely stay vandalized for some time. If the link were removed, vandalism would still continue, but it would likely be much more centered around notable, carefully watched pages (e.g. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>) and be easy to revert, as opposed to obscure pages (what vandal is actually going to type "<a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolls-Royce_Corniche_%282000%29_2ce5.html" title="Rolls-Royce Corniche (2000)">Rolls-Royce Corniche (2000)</a>" into the search bar and hit go?) As for the benefits to having the random page link, the only one I can think of is that it's a nice little diversion for visitors, but such benefits seem small in comparison to its pretty much given encouragement of vandalism. I propose that it be removed, or at least be made a registered user-only feature.--<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzer_Red_d6c7.html" title="User:Azer Red"><font color="Darkred"><b>Azer Red</b></font></a> <a href="../../../a/z/e/User_talk%7EAzer_Red_02c0.html" title="User talk:Azer Red"><font color="red"><i>Si?</i></font></a> 22:31, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's nice for readers to find new subjects! I've always used it to find bad articles and articles needing fixing as well.

<dd>It's pretty obvious that this is how they find articles on lesser-known subjects. I mean, seriously, do you think that the casual vandal actually types <a href="../../../a/m/%C3%A9/Am%C3%A9d%C3%A9e_Baillot_de_Guerville_1e48.html" title="Amédée Baillot de Guerville">Amédée Baillot de Guerville</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_Kashi_Vidyapeeth_5d2c.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth">Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth</a> into the search bar and clicks "go"? Heck no, they just keep clicking the random page button and vandalizing whatever article comes up. That button is a vandal's best friend, since it prevents them from actually having to think of a subject to vandalize.--<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzer_Red_d6c7.html" title="User:Azer Red"><font color="Darkred"><b>Azer Red</b></font></a> <a href="../../../a/z/e/User_talk%7EAzer_Red_02c0.html" title="User talk:Azer Red"><font color="red"><i>Si?</i></font></a> 22:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but the flip side is that it's the wikignome's best friend as well. If you want to find random commas to fix, or random pages that have slipped through new page patrol and need to be speedy / prodded - a good way to do it is to sit there hitting "random" until you find something that needs fixing or tagging. (Or at least that's how I do it - others may have better methods.) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 22:56, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd suggest either keeping it or removing it for anons; I know that it could definitely be used to find articles to fix, as TheOtherBob said. However, there is the consideration of how similar this is to protecting every page (allowing users to edit encourages vandalism!) <a href="../../../v/e/i/User%7EVeinor_0082.html" title="User:Veinor">Veinor</a> <a href="../../../v/e/i/User_talk%7EVeinor_8b70.html" title="User talk:Veinor"><sup>(talk to me)</sup></a> 23:00, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally I find the random link a fascinating object - you never know where you will be going next. Should the focus of wikipedia be to protect all content at all costs from vandalism - or should it be to promote content at all costs at the expense of all? Of course the reality lies in the middle - but I think the random link lies on the right side of the line. Neither of the articles you linked to have been vandalised - and a quick test by me on hitting the link and selecting obscure articles (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mirror_of_Production_01b8.html" title="The Mirror of Production">The Mirror of Production</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheikh_Abdullah_ibn_Zaid_Al_Nahayan_77c1.html" title="Sheikh Abdullah ibn Zaid Al Nahayan">Sheikh Abdullah ibn Zaid Al Nahayan</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_J._O%27Donnell_ed97.html" title="James J. O'Donnell">James J. O'Donnell</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk_Windmills_Trust_ba82.html" title="Norfolk Windmills Trust">Norfolk Windmills Trust</a>) show that none of them have been vandalised either. The vandals who wish to target obscure articles will do so anyway, random link or no random link - just clicking a trail through articles from well known ones can very quickly (within 3 or 4 links) deliver you to something very obscure anyway - they will always find a method. <a href="../../../s/f/c/User%7ESFC9394_9d0f.html" title="User:SFC9394">SFC9394</a></dd>

<dd>Indeed, but going from <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhi.html" title="Gandhi">Gandhi</a> (probably something that a lot of the juvenile school vandals will have been asked to find out about for some class exercises) is one click away from <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhism.html" title="Gandhism">Gandhism</a> which is one click away from your target article, <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_Kashi_Vidyapeeth_5d2c.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth">Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth</a>. We can't turn this encyclopedia into an online anti-vandal fortress - the easiest way to solve the vast majority of vandalism is to stop anon edits, but that isn't going to happen either!

<dd>Openness and preventing vandalism are always a delicate balance. Our position has been that we'll go for openness unless things are so bad that we can't--that's why we still allow anonymous editing, despite the problems. I suspect, though, that the random article link has been indirectly responsible for much of our growth; it's the only way, in a few seconds, to get a sense of the encyclopedia's enormous breadth and range, and people (newcomers too, not just wikignomes) generally find it fascinating. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 03:32, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Again and again user 84.133.etc. replaces the passage that is not to be found in the given reference ("Revelations"), I read the book and especially searched for the quote, but did not find it. Moreover, what the quote says is included in the surrounding paragraphs anyway. So I don't know why 84.133.etc. replaces the wrong passage all over again, and he refuses to give his reasons, on the contrary, he is insulting me ("(Bwilcke, stubborness won't help, this just ain't right so you better shut up"). I know him, he is a German whose contributions are confined to enter or provoke edit-wars - like here - and to rare minor (mostly unreasonable) corrections. A weird fellow. He likes to insult not only me but also others (e.g. got blocked once for incredible contentions about the familiy of another user, unknown to him).</p>
<p>Could you help, please?</p>

<p>It's about time we (re)consider dropping the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Wikipedia%7EMain_Page_featured_article_protection_4333.html" title="Wikipedia:Main Page featured article protection">prohibition against semi-protecting Today's Featured Article</a>. The discussion on the talk page has stalled and so I have decided to bring the matter back to the forefront here. In the first five hours <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspasia.html" title="Aspasia">Aspasia</a> has been on the Main Page, changes to the article have been – in short – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aspasia&amp;diff=111508065&amp;oldid=111443353" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aspasia&amp;diff=111508065&amp;oldid=111443353" rel="nofollow">minimal</a>, with many of the constructive edits (that are not merely vandalism reverts) coming from established users. And yet we are still maintaining the idea that it is better to show people that this one particular article is open for editing rather than maintaining the integrity of what we claim is an encyclopedia. If we truly are an encyclopedia first, why are we compromising the quality of what we all flaunt as some of our best work in the hopes that, despite past experience, most newcomers will make positive contributions? Whereas the current policy is giving those small number of constructive newcomers the feeling of satisfaction, are we not lending credence to the idea that Wikipedia is unreliable by showing many others entire articles that are replaced or riddled with nonsense by vandals? -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 05:09, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We claim to be an openly editable encyclopedia, so protecting the most visible article goes right against that philosophy. Incidentally, the day you picked to bring this up is a day with a front page article that would have a very small amount of the public that is knowledgable on the subject, leading to fewer constructive changes. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 05:20, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

I know this is the wrong place to start throwing out proposals, but what if we had a "stub of the day" and encouraged editing of <i>that</i>?

<dd>DYK kind of fills that niche with (mostly) short, new articles. Hbdragon88 05:27, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>True, but the rules for DYK have become stricter recently (minimum raised from 1,000 characters all included to 1,500 characters excluding references, infoboxes, and categories), so stubs and very short articles no longer have a place there. Perhaps an "article improvement of the day" on the front page may be a way to lure new editors?

<dd>We are first and foremost a free encyclopaedia - at least that's what it says at the top left of every page. Being freely-<i>editable</i> is a means to an end, of generating as much content as possible, and comes second in importance to being an encyclopaedia. The prohibition against semi-protecting today's FA is misguided because it puts editors above readers, even though the vast majority of people come to Wikipedia to read it, not to edit it. (As any rational person would expect - I don't go to McDonalds so I can grill my own burger. Or to use a non-profit analogy, people who call <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Samaritans_ca24.html" title="The Samaritans">The Samaritans</a> don't expect to be told to sort it out themselves.)</dd>
<dd>Preventing anons from starting articles, introducing the semi-protection policy, and many other measures have already gone against the philosophy of being openly editable for the sake of protecting the encyclopaedia. Semi-protecting the FA so that people new to the encyclopaedia don't see a load of penises or 'MY FREIND TOM SUCKS BALLS LOL' is another step that should be taken in this direction. I acknowledge that I'm in the minority over this at the moment, but quality is more important than quantity now, and the direction of policy is inevitably going to continue to point in the direction of safeguarding what we've got rather than fighting the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_diminishing_returns.html" title="Law of diminishing returns">law of diminishing returns</a> as it applies to random contributions.

<dd>No, they are one of the most popular rock bands (or alternative pop or whatever it is called nowadays) in Europe (certainly in France and Italy, but also in Belgium and I suppose a lot of other countries). I don't know what article was speedy deleted (it looks like all band members have their article for the moment, so perhaps you haven't speedy deleted it after all). A link from David Bowie to Placebo is quite normal, as they are heavily influenced by him. It has less than 500 incoming links (now, perhaps people removed some since the start of this section), so I doubt that it is one of the most linked articles (check e.g. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>), and most of the links seem at first glance to be correct (there are some like <a href="../../../j/o/d/Jodrell_Bank_Observatory_bcef.html" title="Jodrell Bank Observatory">Jodrell Bank Observatory</a> I could do without, but that's a general problem with trivia sections).

<p>Maybe I'm completely off base here, but we generally don't issue blocks for warning removals by an editor from their own talkpage do we?

<dd>Yeah, that seems to be the root problem here.

<p>i have editted two intel articles on "pentium d" and "core 2" user sarenne keeps undoing the edits.</p>
<p>i don't understand what is going on here and need some help. what's the point of Wikipedia if some folks just undo all of the work of other users. I did enter a comment on user's sarenne talk page -- but i doubt it makes a difference.</p>
<p>but from what i read the problem is much bigger than i.</p>
<p>this user is trying to engineer social change far beyond the mear correctness of terminology...which, by the way, i totally disagree with.</p>
<p>so someone needs to explain this binary terminology religious ferver to me and what it has to do with Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Or maybe you won't have to "block" me. I will just go away and use/contribute somewhere else where it is valued.</p>

<dd>It has been explained to this user why his edits have been reverted and he has been directed to the correct page to take up his issue with the current policy. This is a hotly contested policy, but has withstood many challenges thus far. There have been a string of IP users recently who show up solely for the purpose of removing the correct usage of these prefixes and causing a fuss when their changes are reverted. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2007-02-28T17:51Z</code></dd>

<p>It doesn't matter how hotly contested this issue is or what the past has held. In this case these articles are about products designed and built by Intel. The inventor/manufacturer does NOT use this terminology. So I don't think that Wikipedia consensus (and since the entire community didn't vote, the importance of this isn't clear either) is really the guiding factor in these articles. They should be true to the rightful inventor/owner terminology. It is clearly confusing to see one terminology in Wikipedia and a different one from the manufacturer: web pages, documentation, packaging etc.</p>
<p>This isn't just editting of a page here or there but these MiB/KiB folks are out to change the world. They are clearly monitoring Wikipedia for just sunch changes and changing them back...it's like the binary number police at work. When in this case, they are simply wrong on every front. If they want to write original articles and use obscure terminology known only to .00001% of the population, then fine. I appauld them for living in their own private world. But I live in this world and it doesn't use MiB or KiB ... anywhere else.</p>
<p>The forced imposition of standards is a political event and should be handled in a suitable political forum. If they want to "suggest" certain changes to authors...well why not. But they are forcing every page in Wikipedia to bare their particular nomenclature stamp when it is not the desire of the subject community. What is "correct" is not the forced change of every occurance of MB to MiB etc. They must have a BOT that checks all pages in Wikipedia for "violations" of their form of "correctness" given the speed with which my edits were removed. This is really the George Orwell "1984" nightmare incarnate.</p>
<p>And the slight above about IP users is just more snobbery about the topic. I didn't sign on because I didn't even think about it at the time. And I don't think others are trying to hide from the changes. Only from the overwhelming pressure of the binary zealots that are taking over Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Read what they said. The words on vandalism and blocking are threats pure and simple. You don't leave it the way we want it and you will be "eliminated"....almost "resistence is futile" sound about it. I don't think that I and other users respond to threats very well.</p>
<p>Wikipedia's value is deeply rooted in it's openness. This kind of "bully" editing runs clearly against the grain. These folks, whoever they are, don't own every technical page in Wikipedia...at least I don't think that they do (correct me if I am wrong). And I don't think it serves Wikipedia to have "policemen" of any type forcing everyone to walk on the "right" side of the street.</p>
<p>But I am concerned about these pages where the terminology is being corrupted in the name of "standards" and made inconsitent with the common practice of engineers, programmers, users and manufactures as represented in their own writings, web sites and packaging.

<dd>In this case, the marketing people at the companies you mention are using the wrong prefix because they don't want to confuse the customers. Wikipedia shouldn't adhere to marketing talk, it should keep to standards and in this case MiB is the correct use of prefixes when referring to 1024 bytes. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangnet_7125.html" title="User:Strangnet">Strangnet</a> 19:52, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wonder what admins are for then? I am just a simple user and everytime I make a change the MiB police change it back. I don't have the power or time necessary to keep making the changes over and over again. If the admins are in support of "editting police" then it's a sad day for Wikipedia. If and until the "issue" is settled, I think that they should not be able to "purify" all technical articles to their own beliefs and wishes. This isn't a dialog that can happen on a single article or two. And it doesn't appear to me that they are winning on the merits of their argument either. They are winning by brute force. Multiply this behavior many times and it will be the death of Wikipedia. Sure you want it to start here?Rman2000 20:20, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Admins are janitors here, not police. What I said isn't in any way "support of editing police". The only things an admin can do that any other editor cannot is delete articles, protect pages from editing, and block editors for vandalism. Other than that that, we are all simple editors. Deletion, protection, and blocking are not warranted here so there really is nothing that requires an administrator to intervene.

<p>First of all, it isn't just the "marketing" people using a terminology. The technical programmers and engineers who invent, design, build, test and ship all (almost all) technical products don't use MiB or KiB. The computer technical community has been using MB, KB, for what, sixty years now give or take. And they are all "wrong" and you are the only one who is right? My my, it must be special to know that only you have it right and everyone else has it wrong. But it is also the "confusion" of the "customers" that should concern Wikipedia the most as Wikipedia doesn't just exist to fulfill the whims of a hand full of MiB zealots.

Nobody has bullied you, it's you who is demanding that your opinion is more valid than that of the users who established and have maintained this particular policy.

<p>I would like to request a review by an independent Admin of the abuse of admin power by DBachmann. In a content dispute, he blocked my id. I requested an independent review as a part of Unblock. Dab unblocked my id, so that the independent review would not happen. So I am requesting the review here. To provide some details, Dab is adding all kind of original research to the Indigenous Aryan Theory article. I have been asking for citation of controversial claims since Feb 13th. Yesterday since no citation was provided, I added verifiable and relevent content with proper citation and removed OR. Dab removed the properly citied material and replaced with OR. One place where he did provide citation, he misrepresented the main content of article. When I corrected the content based on the article, he charged me with reverting and blocked me for 48 hours (he is the one doing reverting). I requested him to discuss on talk page. WP:OR states that any further analysis of authors position is original research. Dab as an admin should be upholding WP policies and not abusing them. I can provide history going back about 4 months where he has provided OR, removed properly referenced material, and provided fictitious citations. Please see here for other editors complaints.

<dd>Check your junk folder; if you didn't get an email when you asked for a new password to be issued, it's very possible that you did not set that email address to the account.

<p>I'm sure most people here are aware of the "gap" between admins and non-admins, by which I mean that several people perceive a wide difference between the two groups (regardless of whether such a difference actually exists) and tend to distrust the other group. We appear to be getting another "gap" between clerks and non-clerks. There is some discussion <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_noticeboard_Clerks_e7bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Community noticeboard/Clerks">here</a> where someone suggested deprecating the position and was vigorously attacked for his opinion.

<p>Adrian Sfarti has been contacting faculty members at UIUC regarding a recent sockpuppet report <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Ati3414_af24.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Ati3414">Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Ati3414</a>. He has also been sending emails slurring a student and even trying to involve the campus police all because of this report and delusions that he keeps getting banned at sites, not because of his actions that warranted the bans, but because it is somehow everyone else's fault and we should fix everything for him. His behavior is unacceptable, but furthermore I am disappointed in Wikipedia administrators. Yes ultimately these are the faults of Adrian Sfarti's actions and he clearly has problems, both in the inability to look at himself critically and accepting the consequences of his actions, but also the notion that he can possibly believe this makes him look like anything but more of a crank is beyond me.</p>
<p>However, it is outrageous that Wikipedia administrators allow this to keep recurring. Yes, that is right, Adrian Sfarti has done this in the past. This should never have been allowed to happen again, for he should not have been allowed to even get back into situations like this. You have IP records of everyone coming on here and at the very least you should have a mechanism to flag someone as heavily using IP's that a banned individual used. From the sockpuppet report it is even apparent that a user recognized one of his edits and labeled it as "Sfarti spam" back in mid December, and yet Adrian Sfarti was allowed to continue on. People like Mr. Sfarti should immediately be removed. To keep letting them get their foot in the door again and again, and then to drag out the process of removing them each time, only leads to more of this nonsense.</p>
<p>Please give serious consideration to improving your user identification mechanisms. It is clear he will continue this cycle for as long as you allow him and I do not want to ever have to deal with this individual again. AnnoyedInIllinois 06:04, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You might not want to deal with him, but unless he has been <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">banned</a> by the community here, he is free to edit. From what I see Sfarti was never banned here and If I'm missing something, point me to the editor name he was banned under or the community ban discussion. Most of the stuff you are referring to here is happening off Wikipedia and isn't relevant here. We generally don't block underlying IPs unless there is serious vandalism or personal attacks happening, and I don't see that right now (diffs would be helpful). So... I'm not sure what you are expecting to happen here.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:04, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>HI AnnoyedInIllinois... we have alot of concerns to balance here. First of all, your concept is a good one (flagging users who are using the same IP address of someone who has been troublesome) but unfortunately it can't be done in a way that is effective. In many cases IP addresses aren't stable. Some even switch every page-load. In other cases (schools are a good example) a single IP address might be shared by hundreds/thousands of editors. In a few notable cases entire nations share a single IP address. Another concern is that of privacy. I realize that IP addresses arn't very secure, but atleast when I speak here I can do so with confidence that some irate vandal isn't going to call my boss and try to get me in some kind of trouble. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 18:58, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not really a backlog. Every few days a new report is generated and usually shows around 300-400 broken redirects. Then within a day or two one or more admins notices that and clears it out before the next report is generated. I've rarely seen this get up to 500+ when the previous report wasn't cleared, but it's never more than a week's worth of pages. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:22, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Frankly, I'm not sure it's appropriate with the main AfD so far underway and the first person commenting in the canon AfD that he thought the other three article should be kept, but favors deleting the "canon only" one. I would suggest doing a procedural close on the canon AfD and reopening it when the other one finishes, with the hope being that the result will be consistent with the main AfD.

<p>Short of Essjay choosing to protect his talk page, I'd leave it alone and let him sort it out later. For those out of the loop, on February 5, <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> edited his /me template to add <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AEssjay%2FMe&amp;diff=105804157&amp;oldid=55380426|reveal" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AEssjay%2FMe&amp;diff=105804157&amp;oldid=55380426|reveal" rel="nofollow">his personal information</a>. Turns out he's not a catholic scholar in his 30's as the userpage claimed before. However, he cites privacy concerns as his reason for masking his real identity and personally I don't care about the whole thing. End result was that yesterday he was <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot_effect.html" title="Slashdot effect">slashdotted</a> as though it was breaking news even though it's a month old, and this is where the trolling comes from.

<p>I am in the final planning stages for a web-based discussion forum to supplement wikien-l and related mailing lists. The purpose is to provide an independent, carefully hosted venue for discussion about Wikipedia that works well for high-traffic threaded discussions.

<dd>I think Wiki talk pages, mailing lists, and IRC channels are enough fora; it's just technical issues that might make wiki or mailing lists less preferable to a webforum.

<p>Hi, I've been trying (with the uncoordinated help of a few other editors) to clear the backlog of <i>articles to be merged</i> for the last few days. There was a backlog that went back to February 2006, but now I've run into <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_United_States_presidential_election_recounts_and_legal_challenges_501a.html" title="2004 United States presidential election recounts and legal challenges">2004 United States presidential election recounts and legal challenges</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_the_2004_United_States_presidential_election_controversy_and_irregularities_50f8.html" title="Timeline of the 2004 United States presidential election controversy and irregularities">Timeline of the 2004 United States presidential election controversy and irregularities</a>, and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy_and_irregularities_5add.html" title="2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities">2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities</a>. To be honest I'm not sure what to do with them exactly; there is not much discussion of the merge on the talk pages. However there is a ArbCom warning not to make any "disruptive" changes. I assume merging, redirecting, etc. would qualify as dramatic if not disruptive. So, I'm not really sure how to proceed.

<dd>Consider submitting all three articles to <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_91e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">Wikipedia:Peer review</a>, to get a list of suggestions. The last of the three looks the most like a real article. I wonder if it could become the master article and the others somehow converted into subarticles.

Consider reading the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Election_215a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Election">Arbcom Election case</a>, the 2 AfD debates for the third article and at least skim all the Talk pages.

<p>The suggstion that a well respected vetern editor blocked this user (for what is perfectly obvious is a violation of 3RR) out of political motivation, and the canvassing of editors with langauge that similarily suggests a politcal motivation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Durova&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111198341" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Durova&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111198341" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:RolandR&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111201039" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:RolandR&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111201039" rel="nofollow">here</a>) is such a blatant violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> that it should earn you a block. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 00:20, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I agree with the block, it is hard for me to see why one would block someone for failing to AGF. Canvassing is bad, they've stopped canvassing.

<p>(outdent) I received a request at my user talk to review this block and it does look like a solid application of 3RR policy. <i><a href="../../../t/u/_/Tu_quoque.html" title="Tu quoque">Tu quoque</a></i> isn't grounds for unblocking. Clearly, the article needs protecting for a bit while the editors work toward consensus. I recommend an article content <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> to bring in some fresh views. If problematic behavior by other disputants continues then build up a case for <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> (or any other applicable policy) and report to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 21:38, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another question, <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> has threatened to block me for supposedly making "repetitive, predictable personal attacks"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=111205979&amp;oldid=111205380" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=111205979&amp;oldid=111205380" rel="nofollow">[86]</a>. But I have not made any personal attacks, merely questioned her actions as an admin. To what extent can an admin use their admin rights to ban editors who oppose their particular point of view? In such cases would it not be wiser for that admin to leave the block to another admin in order to avoid the appearance of a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interrest</a>?

<p>I would just like to note that following the lifting of my block, SlimVirgin posted comments at my talk page and the talk pages of others, that I consider to be inappropriate.

<dd>You know Jayjg, I really don't understand your tone. Or the implication in your first posting that I am a "conspiracy theorist". In fact, strangely enough, the only two people here that have ever made such an accusation against me are you and SlimVirgin. You above, and SlimVirgin twice in the last three days, most recently at User:Mackan79's talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mackan79&amp;diff=112137009&amp;oldid=112134344" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mackan79&amp;diff=112137009&amp;oldid=112134344" rel="nofollow">[94]</a>. I didn't respond to your accusation above, because I didn't want to escalate the situation any further. I thought I would merely point out that for purposes of disclosure, it might have been nice if you had mentioned that you had a direct stake in the matter, since you had been involved in an earlier version of the same editing war. That you are trying to make me out to be unreasonable based on my restrained response to your accusations, is really totally unfair. Thanks for your input again.

<dd>If you violate the 3RR and are blocked for it, it's safe to assume that it's your conduct that got you blocked. We admins aren't required to have no political opinions in order to use admin abilities. If you believe you are being persecuted for religious or political reasons, your best bet is to have exemplary conduct. If you are no longer blocked after that, then it probably wasn't your political views that got you in trouble. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">random</a>)</sup> 18:14, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Quadell. I don't think that admins shouldn't have political opinions. (In fact, that would be quite ridiculous. Everybody has political opinions and biases that inform their editing and interaction, no matter how "objective" they claim to be). And I may note, in my defense, that since the block I have reflected on my editing behaviour and taken a much more collaborative approach. I invite anyone to take a look at my extensive participation in the talk pages of this RfC that I opened <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_indigenous_peoples#Request_for_Comment:_Palestinian_indigeneity" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_indigenous_peoples#Request_for_Comment:_Palestinian_indigeneity" rel="nofollow">[95]</a> to discuss edits I would like to make to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_indigenous_peoples.html" title="List of indigenous peoples">List of indigenous peoples</a> article and to review my user history in general since the block.

These are directly related to the issue raised by <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">User:Abu ali</a> and to the discussion above. If there is an impartial administrator out there willing to take a fresh look at the discussion above, and the diffs provided in this entry, I would very much appreciate it. I submit that both Jayjg and SlimVirgin have, even over the course of this discussion, used their administrative clout to intimidate people whose personal POVs conflict with their own, and with whom they have been involved in edit wars. (Further evidence on SlimVirgin provided here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=112325827&amp;oldid=112302834" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=112325827&amp;oldid=112302834" rel="nofollow">[100]</a>) Using one's administrative clout in this way should at the very least be discouraged.

<dd>Thanks! I haven't done one for RFCU (request-for-check-user) yet, only because I'm not as familiar with that area, and don't know what are the frequently-used reference links. I've been working on RFC (requests-for-comment) pages, which only share their first 3 initials with RFCU. What sort of template would be helpful over there? -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 06:11, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It would be similar to {{<a href="../../../r/f/c/Template%7ERfcuser_7c35.html" title="Template:Rfcuser">rfcuser</a>}}, except that it would link to Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/USERNAME. At Checkuser, all requests for a single user go onto a single subpage, even if there are multiple requests on a user, so it seems like the template code would be straightforward. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 07:11, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Since when did we block IPs indefinitely for being public computers? Would that also include schools, libraries, hotel rooms, coffee shops, and computer labs of any other kind? If there is vandalism, the IPs should be blocked for an appropriate length of time, taking into account that the IP is shared. I think a permanent block (unless requested by an authority greater than or equal to the store manager) sets a bad precedent (see <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/foundation_issues" class="extiw" title="m:foundation_issues">m:foundation issues</a>: anyone can edit"). Consider that not everyone has internet access at home, and that many users edit from their place of business, particularly those working in retail. Please consider allowing registered non-vandal users to continue editing. — <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharlotteWebb_8dbe.html" title="User talk:CharlotteWebb">CharlotteWebb</a> 07:42, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The computers are essentially open proxies. Unlike libraries, schools, etc., a Best Buy computer is open to anyone who goes into the store, and a post on the IP's talk page stated "THIS IS A PUBLIC COMPUTER AT BEST BUY" until it was removed by a later editor from the same IP. I would mention more about why this was blocked, but I only know what Jpgordon discussed with me (we found this IP through a checkuser of accounts used to harass myself and CSCWEM).—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 08:04, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Some are connected; I've used some to check reviews on a product on the Circuit City website before I buy something at a Best Buy. However, these computers are not public computers. They are computers owned by Best Buy, for the use of I'm imagining buying things on bestbuy.com and signing up for Best Buy credit cards. Best Buy doesn't advertise that it has computers for internet use in its stores, and in my experience, public computers usually require some sort of agreement form to be signed. If it is an employee, he shouldn't really be editing Wikipedia while on the clock.

<li>That isn't really the aim here&#160;:) Generally XNRs tend to confuse people, and make things appear to be in article space when they aren't articles; on <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a>, XNRs are almost always deleted (with, yes, some exceptions for the few that are actually useful). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 10:24, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Personally, I think RFD is fairly dumb about this. Cross-namespace redirects can make the encyclopedia easier to use. For example, if I type "<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikien-l.html" title="Wikien-l">wikien-l</a>" into the search box I ought to get to <a href="../../../m/a/i/Wikipedia%7EMailing_lists_886e.html" title="Wikipedia:Mailing lists">Wikipedia:Mailing lists</a>. But no, since that would be cross-namespace, it was deleted and subsequently recreated with a link to our article on the concept of <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mailing_list.html" title="Mailing list">mailing lists</a> in general. Of course that's not a very helpful result if you want wikien-l. But not to worry, someone added <a href="../../../m/a/i/Wikipedia%7EMailing_lists_886e.html" title="Wikipedia:Mailing lists">Wikipedia:Mailing lists</a> as a top link on <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mailing_list.html" title="Mailing list">mailing list</a> because having cross namespace links at the top of articles is somehow more acceptable than having the crossnamespace redirect.

<li>I have. I don't consider the existance of an easy way to remove self-references as any kind of a legitimate justification for making the encyclopedia harder to use. The fact remains that someone interested in wikien-l would still have to follow an complicated route, regardless of whether that template exists. If all we cared about was making things easy to remove, then we should simply tell reusers to run: "DELETE FROM page, pagelinks USING page, pagelinks WHERE page_is_redirect=1 AND page_id = pl_from AND pl_namespace&#160;!= 0 AND page_namespace = 0" and all cross namespace redirects from article space will vanish, simple. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 00:30, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well, I've stopped trying to keep the mfd discussion open, since I'm being ganged up on by admins. Have we learned nothing from the Daniel Brandt debacle of last week?

<dd>The motto of the Brandt debacle was to allow discussion to run its course. Stifling discussion doesn't allow editors to share their views, and leads to confusion and bad feelings.

<p>I hate to sound negative, but I've run across a few people lately that, well, aren't really using Wikipedia for the articles, but rather the webspace. I've stalked this board for a while and seen other cases where actions have been taken, but I can't remember when they were so I can't look them up. I found these two through recent changes and category cleaning.</p>

<dd>Well, <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> pretty much says that we should frown upon the use of the user and talk pages for personal use (or stuff that's not related to the project). So I think this is grounds to MfD the pages, but only after you have tried to discuss the problems with the user. Many new users aren't aware of policy as well, and thus it would only make them angry if you MfD'd them without warning. Maybe try contacting the users again, and if there really is a problem and they don't respond, MfD any page that seems to be in direct contradiction to the policy in <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a>. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJared_27c5.html" title="User:Jared"><font color="#0084C9">Jared</font></a></b></sup><sub>┘</sub><sup>┌</sup><sub><i><a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJared_bc99.html" title="User talk:Jared"><font color="#009E49">talk</font></a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup>  13:50, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Further to <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Spot_the_difference" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#Spot_the_difference</a>, a certain amount of ill feeling had spilt over to <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Sonoma_County%2C_California_4140.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Sonoma County, California">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Sonoma County, California</a>. I cautioned both parties, one of whom responded very graciously, and archived the discussion since the FAC has no chance of succeeding. I used the archive templates as a temporary measure so that Raul or somebody else with more knowledge of the procedure can close it properly.</p>
<p>However, another admin, <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrianSmithson_2424.html" title="User talk:BrianSmithson">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrianSmithson_f4a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrianSmithson">contribs</a>) has been reverting me, claiming I don't have the authority to close a FAC. He declined my invitation to challenge my action here, and the FAC remains open. I see, however, that he <i>has</i> posted on <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EFeatured_article_candidates_f596.html#Closing_FACs" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates">Wikipedia_talk:Featured_article_candidates#Closing_FACs</a> where Raul claims only he has the authority to close a FAC.

<p>Do we really have one man ownership of the FA system to the extent that I can't close a FAC which has <i>no chance</i> of success and where it's causing ill feeling which has spilt over to this noticeboard?

<dd><a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_c58c.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates</a> seems pretty clear: "the Featured Article Director (currently Raul654) determines whether there is consensus. If, after sufficient time, objections considered actionable by the Featured Article Director have not been resolved or consensus for promotion has not been reached, a nomination will be removed from the list and archived. The FA Director determines the timing of the process for each nomination." That may need to be changed, but hasn't been yet. I would agree with you that the proposal currently has no chance, with 3 complaint notices, 1 inline reference, and being composed mostly of lists, but technically BS is correct.

<dd>Thanks for the comment. I'm aware of what it says, but I am of course referring to a <i>hopeless</i> case which I wanted closed and stamped out <i>immediately</i>. The big ugly archive boxes ought to have alerted Raul when he next came online and of course he does now know about it. My point is simply that whatever the instructions say, I challenge the assertion that an admin in good standing can't <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">snowball</a> a hopeless FAC which is leading to bad feeling, and that thanks to some arcane rule from long ago only one person can close the debate. Looking at it another way, I'm a member of <a href="../../../b/a/g/WP%7EBAG_f4b6.html" title="WP:BAG">WP:BAG</a> but I wouldn't object if you closed a bot application from Willy on Wheels! :) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 14:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Eh.

How about seeing if we can convince the nominator to agree to withdraw the nomination? That's not strictly in the WP:FAC rules either, but it has been done before, and I imagine BS wouldn't object. I'll go comment to that effect. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 14:13, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There was a "vote" on his status a few years back.

In future, I'll check blocklogs before reporting there (my bit of learning from the experience!) but blocking admins would help out anyone who might otherwise mistake an indef blocked account for an active user if they did make it clear on the talk page. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 13:37, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a bit of a split debate, the block log is the fixed record.

<p>Excuse me, I don't see there is such rule in those links you provided. Also it is not just a simple list. It is an article about UW-Milwaukee's alumni.

<ul>
<li>Fair use allows the image only in an article specifically about Katz, and only if no free image can realistically be obtained. I think you have been told this before. And threatening to reinsert the image if nobody answers less than an hour after asking a question is also unacceptable; some of us have work to do. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:48, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For clarification: to say that an image is being "fairly used" is misapplication of the term "fair use." The term "<a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>" refers to a specific legal doctrine in the United States that allows people, in certain circumstances, to use copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright holder; indeed, even if the copyright holder has explicitly denied permission. The fair use of images and other media on Wikipedia is restricted further by the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use policy</a>. The term "fair use" should not be turned into a adverb to describe how a particular image is being used. Rather, it should be stated that the image "qualifies for 'fair use' as described by <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>" or some other statement like that. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 23:57, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While I agree that an adverbial phrase like "fairly used" is probably a bad idea with respect to a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Term_of_art.html" title="Term of art">term of art</a> like fair use, when discussing fair use issues please remember that is it the <i>use</i> which qualifies (or does not qualify), not the <i>image</i>. All images (indeed, all copyrighted works) "qualify" for fair use; the legal test is based on the <i>use</i>, not the identity of the work. So it is necessary to state that the "use of the image in _______ qualifies for fair use as described by <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>". I'm sorry for the hair-splitting, but I don't want anyone to misinterpret <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a>'s remarks as asserting that there is a class of works that qualify for fair use and a class that does not. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 00:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Sorry, this probably won't take long, but I've got to go somewhere! This user seems to be spending a lot of time creating what appears to be hoax music articles. I have managed to delete some of them, but there are still a few left to consider (including his userpage). There is at least one unlicensed image there and an article on an AC/DC album that nobody seems to know about (redirected to band article for now). None of the articles are sourced and seem to have spurious claims about sales attached to them.
