<p>I'm not quite sure what I should do here. I recently speedily deleted a page for nn-bio; the page was written by someone other than the subject of the article, and the subject of the article wants to see what was there before it was deleted. Quoting from my talk page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>... another reason as to why i would like to see the material is to determine if malice was intended. i have been getting quite a bit of flak from people who have seen the article and seeing the content would hopefully enable me to identify the person who posted the article and hence, pursue the appropriate courses of action.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So far, I've been politely refusing to do dig out the deleted material. However, what's the relevant policy on this?

<dd>Not every user who can be trusted to view deleted content is an administrator. Whether or not to reveal deleted content is a choice you've gotta make — ably guided by Zzyzx11's links, of course — but I don't think it's a good idea to hide <i>everything</i> from non-admins just because they're not admins. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 06:46, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Of course the good reasons would be things like copyright violation and libel, etc. So if the information could be considered as libel, then revealing it after deletion could be contributory in that. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 15:11, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A similar incident occured before. What I did (at someone else's suggestion) was undelete the page, move it to my userpage, delete the redirect, protect the page in my userspace, and give the url to the interested party. This lets them view the whole history and all the information we have, but also prevents it from looking like a real article. --best, kevin <b>[</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">kzollman</a><b>][</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">talk</a><b>]</b> 03:43, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some, but not all, deleted content is sensitive. For instance, if a copyvio or attack page is deleted, recovering that content for a non-administrator might in effect constitute copyright violation or defamation. However, if a nonsense or fancruft page is deleted, recovering that content wouldn't cause any problems. Use common sense. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> <small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">Are you a fan of the band Rush?</a></small> 03:49, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>What he means is that some admin (Curps, IIRC) intentionally created a bunch of nonsensical usernames to fill up the first page of Listusers, to prevent e.g. "!!! (foo) is an idiot" from showing on the first page.

<p>This deletion nomination was made because a first nomination, which resulted in no consensus, is being appealed on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a> (DRV). Because DRV is not a consensus-based forum, I obviously decided that it would get a fairer discussion with a second run on Articles for deletion. I made the second nomination and so far there are six votes in addition to my nomination, in which I gave a recommendation to keep. I made the nomination in good faith, and all six votes so far favor keeping the article.</p>
<p>However, R. Fiend has delisted this. He states that a second nomination cannot proceed while the first is under review. I find this unconvincing. It would be extraordinary if two discussions on AfD gave strong indications of absence of consensus to delete an article, but the article was deleted by deletion review as a result of refusal to permit the second deletion discussion to proceed and a decision to ignore the non-consensus to delete in the first.</p>
<p>I invite discussion on how to resolve this problem. I'm sure R. Fiend is sincere in his belief that the second AfD would be wrong, but I do not think it can be right to use deletion review to overturn a no consensus keep result while refusing a simple rerun to determine whether a consensus can be raised. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:13, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Deletion review and AfD measure two very different things. Deletion review is an evaluation of the decision made by the closer, while AfD is an evaluation of the article itself. I see no reason why the two cannot be conducted at once. That the results of the first AfD may have been misinterpreted in no way affects the quality of the article. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 05:25, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for restorng it. R. Fiend has removed it again and closed the nomination for a second or third time, I've lost count), claiming that it was a bad faith nomination.

<dd>Failing to place a notice on DRV that it's been re-opened, plus the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_state-named_Avenues_in_Washington%2C_D.C._%28second_nomination%29&amp;oldid=37302390" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_state-named_Avenues_in_Washington%2C_D.C._%28second_nomination%29&amp;oldid=37302390" rel="nofollow">incredible nomination</a> itself, it strains credulity to ask us to consider this nomination as having taken place in good faith. Can a week go by without a tempest in a teacup being raised by Mr. Sidaway? The discussion at DRV had failed to date to get the super-majority required for deletion, and would almost certainly have resulted in relisting regardless. Yet again, the path of maximum disruption has been chosen. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 05:52, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I closed the AFD because it was obviously bad faith, in the same way it would be bad faith for me to nominate George W. Bush for President saying "Here's why you should vote for him: 1. he's a liar, 2. he's an idiot, and 3. he's a war-monger." What's this? No one is supporting him? How odd. DRV is discussing whether the first AFD was closed correctly, Tony trying to undermine this by engineering a keep consensus at an unrelated vote is not good faith. But Simon's right, DRV and AFD measure 2 different things, and there shouldn't be votes going on at the same time in both places. Which takes precedence? If DRV decides that the first closure was incorrect, then I guess it would be deleted, and the AFD would be closed, because the article would already be deleted, and if recreated could be a speedy G4. If having more discussions at more places inevitably gives us better results should I open a concurrent 3rd and 4th AFD for the article? As long as I get one consensus I could then claim a valid delete, right? In any case, I'm curious to see whether AFD is a vote or not. Everyone says it isn't, but I suspect it really is. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 05:59, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well I'm here to tell you that it wasn't in bad faith. I'm not going to re-open it since you've speedy kept. Of course AfD will always take precedence, because it's the consensus-based forum.

<li>Likely because of the fallout, earthquakes and tidal waves resulting from such a nuke.

<p>Who told you that DRV is a consensus-based forum? 50% to endorse, 75% to overturn doesn't sound like consensus to me; it's just vote-counting. No, AfD works by consensus, doesn't have quite so paranoid an atmosphere, and could easily have handled a rerun of this debate, and there was no reason why that debate could not run in tandem with the DRV discussion, over which it would of course (being consensus-based) take precedence. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:44, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>What I mean is that DRV was created by, and is supported by, consensus. The individual discussions there are technically vote counting, but people do make more sensible comments than on AFD, and take each other's opinion into account more than they appear to do on AFD. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 18:02, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Tony, I think you may be trying to have your cake and eat it here. When you want something kept, you (not for the first time) bypass DRV, and appeal to xFD (where it is easier to get a 'keep'). But when it came to userbox templates, you ignored TfD and speedied them, and then listed on DRV (where it is easier to get a deletion endorsement). XfD is derided when you don't like its results, and upheld as essential when you do. I'm not accusing you of bad faith, but this gives the impression of gaming the system. And, yes, the system stinks, but the only other thing on offer seems not to be so much a 'faith-based' deletion system as a 'Tony-based' one--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 20:22, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Doc, you're right that I took a pragmatic approach on userboxes. I would not trust DRV to make a good call on article content, because there is a tendency there to ignore or downplay the importance of content. As userboxes are pure vanity and have no encyclopedic content I will trust the judgement of DRV more than I trust a TfD, because it's in the nature of userboxes to be placed in prominent positions on people's userpages, resulting in an unconscious and unavoidable skewing of TfD votes where userboxes are involved. Those who tend to their userpages spot the tfd notice and click the link--I can't blame them for doing that but it does create an artificial keep vote which is not representative of consensus. According to my survey of--to date--more than 200 userpage contacts from my watchlist, only 10% of active Wikipedia editors have political or religious userboxes (which is not to day that the other 90% are opposed to them, but I expect they might be include a lot of people who are less in favor of them). --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 19:05, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The last vandalism from this IP was over three hours ago, and it has made one minor non-vandal edit since then. The IP resolves to "bbcache-115.singnet.com.sg" and appears to be part of an AOL-like shared proxy setup. The block log shows four blocks and one unblock with the comment "<i>singapore proxy? shorten block</i>".</p>
<p>Since I've been doing this admin thing for less than a day, I'd like to confirm whether my decision not to block was correct. Also, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:165.21.154.16&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37427632" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:165.21.154.16&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37427632" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, it appears that there is indeed a persistent vandal using these IPs.

<dd>Done though I didn't see any discussion about what the correct way to name the article is. Some justification for the new name would be good. And go ahead and fix all the links to the article to bypass the redirects. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 16:23, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, Taxman. I've just finished updating the redirects. I didn't propose a Requested Move as I think the name change is uncontroversial, in view of (a) the article's opening sentence; (b) my recalling how this name was expressed in a couple of history sources I've referenced, (c) backed up by (non-Wikipedia-based) results from an internet search.

<p>How does a naming convention get from proposed to accepted? I posted <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28Ohio_school_districts%29_c374.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Ohio school districts)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Ohio school districts)</a> in April 2005. Nobody has objected to it and I've been using it to rename articles covered by it. Though I'd feel more confident it were official policy. So how do I make that happen? <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedanticallySpeaking_fbd8.html" title="User:PedanticallySpeaking">PedanticallySpeaking</a> 17:48, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It seems that you originally did not follow the steps listed on <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_create_policy_4959.html" title="Wikipedia:How to create policy">Wikipedia:How to create policy</a> back in April. Thus nobody was notified, nobody really commented on it, and therefore it was eventually marked as inactive. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 20:47, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yep, just like that. To advertise such, put a link on RFC, the village pump, WT:Naming conventions, and the talk pages of relevant high-activity pages or wikiprojects. Get consensus. I marked this as historical because (1) there was no active debate, and (2) there was no real feedback whatsoever, thus no way to tell if it's consensual. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:21, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Greetings. On vacation, I took a lot of pictures of exhibits at the Smithsonian gallery and uploaded them to Wikipedia, releasing them under both the GFDL and a cc-sa license. One picture in particular was <a href="../../../b/i/g/Image%7EBig_Quran_page.jpg_f52a.html" title="Image:Big Quran page.jpg">Image:Big Quran page.jpg</a>, showing a folio from a very large Qur'an, with my wife in the photo to show scale. I added the photograph to <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timur.html" title="Timur">Timur</a>, the commissioner of this historic Qur'an.</p>
<p>Someone added the image to the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> article, and controversy quickly ensued (see <a href="../../../q/u/r/Talk%7EQur%27an_Picture_Controversy_632e.html" title="Talk:Qur'an/Picture Controversy">Talk:Qur'an/Picture Controversy</a>). The photo shows my wife in clothing that would be considered normal in Washington D.C. in the summer, but which is scandalously immodest in most of the Muslim World. <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an_desecration.html" title="Qur'an desecration">Qur'an desecration</a> is an extremely high offense is Islam, of course, as can be seen in <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an_desecration_controversy_of_2005.html" title="Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005">recent history</a>. Now there's nothing wrong with having such a picture on Wikipedia -- we have much more racy pictures -- but to have the picture in the Qur'an article was offensive to many Muslims, and several complained. A vote was held. Many supporters of the image's removal wanted to avoid being offensive unless it was necessary, or simply felt the photograph was not of sufficient quality to warrant its inclusion. Many opponents of removal wanted to take a stand against what they saw as religious censorship, or noted that no similar replacement is available. Feelings were strong, and bad faith was assumed by many on both sides.</p>
<p>When I found out about the incident, quite by accident, my wife and I sat down and talked about it. She is very saddened that her likeness is being used in such an insensetive way, and we both agreed that it was unacceptable for this image to be used. I noted this on the the controversy page, but by then many people's feelings had solidified, and no votes were changed as a result. After two weeks, the vote was closed, but consensus had not been acheived: there were 20 keep votes and 16 remove votes. As could be expected, both sides feel that the lack of consensus validates their own position.</p>
<p>As I stated on that page, "The fact is, I'm just not comfortable having an image of my wife misused in this way. Yes I uploaded the photo, but I never intended for it to be used in an article on the Noble Qur'an, so I'm going to remove it. I know that many of you will disagree with me, and I respect that, but I'd ask that you use a photo of your own wife, and leave mine out of it. It pains me to be so stubborn about this, but I take this very personally."</p>
<p>Now there is something of a mild revert-war going on. This is an extremely important issue to me, since I feel that my family has been brought into a very unfortunate situation here, and my wife is understandably insistent that her image not be used to cause religious offense in this way. I'm not sure how to handle this. I'm obviously far too involved to use any of my admin abilities to deal with the situation. Any advice or assistance by other admins would be appreciated. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 19:22, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, thats kind of the problem. Since others have uploaded their revisions to the photo, and because of the way you licensed it, not only do other copies certainly exist but you aren't the creator of the revised images. If you do delete it, the revisers could re-upload the image still under gfdl and use it in the article. You could of course ask them not to...but they are under no obligation to do so I don't think.</dd>
<dd>I'm hoping that one of the more senior admins wander by and have a good solution. I'm not going to say that you shouldn't delete the image / ask that it be deleted...because frankly I would consider doing that myself (as I stated above naievely, and now knowing more about the situation) if it were my picture...but know that there could be penalties to pay.&#160;:( --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 20:02, 30 January 2006 (UTC) (after edit conflict)

<p>Quadell, that was really inappropriate. I understand that you and your wife are upset about this, but you have an ethical obligation not to use your administrative powers to decide cases in which you are so personally involved. As far as I can see you have no legal grounds to control the photo and while you might have a reasonable case for convincing others to remove it, you certainly shouldn't just delete it yourself. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 22:14, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it's more complex than that. Generally, it has been considered kosher for users to remove most kinds of content they added (except en-masse deletions). Note that if it were re-uploaded by someone else, it would be inappropriate for Quadell to remove it again, but this particular case is at least murky ground -- I don't think it's clear cut that he was acting wrongly, and I think it is a far cry from abuse. If you want the content, re-uploading it should be ok and simplify things. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 23:05, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see how this could be considered abuse. Quadell made an unwitting mistake. He publicly requested that the community correct the mistake. There may have been a split consensus, but that means that a substantial portion of the community acknowledged the mistake. The community sat in paralysis for almost three weeks debating the mistake. Quadell finally fixed the mistake himself. Fine. We should help people correct bona fide mistakes.

The latter egregious stuff was a few months ago, I guess he doesn't do that anymore, but apparently the POV editing has continued.</p>
<p>Back in December he took exception when I speedy deleted his fourth or fifth re-creation of an AfD'd article, and some discussions ensued, see Talk:Cuban espionage and related extraterritorial activity revised. At the time it was clear he didn't believe in <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, believed he owned the articles he created, and most significantly, did not believe his contributions were covered under the GFDL.

<p>After that I moved on, it was mostly the stuff I considered egregious that I was concerned with (re-creation of deleted articles and adding Cuba stuff to non-Cuba articles), and I didn't really care to get involved in content disputes over Cuban-related topics.

However, of special interest is the phrase near the bottom, <i>"Note that science ... when used to emasculate other views ... is also POV suppression."</i> In other words, this is really a stealth proposal against using scientific facts to discount an article on pseudoscience. This was pointed out on the talk page, but of course it's not being listened to.

<dd>"It is important that the various views and the subject as a whole are presented in a balanced manner and that each is summarized <i>as if by its proponents to its best ability.</i>" (emphasis theirs) Proponents are by definition not neutral and this is saying that the article should read as if a proponent wrote it. Proponents contributing is fine, but the article should not look like it was written by a proponent. It should be written as if by a neutral observer instead. Arguments in favor and against a position should be presented. Every article should be neutral in itself, not by the inclusion of other non-neutral articles in the encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:55, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, reading it again, I think I misunderstood their position. So each side will get a chance to state its case, or something? Still, I think an article should be completely neutral and not switch back and forth between POVs.

<dd>The only reason I bothered to intervene in what was at first a mistake and now a silly, petty debate is that I didn't remember any inaugural SOTU. Upon investigation, I found that it is a fairly common idea that officially there was no SOTU that year. Now, there was an address in 2001 that played the same role as a SOTU and for all intents and purposes was a SOTU. Except it wasn't, officially speaking. It was in fact called by another name. To call it a SOTU without explanation is a statement of error.</dd>

<dd>Beyond the fact that last night's address was officially Bush's fifth State of the Union, I agree with every other editor that it just makes more sense to categorize them by year.</dd>

<dd>This has been discussed before, and generally dismissed because admins regularly take actions that would make other editors none-too-happy, even if such actions are good and in line with policy.

<dd>I think that the problem with admins-for-life is more theoretical than practical. I don't know of any admins who are <i>generally</i> considered to be misusing their powers (as opposed to having pissed off a particular group of users). Those who might be considered clueless tend to be the newer, less-experienced ones, so term limits wouldn't help there. And anything we do can be undone by other admins. The recent hysteria over some ill-considered blocks could have been avoided if people had just taken 24 hours to wait for bad blocks to be undone rather than getting overexcited at someone having dared to block them. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkalexander100_03f8.html" title="User:Markalexander100">Mark</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkalexander100_f98a.html" title="User talk:Markalexander100"><sup>your words</sup></a> 17:36, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So... we have blocks of two people (El C and Carbonite) who are admins and one person (Giano) who (IMHO) should be an admin, all for something that should have - at the very most - resulted in a minor ticking off and reversion. Carnildo's action - at best - can be seen as WP:POINT of a fairly extreme form requiring equal (if not greater) ticking off. Personally, it sounds like RFAr material. I don't agree with the initial blocking that led to this situation - people are entitled to their beliefs and inclinations, no matter how objectionable they may seem to us (actually carrying them out is, of course, another matter) - but the response from Carnildo was equally, if not more, inappropriate. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 00:17, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a difference though. Engaging in pedophilia is almost universally criminal in the modern world, whereas most sensible nations are tolerant of homosexuals and women.

<dd>I agree with Ec5618 on this one. Blocking those 3 users without proper discussion is objectionable. But attacks are not permitable by any means.

<p>To me it seems clear that Carnildo is concerned about a very real risk which we have seen played out in many human societies: <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_panic.html" title="Moral panic">Moral panic</a> driven hysteria. It is unacceptable to block users who make quality edits and whos behavior is without question simply because of their beliefs or conditions. We already can, and must cope with POV content, so there is no risk in allowing well behaved deviants to edit, and no resulting need for us to pass a moral judgment on their condition be it homosexuality or whatnot, even if such a judgment would be easy to make and easy to justify. It is utterly unacceptable for anyone to abuse our fear of amoral and harmful people and our desire to protect our children to silence people they disagree with. At first I thought Carnildo's response was less than optimum, and that reasoned discussion would be better... But after seeing responses like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Carnildo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38382221" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Carnildo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38382221" rel="nofollow">this</a>, I have to agree with Carnildo's act. <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_McCarthy_1e1b.html" title="Joseph McCarthy">McCarthy</a> style attacks are a poison we can not tolerate, and must be stopped in any way necessary. So go ahead, El_C, call me a pedophile just because I don't support a paranoid witch hunt against pedophiles, it will only serve to justify Carnildo's action more. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 02:58, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Carnildo showed very poor judgement and lack of self-disipline, without so much as a Mea Culpa. Such actions cannot, nor should not, be tolerated in an admin. However disagreeable someone may be, they should never be indefinately blocked or banned for merely expressing their opinions.--<a href="../../../r/2E/d/User%7ER.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29_1bea.html" title="User:R.D.H.

<dd>But do you think it is correct for admins to block nondisruptive users purely due to their moral outrage? What about stiring up fear in Wikipedia users in attempt to accomplish the same? In my view that too is not to be tolerated. So what we're left with is mistakes made all around. But the worst of which, wheel warring and false accusations were made not by Carnildo but by those who oppose him. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 04:45, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Here's a hypothetical to consider-What If, instead of pedophiles, the users in question advocated banning, Software pirates or Copyright violators, would you still consider Carnildo's actions justified?

<dd>I'd support banning people who user their userpages to advocate software piracy or anything else that would hurt the project, if they refuse to quit.

<dd>If someone is using Wikipedia to violate copyright, or to pirate software, then I'm all in favor of blocking. Likewise, I'm all in favor of banning a pedophile for using Wikipedia to troll for children. These are all <i>actions</i>. But banning someone for <i>being</i> something, whether it is a being a pedophile, or being a Muslim, or being a software pirate is not acceptable: these are things that someone <i>is</i>, and have no direct effect on their contributions to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 07:43, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the only reason to perminately ban ANYONE is for their ACTIONS, not their opinions or their advocacy (which is what the pedophile user boxes amount to). I personally think pedophila is more of a choice than a sexual orientation. And advocating it, even if not acted upon it here, is not good for the project or the community. We can always find others willing to contribute who don't pose the same legal risks. Irregardless, your actions were clearly WRONG and show extreamly POOR JUDGEMENT.

<p>Whoa! Hope I didn't scare anyone there, but here's the deal: I logged in, checked my watchlist, and went into the "edit your watchlist" page. There I found a number of pages, all redlinked, with highly suspect titles, which I <i>certainly</i> hadn't added. The list of the added pages is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>EGADS!!!! what are all the block bots on vaccation or something?</li>
<li>Hey Kitten Boy!!! Forget about something!?</li>
<li>Just one of your bumbling admin buddies</li>
<li>Penis!</li>

<li>User:Special Penis</li>
<li>User:Sponsered by voters for the desyopsing of curps and his damned block bots</li>

<li>User:WoohooI love stupid admins, who unblock when they're not supposed to</li>
<li>User:Woohookitty/Hey Kitten Boy!!! Forget about something!?</li>
</ol>
<p>Although I'm not entirely sure why someone would break into my account to add bizarre titles to my watchlist, I don't really know what else could've happened. As far as I checked, all of the edits made under my account were done by me, so as far as editing goes I appear to be clear.</p>
<p>Given the names of some of the titles, I have to ask: if one of you lads did this, kindly fess up. It's O.K., it's funny enough, no worries, I won't prosecute. If this is the case, then I don't really care.</p>
<p>If that unlikely scenario doesn't bear fruit, then I'd appreciate someone CheckUsering me to see what that reveals. When you do so, e-mail me and I'll give you a list of the locations of the IP addresses you should be seeing (sadly, I don't know the exact addresses, and I know that at least my home IP is static). I'll ask an ArbCom member if I need to, but if one of you is reading this, then please feel free and welcome to do so now.</p>
<p>Sadly, I don't have the internet access I'd like to have in order to deal with this, but I'll make a strong and concerted effort to find some tomorrow to see what's been written and to respond. Oh, and if anyone's had a similar experience or has any ideas about what happened, please leave a post.

<dd>But that would leave a redirect that even if deleted would show up on deleted revisions as well as the fact page move vandals normally set off all the bells and whistles for people monitoring the move log, just doesn't seem like the standard page move vandal style... but that's just my take on it. <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="red">Jtkiefer</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="orange">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="green">C</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="blue">@</font></a></sup></small> ---- 01:11, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Those really were the result of page move vandalism. When you add a talk page to your watchlist, only the main page itself shows up on the actual list.

<p>A final decision has been reached in this arbitration case. Beckjord and his socks are banned from Wikipedia for one year. When he comes back he may not edit articles related to the paranormal, interpreted broadly to include the likes of crop circles and Bigfoot. He is banned from sock puppetry, placed on personal attack parole, and general probation. He can be banned for disruption by any three administrators.</p>
<p>This is a formal request for implementation of the one year ban by a block. His socks are listed on the evidence page.</p>

<p>EffK is banned from Wikipedia for one year (I have enforced this already). When he returns, he is banned from editing Catholicism articles, and may be banned from any articles he disrupts. Should EffK violate these prohibitions, he may be briefly blocked, up to a week in the event of repeated violations. After 5 blocks, the maximum block shall increase to one year.</p>

<dd>Famekeeper was certainly the same user as EffK, but it's not a normal case of sockpuppetry. He registered originally as <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamekeeper_f5a0.html" title="User:Flamekeeper">User:Flamekeeper</a>, but did not want to give Wikipedia his e-mail address. Therefore, when after a few months the computer asked him to re-enter his password, which he had lost, he had to register a new account, <a href="../../../f/i/a/User%7EFiamekeeper_763f.html" title="User:Fiamekeeper">User:Fiamekeeper</a>. Then he lost his password again, and when the computer demanded that he log in, he registered again as <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorecticus_3427.html" title="User:Corecticus">User:Corecticus</a>. That was abandoned for <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamekeeper_69ec.html" title="User:Famekeeper">User:Famekeeper</a>, which was followed by <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPureSoupS_5561.html" title="User:PureSoupS">User:PureSoupS</a>, and he finally re-emerged as <a href="../../../e/f/f/User%7EEffK_b5e6.html" title="User:EffK">User:EffK</a>. He has never tried to deny that his new account was a reincarnation of an old one, and has on various occasions denied that he used sockpuppets. He recently made a long farewell speech, and signed it as EffK, then logged in again as Flamekeeper, and signed, saying that he had found his password, then signed again as Corecticus and Famekeeper, but said he was unable to sign as Fiamekeeper, and didn't attempt to sign as PureSoupS. Since he has been open about these identities, and never used two accounts simultaneously, until the night of his grand farewell, I don't think they should be blocked as <i>sockpuppets</i>. I do, however, think it's appropriate to block them, but feel a different wording should be used. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:06, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>IMHO, we don't need an RFC about this. Both sides of recent debates about censorship, userboxes, etc. are understandable and don't need to escalate into wheel wars. What we do need is a resolution to the userbox debate specifically, because it is much too stressful. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 01:56, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it all dates back to Kelly's mishandling of the userbox issue, along with Neo's behaviour over templates. Whatever about the rights and wrongs of the issues, their mishandling of the incidents created such a breakdown in community trust that everyone seems to mistrust everyone else. It had been unravelling before then but their actions led to a firestorm of anger that is still raging, except that it is now directed elsewhere. So issues that could have been handled (reasonably) calmly are now mired in mistrust and a fear that someone else is going to try to bulldoze something through. As the fiasco over the Mohammad cartoons shows in the Middle East shows, a small issue can ignite an underlying unhappiness, impacting far beyond the original issue. So instead of community trust, we seem to have a lot of "I'll do it to you before you do it to me". But I don't know how we stop it. As WP gets bigger it becomes less manageable, less governable and less of a small community. Organic societies like ours can go one of two ways: they can work or they can implode. WP could go either way. It needs management to avoid implosion, but the problem is that its lack of rules at the start means that some will see that management as controlling and react against it. (Examples: if we had had a policy on userboxes to start off with, we wouldn't have got into the mess that has resulted, leading to Kelly's unilateral mishandling of the situation, in turn producing a negative reaction. If we had from the start a cohesive strategy for photo use we wouldn't have all the bad feeling caused by poorly judged deletions.) It is a complex problem. I expect theses will be written in the future not merely on Wikipedia but with titles such as "WIKIPEDIA: THE ORGANIC EVOLUTION OF A COMMUNITY", "MANAGING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES: THE WIKIPEDIA EXPERIENCE" and "CENTRALISING POWER IN ORGANICALLY EVOLVING ORGANISATIONS: THE WIKIPEDIA EXAMPLE". And the stuff on this page on on for example paedophiles will be analysed in academic papers and books. (Maybe I should write one of my own on WP! lol. But only when I finish the two I am currently writing.) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 02:07, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Remove polemical things from Template: and Category: space, but let people subst: them first, and otherwise let users state rather inflamatory things on their user pages.

<p>I wouldn't put too much of the blame just on Kelly. There are a number of long-timers who have taken the stance that their personal ideas of what is best for the encyclopedia are so important and urgent that there is no civil way to approach the issues. The rhetoric seems to be, "If I'm right, I don't have to be civil." And I think the community has somewhat unwittingly encouraged this behavior by making it pay off—the most expedient way to get attention for one's pet issue lately seems to be taking rash action that is bound to raise a ruckus. Allowing "<a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a>" to be misused in this way with impunity has helped this kind of culture take root. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 02:33, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Things happened pretty quickly, so I'm not sure if my action was appropriate. However, I will do my best to explain what happened:</p>
<p>The account was originally blocked by <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> for having an inappropriate username. However, the block seemed to cause collateral damage, as several IPs (possible AOL proxies) were automatically blocked. I unblocked the account, hoping that the vandal had gone away. Unfortunately, I was wrong. As soon as the account was unblocked, it started vandalizing again.</p>
<p>However, the vandal had posted his password on his talk page, although the edits containing the password have been deleted. I logged onto the account and changed its password so that it cannot be used again.</p>
<p>I hope that I did the right thing. --<a href="../../../i/x/f/User%7EIxfd64_14d3.html" title="User:Ixfd64">Ixfd64</a> 02:57, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>There's nothing new here: vandals have figured out how to leverage a single username block into a denial of service attack on all of AOL, thanks to the deadly combination of Mediawiki's autoblocking and AOL's round-robin allocation of IP addresses.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, "Troll penis" was not blocked just for the username... this is a known vandal. This user has created socks with various variations of this name (including Greek and Cyrillic letters spoofing Latin... that's actually a capital Tau) and has committed vandalism with them in the past.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's nothing admins can do about this. Since AOL won't change their IP allocation policies, only a Mediawiki software change will work (maybe build in knowledge of AOL ranges and never autoblock an AOL range; maybe abolish autoblocks altogether; maybe allow admins to specify at block time whether or not a block should be applied on an underlying IP address; maybe create a new class of "confirmed" registered users (any account that's demonstrably not a throwaway account) who are immune to autoblocks).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This has been going on for months. AOL users complain to us, but only the developers can do something about this.</dd>

<dd>I have suggested a similar idea before. Basically, administrators would be able to "whitelist" users.

<p>Regarding other usernames, it's fairly clear that some of them are created simply for the purpose of getting the underlying IP blocked (eg, the "please block me" accounts).

<dd>The problem is, AOL users only see the name of the administrator who applied the block on the original username, and complain bitterly to us. Often they don't read the autoblock notice carefully, they only see the edit summary applicable to the original block, mistakenly believe it applies to them, and then they ask "Why are you accusing me of vandalism? please look at my contribution history, I've never vandalized". Sometimes angry, sometimes anguished.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What exactly are we supposed to tell these folks? Too bad, and it'll happen again soon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These autoblocks presumably last 24 hours like any other, which is inconsistent with the suggested policy of limiting explicit AOL IP blocks to a much shorter duration.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And of course, admins have no way of knowing that the registered user they just blocked is an AOL user, and even if we knew, it wouldn't matter because there's no way to block just the username without triggering autoblocks. And we can't not block because then the vandal just goes nuts and laughs at us.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given AOL's round-robin IP allocation, we <i>know</i> that autoblocks on an AOL IP address:
<ol>
<li>never do any good</li>
<li>always do harm</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>So, logically, somehow we have to find some way, any way, to avoid doing something that never does any good and always does harm.

<p>A useful solution would be a checkbox labelled "<i>Do not block other users from this IP</i>". It'd have a dual purpose: if applied to a username block, it would disable the autoblocker; if applied to an IP block, it would allow logged-in users to edit from that IP. Both are features that have been frequently requested. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 06:35, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>all things considered, AOL treats it's <b>paying</b> customers like cattle, so it's not terribly realistic to expect them to actually respond to a representative of wikipedia, when they basically ignore their own clients, not to mention, they're not exactly going to go out an change their entire proxy system just because someone asks them to, I mean of the last 8 or so "upgrades" for AOL, none of been anything more than cosmetic, I don't think they've even upgraded their servers since back in the days of the dial-up-modem, I wouldn't be suprised if they don't even <i>have</i> real tech support people on staff, just graphic artists who decide how to make the interface even more ugly than the previous version...</dd>

<p>Well, considering we now have more traffic than they do (says Alexa at least), we may have some leverage with them. Has anyone in an official position tried contacting their network admins? There's got to be a way to find their actual contact information rather than abuse@aol.com. But if they don't respond to polite, well placed requests, we could always issue a press release saying we're banning all of AOL because of their brain damaged policies. (More politely worded of course.) My guess is finally the bad press would be enough to get some action out of AOL and we could all live happily ever after.

All content reversions on this page must be discussed on the article talk page. The mentors are to have a free hand, do not have veto over each other's actions, will be communicating closely and will generally trust each other's judgement. Any mentor, upon good cause shown, may ban any user from editing <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuro-linguistic_programming.html" title="Neuro-linguistic programming">Neuro-linguistic programming</a> or a related page.

<p>The selected mentors are <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a>, and <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a>.

While any admin is empowered to enforce the probation, it would be preferable to alert one of the mentors (unless necessity dictates otherwise) as they will serve as admins knowledgeable and aware of the conflict.

<p>This is obviously a very sensitive area, as we can see from recent discussion. I think there are questions that we need to formalise answers to, before we are forced to by hostile media interviews.</p>
<ul>
<li>What would we do if someone found evidence that a pedophile was using Wikipedia for indecent purposes? I think this is very unlikely, since Wikipedia is fundamentally public (and the opposite of most chatrooms or messaging services). But we need an answer.</li>
<li>Is there a consensus that self-identifying pedophiles are entitled to edit as much as anyone else? Are there limits to the degree to which they can state that identity on Wikipedia?</li>
<li>Do any additional steps need to be taken to ensure that pedopilia-related articles are NPOV?</li>
</ul>
<p>There is already the ludicrous <a href="http://www.wikipedophilia.com" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedophilia.com" rel="nofollow">Wikipedophilia.com</a>.

Also, if you look at the history of <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophile_activism.html" title="Pedophile activism">Pedophile activism</a>, for instance, it's clear that people have been inserting pro-pedophilia comments. In that particular case the Wiki process sorted it out, and the last thing I want is any more moral panic.

<dd>I think self-identifying paedophiles are <i>less</i> of a risk to our younger contributers than those who don't identify themselves. Statistically, we probably have an active paedophile or two among our editors and we certainly have active paedophiles among our readers: but then the same goes for blog sites. It is a question of general Internet security: people should not just assume that because someone says they are a 16-year old boy from the Sydney suburbs then they really are. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhyschim62_05f3.html" title="User talk:Physchim62">(talk)</a> 17:03, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Rename</b> at very least, <b>preferably delete</b>.

<dd>I don't know; the possibility of it going horribly wrong (being infiltrated by bad-faith users of one sort or another); and the likelihood that it will a) be misinterpreted and b) be inactive. However, this is WP:AN and not a deletion debate.The recent storms suggest that the default position of 'do nothing' might not have a consensus, i'm trying to stimulate more discussion to see whether that is the case.

<dd>Yeah, having someone else block you has the same consequences as blocking yourself (collateral damage to underlying IPs and users that share the IP address), hence, it's not generally allowed.

The latter egregious stuff was a few months ago, I guess he doesn't do that anymore, but apparently the POV editing has continued.</p>
<p>Back in December he took exception when I speedy deleted his fourth or fifth re-creation of an AfD'd article, and some discussions ensued, see Talk:Cuban espionage and related extraterritorial activity revised. At the time it was clear he didn't believe in <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, believed he owned the articles he created, and most significantly, did not believe his contributions were covered under the GFDL. He appeared to be quite suspicious of the motives of others and not easily won over to Wikipedia philosophies and principles.</p>
<p>After that I moved on, it was mostly the stuff I considered egregious that I was concerned with (re-creation of deleted articles and adding Cuba stuff to non-Cuba articles), and I didn't really care to get involved in content disputes over Cuban-related topics.
