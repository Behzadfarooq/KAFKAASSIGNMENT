<p>I would like some advice in dealing with a tendentious editor on policy/guideline pages. He doesn't understand that guidelines are prescriptive and thus keeps editing them to reflect what he thinks <i>should</i> happen instead of what actually does happen according to consensus. He makes arguments for this using spurious logic, misinterpreting other policy or guidelines, ignoring evidence to the contrary, insisting on straw polls to "prove" him right, and personal attacks. He reminds me of the ill-fated Zen-Master <small>(no, he's not a sock, he just acts similarly)</small>. Basically, he is starting to show all the signs listed on <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Wikipedia:Disruptive editing</a>, except it's in Wikispace and it's not out of hand (yet?). I tried talking to him but that doesn't help; other suggestions would be welcome. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 08:24, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh yeah, I should be less obtuse&#160;:) It's <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFresheneesz_6a7b.html" title="User talk:Fresheneesz">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fresheneesz_d7d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fresheneesz">contribs</a>). This has been going on for about three weeks now. Among others, he has claimed that style guidelines aren't guidelines, that there's a difference between guidelines, "full guidelines" and "official guidelines", that the GFDL isn't policy, that numbers aren't verifiable because addition is original research, that policy pages may not link to non-policy pages because of a status conflict, that AFD is a vote and therefore Wikipedia uses polls whenever desired, and that it's proper (or even possible) to make a guideline to force editors to stop a common practice. Oh, and a bunch of personal attacks thrown in, and calls for people to "fight" others.</dd>
<dd>His main agenda appears to be opposition to <a href="../../../d/d/v/WP%7EDDV_84f5.html" title="WP:DDV">WP:DDV</a> (formerly VIE) and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> - however, confusingly, he makes a somewhat nebulous difference between notability and votes (which he opposes) and significance and polls (which he approves of). Anyway, while he has every right to his opinion, the above practices are not at all a constructive approach. These two diffs pretty much sum it up: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Appealing_a_block&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75219588" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Appealing_a_block&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75219588" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Appealing_a_block&amp;diff=75575618&amp;oldid=75526289" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Appealing_a_block&amp;diff=75575618&amp;oldid=75526289" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</dd>

<dd>My thoughts... ignore it. Seriously, the changes he is suggesting are significant and the number of people who knew of them insignificant (though 'advertising' like this may change that). Generally major changes like this happen because alot of people want them to happen. One guy and a couple of people who say, 'yeah I can sort of see some benefit to that but what about these three problems?', don't seem likely to amount to much. Even if he holds a 'poll' and five out of the six participants support him... a reason to significantly rework Wikipedia policy it is not. If he tries to change policy without widespread consensus it can be dealt with then. If it <i>develops</i> widespread consensus... well then it is a reality of what users do and could then be recognized as such. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:50, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like to note that Radiant seriously misconstrews my actions and my thoughts. Many of the things he complains about me are old news - for example, I did claim that "style guides" weren't guidelines - but I have seen that I'm wrong, a looooong time ago. Also, he misinterprets me, for example - AfDs using polling, they aren't pure votes. Wikipedia *does* use polling, as i'm sure all of you know. Radiant is under the perception that polls shouldn't be used on wikipedia at all - and hes making his case by tagging his pet proposal <a href="../../../d/d/v/WP%7EDDV_84f5.html" title="WP:DDV">WP:DDV</a> as a guideline without any clear consensus. Hes actually gone so far as to delete a poll I was trying to run - saying that I "just don't get it".</dd>

<dd>I can't disagree that radiant has a very many good edits, but almost any time i'm dealing with him, its somthing disruptive and agressive (probably because I don't bug him when he does stuff well). Frankly, I find his actions abusive. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 01:43, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't pitch in then, as I have had a long-standing disagreement with Fresheneesz over other issues. In fact, I think Fresheneesz's non-notability policy may have been a response to the aggressive pruning of articles on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_rapid_transit.html" title="Personal rapid transit">personal rapid transit</a> subjects, particularly the <a href="../../../u/n/i/UniModal_ee4c.html" title="UniModal">UniModal</a> concept by Douglas Malewicki, which currently has no prototype, no funding, no customers, no test track and no similar installations in use anywhere in the world but is being pitched all the time. Personal rapid transit is a transportation technology which in several decades has yet to achieve a single real-world implementation, although one very small installation quite unlike the wide-scale urban schemes described in the article is currently being constructed in the car park at Heathrow Airport. Heaven forfend that we should say so, though, as that would be bias of the most appalling sort&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">User:Stephen B Streater</a> may be a good person to ask, he has more patience with Fresheneesz than I do. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 09:53, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Same old bullshit, I see. My POV is that the article should reflect reality, not what Douglas Malewicki and Jerry Schneider think reality <i>should</i> be. In this I succeeded admirably for a long time against considerable opposition from you and Fresheneesz. Stephen Streater also pitched in, and you'll note that his views pretty much coincided with mine: it's a hypothetical form of urban transport, interesting but unproven. Last time I looked the article still represented my POV, starting out by saying that it is a category of <i>proposed</i> urban transport, and that no wide-scale implementations exist or are planned. You can portray this as victory for yourself if you like, as long as the article remains accurate in respect of the unproven nature of the scheme I don't really acre overmuch. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 11:52, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fresheneesz has established a clear pattern of disruptive editing on policy pages. It is not so much his opinions, though to be clear his view on voting is completely mistaken, but his method of making them. You can't change policies you don't like by modifying the tag yourself, and trying to round up others to revert for you, and concocting votes where there is no dispute, and being rude to others, and especially not when you are simply wrong. I feel like our time is being wasted for no discernable reason. I am ready to suggest a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_probation_92b5.html" title="Wikipedia:Community probation">community ban</a> from policy pages, at least for a bit.

<dd>It's clear that Fresheneesz has been primarily engaged in policy edits by the contributions. There's a patter of a response to a Wikipedia talk: page, followed by editing of the policy in question. The responses of the user on the talk page are not very combative, they are tearse though. I think Fresheneesz is meaning to do good things, but in an improper and inappropriate way without discussion. Proposed and official guidelines and policies must be hashed out with appropriate channels. Fresheneesz, post to the talk page what you'd like to change, or make a user subpage. I'm not for community banning a user for taking a part of policy or process, just watch your steps and consider the whole community before editing a policy or guideline.

<p>It's good to avoid unnecessarily hostility. Fresheneesz has put a lot of work into developing a view of how Wikipedia should work. His generous view of notability is out of line with consensus, but OTOH the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notability</a> article is less than a month old and has not yet completely settled down. Whether such an article in flux should be termed a guidline or a proposal shouldn't be allowed to cloud the bigger issue - whether there should be a guideline at all. I started the rationale section to show how the guidline relates to policy, and Centrx and others have refined this. The article is becoming tied down to official policy. In the mean time, I suggest Fresheneesz raises his more general points about notability - perhaps on the mailing list. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 11:54, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Based on this discussion on AN/I and the numerous comments on Freesheneesz's talk page, I support an <i><b>one week community probation that prohibits Freesheneesz from editing all pages related to the Wikipedia policy, guidelines, essays.</b></i> Additionally I suggest an <i><b>one week community probation that prohibits Freesheneesz from editing Policy/Guidelines talk pages. For the duration of this probation, Freesheneesz is restricted from editing places that these discussions occur and starting policy discussions on another user's talk page.</b></i> After the probation ends Freesheneesz is encouraged to limit his discuss of his ideas to the talk pages of these policies and other customary places for these discussions. Freesheneesz is counseled to avoid spamming his opinions across multiple user and article talk pages.</dd>

<dd>This restriction on talk page discussions is necessary to remind this user that we are here to write great articles not great policy.

The suggested sanction for disregarding the article ban is a 24 hour block with the block time adjusted up or down according to Freesheneesz's response.

<dd>I agree. I browsed the talk page, and there were several people on both sides of the debate. It was not just Fresheneesz. In fact, a quick look at the history of the page shows two editors other than Fresheneesz changing guideline back to proposal. Also, I am new to this debate, but Radiant's argument seems dangerously circular: he says Notability should be a guideline because that's what is currently done, but he ignores the fact that what is currently done is controversial (isn't notability one of the most hotly debated topics in content disputes?). Shouldn't there be a more rigorous process for accepting a controversial guidline than "Well everyone's doing it these days, so why not?"? The Notability "guidline" was still listed as a proposal just two weeks ago, so this is far from a settled issue.</dd>
<dd>Back to the question of Fresheneesz, I've not seen any evidence of behavior that would warrant a probation (what does "community probation" mean anyway? Does that mean he's blocked but not really blocked?). Radiant's original complaint was vague, and the evidence presented by others seem to prove nothing more than a minor dispute. Perhaps before any action is taken, someone should document here exactly what edits he made to deserve this probation? <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 13:28, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These two remarks are a sample of some that go beyond simply debating the policy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78610971" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78610971" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Non-notability&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78656876" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Non-notability&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78656876" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Freesheneesz is ratcheting up the discussions past the point where a civil exchange of ideas is going to occur. This topic ban is preventative not punitive. Freesheneesz needs to learn the boundaries for productive editing related to policy changes. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 14:11, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, I just don't see it. The first is a relatively polite plea to Jimbo to intercede (certainly not unusual or in violation of anything), the second is a single revert of a rejection of the policy proposal - and note that he did not re-revert after that. Was consensus reached on rejecting that proposal? It's quite possible that the other editor was jumping the gun on rejection. In any event, he did not re-revert.</dd>
<dd>I still see no evidence of anything more than a spirited debate. Let's not overreact here. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 15:43, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did some poking around on Non-notability talk page, and it seems there was an extended debate over whether to have a straw poll - Fresheneesz wanted one, Radiant didn't; when Fresheneesz started one, Radiant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Non-notability&amp;diff=78462707&amp;oldid=78460174" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Non-notability&amp;diff=78462707&amp;oldid=78460174" rel="nofollow">deleted it</a>, which angered Fresheneesz. Regardless of the merits of straw polls, there is no policy against them, so was it appropriate for Radiant to delete Fresheneesz's edits? Now, if Fresheneesz was <i>misusing</i> the results of a straw poll to, say, change the proposal to a guideline, that might be a different issue. But just calling for a poll doesn't seem to be like that big a deal, and deleting it was unwarranted. So I believe this just is a spirited debate with some minor transgressions on both sides -- and we shouldn't be singling out one side or the other. In fact, Stephen B Streater has a good solution below: they should <i>both</i> back off the notability pages for a few days and let things cool down. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 16:16, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. Fresheneesz clearly lost his temper a bit here, but Radiant also deleted Fresheneesz's poll on the talk page. If you are going to condemn Fresheneesz for his hostility, then Radiant cannot be excused for his actions either. Frankly, I consider removing someone's talk page comments (that's considered vandalism, isn't it?) a more serious offense than the incivility shown by Fresheneesz.

<li>A poll is not a comment. Removing polls is common practice because polls are generally considered a Bad Idea (needlessly polarizing, not conductive to consensus and inhibiting creativity; see also <a href="../../../d/d/v/WP%7EDDV_84f5.html" title="WP:DDV">WP:DDV</a>). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 22:49, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Removing polls is commonplace? So anyone has the right to remove anyone else's poll? This doesn't seem right. Also, I found this quote on <a href="../../../d/d/v/WP%7EDDV_84f5.html" title="WP:DDV">WP:DDV</a>: <i>"Straw polls, a type of non-binding poll, are sometimes used to gauge where editors stand after a lengthy discussion. Such a poll can be a simple tool to help explore and negotiate a consensus, and is often seen as a simple means to recap current positions, or to test or document a likely consensus."</i> That article also says <i>"Polling isn't evil in itself"</i>, and I didn't find anything that says polls should be deleted on sight. In fact, the guideline seems to say that polling itself is not evil unless the results of the poll are misused. Certainly the "evils" of polling, if any, pale in comparison to the evils of deleting someone else's comments (we're not talking about personal attacks here) <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 23:12, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I read the guideline (DDV), and the spirit of the rule seems to be "Polls are not evil, but they can be misused". In fact, the words "Polling isn't evil in itself" appears more than once. Straw polling even seems to get a mild endorsement on the page (<i>"Such a poll can be a simple tool..."</i>). I see no justification in that guideline (neither literally nor in its spirit) for removing another editor's straw poll. Now, maybe deleting polls is commonly done, and maybe it's even an accepted practice, but I don't see where that's documented as policy or guideline; in fact, it seems to run smack in the face of two well-known policies: civility and vandalism. I think I would have reacted the same way as Fresheneesz, if my edits were deleted in this fashion. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 03:46, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One interesting thing I see is that peoples main grudge against me is that they think i'm taking policy/guideline into my own hands - and changing tags without discussion, etc. The funny thing is, that is exactly what i'm combating. A select few editors have been trying to change old guidelines into non-guidelines, and new proposals into <i>old</i> guidelines - without consensus. I've come in contact with a larger group that agrees with Radiant than I expected to find - and these people all agree that guideline is basically someones description of what already goes on. Personally, I find that view of guidelines to be very inefficient, because rather than giving us the ability to better wikipedia, we are at the mercy of what people already do. That narrows our options a bit.</dd>

I don't want wikipedia to turn into a giant beuracracy, or some oligarchy of abusive admins. I'd like wikipedia to stay as a place based on consensus, with a common goal of helping people.</dd>

<dd>Calling an established editor's edits vandalism is considered poor form on Wikipedia. Do you think that Doc has suddenly become a vandal? Wasn't he putting a specific tag on an failed proposal. Didn't Doc mark out a straw poll that the editors of that proposed policy had not agreed to use? IMO, neither of these actions deserve warnings, but discussion. Please make your comment on the talk page and then wait for many other people to remark before you claim to know something so strongly that you will start an arbitration case against those that disagree. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 00:07, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He is not a vandal, and I didn't say he was. However, good editors, and good administrators still have the power to vandalize wikipedia - and he has used that power.

You haven't told me i'm wrong that "<i>deleting someones talk page posts is vandalism</i>" - so i'll just assume you don't disagree.</dd>

<dd>So I'm 'not a vandal', I have just 'used my power to vandalize'. Well, I'm glad that's not a personal attack then. I didn't 'delete your post', I struck through a poll you'd unilaterally opened in the teeth of objections. 'No one has agreed not to use straw polls'? WTF type of logic is that? No one has agreed that I shouldn't block you for a week either - so can I? The notion that notability should not be used as a criterion for deletion is often suggested - and there is nothing approaching a consensus to support it. (See any deletion debate for evidence.)

<dd>Just curious: why is there such extreme objection to a straw poll? <i>What's the big deal??</i> I think the actions you and Radiant have taken to prevent these straw polls are way out of line.

<dd>I don't like polls, but if there is consensus to conduct one, and a reasonable discussion of its purpose and wording, then so be it. But this had none of these - one user instigated a worthless poll, on his own terms. I did not revert 'on sight without discussion', there was endless discussion on the talk page, at the end of which one user unilaterally, in the face of objections, initiated a polling process. I struck it, allowing for further discussion as to the merits/dismetits of the poll.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 15:02, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So there has to be a consensus just to conduct a straw poll? How does one gauge consensus on this - might I suggest a poll?&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>Seriously, I just think deleting someone else's poll crosses the line. There is no policy or guideline that <i>forbids</i> polling, and therefore removing it seems quite unwarranted. As I said before, I think I would have reacted the exact same way as he did, because deleting others' good faith comments is generally considered vandalism.

<dd>Is removing talk page comments considered "reverting"? I mean, come on, you keep talking like deleting someone's comments is nothing worse than a simple revert, when you know that it's more than that. I'm shocked that both you and Radiant have not only taken these actions, but continue to defend them as "no big deal" while you attack Fresheneesz for <i>insinuating vandalism</i> in response. Something is out of whack here, that you feel fully justified in removing someone's non-binding straw poll (no matter how <b>you</b> feel about) but are <i>up in arms</i> about that same user calling your actions vandalism and telling you (politely!) he's taking you to arbitration! I'll repeat: I probably would have done the same thing Fresheneesz did in response to your actions, and I can honestly say I understand his frustrations that he's being made to look like the only aggressor in this debate. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 22:11, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The removal of legitimate warnings doesn't have to be defined as vandalism to prohibit it. In fact, {{Wr4}} states that "Removing legitimate warnings from your talk page is considered disruption." Disruptive behavior can be prevented, even when there is no written policy against it. Indeed, many unregistered users have had their talk pages semi-protected to prevent further warning removal -- for a few examples, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=User_talk:130.65.109.52" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=User_talk:130.65.109.52" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=User_talk:24.52.175.10" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=User_talk:24.52.175.10" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. Furthermore, the warning removal templates have recently undergone a TFD discussion, <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_2006_August_9_c989.html#Template:wr.2C_wr2.2C_wr3.2C_wr4" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2006 August 9">Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_August_9#Template:wr.2C_wr2.2C_wr3.2C_wr4</a>, which indicates a clear consensus to keep them. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 21:21, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The TFD process does indeed involve placement of notices on the affected templates to notify interested users. However, many users actively participate in many TFD discussions. Consequently, a number of users would have seen the discussion on the TFD page; we should not conclude that the editors participating in the discussion were necessarily unrepresentative. Furthermore, if TFD discussions <a href="../../../d/d/v/WP%7EDDV_84f5.html" title="WP:DDV">aren't votes</a>, then we can't assume that the discussion was closed as "keep" simply because there was a strong supermajority in favor of this outcome.

<li>I can see what the template says, but please explain to me how it could be disruptive to the encyclopedia to remove a warning from a user talk page?

Furthermore, the argument that "TFD... cannot decide on policy/guideline matters" is unconvincing since <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_Bureaucracy" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 23:47, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I see, and that is indeed a good point. I suppose a counterargument would be that Wikipedia tends to make things easier for editors than for maintenance workers (including the CVU, admins, etc). Not that I necessarily agree with that but it seems to be the way things work. I believe the main problem is this: removing warnings hampers the CVU - but since it's not actually possible to stop people from removing warnings, you have to check people's history anyway. So prohibiting warning removal doesn't really solve your problem. I think a better result would come from a technical solution, possibly involving some automated off-wiki log page (<a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> used to have a very effective off-wiki log page). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 00:04, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>At least for unregistered users, it is "actually possible to stop people from removing [legitimate] warnings", without blocking them, by semi-protecting their talk pages. A technical solution to parse talk page histories and display the warnings contained there might be valuable -- however, until such a solution is developed, we are constrained to do the best that we can with the existing technology. Furthermore, if we are to designate the talk page history rather than the current version of the talk page as an archive of warnings, such warnings will be effectively irremovable, except by administrators, even where the warnings are mistaken, or completely frivolous. It is possible for an administrator to remove frivolous warnings from a user's talk page history, by deleting the talk page, then restoring the revisions without the frivolous warnings. Such talk page history deletions might frequently be necessary, if we are to rely on the talk page histories to indicate legitimate warnings, but not frivolous warnings. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 00:35, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you want to talk disruption, I have seen far more disruption resulting from edit wars over talk page warnings than would ever be caused by the simple removal itself. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:21, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with Thatcher131, the way to do this is not to allow policy violations until we create a technical solution. We had discussed technical solutions on <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Removing_warnings_cf76.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Removing warnings">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Removing warnings</a>, but it kind of fizzled due to the fact that no-one who really needed such a technical solution was involved in the discussion. I would suggest reviving discussion there. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 15:07, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with what others have said about the need to find ways of keeping track of 'disruptive users' which are not <i>themselves</i> disruptive. Revert warring to enforce warnings (which are all too often specious to begin with) and then throwing these 'you will be blocked' templates at people causes far more problems than the issue it is designed to address. As to the TfD... there was an active debate on this issue at the time the TfD was running, but the existence of the TfD was only mentioned in that debate after it had concluded. The TfD thus obviously did not include the opinions of many who object to this practice. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 15:24, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user threatened me with violence after I just nicely commented that a certain picture should be kept.

<p>This is not a legal threat against the encyclopedia, but against a user who has used the encyclopedia to perform a criminal threat. Why should I be punished for it?</p>
<p>At least in the Finnish juridic system, even though it is the Internet, threats of violence will be dealt with seriously. A minimum punishment would be a fine, but if he happens to be felon under probation (for example), he will go back to prison.</p>

<dd>I think that given the nature of the threat, your reaction was understandable. I might also suggest that, although it's probably just rhetoric (if only for geographical reasons), Sahands be asked by an admin to withdraw the physical threat. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 14:14, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

After Sahands was supposedly banned, this is what is now on his personal page: User Talk Sahands Death threat Quote: "Jk-BMW - Jussi Korkala &lt;jkorkala@gmail.com&gt;&lt;---the most fucking retard on earth, your location has been tracked down, my boys will come for you now and kill off you and your waste of a family..."</p>
<p>So now it has become a death threat. A DEATH THREAT to me and to my family. I think additional action is required.</p>

<dd>In two and a half years here, serving as an admin a lot of that time, I have received at least five separate death threats. I ignore them. Doing anything else would waste too much of my time.

I'm most concerned with hogeye's creation of a "neutral" disambiguation page for anarchism (<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Anarchism (disambiguation)">Anarchism (disambiguation)</a>) despite a clear rejection on the anarchism talk page (a couple different times) of his proposal to do so. The page now redirects to anarchism, as does his pov fork <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28political%29.html" title="Anarchism (political)">anarchism (political)</a>. The other pov fork that he created was <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28social%29.html" title="Anarchism (social)">anarchism (social)</a> which now redirects to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_anarchism.html" title="Social anarchism">social anarchism</a>. He reverted attempts by different users (including myself and Bishonen, an admin) to redirect <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28social%29.html" title="Anarchism (social)">anarchism (social)</a> to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>, calling them vandalism in the edit summaries, which resulted in a 3RR block and several condemnations by various editors and admins, including ones who aren't at all involved in all the battles on the anarchism page. And guess what some of his first edits were after his block expired? You guessed it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism_%28disambiguation%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78751465" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism_%28disambiguation%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78751465" rel="nofollow">reverting Bunchofgrapes</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism_%28political%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78751716" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism_%28political%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78751716" rel="nofollow">myself</a>. Hogeye has openly encouraged edit warring and gaming of the system. He refuses to abide by consensus and is incredibly disruptive. I has said it a thousand times, and I'll say it again: <b>we need to ban him indefinitely!</b> He has consistently shown a lack of restraint and good faith, and I am seriously sick of trying to work with him. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 07:18, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think so. Did you see his block log? Honestly, I'm not sure why he wasn't blocked indefinitely as soon as he got the 3RR vio a couple of days ago. His last block was for 2 months. I only did 1 week earlier today mostly because I know that other admins are more versed on him than I and I didn't want to overdo it. But I can't see disagreeing with the block. He's shown no inclination to change. To me, content forks are the most disruptive thing you can do outside of random page moves. And that's what he's been doing. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 01:44, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi. (Not sure non-admins can even post here, but anyways...) I watch this page a bunch, to see how Wiki 'works' behind the curtains, and I have to say, being a 'new reader' to the articles iin question, that it looks like Hogeye's got a lot of research and solid ideas in his versions, and while it's clear he's breaking lots of policy, I have to ask, how did this entire mess get started? was this a case of too much being bold and not enough talk page? Is there any way to merge his long historical content on anarchism in to the page, finding a compromise? <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 17:28, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to me that if this is your worry, then it's not so much the administrators you are concerned with, but rather, <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>.</p>
<p>To be honest, an article about wikipedians in the media may just be a reasonable topic for an encyclopedia - it's about a noteable subject that someone may just look for, and wiki would naturally be the first plce to look for it. Naturally, this user would have a reasonable entry on such an article. However, an article about a wikipedian who's become an 'E' list celebrity for nothingmore than editing really is little more than a vanity thing.</p>
<p>In terms of the vote - to the best of my knowledge, it's rather like the RfA process - the votes can be counted, but the comments are more important, and so with valid reason, it's perfectly acceptable (and required) to go against consencus by invoking <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> for the sake of the encyclopedia, which is what's happened here wit <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">User:The Land</a>.

<dd>I am not sure that trying to trip me up on whether I deleted it on the basis of A7 <i>or</i> IAR is very helpful. I was perfectly aware that there were two AfDs which had been closed as keeps, and therefore a7 as written was of limited help. However, I felt that it was nevertheless an unencyclopedic biography, and applied IAR in ignoring the AfD discussions and part of the written CSD rules, to remove content which was clearly unencyclopedic: and gave a7 as the deletion reason because that is the CSD that matches unencyclopedic biographical articles.

<dd>Thats a fair comment, and I'd have to agree that it's probably not te best use of WP:IAR in the world on that basis. I just don't believe that an admin has done anything strictly "wrong" with it - though certainly somewhat eyebrow raising so to speak (ie - the minor controversy here). To be honest, having looked at googles cached page of the article, I'd have to say that the form it was in (unless there were major changes afterwards) was little more than a stub. Were it to be expanded, then it could only ever go into such things as editing style, preferred articles, articles created or featured, etc, etc. Of course, that would be vanity anywhere other than in userspace, where EVERYbody has their own page.</dd>

<dd>I can understand using A7 in combination with WP:IAR (vanity) - though given the exact wording of A7, it's nothing if not a contraversial thing to do - it is possible to see that The Land may well feel he was acting in in the spirit of the clause in the best interests of wiki though (<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>). Whatever happens, I can only hope that the DRV will have the final say on the matter, and will make a judgement poste haste, without passing judgement on the good faith actions of those involved. --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 11:05, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why do we require that people be mentioned in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>? So we have sufficient verifiable material for an article. Despite numerous trivial mentions as human interest in stories about Wikipedia, there clearly isn't enough material for an article here.</p>
<p>If you reduce the article to what's backed by the sources, it boils down to "Simon Pulsifer is an 24-year-old from Ottawa who is a prolific Wikipedia editor." All of these articles are not about him, but merely mention his background in a sketchy way as human interest for articles about Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The AFDs forgot that "non-trivial" bit in "non-trivial coverage in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>", and no amount of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Voting_is_evil" class="extiw" title="meta:Voting_is_evil">voting</a> is going to make verifiable content suddenly appear.

<p>For the love of god, A7 should have been used <i>in the first place.</i> So this guy has been "featured" in some news articles about his "editing of Wikipedia." (at least that seems to be the moral to the stroy here) So what? There are plenty of other editors featured in a similar fashion, and do you see articles about them on here? Lastly, people come to Wikipedia to read up on things like science or history, <b>not</b> about some non-notable editor of a website. If he has an article we all might as well have one.

<dd>So, we have a minor celebrity (subject of a number of newspaper articles including 2M-circulating Mail and Globe). The article on him does not violate the not-negotaible principles of Wikipedia (WP:V, WP:NOR, WP:NPOV, copyright law, etc.) Some people consider him to be notable enough to be included, some think it is not the case. It is an extremely common situation and that is why we have the AfDs. There was no consensus to delete (if anything there was a consensus to Keep). Thus, the article should be kept. Do not see anything unusual here warranting WP:IAR and other heavy artillery. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 02:51, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even if Mailer Diablo's close had merely been challenged at DRV it would have been good manners to discuss it with him first. Failing to discuss a proposed speedy delete action like this with him was very bad manners - such a discussion might have led to MD voluntarily reconsidering his closure, or it might have led to agreement to test his "keep" closure at DRV. I'm not suggesting that what happened was anything worse than discourtesy (such as bad faith, wheel warring, blah, blah), but it certainly was discourteous. This discussion should be a reminder that good manners in interaction with colleagues can go a long way. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 01:52, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just a heads-up: there has been a spate of anonymous Hispanicization of Catalan names. As far as I can tell, it's all anonymous, and while I hesitate to impute motive, given the nature of some of the edits it is clearly not being done in good faith: see for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=77777655" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=77777655" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, which changed "<b>Antoni Gaudí i Cornet</b>, in Spanish also known as <b>Antonio Gaudí</b>" to "<b>Antonio Gaudí i Cornet</b>, in Spanish also known as <b>Antonio Gaudí</b>". That is, the Catalan name was removed and the Spanish given twice, despite the article being named Antoni Gaudí.</p>
<p>I realize that only a relatively small proportion of English-language editors are familiar with the Catalan language, but when you see the letter "o" (or sometimes "io", "a", etc.) being added to the end of names of people from Valencia, Catalonia, or the Balearics, then this is probably what is going on; similarly, when names ending in "eu" are changed to "es", etc.</p>
<p>This may not have been the best place to post this, and if someone has a better idea, feel free to copy or to move (but if you move, please do leave the section header and a link).

<p>There seems to be another erpution from a user tagging everything in sight with {{unref}} tags. This behavior seems very similar to the behavior reported a few days ago from user ClairSamoht, so this could be an alternate login for the same physical person. This user goes as far as tagging entire sections of Featured articles as unref (see <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>). Rather than a list of taggings, here is the Contribs sheet of this user. I believe it is rather self-explanatory<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Anonymous+57" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Anonymous+57" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>.

<dd>Yes, his behaviour is highly disruptive. The Canada article is very well referenced; in addition to the ref tags for the controversial statements and specific numbers, each section has it's own list of references in the References section. From <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>:

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So the references at the bottom of the page are sufficient and extra ref tags are not necessary, and thus his behaviour is uncalled for. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 21:18, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anonymous 57 may have some valid points (I just finished adding some references to sections he marked), but the way he is going about this is only serving to inflame other editors.

He started editing again at 21:34 on the very article that got him blocked. If he would rely more on talk page discussion I think this wouldn't be such a problem. I suggest a voluntary cooling-off period for Anonymous 57, if he is open to the idea. <b><a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagrashtak_1a5a.html" title="User:Pagrashtak"><font color="#8855DD">Pagra</font></a><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPagrashtak_d273.html" title="User talk:Pagrashtak"><font color="#6666AA">shtak</font></a></b> 03:01, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

After discussion with one, I editted the template so that images were transcluded, but then I was told by A Man In Black that they would never be able to pass <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">fair use criteria number 3</a>, which states that the number of fair use images on a page should be limitted, and the pages would have had upwards of 100 fair use images on them. After all of that, the anons decided to change the Pokepisode template so that it was a duplicate of the Digimon episode template which was reverted as vandalism (along with the extremely incivil edit summaries). It was all good for the night, until Yugigx60 changed the template back to a duplicate of the Digimon one, and then asked <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> to protect it because of an edit war.

<ul>
<li>Personally, I think images are good for the articles, and as long as images are conveying and adapting on central themes of the plot, they pass fair use. <b>Screenshots</b> help identify episodes visually and identify key moments. Identifiying episodes and distingushing between them are key reasons for having List of episodes type articles.

<ul>
<li>Don't copy over someone else's text. This is so that other users and administrators can see the whole situation. Right now, it is an edit war that you yourself are involved in and changed the template that was made specifically for the pages to be a copy of another template. I am here to get an outside view on the whole situation, since administrators and regular users are now involved in this conflict. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 21:28, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The images would be on the episode lists; it's just that it was created to omit all of the images, which at one point were said were going to be used to make it pretty, which is also an FUC criteria failure.

<p>I think <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">FUC #8</a> is more appropriate here. When a TV episode article has a fair use image one can make a reasonable claim that it is necessary to illustrate and discuss events of the episode. Images on lists are largely decoration, and decoration does not meet fair use criteria. (Note that this is just another version of the debate over whether NCAA team logos could be included only on the articles about the teams themselves, or also on game schedules, where they are largely decorative.) Not to mention the fact that a list such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Charmed_episodes_943e.html" title="List of Charmed episodes">List of Charmed episodes</a> take forever to load on dialup because of all the transcluded images. I believe MiB and Ryulong are correct here. If other TV shows do this (such as <i>Charmed</i>) they should be nuked as well. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:32, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

There is ongoing debate about this subject at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_Fair_use_images_in_lists_8888.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use/Fair use images in lists">Wikipedia:Fair use/Fair use images in lists</a>. In my view, most of these lists have large swathes of images accompanied by very little text, which is usually not relevant to the image in use, and as such the use of images in those lists cannot legally be claimed as fair use. However others (mostly the authors of these pages) disagree. As I see it the discussion is gradually proceeding toward a consensus that as long as images are accompanied by sufficient text to offer some kind of critical commentary on the list item, and as long as the image actually contributed to that purpose, then the inclusion of images would be ok. New voices at the discussion would of course be appreciated. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 15:35, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

This debate is nothing new, especially to anyone who's familiar with the still unresolved <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Lost_episodes_f69f.html" title="List of Lost episodes">List of Lost episodes</a> dispute.

To prevent discussion forking I suggest you guys continue this discussion on one of those pages or at least leave notice on those pages about the new discussion. Also, it would be good to over-view many of the points made by both sides in those discussions. As it is now there is no conclusive proof that images in a list of episodes, when properly chosen, violate <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 21:28, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After reading the (removed) recent stuff about an admin account allegedly being sold on Ebay, I did a search on the search term "wikipedia" on that site. I didn't find any accounts for sale, but there were a few weird entries, like <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Practical-hand-forged-Wikipedia-Katana-for-IAIDO-AIKIDO_W0QQitemZ110034651201QQihZ001QQcategoryZ43338QQssPageNameZWD1VQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem" class="external text" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/Practical-hand-forged-Wikipedia-Katana-for-IAIDO-AIKIDO_W0QQitemZ110034651201QQihZ001QQcategoryZ43338QQssPageNameZWD1VQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem" rel="nofollow">this one</a> with titles like "Practical hand forged Wikipedia Katana for IAIDO,AIKIDO". What the heck is a "Wikipedia Katana"? The description of the item doesn't give any indication of what connection it has with Wikipedia. The same is true of several other entries that, for no obvious reason, include the name of Wikipedia in their descriptions. They seem to be mostly from sellers in China.

<li>If it seemed to be true, you'd have to ask the "buyer", and you'd have to believe what the "buyer" said. If the "buyer" actually paid money for the name and password of a retired admin and didn't get it, he -- somehow I imagine such twits as male -- would perhaps be too embarrassed to admit "I was a sucker; I got fleeced." And if it were true and the buyer claimed as much, he wouldn't give convincing evidence as this would identify the account and cause it to be blocked, and what a waste of his dough that would be. Investigating such an allegation would probably be a wild goose chase. Better just to keep an eye on what's done with admin powers. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:55, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have a suggestion for people; if multiple people use your PC, and want to edit Wikipedia, block it (so you don't get autoblocked because others are using the same IP address as you!)</p>
<p>Go to C:\Winnt\system32\drivers\etc\hosts or C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts, and add the following lines: 127.0.0.1 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/</a> or (Wikipedia's IP address) - then redirect it to a Wikipedia mirror etc.</p>
<p>Then, when you wish to use Wikipedia, just comment out the block in the hosts file like this: */127.0.0.1 http://en.wikipedia.org/* and you can edit again!</p>
<p>Hope this helps; if I'm helping to prevent vandalism, then let me know! --<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.42.237.173.html" title="User:82.42.237.173">82.42.237.173</a> 08:13, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Give me a break Gryffindor. Rarelibra is trying to correct the extreme German POV you have spent almost a year trying to embed into WP. The archives are clear, from the beginning when you moved Trentino-Alto Adige to Trentino-South Tyrol. It is unethical for you to try to abuse the system like this to get your way, and waste other's time. Taalo 21:09, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Copy+Paste page moves are not an acceptable way of dealing with content disputes. Try mediation, an RFC or arbcom instead (in that order). <a href="../../../d/j/b/User%7EDjbrianuk_0376.html" title="User:Djbrianuk">exolon</a> 22:07, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This was answered in more detail at ANI, and I'm not sure why Gryffindor felt it necessary to post it twice. No damage was done since the source articles remain intact and the destinations were redirects, and are redirects once more. <i>If</i> there is a future consensus to change the article names, an admin will have to do it. However this is a content dispute at its heart and administrators are not referees (when we can help it). Try a request for comment, third opinion, or mediation. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:03, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

Previous blocks have also involved numerous other accounts springing up trying to get the underlying IP unblocked and previous experience has then shown (again via checkuser) the same situation recuring. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 20:32, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

See also his contribution history from the beginning, which shows that Lochdale is constantly attacking me, claiming false things and removing passages I have written simply because the content of these paragraphs is not in line with his personal view of Elvis. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 01:45, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We have gone through this issue again and again. Your assertations are not "well sourced". Instead, you make an effort to take reputable sources to buttress questionable (at best) claims. You've made a considerable effort to have me banned not only from the article but from Wikipedia entirely. I have tried to engage you in the Talk page but you have a clear and direct agenda that has nothing to do with Wikipedia or the truth. This matter should be arbitrated. It seems, however, you want to create a red-herring by attacking me and focusing on me personally rather than your actions. <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochdale_5ee1.html" title="User:Lochdale">Lochdale</a> 03:51, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, the last of those edits whose diffs 141 so handily provides is indeed a bit odd. In it, Lochdale adds a spurious backslash. I presume that this was an accident, triggered by understandable irritation over yet again having to delete a wodge of innuendo-filled blather about Presley's "male friendships". Anyway I forgive Lochdale for his (her) backslash. The other edits are exemplary. Well, we're now past <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Onefortyone_2ebd.html#Log_of_blocks_and_bans" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Onefortyone">the 27 Sep '06 end of 141's ban</a>, so we can expect unrestrained additions of material that will imply that Presley was notable primarily for porking lots of girls in his youth, for porking his mother (?!), for being a playmate (?!) of someone called Nick Adams, for not being able to pork lots of girls in his middle age, etc etc ad nauseam and beyond. And any objection to this is likely to be held to show that the person objecting is a "fan" of Presley and thus blind to his failings (never mind that my own total collection of Presley discs and MP3s numbers zero, and perhaps is not so unusual). So, the participants of WP can decide: Is WP seriously trying to be an encyclopedia, or is it merely an indiscriminate collection of salacious factoids? My own suspicion is that a great number of people hereabouts are more interested in the tabloidy factoids than in substantive content about significant achievements by people who are (deservedly or otherwise) famous, and that's one reason why I "unwatched" the Presley article some time ago. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:34, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just a question, Hoary. Where is my contribution adding "material that will imply that Presley was notable primarily ... for porking his mother (?!), for being a playmate (?!) of someone called Nick Adams"? Such topics were not part of my last contributions. On the other hand, in my opinion, it is of some importance that Elvis (frequently referred to as a "sex symbol"), was not overtly sexual towards women, as several sources prove. But the real problem is that Lochdale simply claims that my edits are questionable, but this is not true. He also claims that most books do not support my contributions, but he is wrong, as facts show. You should have noticed that, as a kind of compromise, I didn't mention sources such as the controversial manuscript book by Elvis's stepmother Dee Presley in my last contributions, primarily centering on what is written in reputable Elvis biographies. But this material has also been deleted. It seems as if Lochdale did not read any of the major Elvis biographies. I have not yet seen that this user has given direct quotes from one of the sources he claims to have read. He frequently misquoted Guralnick's name as "Guralnik" in the past (see, for instance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Elvis_Presley#Male_Friendships" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Elvis_Presley#Male_Friendships" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a>), and he didn't even know the exact title of Guralnick's book <i>Careless Love: The Unmaking Of Elvis Presley</i>, as he cited it as "Careless Whisper". See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=71108902&amp;oldid=70852851" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=71108902&amp;oldid=70852851" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>. He also disparages university studies I have used for my edits. He says, "I would disagree with that the information presented is really worth mentioning as a lot of it seems to be from college disertations etc...." See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=79131677&amp;oldid=79128130" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=79131677&amp;oldid=79128130" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>. This statement speaks volumes. Lochdale's only aim seems to be to delete my contributions. Just one question. Is there a reasonable argument for excluding the whole paragraph on Elvis's male friendships from the article? See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=79180736" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=79180736" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>. These friendships with members and employees from the <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis_Mafia_68b3.html" title="Memphis Mafia">Memphis Mafia</a> are well documented and part of every Elvis biography and they are certainly accepted by the mainstream, as all these people played a significant part in the singer's life. Why should this paragraph be totally removed from the article? On the other hand, look at the unsourced "Trivia" sections of the article, for instance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#Likes_and_dislikes" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#Likes_and_dislikes" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>, and sections such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#Presley_in_the_21st_century" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#Presley_in_the_21st_century" rel="nofollow">Elvis Presley in the 21st century</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#Elvis_lives.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#Elvis_lives.3F" rel="nofollow">Elvis Lives?</a>. These sections are fan stuff in no small degree, as they are always singing the praise of the megastar. Is all this material encyclopaedic? I don't think so, but some users, among them Lochdale, do frequently support these sections by their contributions (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70875388" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70875388" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Elvis_Presley#Presley_in_the_21st_century" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Elvis_Presley#Presley_in_the_21st_century" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>). Though I am not of the opinion that all this material should be included in the article, I never removed these paragraphs, as Lochdale frequently does with my contributions. In my opinion, Lochdale is part of an Elvis fan group which endeavors to suppress specific details about the singer's life from the article, if he is not somehow related to multiple hardbanned <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETed_Wilkes_458b.html" title="User:Ted Wilkes">User:Ted Wilkes</a> (we have already discussed my suspicion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jtdirl#Evidence_that_IPs_66.61.69.65_and_24.165.212.202_and_NightCrawler_alias_DW_alias_Ted_Wilkes_alias_Duisburg_Dude_are_identical_with_user_Lochdale" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jtdirl#Evidence_that_IPs_66.61.69.65_and_24.165.212.202_and_NightCrawler_alias_DW_alias_Ted_Wilkes_alias_Duisburg_Dude_are_identical_with_user_Lochdale" rel="nofollow">here</a> and elsewhere). And what about the well documented FBI files I have cited and the false claims by Lochdale concerning these files?

It seems as if I am the only user who frequently, and accurately, cites his sources, and Lochdale is frequently deleting the passages I have written. These are the facts, and Lochdale's deleting tactics are not acceptable. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 13:52, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Where is my contribution adding "material that will imply that Presley was notable primarily ... for porking his mother (?!), for being a playmate (?!) of someone called Nick Adams"?</i> In the past, plentiful. But the history of this ghastly article is impossibly long and I am not now going to look within it for this. I'm happy to hear that you haven't readded/augmented it recently. I hope that you don't readd/augment it in the future. ¶ <i>[I]n my opinion, it is of some importance that Elvis (frequently referred to as a "sex symbol"), was not overtly sexual towards women, as several sources prove.</i> Then we differ, because in mine this is of no importance whatever. ¶ <i>It seems as if Lochdale did not read any of the major Elvis biographies. I have not yet seen that this user has given direct quotes from one of the sources he claims to have read.</i> Not being Lochdale, I don't know. The article has hugely too many direct quotes, sometimes taken out of context. ¶ <i>He also disparages university studies I have used for my edits.</i> The last time I looked, one of these studies was about Presley and seemed substantive; some of the others seemed to emanate from the polemical quasi-academia of "queer studies" and the like. ¶ <i>Is there a reasonable argument for excluding the whole paragraph on Elvis's male friendships from the article?</i> Yes, because Presley's male friendships seem entirely unremarkable, aside from those with the so-called Memphis Mafia and the twisting of the friendships (and everything else) that came with his descent into multiple drug addiction. They don't seem to have influenced his (sometimes good) music or his (almost universally horrible) movies, or indeed even his "iconicity" (!). ¶ <i>[L]ook at the unsourced "Trivia" sections of the article, for instance [64], and sections such as Elvis Presley in the 21st century or Elvis Lives?. These sections are fan stuff in no small degree, as they are always singing the praise of the megastar. Is all this material encyclopaedic? I don't think so</i> -- and while I disagree that they're all hagiographic, I agree that much of them is junk. Indeed, I was hacking away at "Trivia" (adding "{{fact}}" to it, deleting it, etc.) when Nicholas Turnbull invited you, me and one or two others to take a break from the Presley article.

<dd>Regardless of the situation calling someone the "second worst editor on Wikipedia" and talking about their "arrogance" and telling them to leave is a personal attack.

<p><b>At my wit's end</b> I'm not sure where to post this or what to do here, but there has been an on-going, Byzantine, and nasty revert war/string of personal attacks/vandalism/etc. involving myself, BGC, and Dudesleeper.

<p>At this point, the fighting on this page has ended due to a compromise on the content of the article. Meanwhile, at <a href="../../../r/2E/e/Template%7ER.E.M._45a5.html" title="Template:R.E.M.">Template:R.E.M.</a>, a proxy fight emerges, again with BGC and Dudesleeper on the one hand, myself on the other. Instead of being a quarrel about factual content, this is regarding formatting. My argument is that introducing arbitrary HTML makes the page less <a href="../../../u/s/a/Usability.html" title="Usability">usable</a>, whereas BGC and Dudesleeper are arguing in favor of a certain formatting based on purely capricious aesthetics. The entire history is too long and convoluted to present here, but it mostly revolves around arbitrary formatting issues.</p>

I have no idea what should be done here, but I've made sincere good-faith attempts to resolve this dispute (including e-mailing two admins for assistance, getting none), and I'm at my wit's end. Meanwhile, these two resort to cheap sniping like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dudesleeper&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78764024" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dudesleeper&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78764024" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dudesleeper&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78997493" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dudesleeper&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78997493" rel="nofollow">this</a> and refuse to discuss the substantive issues I bring up on talk.

<dd>Looking through the history of the template in question, I do see Koavf having violated 3RR on 9/27 - 9/28. However, he already served a 48 hour block for that violation. I see no 3RR violations since then. From either side. That said, the revert war between these two was still continuing unabated, just a little more slowly. So I'm not really disputing the blocks themselves, more just the reasons for them. IMHO <b>something</b> needed to be done to tell these two that what is going on needs to stop. Blocks for Edit Warring can and do get issued, and that would be what I would have recommended, rather than 3RR blocks.</dd>
<dd>I'm also inclined to protect the template itself until these two can work something out. At this point it appears that 48 hour blocks are unlikely to solve anything. With the page protected, I'm not certain if anything would be more likely to get worked out, but at least the revert war would be stalled. Probibly time for them to take it to dispute resolution of some kind. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 15:24, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yeesh. See, I don't like <i>either</i> position. If you say "is not a vote" or if you say "is a vote," you're licensing further action that can be pretty bad, in my opinion. In fact, AfD does have tallies, and it is an iffy admin who goes against majority (or it's a very, very iffy AfD that generates a majority against policy), but, at the same time, it is not a "first past the post" sort of thing, either. If we go around trumpeting, "AfD is not a vote," we imply, both for ourselves and to the non-administrators, that we do whatever the heck we want. (If it truly were "not a vote," we wouldn't even have the thing -- we'd just have a huge CSD pile.) I guess it's the sloganeering that bugs me. (Yeah, I'll go say all this, but I wanted to say it here, too, in case my fellow adminfolken wanted to tell me how I'm wrong.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:41, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Truthfully, it doesn't matter what you call it because <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> trumps the lot&#160;:p. seriously though - it's not a vote per se, but that doesn't mean admins can do what they like. Invocations of WP:IAR in admin actions can only occur where there is a firm justification for it that can be explained in terms of the goals of Wikipedia, it's processes, it's environment, or it's functions. Outside of this uncommon area, Amins merely follow established concensus and sweep the road in between their work as wikipedians like everybody else. As an example, if you had a vote of 70 delete and 30 keep, but 45 of the deletes were just that with no good reasoning or using defeated arguments insistantly, while all the keeps had good reason given, then there would be a reasonable argument for the keeps to have it. It's an extremem example, but it demonstrates the point.--<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 15:57, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>XfD not a vote. Admins try to determine a consensus based not only on the number of comments in each caategory, but also the validity or the arguments put forward; they can totally disregard some comments, if they are clearly based on limited information or on grounds that are outside policy. For a reminder of how messy deletion can become, and how the discussion can turn 180 degrees in a very short time, see <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Pedophilia_efdf.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:WikiProject Pedophilia">Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:WikiProject Pedophilia</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 16:19, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>AfD is not a vote. It's a call for discussion leading to consensus. The closing admin looks at the inputs and their convincingness, and makes the call, is consensus there? Then the admin acts. If there is sufficient doubt that the action wasn't quite right, it goes to DRV. So far, so good. No voting, all within the wiki way, good stuff, most outcomes stand... The problem really is not AfD, but rather DRV, in my view, which seems to be organised along strict voting lines. That just seems wrong. The effort to delete DRV outright, while amusing, also showed that there is significant opposition to how DRV runs now. That's my view. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:18, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>(after about 10 million edit conflicts) It's usually not a vote. But in the AfDs with 50+ non-sockpuppet votes (which are rare), who are we kidding, closing with anything but the raw numbers is just closing based on our own opinion. And maybe that's okay, but I don't like couching it in this "Well the delete side just made stronger arguments so that's what consensus was... <b>coincidently</b> I personally wanted to delete the article anyway" nonsense. In AfDs with smaller sample size, often people get it wrong, make unconvincing arguments, and so on, and there aren't enough people involved to counter it, so sometimes you'll end up with a 50% "vote" to keep original research and other Bad Things, and the closer needs to deal with that. In conclusion, I think this whole vote/not a vote stuff is... not good, somehow or other. I know people mean well with it, but it is just devisive somehow. Let people call stuff what they want, and make the decisions that they think are best for the project... it worked for a long time, why obsess over semantics now? --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 16:19, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Back when <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD100_b539.html" title="WP:AFD100">I looked at this</a> over a year ago, one could predict ~93% of AFD outcomes by saying that greater than 2/3 delete votes would lead to deletion and less than that led to the article being kept. I think it is clear that AFD does have qualities of being a vote (as well as qualities of being a discussion). However, I will leave it to others to make up language on what to call these processes where we both discuss and vote. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 16:33, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<big><b>Important clarification:</b></big><br />
Radiant neglected to mention the fact that the debate in question pertains <i><b>not</b></i> to the nature of AfD, but to the definition of the word "vote." We're in complete agreement that a closing admin should not simply count the votes and declare a numerical outcome, but the word "vote" implies no such thing. In this context, it refers to "the formal expression of a proposed resolution of an issue." Most of you are using a colloquial connotation that isn't strictly correct, which is why I don't advocate advertising Wikipedia processes as "votes." I do, however, object to the incorrect statement that they <i>aren't</i> votes. You really mean to say that they aren't majority/plurality votes. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 16:52, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True. The only thing that got me was the way it was phrased in saying that "bands are always punative" bit. To be honest though, it probably struck me only in combination with something written about the victims being the ones getting punished - I think he might have been talking about himself. I saw the RFC, but I also read a comment on his talk somewhere regarding one of the people who "tried to resolve" and retracting the support of it - seems to be the same people as were involved in an incident at WP:PAIN centered around him.</dd>

To tell the truth, my heads about to explode trying to understand what's going on. There's plenty of disruption present, but whether there's any blame or single cause of it is something I can't answer - I guess that comes from having been too involved in mediation a while back. lol</dd>

<dd>I think we need to make it official policy somewhere that when stylistic disputes about 'mass edits' like this (whether from bots, AWB, scripts, or even manual editing) come up <i>everyone</i> needs to stop, whether editing or reverting, go to an appropriate talk page, and sort out the consensus view on the issue before continuing. We have run into this over and over again with 'BC' vs 'BCE', road name standards, date linking, spaces vs nbsp, et cetera. Any sort of change to numerous pages is going to serve as a 'multiplier' on disagreements and waste an inordinate amount of time on all sides... the difference between edit warring on one page and doing so on a hundred. When a bot is making mass disputed edits we block it on sight... the same ought to apply to humans doing so - which would include <i>reversions</i> of the edits where that too is disputed. A fifteen minute block with an edit summary indicating that it is just to stop the ongoing changes to allow discussion shouldn't carry any 'stigma' and would allow these to be sorted out before people start going into meltdown (as above). In this specific case, the date linking issue seems to have been discussed several times before... so this seems like either mass edits <i>against</i> consensus or mass edits with a known absence of consensus... either of which strikes me as extremely disruptive and worthy of a block if they don't stop. Again, I think past experience / common sense show that mass changes should <b>only</b> be made when they are widely agreed to. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:03, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In all the discussions on <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSNUM_3545.html" title="WP:MOSNUM">WP:MOSNUM</a> there has been general consensus that individual years standing alone (which have no bearing on date preferences, unlike the ones associated with a day-month) are overlinked, and no agreement on how much they are overlinked. Unlinking them all when all were linked seems marginally acceptable, though probably not the best way to deal with it. Then the appropriate action to be taken should be adding back those few which are really relevant, not reverting en masse. But it would be better for Bobblewik and those like him to leave the most clearly appropriate ones, and make clear in their edit summaries that they are only removing excess ones. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 16:42, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bobblewik complains here, but his long insistence on acting just like a bot even when it would be obviously stupid to an editor with any writing sense is pretty much custom-designed to wear away the patience of any sane editor trying to clean up his Sorcerer's Apprentice brooms' work, and "Fucking quit it" is entirely justifiable IMO. As is the response of summary rollback. If the manual of style says <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Digital_Radio_Mondiale&amp;diff=78673501&amp;oldid=78660090" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Digital_Radio_Mondiale&amp;diff=78673501&amp;oldid=78660090" rel="nofollow">this</a>, for example, is in any way a sensible or useful edit, then it's just wrong.

<p>I notice that people no longer bother to warn people before giving them usernameblocks, this means that someone creates JoeSmith382752836, and 20 seconds later they're looking an autoblock square in the face that says something like "<i>Usernameblock, less numbers plz</i>" and they're left blocked from actually creating a new username for at least 24 hours. If they're genuine new users they <b>don't even know what an autoblock is</b>, and don't know to wait around for it to expire. For harmless usernameblocks like the hypothetical one above, shouldn't people be given a warning before being blocked? Come to think of it, why block at all? If someone creates bobsmith358239552325 why not just ask them to pick a new username, and wait for them to reply? The current policy just scares away new users at random. Heck, even the email thing, the reason for not using your email as your username is to <b>protect the user from spammers</b>, yet people are giving <b>punitive</b> usernameblocks to people who list their emails--<a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.65.html" title="User:152.163.100.65">152.163.100.65</a> 21:12, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True enough, but it seems to me that there's a big difference between how an admin should issue a username block to a blatantly offensive or vandalistic (e.g., offensive, racist, "Wheels" etc.) username, and a good-faith username that happens to contravene a rule created for admin convenience (e.g., "not too many numbers" or "no special characters". In the case of the latter greeting a newbie with an indef username block is almost guaranteed to create a <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> issue if care isn't taken. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 00:00, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If every account was used, that would make sense. However, blocking, and leaving a {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameblocked_c05c.html" title="Template:Usernameblocked">usernameblocked</a>}} message expalaining how to change the username is perfectly acceptable since most accounts with no edits rarely get used. It has never been the practice to warn first as doing that to 500,000 unused accounts is a waste of time. Additionally, the username block summary contains a link to that template which explains everything. Its not a bite issue at all. Btw, the username rules were not created for "admin convenience" and stating so shows a bit of paranoia. Username rules were created to help the community function easily. That includes all editors. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 00:05, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Strike "admin convenience" from my comment and substitute "other editors' convenience." I meant convenience for the administration of the site collectively, not any individual administrator.

<dd>Thank you for clarifying that. The abbreviation admin is ambiguous though, and since you used it to mean "wikipedia administrator" in the first instance, there is nothing for me to do but assume you meant it like that again given that I can't read your mind. I'm sorry but the way you worded it, the meaning would be a manifestation of the general paranoia going around that admins are out to rule wikipedia by abuse or whatever.

<dd>Further, if we're going to insist that a user changes his username, it seems that the kindest time to do it is immediately on creation of the account, before they have edited.

<p><a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">User:UninvitedCompany</a> deleted the article <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavor_Flav_694d.html" title="Flavor Flav">Flavor Flav</a> (the rapper from <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Enemy_74a7.html" title="Public Enemy">Public Enemy</a> and star of <i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavor_of_Love_4286.html" title="Flavor of Love">Flavor of Love</a></i>), saying that it "had no sources." Last I checked, that wasn't a reason to unilaterally delete an article, especially on a subject who is clearly notable. I restored the article, and figured you all needed to know. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H.</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Halterman_f64b.html" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">I did "That's hot" first!</a> 02:25, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>he's also deleted a few other articles under similar circumstances, apparently: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=UninvitedCompany&amp;page=" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=UninvitedCompany&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">[80]</a>, someone will need to look into those too. Speedy deleting articles for lack of sources is clearly not supported by policy, or common sense. At most articles should be deleted through PROD/AfD if someone suspects they're hoaxes. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:04, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Both of these had received <a href="../../../o/t/r/WP%7EOTRS_ffb6.html" title="WP:OTRS">WP:OTRS</a> complaints. <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> encourages all editors to remove unsourced material from articles and to delete articles where there are no sources in the article history and the article would be substantially empty after the unsourced material is removed. We are presently trying to clear a large backlog of OTRS complaints which exists in part due to Kelly Martin's departure from the project and also due to several other OTRS regulars scaling back their participation due to school. So I try to work quickly. I have no problem with someone recreating these articles as stubs or for that matter making expanded articles, if proper attention can be paid to sourcing. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 03:22, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Articles can always be restored. It's better to have no article on notable persons than articles filled with libel, puff or gross inaccuracies. I can also verify that the OTRS queue is incredibly large...Kelly Martin was a very hearty correspondent, and her absense is being felt in the amount of work necessary. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique"><b>B</b>astiq<span class="Unicode" style="color:#FF72E3;">▼</span>e</a> <b><sup><a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBastique_d47c.html" title="User talk:Bastique">demandez</a></sup></b> 03:28, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Is there a place for OTRS folks to request other editors to give some attention to certain articles? I bet people would be willing to do some of the editing required in clearing the backlog. I understand that confidentiality is a concern, but surely some of the legwork could be done by people who aren't reading the actual email communications. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 03:31, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was going to say something like that. People are always saying OTRS is backed up, but then only people who are friends with whoever runs OTRS can actually help out.

<p>In short: 1) I asked Linnwood if he were a child and if that was what interested him in the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_punch.html" title="Donkey punch">donkey punch</a> 2) He came back with a trolling accusation when I was asking a very serious question. Conversing about sex with minors via the internet is not a good idea, to say the least, and I want nothing to do with it. 3) I concluded there's a good chance he's under 18 because anyone would have confirmed adulthood, especially young adults, who usually don't want to be mistaken for kids. 4) I put a warning on <a href="../../../d/o/n/Talk%7EDonkey_punch_2422.html" title="Talk:Donkey punch">Talk:Donkey punch</a> to warn others he may be a minor and to be careful until proof of age is established. 5) Linnwood removed it, calling it trolling.

<li>I don't really see a problem with the AFD except that the layout is messy (feel free to fix if it bothers you) and it has two or three socks. As to your other question, we used to have an encyclopedia with strict standards so that only experts could edit it; it was called <a href="../../../n/u/p/Nupedia.html" title="Nupedia">Nupedia</a> and didn't really work out. Since basically any minimum level for editing is going to be arbitrary, that means we don't set a minimum level and also allow e.g. foreigners with poor English skills, or children with lack of grammar, to participate.

<p>There are three abuse issues I want to present:</p>
<p>One, Averette and FairHair are behaving like a sockpuppet pair, and have 4 or 5RR'ed he article a couple of times <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conch_Republic&amp;curid=266652&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conch_Republic&amp;curid=266652&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[82]</a>. I'd like uninvolved admins to take a look and see if a CU is called for.</p>
<p>Two, Averette is now persistently using <a href="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-fl-cr.html" class="external free" title="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-fl-cr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-fl-cr.html</a> as a source for his claim that the Conch Republic is a former rather than current entity <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conch_Republic&amp;diff=78682705&amp;oldid=78670430" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conch_Republic&amp;diff=78682705&amp;oldid=78670430" rel="nofollow">[83]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conch_Republic&amp;diff=78733454&amp;oldid=78729912" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conch_Republic&amp;diff=78733454&amp;oldid=78729912" rel="nofollow">[84]</a>. This is the website for a company which produces specialty flags. That website includes an out of context past-tense citation from the main Conch Republic primary source <a href="http://www.conchrepublic.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.conchrepublic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.conchrepublic.com/</a>, most specifically <a href="http://www.conchrepublic.com/republic_position.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.conchrepublic.com/republic_position.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.conchrepublic.com/republic_position.htm</a>. The Conch Republic website uses past tense for its secession and present tense for its existence. This appears to constitute persistent nonsense edits, as the source's validity has been disproven and pointed out to him.</p>
<p>Three, Averette just made the nonsense claim that a road (Card Sound Road) which is more than 120 miles away from <a href="../../../k/e/y/Key_West%2C_Florida_4530.html" title="Key West, Florida">Key West, Florida</a> constitutes a valid second route out of the city, beyond <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Route_1_81e1.html" title="U.S. Route 1">U.S. Route 1</a>.</p>
<p>In fair disclosure, I have 4RRed the article in the past 24 hrs, with my last edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conch_Republic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78734146" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conch_Republic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78734146" rel="nofollow">[85]</a> being to revert Averette's reposting the misused source info after I warned him it was nonsense to add bad material and misuse sources. I believe this was a vandalism revert, however, at this point I am going to stay hands-off on the article until others can review the situation. I have not reverted the third, road-related nonsense vandalism.</p>
<p>I am generally loath to bring a content dispute to AN/I, however I believe that Averette is now violating WP policy in multiple manners. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">User:Lar</a> had been looking at the situation (including warnings to Gene Poole, who has been rude at times in the dispute) but is too busy at the moment and recommended ANI. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 20:27, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I warned them again, maybe it will do some good. I'm not unwilling to block teh lot of them for a bit to get it to stop, or protect the article, as they really do seem to be going at it quite vigorously. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:56, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, there is no consensus either way, but why should people be able to move an article from its original spelling to one of diacritics but when i try to move it back to its original spelling, i get called a vandal? When there is no consensus or a dispute, leave as is. I am not a vandal and the vast majority of my page moves are to their original spelling, not to my pov. Now Ryulong has enforced his pov and undid my attempts and restoring to the original spelling. If i try to fix it, i will get called a vandal. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 06:28, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I say leave articles at the oringal spelling until a consensus is reached. If the original article spelling used diacritics, then leave it that way. if the original spelling didn't, then don't. Diacritic spelling is not <i>wrong</i> and neither is non-diacrtic spelling. I am just a firm believer in "most common spelling in English for wikipedia articles". <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 06:35, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I remember that argument from the RM. There is no "most common spelling in English" for these hockey players' names. Just because diacritics are omitted in, say, the newspaper doesn't mean they should be omitted on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 06:36, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The commonness of a misspelling doesn't make it permissable. This isn't really a controversial thing in my book, so I don't see what the real problem is, and just because it's the original spelling doesn't make it the "best" one. I assume you wouldn't object to moving a mistyped article name to the correct sentence case, so I don't see how this is that much different. It doesn't appear to hurt anything, and is being done in the interest of correctness. You don't seem to be arguing in favor of correcting a misspelling, though, and I also don't see this as being something <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">we need consensus for</a>. -- <a href="../../../o/m/i/User%7EOmicronpersei8_71da.html" title="User:Omicronpersei8">Omicronpersei8</a> (<a href="../../../o/m/i/User_talk%7EOmicronpersei8_2291.html" title="User talk:Omicronpersei8">talk</a>) 06:40, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Honestly, that is what got me on this in the first place. the <i>English</i> spelling is <b>not</b> a "misspelling". English does not spelling English wrong. In the vast majority of cases (especially with hockey players), diacritics are dropped. and i am not just talking about the internet. i rely on reference books, atlases (for city names), other incyclopeadias, etc for my arguments. If a reputable reference book about hockey ommits diacritics, then are they "misspelling" it? i think not. they are just spelling it English. It is Ryulong's pov that all the articles should include diacritics. it is my pov that all articles should go to their original spellings until a consensus is reached. I request that Ryulong moves back all the articles to their original spelling until a consensus is reached, in good faith. And i repeat, English spelling is not wrong, just different. it is a blind pov statement to call spellings without diacritics wrong. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 06:50, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But they're <i>not</i> the "original" spellings. They're not transliterations, they are, indeed, misspellings in the name of ease. -- <a href="../../../o/m/i/User%7EOmicronpersei8_71da.html" title="User:Omicronpersei8">Omicronpersei8</a> (<a href="../../../o/m/i/User_talk%7EOmicronpersei8_2291.html" title="User talk:Omicronpersei8">talk</a>) 06:51, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, it is your pov that the english spelling is a misspelling. some words, such as Pokémon are most commonly spelt in English <i>with</i> the diacritic and therefore, <i>Pokémon</i>, not <i>Pokemon</i>, is the correct title for that article. My argument is simple, the most common spelling in English is the spelling to be used for article titles. But that is not what i mean by original. When i said original earlier, i was referring to the original author's spelling of the artilce title. if the original author spelt it with diacritics, then until this dispute is finished, it should keep the diacritics. and vice versa, if the original author didn't use diacritics in the article's title, then diacritics should be left off until this dispute is resolved. That is what i was trying to do. Why was i tryiung to do that? because a few users mass moved most of the articles to include diacritics without any form of consensus while discussions were in progress. my "attempts" to set things "straight" have been thwarted by ryulong. There were about 3 users i can think of off hand who went on that moving spree without consensus. in the summer i tried to straighten things out back to the way they were and i got blocked. i am still trying to return things to back before the move dispute. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 07:01, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is what <b>#REDIRECT [[Insert non-formatted text here]]</b> is for. Since there is no answer to the issue, settle on one spelling and redirect the others.

<dd>I have told him of that already, but he believes that the diacritic names should be made as redirects (which is really utterly pointless). And there has been no consensus as to where these articles should be. It was (I believe) decided that <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teemu_Sel%C3%A4nne_49c3.html" title="Teemu Selänne">Teemu Selänne</a> not be moved to its diacritic-less title, and there is no policy, guideline, or consensus to state anything otherwise.

I dont' care about "originally in English". less than half of all english words are actually "from English". languages change over time. currently, most "foreign" words in english drop diacritics, and not just on the 'net either. the most common spelling in english from reliable sources should be used as the article's title. simple as that. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 07:24, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Honestly, i don't see what difference that makes. We on wikipedia are still after the most common name and the name most recognisable by the layman. Basically, we are after the name that is most commonly found in reputable publications from various different sources, not just other encyclopaedias, but reference books, newspapers, magazines, the Internet, biographies, and other such publishers too. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 07:32, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Using the proper spelling would eliminate the need to debate what the most widely accepted spelling is.

<p>After taking the time to create a new article that relates to my several invention and the licensing agreement with national companies that are using the innovations, an administrator (lucky 6.9) called my entry: "Utter Nonsense." Twelve pending US patents, some with licensing agreements, and two granted pantents currently on the market (for the past 15 years!).... is utter nonsense???</p>
<p>When I searched my name, "Jennipher" the results were that of Jennipher Frost, a model search contestant who was upset about cutting her waist length hair.</p>
<p>Pardon me for trying to contribute "Utter Nonsense" to your "encyclopedia".</p>

<p>This tag solution is <i>terrible.</i> I have removed all the OTRS templates from article pages. If OTRS receives email indicating that the subject of an article considers it libelous or defamatory, we need to take much more drastic action than a dispute tag. In other cases, this kind of criticism should go ONLY on the talk page. Dispute tags that allow for arbitrary user comments are, plain and simple, divisive. And it adds a whole new dimension when the source of the criticism is an email Wikipedia gets: the source of the criticism isn't around to make suggestions or clarify the situation -- so, it really carries no weight. Suggestions for improvement of an article belong on the TALK page, not on the article page: dispute tags are an exception: they exist so that edit wars can be averted. By including a note like "the neutrality of this article is disputed" it is made clear that the current version of the article is not completely acceptable to all editors, which means that those who don't find it acceptable can at least feel that they've made some progress towards having their objections understood. Templates like {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV-because_a298.html" title="Template:POV-because">POV-because</a>}} have been deleted for this kind of reason at <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a>, and this case is even worse, because it brings objections onto the article page from people who aren't even Wikipedia editors. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 14:15, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mango, I would like to point out that the OTRS staff screen the complaints. The majority of article complaints sent to OTRS aren't acted upon. The complaints about vandalism and attack pages we generally can resolve very quickly. The problem is that there are a certain number of legitimate complaints regarding articles which are, on the whole, undersourced, inaccurate, and badly written. This is the area where the OTRS staff are particularly much in need of help, because it can take hours to fix one of these unless the fix is to stub or delete the article. I don't want to be hasty, but on the surface of it I see nothing inherently wrong with us maintaining some sort of list or category for articles for which we need help from the community to fix. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 16:01, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm looking through <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_2006_June_30_4850.html#Template:POV-because" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2006 June 30">POV-because's TfD</a>, and many of the deletion comments were because it was used for trolling, or because POV-pushing extended to the tag reason itself, which wouldn't seem to happen here. However, there are legitimate concerns raised; I would imagine that not all OTRS cases would be at all appropriate for a publicly-viewable tag. Still, in the section above there is a list of OTRS cases; do you (Mangojuice) object to the tag but not the list, or would you rather the list was removed from AN/I as well? Would you allow a Wikipedia: subpage for such lists? Just wondering, I don't have any experience with OTRS myself, I just create templates from suggestions on AN/I (among other things), but there seems to be a debate brewing here. (I hope I haven't started an edit war by creating the template!) It may be worth TfDing the template to get wider opinion on its usefulness. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 14:30, 3 October 2006 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</dd>

<dd>IMO, there would be nothing wrong with having a category, or a Wikipedia namespace page, or even a talk page template for documenting these email comments. I vehemently object ONLY to the idea of putting it on the article page. If tags would be used on the article page, they should be the standard dispute or cleanup tags, and explained in detail on the talk page. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 17:02, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So i decided to tidy up and neutralize this article to mirror only fact and relevant information to this individual's biography and nothing more and NOT to cheapen it and desperately attempt to attack or defamate the article's subject, nor imbed POV or pointless speculation.</p>
<p>Here is a snapshot of MY edit..</p>
<p>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Derek_Acorah&amp;oldid=79229110|Derek" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Derek_Acorah&amp;oldid=79229110|Derek" rel="nofollow">Acorah</a>] <i>Revision as of 11:45, 3 October 2006</i></p>
<p>I later notice to see that two "editors" <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevepaget_ce02.html" title="User:Stevepaget">USER:Stevepaget</a> &amp; <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulmoloney_0154.html" title="User:Paulmoloney">USER:Paulmoloney</a> with similar goals to each other (seemingly to disrupt wikipedia and garner attention by polarizing articles to befit their own POV) have persistantly continued to revert my (and others) legitimate edits back to the previous states.</p>
<p>After i served the relevant cautions and FINALLY warnings to these culprits i discover the following bizzare and unfortunate personal attacks posted on <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulmoloney_0154.html" title="User:Paulmoloney">USER:Paulmoloney</a> user page (beneath the warnings)</p>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Topov, I'm rather disappointed you were reduced to adding spurious warning to my talk page because I've been correcting your wholesale deletions of material criticising Derek Acorah.

<p>Indeed as you can see these two editors have a problem, including understanding edit summaries and adhering to the guidelines and policies of wikipedia.</p>
<p>Including Disruption, Vandalism, Excessive reverts, Personal Attacks, and NPOV.</p>
<p>Perhaps a permanent block would suffice.</p>

Subject:         *?* You're such a typical Jew.
</pre>
<pre>
You criticize everything but when fact is thrown in your face you shut up quick. 
I would really like to know just exactly how my comments were, "racist"? Of course, 
I've already emailed you explaining to you that what I had pointed out was fact, 
and facts cannot be racist. It really disappoints me to learn that even on the net 
we don't have freedom of speech anymore. And it's all thanks to shill spewing kikes 
like you.
</pre>
<p>I looked at <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> and it appears to require that several warnings be given before taking action. I would presume that the preceding is egregious enough that warnings should not be necessary, so I've come here in hopes of short-circuiting that process. <b>I can say without qualification that if this had been directed at someone else, I would block either for a year or indefinitely. I would hope someone else will do the same.</b></p>
<p>At first I honestly didn't have any idea what provoked this: I edit about 50-100 articles a day, so it could have been almost anything. But I looked through his (sparse) edits and found it. I had reverted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=White_Terror&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78105191" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=White_Terror&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78105191" rel="nofollow">this</a>. In part it reads "members of the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> who masked their identity and used "terror" to protect themselves from marauding African Americans who, angry and resentful about slavery, wished to exact revenge on their former owners by murdering them and raping their women." It goes on, similarly.</p>
<p>After reverting I wrote on his talk page "Normally, I make a lot of allowances for new users, and I try to welcome them, and so on. I don't usually 'bite the newbies', but your racist remarks added to <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Terror_b044.html" title="White Terror">White Terror</a> as your sole edits to date put you in a category all your own. I imagine you intended this as a throwaway account; so be it. One more edit like that and you won't have a choice in the matter." In the circumstances, I think that was rather restrained. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 19:02, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wow. I posted this hours ago, and no one has responded. Apparently I can't even get this discussed. Either no one (except Nacon, who I believe is not an administrator) is reading this page (unlikely), or no other adminstrator thinks this user's conduct is a serious problem (unlikely, I hope), or everybody is deciding it is someone else's problem. And, as the person attacked, I am the one administrator barred from blocking him.</p>
<p>I'll put this bluntly: I will make a note of this matter on my user page and user talk page so that it is clear to people why I am gone for an indefinite period. If this person's conduct is considered anything like acceptable, then, much to my surprise and regret, I have been mistaken this last few years about my belonging in the Wikipedia community. If someone wants to deal with this, fine, then, I will gladly come back: leave me a note. I'll at least check my user talk page daily for a while, or you can feel free to email me. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:08, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We don't normally block for emails, as off-wiki actions are difficulty to link with certainty to accounts. But based on those edits, I'd have indef blocked the account without batting an eye. Finally, while I do see that this is upsetting, it's best to just hit "delete+block spam". I was gettimg lynching images for a while, and yeah I lost my hat over it. If fact, I'd had a good rant on this very page, almost exactly like your (but with more venom) to the effect of "Thanks for nothing, suckers" that no one was helping me. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 00:25, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I am here in part to report a small incident of vandalism by a permabanned user editing as an anon, but mostly to make a suggestion relevant to the things you guys often have to discuss on this page.</p>
<p>My reading of various policy pages is that</p>
<ol>
<li>permabanned users are not supposed to create socks and continue as before,</li>
<li>they are not supposed to edit anonymously, although this is harder to control (but see the cited page for evidence that this particular permabanned user is easy to spot even as an anon)</li>
<li>to further the mission of the encyclopedia, users in good standing are allowed to keep notes listing relevant links as per <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Iloveminun_bfb0.html#Keeping_notes" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Iloveminun">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Iloveminun#Keeping_notes</a></li>
<li>a permabanned user who is being tracked at such a page is certainly not supposed to vandalize them.</li>
</ol>
<p>KraMuc has repeatedly violated all of the above, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AHillman%2FDig%2FKraMuc&amp;diff=79489115&amp;oldid=78798638" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AHillman%2FDig%2FKraMuc&amp;diff=79489115&amp;oldid=78798638" rel="nofollow">most recently</a> at my page of notes User:Hillman/Dig/KraMuc.</p>
<p>I propose that some place be found in Wikipedia space to keep notes like this under admin lock and key. My idea is that ordinary users can still <i>create</i> such notes as per <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Iloveminun_bfb0.html#Keeping_notes" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Iloveminun">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Iloveminun#Keeping_notes</a>, but if admins agree the subject really is a problem user (probably a no-brainer in the case of permabanned user!), they can be moved (or copied) to the new location, protected, and thereafter maintained by admins. Perhaps a template could even be devised, probably following the model of that page more or less closely, to help standardize the layout.</p>
<p>The point is that this would avoid the kind of vandalism we see in the history of User:Hillman/Dig/KraMuc. This would also shift the "moral responsibility" for a troubling activity (monitoring activities of other users) to the larger community (kind of like: in a civilized community, citizens shouldn't lay hands upon each other, but we make reluctant and carefully regulated exceptions for cops, firemen, and medical personnel).</p>
<p>(An aside about this particular page of notes: even before <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Iloveminun_bfb0.html#Keeping_notes" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Iloveminun">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Iloveminun#Keeping_notes</a> came out, on the basis of common decency and common sense, I consistently made an effort to stick to the facts in these pages. I've actually noted in my partial reversions some of the points he wanted to make, but KraMuc has been ignoring the header of the page in question. However, now he's just repeating himself, and he certainly feels no compunction about violating <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> by ignoring the header.)</p>

<dd>You may feel left alone in the struggle with KraMuc, as he targets a very narrow (and one may say <i>obscure</i>) set of articles. IMHO simple by having editors feeling responsible for those few article, the problem should become under control.

Zer0 had refused to answer and I don't think a simple question, as I put it, is a violation.

<dd>I'm not claiming anything, nor am I convinced of anything. In good faith, I asked NuclearUmpf (an admitted new account of a user on probation) a simple question regarding his identity - which he ignored and deleted from his talk page. If, as I suspect, this user doesn't want to be on the record lying about his sock campaign, he'll ignore the question as Zer0 did. And as Checkuser isn't for fishing, once again it's musical chairs for the ill-intentioned trolls, and back to square one for the users who've already taken Zer0 (and Merecat and Rex before him) to ArbCom. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 01:54, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>NuclearUmpf and his former account Zer0faults were checkusered against Rex071404 three times and they all came up dry. There <i>are</i> certain similarities, but the case seems unlikely to yield technical proof. Ryan formerly posed this question to Zer0faults, and in recent context (see <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">WP:AE</a> and my talk page) posing the question again seems a wee bit like trolling. I have asked all parties to deal with the content of each other's edits, and I think we can safely consider this a closed issue. If NuclearUmpf is unable to edit articles while conforming to usual community standards of behavior, he can be dealt with per his <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Zer0faults_fd1a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Zer0faults">arbitration</a> case. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:36, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I <i>certainly did not troll</i> by asking NuclearUmpf the same question I asked Zer0faults <i>months and months ago</i>. Since the very issue of his sock identity was being discussed, I felt it a valid question. Instead of being answered, the question was wiped from his talk page as trolling. Do you think calling me 'a wee bit like a troll' here is productive?

<dd>I'm finding your accusations to be uncivil. The question was not answered, as checkuser cannot prove a negative - so a simple good faith question was the right, simple way to address the issue of just how many socks you've employed. Your <i>refusal to even answer</i> seems most uncivil and a serious lack of good faith (exactly what you accuse me of, another pattern of Rex'). Frankly, as you've never answered the question, the jury is still out, and your conduct will (once again) have to speak for itself. I honestly wish you the best of luck, NuclearUmpf. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 12:46, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ryan, I apologize for offending you. I was dealing with this issue last night on my talk page, e-mail and <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">WP:AE</a>, and just before I logged off I found you had brought it here as well. I would like to suggest that it was at least unhelpful to ask NuclearUmpf a question that he had refused to answer several times as Zer0faults, especially given his current claim that he switched accounts not to avoid his probation but to avoid being followed by people he was in dispute with. (Dmcdevit and I have both answered this line of reasoning at <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">WP:AE</a>.) I think the best suggestion I can think of is to treat NuclearUmpf like any other editor and pretend you don't know anything about his past. If he still can not conform to community standards of good editorship, he is subject to sanctions under his probation. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 11:49, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I accept your apology. I do feel that the evidence and behavior indicates strongly that this user is gaming WP (and if Nuclear is indeed Rex, that's well proven at this point), but once again, I'll simply leave the question unanswered, ignore the instantaneous, rapid-fire accusations (another clue) and let Nuclear's conduct speak for itself, for well or for ill. Again, thanks for the apology, as after dealing with Rex and his ilk in multiple incarnations and the actual disruptions they cause, I take flippant accusations of trolling (meaning intentional disruption or baiting) against solid editors quite seriously. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 12:46, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dylan_Avery_13c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dylan Avery">an AfD for the Dylan Avery article</a> recently (one of a rash of 9/11 conspiracy articles lately), which passed as delete, in a somewhat contentious fashion. It's been on my watchlist since, since comments were made somewhere around here that some expected an attempt at recreation. Meco's recreation was as a redirect to <a href="../../../l/o/o/Loose_Change_%28video%29_a1f5.html" title="Loose Change (video)">Loose Change (video)</a>, but as I read the AfD, that possibility was brought up and didn't get a lot of support.

<p>It is perhaps useful to point out that redirecting, like merging, is an <b>editorial</b> decision. The various XfD pages determine <b>administrative</b> issues. They decide the question of whether the article should be deleted or kept. And that's it. If 50 people vote on an AFD discussion, and they all vote "Redirect", then (assuming they're not all sockpuppets citing bogus interpretations of policy as justifications for their votes) that's a <b>keep</b> result. There is no binding <i>obligation</i> on the part of anyone to actually redirect that page (though any editor could make such a redirect with plenty of justification). Only <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a> can be said to have any authority over editorial decisions as well as administrative ones, because discussions there can often result in a redirect to another page.</p>
<p>Similarly, if an article is deleted through the AfD process, and someone creates a redirect under the same name as the previously-deleted article, it's no longer an AfD issue. The <i>article</i> that was deleted hasn't been recreated. A shiny, brand new redirect has. Which makes it an RfD issue.</p>
<p>I realize that the issue in question has already been resolved, and I'm just blathering to hear my fingers click merrily across the keyboard, but I felt moved to air my opinions.</p>
<p>All the best,<br />

<p>This is a barely recognizable characterization of the problem. Anyone can take a look at <a href="../../../p/a/u/Talk%7EPaul_McKenna_0299.html" title="Talk:Paul McKenna">Talk:Paul McKenna</a>. Aside from the issues with biographies of living persons, which Yakuman blithely ignores or twists completely around (he claimed he shouldn't be blocked for violating the three-revert rule because of this), there's some additional conduct to consider.

<dd>Indeed. The message on Michael's talk page about that is a testiment to this user's actions.

<p>Can someone check whether this user is a clever hoaxer and sockpuppet of 82.46.157.9, please? I suspect many of this user's additions to be deliberately misleading and almost all unverifiable, particularly Shevjenko. Most of both of these users' edits are related in some way to <a href="../../../i/a/i/Iain_Lee_0c3f.html" title="Iain Lee">Iain Lee</a>, the article of which is regularly vandalised.

<dd>Well, Shevjenko I deprodded (I had prodded it already and CPE had removed it) and afd'ed. I agree that aspects of it just sound <b>very</b> odd. I did a search to see if it was maybe copyvio from somewhere and that came up negative. Particularily the bit about Iain Lee being his great great grandson etc etc, for which I want a specific citeable reference (considering the "Oh Christopher Lee is Iain Lee's father!!1!!! I herd it on teh radio" vandalism we often get). If it turns out to be a real article then I offer my full apologies to CPE and the inuit subject with his odd life. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 12:01, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>More interesting - We just had an anon (82.46.157.9) add vandalism to Shevjenko mentioning Waspard (deleted last week) and Pet duel (also deleted last week) with the edit summary of <i>rvv</i>. Both afd's had huge bunches of socks/meats. I looked on the talk page, saw several warnings and went to block for 24 hours...and what did I notice? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User:82.46.157.9" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User:82.46.157.9" rel="nofollow">Netsnipe had to clear an autoblock of CarlosPauloEthetheth</a> regarding this IP.

<dd>I have had plenty of run ins with Kappa when I was involved in the schools debate. While i disagree with his extreme position with regard to school inclusion he always led by example. He has always been very productive with respect to cleaning up school articles, especially those stubs and crap school articles that went to AfD. It escapes me how any punitive block can help this situation, especially if he is not currently spamming. There is no way that a block like this is constructive with respect to fostering a postive and collegial working environment. I would recommend this block is lifted. i would also recommed that people use the dialog option more often. We do not need our admins to turn into a police force that runs under the agenda of shoot first ask questions later. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 15:35, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Friday. It concerns me that there is a core group of admins who pursue their own agenda aggressively and at the same time accuse their critics of somehow being against wikipedia. Accuse them of being wikistalkers, trouble makers and whiners (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Friday&amp;diff=77119012&amp;oldid=76852476" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Friday&amp;diff=77119012&amp;oldid=76852476" rel="nofollow">[118]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Friday&amp;diff=77121059&amp;oldid=77120203" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Friday&amp;diff=77121059&amp;oldid=77120203" rel="nofollow">[119]</a>). Excuse me, but this aggressive enforcement of "<i>my way is the only way</i>" is doing a lot of harm to wikipedias community and someone has to stand up and rock the boat. "<i>My way is the only way</i>" may often be the right way, but there are ways to convince people of this without punitive action. Every punitive action will make it harder to persuade people in the future. Each block and thoughtless comment to ones critics will make it harder to reach the final goal. These police edits create a situation that is very much <i>one step forward, two steps back</i> with respect to reaching the desired goals. It also erodes any trust and respect that such admins would have had in the community.

<dd>Yes, because SlimVirgin has <i>soooo</i> much currency with me. Oh wait, no.

<li>I am in favor of blocking&#160;!vote spammers on sight for the duration of the&#160;!vote, simply because of the disruption they cause (I'd like to have other people's opinion on that).

<dd>Let's not mix two issues, eh? I personally agree that blocking <i>at the time</i> might have been alright, as a preventative measure. I don't see that 48 hours would have been neccessary.

<dd>At the time would have made sense if he had continued spamming after being asked to stop. I for one, am not arguing against a block at the time of the event. I'm not sure of Kappa's history with respect to spamming but even if it is bad, a block prior to a warning would not be justified.

<ul>
<li>That is definitely one thing blocking should not be used for. People react very sensitively to their block log, and there should be no blocks made just documenting things in the block log. If an editor does something bad, but the issue is solved without blocking, there is no need to taint this editor in future RfAs or similar by an entry in the block log. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 16:44, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's precisely because people care so much about their block log that it <i>is</i> an effective tool. You can give dozens of warnings to some users to knock off disruptive behavior, but they'll just keep continuing on as soon as they think your attention is diverted.

<li>I'm not opposed to an unblock at this point (he hasn't edited in awhile anyway, so this current block might not even hit him), I just want the unblocking message to make it crystal clear that the vote-stacking was unacceptable, it was just the timing of the block that was questioned. Far too often I see admin actions get reversed with a summary of "No basis in policy for this block," when the person was legitimately doing something bad, and then they think they have carte blanche to do it again. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 16:41, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, it's widely accepted that vote-spamming is a serious threat to our consensus-based model. Anything done to try to stop it (that works) is not unhelpful.

<dd>Thanks. Let me again note that it's easy to find a page that says it's "not" what you want. This page has a large section telling me what I'm "not" supposed to do here. But it's hard to find a page that tells me where I can find the help I might need. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 20:28, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unless it's been added since this was posted, at the top of the page under the heading "Are you in the right place?" just below the bit in red saying this isn't the complaints department is a list of resources that includes the protection link. =) Not a problem, though - you got to the right place, I hope! <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 22:42, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
