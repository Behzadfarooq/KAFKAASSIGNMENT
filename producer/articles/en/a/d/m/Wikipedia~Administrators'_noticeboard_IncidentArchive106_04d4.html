<dd>I took the unusual approach of overturning Bunchofgrapes' original block and replacing an identical one of my own. I left some rationale behind the decision <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EddieSegoura&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55206298" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EddieSegoura&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55206298" rel="nofollow">here</a>. At the moment, I think we need to decide what would be the best thing to do. At the moment, I think what would be best to do is to leave the block as is, and any administrator who wishes to take responsibility for shortening the block can do so at their own volition. At minimum, the block should stay for a little bit, but in deference to the original blocking sentiment, I'd like to get more opinions and see what others think about the situation.

<dd>The recent activities of his sockpuppets show that he still doesn't understand how to work within Wikipedia, or else he's been trolling us all along. And the cross-project exic*nt fun suggests the latter. But in either case, it's been six months, and I think the community's patience is thoroughly worn out.

<dd>That would require a separate checkuser on every project; if there is reason to think he's active on another project, then I'm happy to hand the IPs off to a steward so they can check, but outside that, I doubt you're going to convince a steward to set permissions on hundreds of wikis and spend several days checking each. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 21:47, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>His discussion about the lead paragraph is fine. It's Wolok's subsequent diatribe about how people should be allowed to have sex with partners who are asleep, intoxicated, &amp;c. that's causing the talk page to deteriorate. That discussion doesn't belong on <a href="../../../r/a/p/Talk%7ERape_b918.html" title="Talk:Rape">Talk:Rape</a> because Wikipedia is not a place for advocacy.

<dd>Ah, I see. Those are pretty far-out things to be pushing on Wikipedia, and you might be able to get action on it (Mediation, Arbitration). In the mean time, I might suggest simply ignoring his diatribes on the talk page. Perhaps push them to a designated subpage, or to Wolok's own userspace (they can certainly derail existing constructive conversation which the talk page was meant for, so this is a good idea). Only if he tries to push his outlying views into the article is there a real problem, at which point, revert, and block for 3RR if necessary. This strategy worked well against Wolok at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Many-worlds_interpretation.html" title="Many-worlds interpretation">Many-worlds interpretation</a>, where we faced similar problems (long rambling OR). Now, this isn't an optimal solution. The optimal solution is to teach Wolok either to conform or to get lost. For that I see no easy solution. By the way, if you enact the suggestions I made, there is a good chance that Wolok will email every member of the Advocacy committee, the Mediation committe, the Arbitrarion committe, and Jimbo with the header "Greeting Earthling" and ask for a ruling against you.

(that call at diner was funny) He is VERY new here, not like I am ANY veteran, but from the threads, he seems sincere and technology aside, seems like he wants to help. All the policies ect, can be overwelming. I might suggest that he tries to work on topics that he isn't so passionate about so he can learn the processes and inner workings of this project before trying to edit what really interests him.

<p>Although I can understand someone being mad with drunken sex being defined as rape (I am), that is not the legal definition as far as I know, and does not belong there. Does the user understand this? Then again, advocating for sex while a person is asleep to be legal is pretty strange. I get images of <a href="../../../n/e/c/Necrophilia.html" title="Necrophilia">necrophilia</a> in my head just thinking about it.

<p><b>I wish I know how to indent.</b></p>
<p><b>Hi Folks,</b> Thank you Tom, for pointing me here. First, of all, lets get something straight. I <b>NEVER</b> said having sex with someone who is asleep is not rape, nor did I ever say it is rape. I said it can be rape or not, depending on the circumstances. Nlu apparently disagrees and maintains it is always rape to have sex with someone who is asleep. He apparanlty has arrived at his belief by misunderstanding something he read. If someone has sex with their wife, and they know their wife wouldn't mind, and they are right, I doubt many people would call this "rape." Moreover, I don't think there is a court in the world that would call this rape. Apparantly Nlu disagrees with me. The issue is relevant to the article because we are trying to define "rape." I suggested rape is non-consensual penetration. Then I questioned my own definition. I am not convinced that every case where there is not express consent is properly called rape, such as the example I gave.</p>
<p>Actually, both Nlu and Lethe are arrogant, partronizing, condescending, insulting, and belittling. They each insist on forcing their view by reverting additions without discussion, by not making any attempt to edit additions but reverting them in their entirety. Lethe claims he doesn't read what I write on the discussion page, still he reverts everything I write. I need an advocate and moderation or mediation.</p>
<p>I inadvertantly violated the 3RR on my very first edit, because I did not know Wikipedia had this rule. After I learned this rule, I did not violate it again, though Lethe claims I did.</p>
<p>Lethe claims everything I wrote is wrong. I sent my additions to a world renown phyicist and cosmologist, Max Tegmark. He is a Ph.D. professor of physics at MIT. He listed my additions one at at time, and after just about each point I made, he agreed with me. Still, Lethe again and again removed them all from the article, even after other editors left them in with just minor modifications. I independently discovered Hugh Everett's Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. I never made this claim before, and I don't expect anyone to believe me. I arrived at the interpretation strictly from logic.</p>
<p>I tried to imagine a perfectly logical nascent universe. I realized that such a universe would be in the exact same position as Buridan's ass. I couldn't see how a perfectly logical universe could again and again choose just one path out of many equally good paths. The Copenhagen Intepretation of Quantum Mechanics would have us believe that the universe just takes one single path out of a near infinite number of equally good paths. I then asked myself what would happen if the universe took every possible path like electricity takes every equally good path. I immediately realized if the universe did in fact take every possible quantum path, it would answer all but one of the paradoxes and difficulties of Quantum Mechanics. Every proponent of the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics agrees with me. I believe it is important to get all the advantages of the Many Worlds Interpretation listed in the artlce. Lethe disagrees with the Many Worlds Interpretation, and doesn't see why those who favor it see the problems they do. The Many-Worlds Interpretation addresses most of Einstein's objections to the theory. Any objective party would agree with this, but Lethe disputes every single thing I say.</p>

<p><b>Hi Michael, Thanks for your message and kind words. Alas, I'm too swamped by various deadlines right now to respond in detail to your MWI questions or accept your intriguing trading offer. As you know, I'm a strong supported of Everett's MWI. My opinions are well summarized in the two articles at <a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/" class="external free" title="http://space.mit.edu/home/" rel="nofollow">http://space.mit.edu/home/</a></b> tegmark/everett.html and <a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/" class="external free" title="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/" rel="nofollow">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/</a> quantum.html.</p>
<p>&gt; I claimed Hugh Everett's Many Worlds Interpretation</p>
<p>&gt; offers the following advantages over the Copenhagen</p>
<p>&gt; Interpretation.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; 1. It more simply and more naturally resolves the</p>
<p>&gt; paradox of wave-particle duality.</p>
<p><b>I agree.</b></p>
<p>&gt; 2. It justifies the anthropic principle.</p>
<p><b>I agree, but only partially, since Level III adds nothing new over Level II - see <a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/multiverse.html" class="external free" title="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/multiverse.html" rel="nofollow">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/multiverse.html</a></b></p>
<p>&gt; 4. It automatically generates Feynman's sum-over-histories.</p>
<p>&gt; The Copenhagen interpretation does not generate</p>
<p>&gt; Feynman's sum-over-histories.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; 5. In other interpretations Feynman's sum-over-histories is</p>
<p>&gt; a mere mathematical quirk, because in these interpretations</p>
<p>&gt; every path is not really taken.</p>
<p><b>I don't quite agree here, since many of these histories are far from semiclassical "parallel universes".</b></p>
<p>&gt; 6. It simply explains Schrodinger's Cat paradox.</p>
<p><b>Certainly.</b></p>
<p>&gt; 7. It returns Quantum Mechanics to a deterministic theory.</p>
<p>&gt; God does not play dice. By doing this, it makes</p>
<p>&gt; Quantum Mechanics more compatible with relativity</p>
<p>&gt; which along with all other scientific theories are a</p>
<p>&gt; deterministic theory.</p>
<p><b>Agreed.</b></p>
<p>&gt; 8. It eliminates the problem of trying defining what exactly</p>
<p>&gt; constitutes "measurement."</p>
<p><b>Agreed.</b></p>
<p>&gt; 9. It eliminates Von Neumann's boundary problem: where</p>
<p>&gt; to draw the line between the micro world where Quantum</p>
<p>&gt; Mechanics works, and the Macro world where it doesn't.</p>
<p><b>Agreed.</b></p>
<p>&gt; 10. It eliminates the special place for an observer and</p>
<p>&gt; human consciousness.</p>
<p><b>Agreed.</b></p>
<p>&gt; 11. It restores objective reality to the universe between</p>
<p>&gt; measurements.</p>
<p><b>Yes.</b></p>
<p>&gt; It seems Einstein's main objection with Quantum mechanics</p>
<p>&gt; had to do with the Copenhagen Interpretation and not the</p>

<p>Lethe claimed everything I wrote was wrong. Max Tegmark clearly disagrees.</p>
<p>Proponents of The Many-Worlds Interpretation claim if it were true, it would yield ten or so benefits. I want to list all these benefits in the article. I sent an email to a world famous cosmologist who is a major proponent of The Many-Worlds Interpretation, and he basically agreed with most of the points in my list.</p>
<p>Some editors are strongly opposed to the Many Worlds Interpretation, and don't want the public to know why those who favor it do so, because that would lead to further support for theory. They are vehemently against the theory on principle because it can't be falsified. I understand this objection and think it is a good objection. But I think Ocaam's Razor favors the theory, others say otherwise.</p>
<p>Before I personally knew anyone had proposed the theory, I independently realized what the theory would accomplish, if true.</p>
<p>I also want the article to include the fact that the theory was initially rejected and virtually forgotten. And I want the article to include the fact that Everett left the field of physics because of the poor reception it received. I think any objective party would agree that these undisputed facts would be of interest to the general reader.</p>
<p>Lethe removes whatever I contribute without bothering to read the support I produce for my claims on the discussion page. Instead of editing my contributions, he just removes them in their entirety without comment and asks others to do the same. He claimed every single thing I wrote is wrong.</p>
<p>He maintains this even after a world famous cosmologist explicitly agreed with just about every point on my list. It seems to Lethe's hostility to the theory is effecting his judgment, or maybe he just disdains me because I am not a physicist.</p>
<p>In any event, his conduct appears contrary to Wikipedia guidelines. I don't know who Lethe is, but he has been very insulting, hostile and patronizing from the get-go.</p>
<p>At present, the article contains a lot of irrelevant equations. All the equations in the article are unnecessary because every equation in the article is equally shared by all interpretations of Quantum Mechanics. The value of of Hugh Everett's theory is not in equations, because Hugh Everett's theory does not add or subtract one single equation from quantum mechanics. Everyone agrees to this.</p>
<p>What Everett does is reinterpret the equations of quantum mechanics. If Everett's new interpretation didn't accomplish anything but generate countless universes, his theory would have no value, and violate Ocaam's Razor. The value of Hugh Everett's theory comes from my list of benefits. These benefits are accepted by all those who favor the theory. Leaving out one or more of these benefits makes Everett's Many Worlds Interpretation less desirable.</p>
<p>At one point, Lethe was insisting a "Paradox" could not be a "seeming contradiction," that the word "paradox" and "contradiction" mean exactly the same thing. He quoted the definition from a third-rate, obscure dictionary. I maintain that "wave-paticle duality" is a paradox even if it is not a contradiction, and even if there is an explanation for it. The mere fact that it seems paradoxical to the layman is enough to allow it to be called a "Paradox." Borh and Heisenberg called it a paradox and gave the controversial "principle of complimentarity" to explain it. Richard Feynman said it could not really be understood. The Many-Worlds Interpretation makes this paradox evaporate from the get-go. According to the Copenhagen Interpretation and "the principle of complimentarity" energy and matter act like either a wave or a particle depending on the exact manner of observation. "The principle of complimentarity" makes reality dependant on observers. Between observations, the "prinicple of complimentarity" says nothing exists. If we don't accept the principle of complimentarity or the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, we are left with a contradiction. Einstein rejected the claim that reality is dependant on our observation. He said the moon exists whether we look at it or not.</p>

<p><br />
Even if you know nothing about physics, you can understand what I am trying to do, and why I am trying to do it. In the 1920s, Neils Bohr and Warner Heisenberg created a theory we know today as Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Mechanics seemed to have some queer features that made it different from all previous scientific theories. For example, every other scientific theory is completely deterministic. Quantum mechanics is not a deterministic theory. According to quantum mechanics certain things seem to happen randomly such as the exact moment particles decay. In response to this randomness, Einstein said, "God does not place dice with the universe." Another strange fact of quantum mechanics is sometimes light acts like a wave and sometimes it acts like a particle. Likewise according to quantum mechanics, sometimes electrons act like a wave and sometimes they act like a particle. Einstein argued with Bohr and Heisenberg. He said, quantum mechanics is likely an incomplete theory, that with better understanding of the universe we would eventually eliminate the randomness of quantum mechanics. The theory that Bohr and Heisenberg created had other problems. Together Bohr and Heisenberg came up with an interpretation of quantum mechanics that addressed these issues. This interpretation by Bohr and Heisenberg became known as "the standard model" or "the Copenhagen Interpretation." This interpretation by Bohr and Heisenberg had a few problems. One, it proposed there is no such thing as objective reality between measurements. Einstein was very critical of this contention. He said the moon exists whether people look at it or not, that humans are not necessary for the universe to exist. The Copenhagen Interpretation had many other problems as well such as how to define the concept of measurement, why measurement should effect reality, where to draw the line between the microscopic world where quantum mechanics appears true, and the macroscopic world where it doesn't. The Copenhagen Interpretation led to a famous paradox called "Schrodinger's Cat Paradox." In the end, Richard Feynman a famous physicist who refined quantum mechanics said, "You are not going to be able to understand quantum mechanics, nobody can." But as time went on, physicists stopped looking at the philosophical problems the Copenhagen Interpretation seemed to present. The theory worked, and as far as most physicists were concerned that is all that mattered.</p>
<p>At this point, somebody by the name of Hugh Everett came up with another interpretation of quantum mechanics. According to the Copenhagen Interpretation our universe is the only universe, and nature just takes one quantum pathway out of a near infinite number of equally good quantum pathways. According to the Copenhagen Interpretation, when the universe comes to a fork in the road, it randomly takes one path or the other, it doesn't take both. According to Hugh Everett's Interpretation, when the universe meets a fork in the road with two equally good quantum pathways open to it, it takes both pathways, not just one pathway. This implies the universe splits at each quantum juncture. That is why Hugh Everett's theory is called: "The Many Worlds Interpretation." Now, if Hugh Everett's theory just predicted the existence of countless extra universes we can't ever detect, it would violate Ocaam's razor and it would be a silly theory.</p>
<p>However, a remarkable thing happens if Hugh Everett's theory is true: all the philosophical problems created by the Copenhagen Interpretation automatically evaporate. It is not so much that Hugh Everett's theory proposes an alternative answer to these problems, but rather the philosophical problems don't arise in the first place. If Hugh Everett's theory is true, it answers Einstein's main objections to the theory, it makes theory deterministic like all other scientific theories including special and general relativity. If Hugh Everett's theory is true, it restores objective reality between measurements. It eliminates the need to define what constitutes a measurement. It eliminates the need for the universe to have observers. It does away with the need for human consciousness. It solves the Schrodinger Cat Paradox. It more simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment. It does away with the need for the "principle of complimenatrity" and simply and naturally explains wave-particle duality. Just about every physicist agrees with these claims. Max Tegmark a famous proponent of Hugh Everett's theory agreed with these claims. I want to put them in the article in the form of a list, because these are the reasons why those who favor Hugh Everett's theory do so.</p>
<p>Lethe doesn't like Hugh Everett's theory. He sees no problem with the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics. A lot of physicists agree with Lethe. The philosophical problems Einstein, Schrodinger, Dirac and Feynman had with the theory don't bother them. Einstein said, Bohr and Heisenberg brainwashed a generation of physicists.</p>
<p>So we are at an impasse. I think the article needs to do a better job explaining what I wrote here. I think the article should include a list of all the advantages proponents of the theory claim for the theory. And I think the article should note that Hugh Everett left the field of physics because the Many Worlds Interpretation was at first ridiculed and rejected by all who saw it. I think the article should include the fact that his theory started gaining popularity in the 1980s. As time passes it has gained more and more adherents. Today most cosmologists favor the theory. Today, it is considered a mainstream interpretation of quantum mechanics. Lethe doesn't want readers to know about this trend because it favors the theory, and Lethe opposes it.</p>
<p>I need your help to request moderation. As the article stands, now, it is essentially incomprehensible to the layman. No layman would gather the above from reading the existing article. I can't improve the article with Lethe deleting every single word I add, and disputing every single claim I make even though I supply ample support for all my claims.. If you read the article's talk page you will understand the hostility I am up against. As it stands now the entry is biased against the Many Worlds Interpretation because it does such a poor job listing the reasons why those who favor it do so.</p>
<p>Presumably, you can help me by bringing in more editors, and by helping me request moderation.</p>
<p>Warmest and kindest regards, Michael</p>
<p>PS. If I had the support of other editors I would completely rewrite the article so it could be understood by everyone. I would like to note, that the article does not need to contain a single equation, since every equation found in Hugh Everett's Many Worlds Interpretation is also found in the Copenhagen Interpretation and vice versa. Of course, physics students may be curious how Everett interprets various equations in quantum mechanics, so they can be left in for physics students. But any bright physics student ought to be able to read my explanation of Hugh Everett's theory, and figure out for himself how to interpret the standard equations of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>I have a special interest in this article because in the 1980s, I independently discovered Hugh Everett's theory. I had never heard Hugh Everett or his theory. I imagined the nascent universe being in the exact same situation as Buridan's ass. I asked myself, how could a perfectly logical universe devoid of free will choose one single path over a near infinite number of equally good paths. I then asked myself what would happen if the universe took every branch open to it like electricity takes every branch open to it. I immediately realized if this was the case, then all the philosophical problems posed by the Copenhagen Interpretation would automatically disappear. Many years later I learned Hugh Everett had proposed this exact idea in 1958. I discovered this by stumbling across Michael Clive Price's famous Internet Hugh Everett FAQ. It just so happens that Michael Clive Price is another editor involved in trying to edit this Wikipedia entry. I think by-and-large, Price and I agree on just about everything.</p>

<p><b>Advantages of MWI</b></p>
<p>Proponents of MWI believe that it offers numerous advantages over the Copenhagen Interpretation, among which are the following:</p>
<p>1. Quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. The Coppenhagen Interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. Aside from the Coppenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. Einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the Coppenhagen Interpretation. In response to it, he said, "God does not play dice with the universe."</p>
<p>2. It eliminates the "measurement problem."</p>
<p>3. It eliminates Von Neumann's "boundary problem": where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies, and the macro world where it does not. Shortly before his death in 1953, Albert Einstein wrote: "Like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects."</p>
<p>4. It eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.</p>
<p>5. It restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. Shortly before his death, Albert Einstein also wrote: "Observation cannot CREATE an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made."</p>
<p>6. It more simply and naturally resolves the paradox of wave-particle duality. By doing this it simply explains the double-slit experiment. Richard Feynman said, "[the double-slit experiment] has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery." David Deutcsh wrote: ". . . the argument for the many worlds was won with the double-slit experiment."</p>
<p>7. It simply explains Schrodinger's Cat paradox.</p>
<p>Based on the above advantages, it seems Einstein's main objections with quantum mechanics had more to do with the Copenhagen Interpretation, than with quantum mechanics itself[citation needed]. While MWI does not quite generate the kinds of worlds necessary to justify the anthropic principle, it is a step on the way to Stephen Hawking's No Boundary Proposal and Max Tegmark's All Universe Hypothesis which do justify the anthropic principle[citation needed].</p>

<dd>There seems to be a basic misunderstanding of the way Wiki works here. It is not a question of two (or more) editors battling out their definition and interpretation of a subject—it is about finding what other sources and authorities have to say about it, and representing those. If there are conflicting authorities, then a balanced representation of the conflict should be given. If the policies and guidelines were followed, there wouldn't be this problem. Read, study, digest and apply the following: <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No original research</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_article_2aff.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect article">The perfect article</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Citing sources</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">Footnotes</a>.

<p>We all apreciate Sandover's thousands of contributions, but that does not give this user a pass to insert POV material into a topic which I am clearly more familiar with. I urge you to see the talk page and <i>read it thoroughly</i>, not skim it.

<p>I have now read Haizum's discussion page in detail — I confess that I didn't know his history before reporting my particular encounter with him. Since the latest block, Haizum has deleted a great deal of unflattering talk and commentary relating to previous incidents (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHaizum&amp;diff=56647471&amp;oldid=56218675" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHaizum&amp;diff=56647471&amp;oldid=56218675" rel="nofollow">here</a> for comparison). While I'm not an Admin, I do know human nature — as I see it, any user who has shown this level of dishonesty and disingenuousness, and who has been blocked four times(!) for similar incidents, is unlikely to change his habits in the future. How will a less experienced Wikipedist, or perhaps someone just beginning to explore this medium, deal with Haizum in the future? Very possibly by giving up on the medium altogether, which would be a great shame.

<p>I just deleted it, and SIMISHAG IS LYING, that is why I originally put one on there. I was supposed to be unblocked on the 29th. IF YOU CHECK, my last post on this account was on the 19th, and another user said my block was extended a week from the 22nd. Another lie. He is just wanting to promote his agenda and he doesn't want people to get rid of the propaganda he has spilled on the articles. It is frustrating.

<p>BTW give me an example of uncivil behavior in my POSTS from today. you cannot. You and the others vandalized the entire steve nash page while i was gone. Now I'm back and you start accusing someone I don't even know of being a sockpuppet. BTW how many USERNAMES before this were accused of being sockpuppets of me?? NONE.

I don't really know what else to do other than post it here, as it's becoming a long-term issue. I do not believe this is a simple editing dispute; it's a repeated pattern of boorish behavior (rants, threats, vandalism, sockpuppets). I have never been accused of such in the year I've contributed here; he's been blocked 10 times (by 6 different admins) in the last 3 weeks, and he was even blocked from WikiEN-L.

<dd>At some point, an indef block of the user as having exhausted the community's patience might be in order. I think the user can become a valuable contributor, and I think we ought to work with him toward that end, but the user seems unwilling or unable to comport his editing with our policies and guidelines (most notably, even irrespective of POV/OR issues, with respect to style and the necessity that one affect a formal tone) and certainly has had a deleterious effect on the articles he has edited. Once more, I don't think an indef block is now appropriate, and I am eminently confident that we can help the user to edit productively, but it should be noted that, thus far, his editing and presence, taken cumulatively, have been more disruptive than constructive. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:32, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I remember seeing something about this vandal fly by on ANI a while ago, but I'm not sure of the entire case. A couple days ago, I blocked a User:SS Stepp-Wulf for pretty typical immature vandalism, and then today I came across a User:Stepp-Wolf who was involved in mass image upload vandalism. I've now blocked both indef, but I'm assuming this is a lengthier and more complex case that I'm not entirely aware of. Apparently, indef-blocked <a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeebotheClown_2864.html" title="User:ZeebotheClown">User:ZeebotheClown</a> is somehow connected to the Stepp-wolf vandals as well.

<dd>I haven't changed my mind, either. I believe Moby Dick is highly likely to be Davenbelle, even though for technical reasons it can't be proved 100%. On May 20, MD was formally warned by Tony Sidaway to "keep away, as much as is reasonably possible, from articles, talk pages and other pages edited by Cool Cat".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive102#Stalking" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive102#Stalking" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. This doesn't look a lot like keeping away. While there's possibly room for some doubt, both about the Davenbelle identification and the more recent stalking (there's no doubt at all about the stalking before the warning was issued), I think this is what we have an ArbCom for. You should take it directly to them. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:38, 4 June 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>(after edit conflict)FWIW, I think the locution <i>hideously sick picture</i> to be a breathless overstatement; I'm inclined to think that most, as I, won't be off-put in the least by its inclusion on Mad's talk page. Nevertheless, because it will likely offend some and thus disrupt the collaborative process on which the encyclopedia rests, the image should be removed. Free speech and sexual liberation aren't really the salient issues here; <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a venue for one to proselytize with respect free speech and sensibilities (which I note even as I think Mad and I are likely of one mind apropos of most issues), and, where one's comments/expressions with respect to off-Wiki issues disrupt the project, comments/expressions can and should be limited. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:02, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(after edit conflict) While we do not have a specific <i>policy</i> forbidding PA's on talk pages, removing the image would be a cooperative and helpful thing for The Mad Bomber to do.

<dd>I think most of us agree with you, as evidenced by the general rejection of the proposition that the image is particularly inflammatory. WP, though, is frequented by some who think differently, and the image is likely to prove disruptive to them if they should attempt to collaborate with Mad. Even as I have difficulty understanding why one would be disturbed by the image, I understand that some (possibly a good portion of regular editors) are disturbed, and, where there's no overarching encyclopedic purpose for its inclusion, it's likely better that the image be removed. As Freply notes, though, it'd be most decorous of Mad to do this himself. If he wishes to advance arguments with respect to free speech and gender equality, the community might, consistent with <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a>, permit him to make such arguments on his userpage, provided that he otherwise contributes to the project, but disruption must be de minimis; for a community to exist, collaboration must be facilitated, but so must one's ability to let others know who he/she is, and text can serve each purpose in a fashion that the image cannot. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 06:57, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm glad the rest of you aren't as sickened by this image as I am. But as Joe points out, this is not an issue of censorship of indecency. I have nothing against people finding this image if they're looking for it. The problem is <i>where</i> the image is. This image will appear to people who have no expectation of seeing it. Assuming that I'm not the only person grossed out by the picture, it will discourage people from using the user talk page and, as Joe says, inhibit communication between The Mad Bomber and others. Oh, and we might have a policy for this already -- <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a>. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 15:30, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Mad Bomber's behaviour is a little worrying. If he truly thought the picture was beautiful or important or some other real reason for having it there then he would respond accordingly. Instead he appears to be deliberately escalating things by have the picture appear multiple times on his talk page, by posting it on other people's talk page and by putting vandal notices on experienced editors talk pages because they removed it. Taking AGF to stretching point I have removed the duplicates but left the original (for now) asked him to explain why he wants the picture there and asked him not to engage in behaviours that serve to escalate rather than diffuse. Hopefully he will do the right thing. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 16:03, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll echo what Geni said—user and user talk pages should be 'safe for work'. We follow what is sometimes described as a 'Principle of Least Astonishment' in determining whether an image is appropriate on a given Wikipedia page. If someone is going looking for information about a Prince Albert piercing, it's not utterly unreasonable to expect a picture of one. If someone is looking to discuss articles with an editor – or just to find out more about him – that someone shouldn't encounter a large, naked, pierced penis. I mean, if an editor wanted to announce that he was a <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">dick</a>, there are better ways to go about it. If our editors don't feel that it is safe to visit other editors' user and talk pages when anyone else is watching, it interferes with the functioning of the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 17:16, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Read the entire seciton Nescio was editing. It was a WP:ANI report about an anon editor that Nescio was suggesting is Merecat when in fact Nescio's edit proves it was Nescio. Nescio was asked about this 4 times previously by MErecat and each time refused to answer. Not only was Nescio sockpuppeting, but he was falsely acccusing Merecat for edits that he himself had made. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.46.20.59.html" title="User:69.46.20.59">69.46.20.59</a> 17:14, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I assume you are asking Merecat's sock, in that case he can't answer since the IP has been blocked for trolling. Quelle surprise. The proof is I edit other people's comments. Only recently I corrected the link to Merecat's RfAr on the current RfCU involving him. Since the original post was by Mr Tibbs, the logic advanced proves I am a sock of Tibbs. It would be funny if Merecat hadn't been exceedingly dispruptive with millions of IP's. <font color="green"><a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a></font><sup><i><font color="blue"><small><a href="../../../n/e/s/User_talk%7ENescio_071f.html" title="User talk:Nescio">Gnothi seauton</a></small></font></i></sup> 18:29, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I said that the cases are seperate because some of the other editors seemed to think there was only one (the case filed by Scoville). We can now see you were indicted for hacking and software piracy both of which are felonies. The hacking crime was dismissed, I don't know why, but others say because you made a plea agreement and we have nothing to see so we can't make a determination here in Wikipedia until we get documentation. But the software piracy was not dismissed. Calling you a felon is not an attack or libel. It is true and cited to a reliable reference: a court doc from the court in New York Image:Brian Bruns Indictment 2423-02.jpg. --Chakabuh 17:35, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That must be what happened. I know Brian, and he was trying to explain the situation to me, and I was in a rush, saw the page, and thought he meant it was an attack page. I was in a rush to go to bed early (we had a huge run with 600,000 impressions the next day), and he wanted me to do something about it.

<p>In this rare case, the editor who's editing an article about himself appears to be in the right. It strongly appears that a previous editor was trying to use the article to forward a factually erroneous claim -- namely, that Bruns is currently under a court's restraining order. Removing an erroneous claim is simply correct.</p>
<p>Moreover, considering the history of the case (with which I have some small passing familiarity) it seems likely that the article was created either as an attack or a prank. The first revision describes Bruns as <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leet.html" title="Leet">leet</a>; other early revisions claim Bruns to be a convict, and to be under a restraining order. Neither of these claims are substantiated.</p>
<p>It is far better that Brian Bruns ask for the article to be removed (by proposing it for deletion) than that he, e.g., go to the press and denounce Wikipedia for libelling him, the way that some people have.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 05:29, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lol, FOo, the claims are susbtantiated. There is no libel, <b>I uploaded scans of the court documents, see above</b>. And the article is protected in a state where none of this is mentioned. If Bruns goes to the media denouncing Wikipedia for libelling him, it will only make him look silly since we have court citations to back up what we write. --Chakabuh 08:11, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An indictment that was dismissed, and far from notable (unless suddenly wikipedia decides to document every indictment/dismissal against every person in the world). An indictment that many kooks try to say is a conviction in an effort to discredit and ruin my reputation. I corrected your statement in the article about me before wiping it out completely in the hope that you'd see your mistake. However, you didn't get the clue, and kept stating as a fact that I was convicted of hacking even when the paperwork involving the case was right in front of your face and said contradicted your assertations. <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruns_0666.html" title="User:Bruns">Brian</a> 17:38, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes the hacking charge was dismissed, but you still were indicted, just not convicted. It is notable, so notable that even the DA's office made a press release about it. Again, your rhetoric about "kooks" is not appropriate in Wikipedia. It is true that they are incorrect in saying you were convicted, as you were not convicted and the charge was apparently dropped. However, you ommitted the fact that <b>you were convicted of software piracy</b> which is a class E felony. I and the others have made mistakes because there is some confusing information about your cases and Scoville and Schwarz haven't presented all relevant documentation. But your person attacks on me are unacceptable. Yes I made some mistakes and I have corrected my data. Now stop posting ad hominem and lets get the correct information into your article. And if you have anything positive about you, please give us references so that we can also write about it. --Chakabuh 17:44, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If it were not Curps doing this, I would have already blocked the account, but because of the long history and the other services Curps provides, I wanted to raise this issue here first. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 22:12, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My first instinct was no, but on the other hand if Curps (the human) is around then a block would force a response, and he can be unblocked straight away. If it is an unauthorised bot, then it should be blocked.

<p>Curps' methods are (a) old news, and (b) the worst-kept secret on this entire project. I'd question the administrative credentials of anyone who was unaware of this. I'll bet dollars to donuts that is was due to some improperly encoded characters in the url, e.g. "�", which in many cases are indicative of a web proxy, as it's relatively difficult to type such characters accidentally using a normal keyboard.

<dd>a) Giving a bot the ability to issue indefinite blocks based on its interpretation of vandalism is certainly not "old news" to me, and would seem to have a lot of potential to create collateral harm that I think should be discussed. If it has been discussed, fine, show me where. Otherwise, please avoid questioning mine or anyone else's "administrative credentials". b) The strange wikitext you point to is an unrelated bug in the ref code which has been <a href="../../../v/p/t/WP%7EVPT_113f.html#nowiki_and_ref_weirdness" title="WP:VPT">discussed at VPT</a> from a different context. Maybe that bug is triggering Curps's reverts, I don't know. And perhaps the IP actually is an open proxy. If so that is a seperate issue to deal with, but the fact that Curps is apparently continuing to extend the functionality of his admin bot without community input and notice is at least disrespectful and quite possibly dangerous. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 06:01, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking at the logs, he may have been running the vandalism bot for ~6 months now, but unless it was actually mentioned somewhere, I would never have assummed that blocks issued as "vandalism" were being made by a bot. If so, I would assume it has been doing at least an okay job if it didn't create huge conflicts before now. However I am still unsatisfied by Curps' secretive methods and uninformative edit summaries. For example, the reversions by Tawkerbot2 seem vastly supperior to me than simply automating a rollback process. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 06:24, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I use "vandalism" as reason when blocking all the time. Also, considering how many times Curps blocks and rolls back in one day, I thought it would be obvious that no human was doing that.

<dd>I was wondering why Curps blocked Joshbuddy (a long-time and apparently good contributor), since the page moves he supposedly made didn't show up in his contributions. However, the move log shows a bunch of WoW type page names and moves. Unlike WoW, legitimate articles were not moved, just pages with names of "WoW test pageX", though. Is everybody starting to freak out and go on vandalism sprees? -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:50, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Josh was attempting to test an experimental tawkerbot feature, during the time that it appeared Curpsbot was offline. Apparently, he wasn't. — <small>Jun. 4, '06</small> <tt><b>[08:11] &lt;<u class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freak</a>|<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a></u>&gt;</b></tt></dd>

<p>So apparently Curps' bot is doing roughly the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Page moves throttle</b>: Detects a user moving pages beyond some rate threshold, issues an indefinate block with summary "page moves...", and posts a notice here at ANI.</li>
<li><b>Page move vandalism</b>: Detects page moves to certain targets (e.g. Earth -&gt; Earth on Wheels) as vandalism. Reverts the move and deletes the redirect.</li>
<li><b>User names</b>: Follows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=newusers" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=newusers" rel="nofollow">new users log</a> and indefinately blocks users with names containing certain words (e.g. "vandal") or that use certain special characters. Block summary is "user..."</li>
<li><b>Rollback</b>: Detects certain behaviors as vandalism and automatically uses rollback.</li>
<li><b>Vandalism blocks</b>: Decides that some vandalism warrants a block summarized as "vandalism". Registered users triggering this are blocked indefinitely. Ordinary IPs are blocked for 24 hours and AOL IPs for 15 minutes. It appears that vandalism that triggers a block will be reverted, but that not all reverts trigger a block.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is my intention to add a similar basic summary of Curps' functionality to <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT</a>. I'd also like to add it <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">User:Curps</a>, since each bot is supposed to give a description of what it does on it's userpage, but I don't know if we can agree on that as long as Curpsbot = Curps user. Personally, I'd strongly prefer that the bot edits and blocks be identified as belonging to a bot in the summaries or through a seperate bot account. In my opinion, having an undocumented bot masquadering as an administrator is antithetical to the open and transparent environment on which Wikipedia is built, even if the bot's actions are presumed to always be correct and effective. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 10:00, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm taking the unusual step of reblocking this editor. It doesn't seem to be right to run this unapproved bot with an admin bit. I'm not convinced that the putative benefits of the bot outweigh the uncertainty. If Curps agrees to disclose the bot source code and its running parameters and data files to a qualified person such as myself or Tawker, I think this bot should be allowed to run with approval. Meanwhile having discussed this with administrators and arbitrators I shall block for twelve hours to permit us to discuss the matter. I will also announce this on Curps' talk page prior to blocking.</p>

<dd>Sounds reasonable.

<dd>I don't think the block was necessary (and useless, as admins can block while blocked themselves, they just can't revert). Curps's block bot is, as the anon editor who visited us above, the worst-kept secret on Wikipedia, and no one complained until this incident, even after it has done <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?dbname=enwiki&amp;user=Curps" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?dbname=enwiki&amp;user=Curps" rel="nofollow">about 25000 blocks</a>. Additionally, this has been known since <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Curps_e85f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Curps">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Curps</a>, so it isn't anything particularily new.

<p><i>R, your monologue above is exactly the reason that original research is not permitted in these articles. <b>For all I know you are a raging terrorist out to murder Jews, Brits and Americans, purposely attempting to sound semi moderate to conceal evil intent (we certainly have had enough of those recently in many Western countries).</b> I could post a long article claiming to be a Palestinian Christian suffering the discrimination and <b>brutality of having to live amongst a bunch of intolerant bloodthirsty Muslims</b> (and those Christians probably exist), but it wouldn't be true. The whole point of Wiki is to have third party mainstream objective sources as the sole source of information. That will provide some validity to these articles. The fact that you (or I) don't like a particular point of view is something you or I might find disconcerting, but if a mainstream source says something, and you don't believe it's accurate, you don't delete the source, you provide another source that has a contrary point of view. I personally find the views of Eduard Said and Noam Chommpsky vile, untruthful, and crazed - but I wouldn't delete them from an article, I would just make sure that a view I considered more accurate was also cited. R, that's what democracy is all about, not drowning out those you disagree with, but offering alternatives to allow interested persons to make up their own mind. And that's why ultimately democracy wins out over rival systems that involved censorship and intolerance, people want the right to make up their own mind. Observe the rules, post mainstream sources, suck it up when reading views you don't like, and you will be a good editor on this article.Incorrect 12:13, 2 June 2006 (UTC</i>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Palestinian_people&amp;diff=56484177&amp;oldid=56478018" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Palestinian_people&amp;diff=56484177&amp;oldid=56478018" rel="nofollow">[50]</a></p>

<p><i>A, you have joined the side of the censors who are attempting to vandalize the article on the Presbyterian Church's anti -Semitism problem. Despite third party reputable sources that report that the PC has been accused of anti-semitism, you have supported those who consistenly delete that information. If you feel the PB church is not anti semitic, you are certainly free to add information to the article and cite sources that say it is not - it is vandalism, however, to delete information that such a controversy even exists. I would guess that you are a man of science from your talk page, since that requires a clarity of thought I would hope that upon reconsideration YOU will edit the PC article to include the anti-semitism information (adding to it if you wish information that would attempt to refute that charge.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alteripse&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56864371" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alteripse&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56864371" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 21:30, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I instructed the user to add a reply to his own comment if he feels it needs clarification. Since he has accused me of taking his words out of context, I believe they should stay exactly as originally posted. Posting a comment below the original statement to add clarification would be correct measure.

<dd>Your apology is accepted. Perhaps you shouldn't jump on the band wagon and instead do your own research. I have already provided my own IP, do an ARIN lookup if you still believe me to be a sockpuppet, do an open proxy scan etc. I have had the same IP for some time as my cable lines it always on. But as I stated in the beginning, do not add words to comments on my talk page after they have been replied to. If you feel you needed to clarify something then its obvious something you said can be misinterpreted or taken out of context etc. Changing the context by adding and removing words later is bad form. Feel free as I stated numerous times to add your comment about clarification below the existing one that needs clarification as to not confused readers who stop by, they shouldnt have to dig through an edit history to read the conversation. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup>|sockpuppets|</sup></font></i></a> 17:07, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with bainer, though I don't think we should have an article on Wikitruth at all, as it is non-notable. It's like a few people (several dozen, tops?) who are upset with <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Electric_4bb6.html" title="General Electric">General Electric</a> starting a website saying that the company sucks and getting an article, and Wikipedia isn't even as notable or as large as General Electric. At most such websites should be mentioned in a Wikipedia criticism article, perhaps not even in the article namespace. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:01, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Show me a website about people upset with General Electric that has an Alexa rank of 80,000 or better. If such exists, we might have an article about that as well. You don't reach that rank just by setting up a website saying "X sucks". You have to make some sense. And it doesn't matter then how many people you are; many notable websites are probably run by single individuals. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMargana_b7b1.html" title="User:Margana">Margana</a> 13:39, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The issue is that these two editors will reinsert this every time it is removed, claiming it needs consensus before a sourced statement can be removed, which I think is utterly wrong.

<p>Any objections to banning this user indefinately? He has <b>never</b> made <b>any</b> edits (not even replying to querries on his talkpage), what he does is upload pictures. Mostly useless (for Wikipedia) self made 3D renders and <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habbo_Hotel_1ebf.html" title="Habbo Hotel">Habbo Hotel</a> screenshots tagged as {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-self_86e2.html" title="Template:PD-self">PD-self</a>}}, he also frequently write "all rights reserved" in the image summary even though he usualy tag them as {{<a href="../../../n/o/r/Template%7ENorightsreserved_10fd.html" title="Template:Norightsreserved">norightsreserved</a>}}. All his images have been deleted twise before (first as "no source", then by IFD the second time), but he never reply to messages on his talkpage, he just upload the images again a while after they have been deleted. I also know for a fact that he has been using these images on Habbo related message boards (some examples <a href="http://habboxforum.com/showpost.php?s=d74c0782955246df0ffeff86c0962869&amp;p=1782807&amp;postcount=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://habboxforum.com/showpost.php?s=d74c0782955246df0ffeff86c0962869&amp;p=1782807&amp;postcount=1" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> <a href="http://habboxforum.com/showpost.php?s=d74c0782955246df0ffeff86c0962869&amp;p=1754375&amp;postcount=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://habboxforum.com/showpost.php?s=d74c0782955246df0ffeff86c0962869&amp;p=1754375&amp;postcount=1" rel="nofollow">[64]</a> (check the source URL of those posted images)), so he's basicaly just using Wikipedia for file storage with is explicitly something <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>. Since he only seem to check in every couple of months a 24 hour or even week long block seems unlikely to have any effect, so I feel we should just ban him indefenetly (and summarily delete all his images), at least untill such a time as he show some sign of actualy wanting to contribute to Wikipedia rather than just leech bandwidth off it. Since it's a bit of a "non standard" case (well there are the repeated copyvios), I just wanted to make sure I won't cause some kind of controversy by giving him the boot without three formal warnings and all that first. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 02:26, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
