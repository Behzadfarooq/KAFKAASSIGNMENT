<ul>
<li>On <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Summer_Rains_b81f.html" title="Operation Summer Rains">Operation Summer Rains</a>, Zeq adds an out of place news piece to the lead, without an edit summary, failing to use the standard referencing conventions. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Summer_Rains&amp;diff=61530256&amp;oldid=61526948" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Summer_Rains&amp;diff=61530256&amp;oldid=61526948" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I revert once (restoring encyclopedic lead) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Summer_Rains&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61530587" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Summer_Rains&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61530587" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Zeq reverts, this time using an edit summary, which reads: "restored wider context of the opreation. Lead should refelect the whole article." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Summer_Rains&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61530587" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Summer_Rains&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61530587" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I revert a 2nd time, explaining that "this is not wikinews. Stop editing disruptively Zeq. Stick to the articles consensus conventions (ref-wise, too), and the scope of the lead." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Summer_Rains&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61530949" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Summer_Rains&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61530949" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Instead of responding to these concerns on the talk page, Zeq informs me I violated 3RR and that I should self-revert. I can't see how I did so, but I don't wish to argue over this at AN3 (or at that point, at all), so I self-revert and withdraw, knowing someone else will revert him shortly thereafter, which they do moments later.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Result: lead remains the same. Only after going through these (3RR diversionary) lengths is Zeq prepared to respond to my original concenrs (at that point I'm no longer interested).</li>
</ul>
<p>The point is that if an established editor points out to Zeq that he is editing carelessly, he is the one who should step back, and only after a discussion has taken place, be allowed to revert to his version/s. I want to see Zeq editing more carefuly, and being open to discussion not only after the fact. I'm uncertain whether the probation is proving effective as I keep seeing Zeq banned from various articles, which presumably is due to him causing problems. Is it worthwhile to continue with it? Will Zeq ever be able to tread lightly when it comes to these sort of careless and tendentious and poorly-communicated editing practices? I'm not sure that he can and therefore am open to a re-examination of the case. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 00:33, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This article is about a current events and as such it is updated with news by many editors.</li>
<li>I have made several polite atempts to comunicate with El_C (on her talk page) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEl_C&amp;diff=61531888&amp;oldid=61479789" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEl_C&amp;diff=61531888&amp;oldid=61479789" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEl_C&amp;diff=61532393&amp;oldid=61531971" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEl_C&amp;diff=61532393&amp;oldid=61531971" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEl_C&amp;diff=61532601&amp;oldid=61532509" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEl_C&amp;diff=61532601&amp;oldid=61532509" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></li>
<li>El-C deleted all of them and refuse to work together to resolve the edit conflict. Instead she just used the reverts (citing my "problematic history").</li>

<li>Probation policy specifically sais to avoid "striking out on users under probation".</li>

<ul>
<li>The fact that any user is on probation should not be used <u>as an excuse</u> to avoid resolving disputes.</li>
<li>At that point I informed her that she should <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEl_C&amp;diff=61544349&amp;oldid=61533953" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEl_C&amp;diff=61544349&amp;oldid=61533953" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></li>

<li>I should not be required to "Step back" <u>upon demand</u> by other who call themselfs "established editor".</li>

<dd>No one <u>owns</u> the article.I am editing according to policy and so should she.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>In her comments she pointed out her sense of "ownership" to that article(she decalred "I wrote 1/2 of it") and clearly her feeling that she own the article are the problem here. Still I appologized to her about hurting her feeling but to no avail and no coepration with her was achived despite my attempts.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As for results, I made total of 2 edits to that article, that was all. (both were reverted in short time so it is not true that these changes remained in the article) I did not continue to edit after these 2 edits, did not wish to get into an edit war on this.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If there is one conclusion from this is that Probation is problematic tool since it encourage some users to think they have the right to avoid coopereting and resolving disputes with others who have a what they call "problematic history" .<a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 03:12, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>PS I would like also to point out that what El_C doubed "proper encyclopedia lead" is written in a clear bias: While Israel's poistion is lacking the whole facts and described in weasle words "israel claim that...." the Palestinian position is writen by El_c in detail and described as "Palestinians assert that..." . some honesty is required here: El_C has a POV to push and my edit (which added few facts) was in her way. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 03:45, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a bit disginious to talk about "patience" when one refuse to discuss a conflict and instead choose reverts and bans. I did raise the issue of the lack of balance in the intro. As for "the comunity" - I have pointed out many times that "the comunity" should be open to critism and different POV (which seems to be the core problem in this edit dispute). Now that El_C seems to gain her coll head I suggest that she remove the improper ban. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 06:03, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zeq is on probation for tendentious editing among other things. He displayed this tendency, despite warnings, in the articles in question. The ban is reasonable and should remain particuarly as Zeq has consistently refused to acknowledge any fault and insists that he is in the right - this does not inspire confidence that Zeq has learned from his mistakes and will change his behaviour. As for Zeq's claim that action was "refused" be arbitrators, this isn't the case. In fact, what occured is that on one occasion I complained to arbitrators directly and one of them posted the incident here. On subsequent occasions I put a notice here myself. Since several of the articles have been under protection since shortly after Zeq's ban the bans haven't had any practical effect as of yet. Homey 18:02, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since it is Homey who filed the original complaint this is not the "independent review" I was hoping for. Need an unbiased opinion. Just for the record: Homey had an edit dispute with me, as a "weapon" in his edit war he also blocked me without cause (twice). In article in which he accused me for tendentious editing I made 3 edits at the time he made over a dozen. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 18:31, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't think serious consideration can be given to lifting the ban as long as Zeq rejects its legitimacy much like how parole boards don't grant furloughs to those who refuse to admit their guilt. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AIsraeli_apartheid&amp;diff=58949457&amp;oldid=58948682" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AIsraeli_apartheid&amp;diff=58949457&amp;oldid=58948682" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> for Zeq's attitude to the ban. Homey 19:13, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that only admins who blocked me are responding here shows that it is not able to get any serious review of this issue. My viwes on how the ban is affecting is irelevent if this ban was not done for good cause and that is the issue. Maybe it is also worth mentioning that largly because of Homey's action the articles I am baned from are protected for over 2 weeks. <b>If I was the disruption</b> . the article could be unblocked after my ban. In fact, the articles had to be locked after I was banned because of Homey's edit wars with other editors. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 19:24, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>After you edit war your way to your favorite version. But Who asked for protection is irelevent here as well as who asked for unprotection. <u>the issue is:</u> <b>If I was the disruption</b> these articles could have been unprotected. The proof is that they are still locked for nearly 3 weeks long after I am banned from them. Something there is <u>&gt; completly</u> not related to me. You on the other hand have violated every poosible policy (such as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html" title="WP:Not">WP:Not</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a> and more in your edit war in these articles.

<p>You were not the sole cause for the articles being protected but a cause. However, unlike others who edited tendenaciously you were violating your probation by doing so. Homey 20:12, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Homey, the fact that you have responded to my request here for a review is foritself a problem that shows your vandeta and the length you go to push those who object your political POV pushing.</li>
<li>Even Tony Sidaway, the admin who banned me agreed that all I was doing was trying to prevent your POV pushing.</li>
<li>I again ask that an independent review of this ban will be done.</li>
<li>Your argument about my guilt as part of other does not hold water. I was editing <b>by far less</b> than you and others on thse articles. The ban was not for good cause and that is whay it needs to be reviwed.</li>
<li>Today, (nearly 3 weeks after banning me) the articles are locked because your political POV pushing. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 20:36, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>1) Zeq, there is nothing wrong with my responding to your request given that I am an interested party. 2) You are misrepresenting Tony Sidaway's comments 3) Perhaps you should post the diffs for the edits that got you into trouble. That you haven't says much more then your attempts to smear everyone who is trying to hold you to account. Homey 20:43, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Homey, I have not misrpersented anything.</li>
<li>I think the right thing for you to do is delete all your comments here and let the review that I asked for take place.</li>
<li>My edits (as well as yours) are not hidden and anyone can see who was disruptive.</li>
<li>All that i was asking is for an admin to take a look at the record.</li>

<p>The second revert took place only about 3 1/2 hours after the first, so this is a clear violation. Leyasu is claiming that he has the support of most of his WikiProject behind him when he is doing the reverts, but only he is doing the reverts. Deathrocker responded to one of the reverts with a personal attack <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heavy_metal_music&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58290986" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heavy_metal_music&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58290986" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, which suggests it may also be good to put Deathrocker on personal attack parole (both of them were blocked for three days before the start of Deathrocker's RfAr for arguing with each other on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>). As for Leyasu, he clearly needs to be blocked, as well as any anons he is using. I was a party in Leyasu's original RfAr and have brought some evidence in Deathrocker's, so I prefer that someone else carry out any block(s) resulting from this violation.</p>

<dd>Blocked Leyasu for three months; if any administrator disagrees with me, let me know and I'll shorten the block. But Leyasu's blatant circumvention of previous blocks with an anonymous account, combined with his violation of parole just hours after being informed that his block expired, makes me think that the user is not willing to obey the parole in the future. One note: I didn't block the IP, as I never block IPs unless I know for sure that they're static. If someone can confirm that this IP is static, and would not be used by any other user, I'll block that too; otherwise, I don't mind if another administrator does so. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 06:45, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This doesn't tie into the rulings directly; but if Leyasu is using these sockpuppets while blocked, the blocks are not serving any purpose. If the anons are in fact him (they do come from a range of IPs that he has used), then he has evaded the block on two separate occasions. This might have bearing on what we decide about Leyasu in the future, so those of us who watch this page should be aware of it whether we do anything about it now or not.</p>

<dd>FIrst off to clear something up. Ive been using Anons mainly to work on thigns i was already working on, before Deathrocker decided to start reverting every edit i made to everything.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, Deathrocker seems to fail to understand <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The precedence goes to the greater view. That means when a whole Project of people give 10+ sources saying one thing, and Deathrocker gives one source, that doesnt mean everyone else is vandalising by removing Deathrockers attempts at POV Pushing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Deathrocker also refused to work with other editors, claiming he owns that article (and several others beside). This is something he has done before, as noted in my Arb Com Evidence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So yeah, once Deathrocker stops stalking me and lets me peacefully get on with what i was doing, maybe then i wont have to keep using Anons. 10:29, 12 June 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Ley Shade</a></dd>

<dd>After waiting for an answer from Homey (which never arrived see the talk page) I preformed the edit (removed one setnce from a quote from a source that should not have been used) and homey response was an edit war (he reverted it while not mentioning it in edit summary.

<dd>The edits you made are completely one sided and POV and attempts to denigrate proponents of the term thus they are tendentious.

<p>Homey 18:55, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is the 3rd time in a week Homey is trying to ban me from articles in which he and I have content disputes. All my edits are maticulsly discussed in talk and I would welcome a discussion why they are not a violation of the probation. Homey has been dishonest about his attempts to push his political POV and been edit warring with many editors in these articles. He have leveled false accuastuions aginst me before so before starting any new ban (previous one was recinded see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Arbitration_enforcement#User:Zeq_.2831_May.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Arbitration_enforcement#User:Zeq_.2831_May.29" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>) I hope to engage in discussion with one one who has an issue with any of my edit. Thank You.</p>
<p>Please encourage Homey to use normal dispute resolution procedure for content disputes. (in the past he blocked me twice while having a content dispute with me, accused me of vandalism (which was also declined by reviwing admin etc..) In short, this issue require carefull examination and dialogue <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 19:34, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe it's high time you relented, Homey? This harassing of Zeq is transcending all bounds: first, you blocked him twice despite being involved in a dispute with him, and now you're trying to have him banned for the second time. Zeq has given you adequate explanations on all purported cases of tendentious editing. If anyone exhibits a pattern of tendentious editing here, this is certainly you: your usage of sources like <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabeel.html" title="Sabeel">Sabeel</a> demonstrates sheer contempt for both <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Try adhering to Wikipedia policies for a change, instead of attempting to have Zeq banned so that you could gain advantage in content disputes.

But perhaps writers who use the word "conspiracy" in the title of their books don't deserve to be treated like human beings. I really don't know. <a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_807e.html" title="User:^^James^^">^^James^^</a> 21:14, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In my opinion, Zeq has again violated his parole and should be banned from editing <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Apartheid (disambiguation)">Apartheid (disambiguation)</a>. As there would be objections to my taking this action due to a perceived conflict of interest, I'm asking you to consider the evidence, judge whether or not Zeq has violated his probation (again), and take any necessary action.

<li>This is laghable at best. The creation of these two pages have disrupted wikipedia. Even if they fail the Afd they will eventually have to be renaed, NPOVed and moved as part of some other Israeli-Palestinian conflict article. (see Fred bauder commnet on the AfD)</li>

Since I am a party to a dispute with him on this page there have been objections raised to my attempts to discipline him. I therefore ask ArbComm members to give an opinion on the following: 1) Has Zeq violated his probation by engaging in tendentious editing in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli_apartheid_%28phrase%29&amp;diff=55770068&amp;oldid=55756301" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli_apartheid_%28phrase%29&amp;diff=55770068&amp;oldid=55756301" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli_apartheid_%28phrase%29&amp;diff=55752867&amp;oldid=55752006" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli_apartheid_%28phrase%29&amp;diff=55752867&amp;oldid=55752006" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>? 2) Should he be banned from the article <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid_%28phrase%29.html" title="Israeli apartheid (phrase)">Israeli apartheid (phrase)</a> and related articles? 3) Should he also be blocked "by brief block, up to a week in the case of repeated violations" as per the guideline in the "enforcement" section above?</p>

<dd>I find the ban marginal. Zeq had not edit warred extensively and was making good points on the talk page about fundamental problems with the article (which I agree with as the article seems to he inherently POV with that title). That said, I do not think Sean Black abused his discretion. Zeq should not be blocked unless he violates the ban. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 13:19, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sean - the admin who accepted homey e-mail campaign (several admins contacted me to let me me know that Homey was spaming large number of admins to get me banned) should have looked more carefully at what is going on in this article:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Homey started it with outrafous content</li>
<li>Homey edited the article 45 times&#160;!!!</li>
<li>Homey was banned for 3RR (including 5 violations)</li>
<li>Homey engaaged in a campaign against me, misusing his admin powers twice to block me with no justaification</li>
</ul>
<p>There is more policy violations that Homey was engage in (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html" title="WP:Not">WP:Not</a>, editing (appliying blocks) while he was under a block) , <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a>, <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a> and more ... so Sean should have been more carefull (to say the least) while he took sides in this dispute. BTW, all other admins that Homey tried to gagng against me have told him flat-out: Zeq was editing in a way that you dispute, that is content dispute, go resolve it according to policy ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=55782557&amp;oldid=55781724" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=55782557&amp;oldid=55781724" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=55785276#Zeq" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=55785276#Zeq" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> - in which Homey first tried to level accuastion of vandalsim against me.</p>
<p>Please review all facts, Homey leveled one false accuastion against me (and others) after another until <b>one</b> sympthetic admin was willing to apply a ban based on the false arguments above. <u>My hope that Sean himself after review will recind the ban.</u> Hopefully he will be the first to review.

<p>While using Hernando Cortez, Lou violated his article ban over a dozen times and his revert parole just over half a dozen, as the contributions consisted of edit warring over a {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} tag as Lou had done <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Societal_attitudes_towards_homosexuality&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53703122" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Societal_attitudes_towards_homosexuality&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53703122" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Societal_attitudes_towards_homosexuality&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53873609" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Societal_attitudes_towards_homosexuality&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53873609" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Societal_attitudes_towards_homosexuality&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54880653" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Societal_attitudes_towards_homosexuality&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54880653" rel="nofollow">[64]</a> etc.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Summation</dt>
</dl>
<p>The evasion went on for a fortnight. I recommend that Lou is banned for the maximum two weeks, one week for each violation. I filed the Arbcom case and have reverted Lou and his sockpuppet, and consider myself too 'involved' to make the block myself.</p>

<p>I was an involved party in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Terryeo_064a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Terryeo">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Terryeo</a>. It was alleged by many editors in that action that Terryeo was engaged in a practice set out by his religious organization called "Dev-T", or "Developed Unnecessary Traffic" -- simply translated, "wasting people's time and energy". It is considered a thing to eliminate in your own organization -- and to increase in the organizations of "enemies". Even after being banned indefinitely from all Scientology and Dianetics-related articles for editing, Terryeo continues to disrupt on article talk pages and user talk pages, whether it is by harassing individual editors or by insisting that Scientology, though supposedly a religion, does not have "beliefs", and persisting in pointless discussion of this impossible premise despite citations from the Church of Scientology itself referring to "the beliefs of Scientology".</p>

<dd>This is absolutely disgraceful and seriously threatening behavior that actually sends shivers down my spine. In my opinion he should be permanently banned after such intentionally intimidating and threatening harrassment. Terryeo is now searching for all information he can find off wikipedia in an attempt to scare wiki contribtutors off scientology articles. Though very typical for the cult, such behavor should <b>never</b> be tolerated on wikipedia.

<p>Having returned from a one-week block for violating personal attack parole and an article ban, Lou is continuing to use his talk page to rail against what he sees as a 'gay cabal'. He is attempting to avoid sanction by saying the opposite of what he's saying, while being completely transparent about what he actually means.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"Of course</i> I <i>would never think of this user as an extremist breaking the rules to further his own agenda, but how can I explain to others that this user's actions were an act of good faith and not blatant POV pushing?"</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lou_franklin&amp;diff=53783567&amp;oldid=53633310" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lou_franklin&amp;diff=53783567&amp;oldid=53633310" rel="nofollow">[74]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>and so on in similar vein in a discussion with Jimpartame, until we reach:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"I don't think that this user is using Wikipedia as a PR vehicle to push a radical homosexual agenda at all, but what do</i> you <i>think?"</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lou_franklin&amp;diff=53804878&amp;oldid=53804374" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lou_franklin&amp;diff=53804878&amp;oldid=53804374" rel="nofollow">[75]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I believe these are quite transparent accusations of bad-faith, despite the sarcastic language used. Apart from that, the accusations are identical to those Lou made explicitly and frequently before ArbCom closed - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Lou_franklin/Evidence#Lou_franklin_is_frequently_uncivil_to_other_editors_and_assumes_bad_faith" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Lou_franklin/Evidence#Lou_franklin_is_frequently_uncivil_to_other_editors_and_assumes_bad_faith" rel="nofollow">this section</a> of the ArbCom evidence page, so there should be no doubt about what Lou actually means.</p>

<dd>User:SchmuckyTheCat's claims are problematic (as detailed below), and it's pretty apparent he does not care about whether he's presenting the entirety of the fact, which is essential for administrators' decision.
<ul>
<li>I have explained in details for many times why Hong Kong and Macao categories should not be subcategory of mainland China-specific categories, but he's kept the false assertion that I'm arguing that're not part of China. Nobody has ever said they're currently not part of the PRC.</li>
<li>I've explained why the word "mainland" was necessary to the list of countries by GDP, just that user:SchmuckyTheCat doesn't agree. It was not me who added the word to the list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29&amp;diff=52975741&amp;oldid=52793741" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29&amp;diff=52975741&amp;oldid=52793741" rel="nofollow">[80]</a>.</li>
<li>As for round brackets, user:SchmuckyTheCat has never justified why all similar cases should be treated in the same manner.</li>
<li>For the list of stadiums, it was user:Alanmak who first reorganised the list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_football_stadiums_by_capacity&amp;diff=49818891&amp;oldid=49729923" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_football_stadiums_by_capacity&amp;diff=49818891&amp;oldid=49729923" rel="nofollow">[81]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_football_stadiums_by_capacity&amp;diff=42690811&amp;oldid=42455782" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_football_stadiums_by_capacity&amp;diff=42690811&amp;oldid=42455782" rel="nofollow">[82]</a>, disregarding how Hong Kong first appeared like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_football_stadiums_by_capacity&amp;diff=42423639&amp;oldid=42361665" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_football_stadiums_by_capacity&amp;diff=42423639&amp;oldid=42361665" rel="nofollow">[83]</a>.</li>
<li>The designation "Macao, China" is at most time spelt with an -o. But user:SchmuckyTheCat does not agree.</li>
<li>I've explained why <i>Taiwan</i> ≠ <i>Republic of China</i>, when it comes with names of categories <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:National_parks_of_Taiwan&amp;diff=52906294&amp;oldid=52905425" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:National_parks_of_Taiwan&amp;diff=52906294&amp;oldid=52905425" rel="nofollow">[84]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:National_parks_of_Taiwan&amp;diff=52908330&amp;oldid=52906803" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:National_parks_of_Taiwan&amp;diff=52908330&amp;oldid=52906803" rel="nofollow">[85]</a>.</li>
<li>The problem with the flag images was identified. User:SchmuckyTheCat and user:Winhunter has refused to accept the fact that the replacement drive applies only when the .svg is an identical replacement (or satisfies official/legal specifications of the flag).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>With these problems I would like to request for reconsideration of the previous decision. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 20:25, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Relevant finding of fact: <b>Zeq cautioned regarding removal of well sourced information</b></p>
<dl>
<dt>Summation</dt>
</dl>
<p>Many reliable sources (such as those removed in the diff shown above, including Israeli and Palestinian government sources) demonstrate that <a href="../../../n/a/k/Nakba_Day_c7d2.html" title="Nakba Day">Nakba Day</a> is commemorated officially on 15 May and <a href="../../../y/o/m/Yom_Ha%27atzma%27ut_f47f.html" title="Yom Ha'atzma'ut">Israeli Independence Day</a> is celebrated on 14 May in the Gregorian calendar. Zeq insists these events are on the same day because some Nakba protests are held on the same day as Independence Day and he continually removes any reference to the dates on which they are officially (and actually) held. He also removes any reference to the description of Nakba Day as a commemoration of Palestinian dispossession and most other information that contradicts his assertions about the purpose and timing of this event. I hope you agree that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nakba_Day&amp;oldid=52183967" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nakba_Day&amp;oldid=52183967" rel="nofollow">this version of the article by Zeq</a> is <b>not</b> an encyclopedic improvement on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nakba_Day&amp;oldid=52155004" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nakba_Day&amp;oldid=52155004" rel="nofollow">this version</a>. Many appeals to Zeq on his talk page and the article talk page have been to no avail and I would like to request that he be banned from this article for tendentious editing and removal of well sourced information.</p>

<dd>There are actually four simultaneous revert wars going on here, each of which is with a different editor! This made it extremely disruptive for other editors to work on the article and around this warring. Many of these reverts are marked minor, and/or have no edit summary (a point which ArbCom determined was disruptive in his first ArbCom case). The wars focused on the infobox, his reverts will either individually or simultaneously revert one of these items:</dd>

<dd>A new article which seems to lack a point for its existance. Instantnood has found this another place to revert war. Two facts at war here:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Instantnood is insisting on removing ", People's Republic of China" from after the section heading for Hong Kong (every other city on the list has it's country after it). To the point that he put a dubious template on it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_Capitals&amp;diff=50934002&amp;oldid=50933830" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_Capitals&amp;diff=50934002&amp;oldid=50933830" rel="nofollow">[110]</a>. I have no idea what his justification for this kind of removal is. There is absolutely no question that Hong Kong is part of the PRC. This edit defies reality.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_Capitals&amp;diff=50631612&amp;oldid=50035370" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_Capitals&amp;diff=50631612&amp;oldid=50035370" rel="nofollow">[111]</a> and another 10 times or so. Instantnood keeps insisting (on several articles) that the ENTIRE OFFICIAL NAME "Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China" must be used, and cannot be broken up by wikilinks to "Special Administrative Region" and "People's Republic of China". So in order to provide such links (which are fairly important to put that wordy official name into context) he insists on duplicitious phrases like the first sentence in that diff, "The Hong Kong SAR of the PRC is an SAR of the PRC"</li>

<dd>Extremely POV re-org of an article, which is what ArbCom said is justification for page banning. Instantnood is removing this article from the category for administrative divisions of the PRC.

<dd>(response to user:SchmuckyTheCat posting at 00:29, May 2) I'm afraid I've to say it's not easy to assume user:SchmuckyTheCat is acting in good faith. He is not always presenting true facts, not to mention the entirety of the facts.
<p>The matter regarding Singapore is discussed at talk:Singapore <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Singapore&amp;oldid=51357842#City" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Singapore&amp;oldid=51357842#City" rel="nofollow">[120]</a>. The participants, including myself, have generally agreed that Singapore is an urban area (i.e. a <i>city</i> from the geographical perspective, cf. <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=51728012&amp;title=London#Defining_London" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=51728012&amp;title=London#Defining_London" rel="nofollow">London#Defining London</a> "</span> <i>The entire London urban area may be..</i> "), and (combined with the fact it's a sovereign state) a city-state. User:SchmuckyTheCat himself and the anonymous contributor are not participants of the discussion, and they are the only persons to have reverted my edit without any explanation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore&amp;diff=51083059&amp;oldid=51042266" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore&amp;diff=51083059&amp;oldid=51042266" rel="nofollow">[121]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore&amp;diff=51117721&amp;oldid=51096136" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore&amp;diff=51117721&amp;oldid=51096136" rel="nofollow">[122]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore&amp;diff=50956444&amp;oldid=50952597" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore&amp;diff=50956444&amp;oldid=50952597" rel="nofollow">[123]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore&amp;diff=50598108&amp;oldid=50595688" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore&amp;diff=50598108&amp;oldid=50595688" rel="nofollow">[124]</a>. For the scope of an encycloædia, city status is hardly merely legalese.

<p>User:SchmuckyTheCat boldly claimed above I'm not discussing about the image format of the flag and how the anthem should be presented with anybody. The real side of the fact is that it's discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHong_Kong&amp;diff=50734197&amp;oldid=50668602" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHong_Kong&amp;diff=50734197&amp;oldid=50668602" rel="nofollow">[125]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Winhunter&amp;oldid=51724869#Overdone_revert" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Winhunter&amp;oldid=51724869#Overdone_revert" rel="nofollow">[126]</a> (and I've also invited other wikipedians previously involved to join <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mcy_jerry&amp;diff=50721214&amp;oldid=50320687" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mcy_jerry&amp;diff=50721214&amp;oldid=50320687" rel="nofollow">[127]</a>). As for Mandarin vs. Putonghua, none of the participants talks about global recognition. They actually said <i>Putonghua</i> is not English (or not an English name), or asserted <i>Mandarin</i> is the natively used English name in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>User:SchmuckyTheCat has failed to demonstrate any evidence to justify his claim that the City of Victoria no longer exists.

<p>For the Pacific Rim capitals article, as explained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pacific_Rim_capitals&amp;oldid=51163223#Hong_Kong.27s_status" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pacific_Rim_capitals&amp;oldid=51163223#Hong_Kong.27s_status" rel="nofollow">[134]</a>, I'm not deleting the words " <i>People's Republic of China</i> ", nor am I denying the fact that Hong Kong is constitutionally " <i>an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China</i> ". I just meant to restore it according to how it was before the edits by the parties involved in the dispute, and let other people to decide how it should be presented. I've rephrased to better present its official full name and its status <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_capitals&amp;diff=50719197&amp;oldid=50717856" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_capitals&amp;diff=50719197&amp;oldid=50717856" rel="nofollow">[135]</a>, but it has been disregarded by user:SchmuckyTheCat and user:Alanmak in their subsequent reverts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_capitals&amp;diff=50805798&amp;oldid=50719197" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_capitals&amp;diff=50805798&amp;oldid=50719197" rel="nofollow">[136]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_capitals&amp;diff=50957761&amp;oldid=50934002" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_capitals&amp;diff=50957761&amp;oldid=50934002" rel="nofollow">[137]</a>.

For the list of tunnels, user:SchmuckyTheCat has disregarded the fact that user:Alanmak's edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_tunnels&amp;diff=42578652&amp;oldid=40547222" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_tunnels&amp;diff=42578652&amp;oldid=40547222" rel="nofollow">[138]</a> touched a debated issue. It's always a good thing to restore according to what these articles were like before the disputed edits, and therefore I'm restoring the article according to that, and according to how the material first appeared <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_tunnels&amp;diff=9305816&amp;oldid=9014925" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_tunnels&amp;diff=9305816&amp;oldid=9014925" rel="nofollow">[139]</a>.</p>
<p>Even worse was that user:SchmuckyTheCat himself had been reverting everything in my edits, including materials he doesn't disagree with, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong&amp;oldid=50646657&amp;diff=50648409" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong&amp;oldid=50646657&amp;diff=50648409" rel="nofollow">[140]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_capitals&amp;diff=50652554&amp;oldid=50649369" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Rim_capitals&amp;diff=50652554&amp;oldid=50649369" rel="nofollow">[141]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_indoor_arenas&amp;diff=50805965&amp;oldid=50794480" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_indoor_arenas&amp;diff=50805965&amp;oldid=50794480" rel="nofollow">[142]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_legislatures_by_country&amp;diff=50771435&amp;oldid=50741884" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_legislatures_by_country&amp;diff=50771435&amp;oldid=50741884" rel="nofollow">[143]</a>.

<dd>infinity0 does not understand the Wikipedia policy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources</a> According to the policy, the FAQ cannot be used as a secondary source. And, he doesn't understand the difference between a secondary and primary sources. Saying it can't be used as a secondary source means it cannot be used in articles as a credible source about the views of anarchists. It can only be used as a <i>primary source</i> --that is, it can be quoted to show that the FAQ says in an article about the faq (the <a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Anarchist_FAQ_95c9.html" title="An Anarchist FAQ">An Anarchist FAQ</a>) article. Administrators and others have agreed with me (See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Reliable_sources" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Reliable_sources" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Reliable_sources</a> talk page for the Reliable Sources article under "FAQs"). The Wikipedia policy says: "<i>A personal website or blog may be used only as a primary source, i.e., when we are writing about the subject or owner of the website. But even then we should proceed with great caution and should avoid relying on information from the website as a sole source. This is particularly true when the subject is controversial, or has no professional or academic standing. WP:V says: "Self-published sources... may be used only as sources of information on themselves, and only in articles about them. For example, the Stormfront website may be used as a source of information on itself in an article about Stormfront, so long as the information is notable, not unduly self-aggrandizing, and not contradicted by reliable, third-party published sources. Self-published sources may never be used as sources of information on another person or topic.</i>" According to administrator SlimVirgin, the section on "Personal websites" applies --the FAQ originates from a Geocities.com website, and whoever runs that website can put whatever he wants in the FAQ --it's not published and the authors are a mixture of unknown people are people with no academic qualifications. Administrator SlimVirgin announced a warning on an article where the FAQ was being cited: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAuberon_Herbert&amp;diff=50047917&amp;oldid=50028927" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAuberon_Herbert&amp;diff=50047917&amp;oldid=50028927" rel="nofollow">[149]</a> Also, the section on Partisan Websites appears to apply: "<i>Partisan political and religious (or anti-religious) sources should be treated with caution, although political bias is not in itself a reason not to use a source. Widely acknowledged extremist political, religious and other websites — for example, those belonging to Stormfront, Hamas, the Aryan Nations website or the Socialist Workers Party — should never be used as sources for Wikipedia, except as primary sources i.e. in articles discussing the opinions of that organization or the opinions of a larger like-minded group, but even then should be used with great caution, and should not be relied upon as a sole source.</i>" Fortunately, this policy helps protect against what has been happening: Someone has been putting original research into Wikipedia articles, then when a source is requested, he goes and puts the original research in the FAQ then comes back and cites it. It's fraudulent. The FAQ cannot be used a credible source for Wikipedia articles. I'm trying my best to keep Wikipedia information verifiable by credible sources.

<p>The FAQ is not a personal website. It is not being used as a secondary source. The FAQ represents anarchist opinion, and so "anarchists think &lt;cite FAQ&gt;" is primary.

<dd>It's not the website of any official organization. It's someone's website on Geocities. He edits that FAQ as he sees fit and it gets circulated around.

As a fellow party in the arbcom case where this ruling was given, I will not block Leyasu myself due to any possible conflicts of interest; but I <i>strongly</i> recommend blocking Leyasu for doing these reverts, particularly if the CheckUser case turns out confirmed, so that the ruling in the case will be upheld. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_Havaname_2e6d.html" title="User:Idont Havaname">Idont Havaname</a> (<a href="../../../i/d/o/User_talk%7EIdont_Havaname_2580.html" title="User talk:Idont Havaname">Talk</a>) 22:37, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Leyasu (aka Ley Shade) is currently serving a 48 hour block for a breach (not the first) of revert parole. I have recently been engaging with Leyasu in an effort to get them to work with others at Wikiproject metal and on other metal pages. However, such efforts have not been going too well recently and <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyouga_27f8.html" title="User:Ryouga">User:Ryouga</a> has just brought this to my attention:</p>
<p>"I am unsure to whom I should tell this to, but in case you didn't know IP address 86.143.126.71 has been vandalistically reverting all pages I have made any edits to, and I am convinced this is Ley Shade. S/he has reverted and vandalised all the pages I have made any edits to, and dirtied up the page again from previous cleanups. This was obviously done as an attack against me.

<p>After notifying Ryouga that I would bring this up here I then received the following message, apparently from Leyasu:</p>
<p>"This IP is me, the other i do not know, nor do i make a habit of getting in revert wars using IP Adresses.

<dd>The issue has been dealt with already, and i have sorted the problem with Ryouga myself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ryouga#Listed" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ryouga#Listed" rel="nofollow">[158]</a> after already explaining elsehwere the conditions of my violation, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48771166" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48771166" rel="nofollow">[159]</a>. I also requested for an extension to my block from the admin that served my 48 hour block <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ryouga#Listed" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ryouga#Listed" rel="nofollow">[160]</a> as is required by my violation. I also pointed out before that this is a one off to stem an all out flame war before it began, and that i already forsaw my extended ban and am willing to endure it to keep flame wars from even happening on Wikipedia. As such i ask this notice be stricken on the basis of the reasoning for violation. 86.132.133.113 00:59, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was a little uncertain on what to do when this began, so I did report the user. Currently we are amidst working this out so I just want to report that currently the issue is no longer serious.

<dd>Either way, the block that <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> set was still evaded by the IP address. Not only that, the IP address violated the 1RR set in Leyasu's arbcom case <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Children_of_Bodom&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48774995" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Children_of_Bodom&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48774995" rel="nofollow">[161]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Children_of_Bodom&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48887464" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Children_of_Bodom&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48887464" rel="nofollow">[162]</a>. So if the current block is being evaded, it should still be extended and applied to both Leyasu and the IP address, perhaps after we have done a CheckUser to confirm that it's Leyasu posting from that IP address (it's not fair to Leyasu if it's an impostor, for example). But since I was a party in the arbcom case, I think someone else should set the block, if it's necessary to set one (which, it would be, if Leyasu and 86.132.133.113 are the same user). I don't know if Ryouga has necessarily been baiting Leyasu to violate the ruling; if he has, then he should probably also be blocked. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_Havaname_2e6d.html" title="User:Idont Havaname">Idont Havaname</a> (<a href="../../../i/d/o/User_talk%7EIdont_Havaname_2580.html" title="User talk:Idont Havaname">Talk</a>) 21:05, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The edits made to the universities category was instead to restore undicussed POV reorganisation by user:SchmuckyTheCat and user:Huaiwei. Nobody insists that Hong Kong and Macao are not part of the People's Republic of China. Quite the opposite, I explicitly acknowledge the fact that they're, according to Article 1 in their basic laws, " <i>inalienable part[s] of the People's Republic of China</i> ". The disputed matter was that whether they're administrative divisions. User:SchmuckyTheCat should have made all these clear upon filing this request, and should not provide inaccurate or even false information, which might affect administrators' decisions.
<p>As for the edits to the article on the stadium (Estádio Campo Desportivo), cf. user:Jiang's comment at <a href="../../../h/o/n/Talk%7EHong_Kong_Time_fe77.html#my_edits" title="Talk:Hong Kong Time">#1</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/n/Talk%7EHong_Kong_Time_fe77.html#Hong_Kong.2C_China" title="Talk:Hong Kong Time">#2</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong_Time&amp;action=history&amp;offset=20060322210800&amp;limit=11&amp;dir=prev" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong_Time&amp;action=history&amp;offset=20060322210800&amp;limit=11&amp;dir=prev" rel="nofollow">#3</a>. It's also related to Macao's status, i.e. whether or not it's an administrative division and/or an ordinary subnational entity. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 21:07, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Now, some of these edits contain edit summaries stating that he will never cease and that no one on Wikipedia, not even Jimbo Wales, has the right to oppose him, just because of his claimed "expertise" in Bigfoot. This is contrary to many policies, including <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, among others. I have two points to make here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why hasn't Beckjord's ban timer been reset?</li>
<li>Given that Beckjord has openly opposed any "authority" on Wikipedia other than himself, doesn't this warrant a hard ban (per <a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIrate_d7f6.html" title="User:Irate"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Irate</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../i/r/a/User_talk%7EIrate_a604.html" title="User talk:Irate">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Irate_df54.html" title="Special:Contributions/Irate">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Irate_e70a.html" title="Special:Blockip/Irate">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>))?</li>

<p>I request enforcement of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Ultramarine_b82c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ultramarine">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ultramarine</a>, which applies only to <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_peace_theory.html" title="Democratic peace theory">Democratic peace theory</a> and one other article. This single editor has been consistently removing sourced statements, despite protests. Some of the material in question has been defended by multiple editors.(See <a href="../../../d/e/m/Talk%7EDemocratic_peace_theory_Archive_5_5125.html#1" title="Talk:Democratic peace theory/Archive 5">Talk:Democratic peace theory/Archive 5#1</a>. This practice was expressly deprecated by ArbCom; which required that we edit by consensus, without establishing private versions.</p>
<p>That these edits also suppress the majority of the work done in support of DPT in favor of three scholars who uphold an extreme position, and also criticism of that position, is, I suppose, merely a coincidence.</p>

<p>Septentrionalis seems to think he owes the article and that he decides the content. His version is selectively including mostly very old studies as a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> for the theory. While excluding recent supporting research, see <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_sandbox5_2282.html" title="User:Ultramarine/sandbox5">User:Ultramarine/sandbox5</a>. It was Septentrionalis who started doing edits again after Salix Alba asked for a slow-down, and yesterday he did a massive revert of many carefully explained changes. The article needs to be trimmed from excessive details from irrelevant studies done in the 70s and 80s, which also Salix Alba agrees on. However, since Septentrionalis resists this, I have now only added the recent research. As this recent research is the by far the best documented advantage of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a>, documenting the role of democracy in preventing wars, mass murder, and human rights violations, it is important that Wikipedia represents the current status correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have never claimed ownership of anything. Removal of sourced statements of fact without consensus is deprecated, and is a violation of the ArbCom decision in this case. Ultramarine's additions are (while it will take some time to look at them), welcome. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 15:34, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ultramarine has, as in the example above, been removing sources from the 1990's. The common element is not their age, but that they disagree with the three authors he chooses to support. Ultramarine claims below to be increasing the diversity of the sources by these removals; this is bizarre. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 15:26, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>My general point is that views of most researchers and their studies and arguments are not farily represented. It should also be noted that Septentrionalis has on several other articles constantly tried to exclude well-sourced advantages of democracy and related research. See for example this, where he deletes every sourced advantage of liberal democracy while keeping many claimed unsourced disadvantages.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liberal_democracy&amp;diff=45141465&amp;oldid=45116640" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liberal_democracy&amp;diff=45141465&amp;oldid=45116640" rel="nofollow">[298]</a> Or this, where he completely deletes the painstakingly made table regarding world-wide democracy from <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_House_082a.html" title="Freedom House">Freedom House</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Freedom_House&amp;diff=45886172&amp;oldid=45378579" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Freedom_House&amp;diff=45886172&amp;oldid=45378579" rel="nofollow">[299]</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_House_082a.html" title="Freedom House">Freedom House</a>, like several of Ultramarine's other edits, is a collection of cut-and-pastes. Most of the paragraphs are taken directly from various pages on FH's website. This is plagiarism, even where it is not copyvio. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 15:26, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Regarding Septentrionalis only supporter, Robert A <b>West</b>, he is real-world friend or relative of Septentrionalis. See their extensive collaborative editing of numerous <b><a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_West_3e8f.html" title="Baron West">Baron West</a></b> and <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_De_La_Warr_64af.html" title="Earl De La Warr">Earl De La Warr</a>.

<ul>
<li><i>Only supporter</i> is a falsehood; almost all the editors who has looked at the article have remarked on Ultramarine's PoV. Scaife objects to it more than I do (See <a href="../../../d/e/m/Talk%7EDemocratic_peace_theory_Archive_5_5125.html#35" title="Talk:Democratic peace theory/Archive 5">Talk:Democratic peace theory/Archive 5#35</a>.

<ul>
<li>Scaife has taken a break from the article for reasons stated in his talk page. Several editors have ceased attempting to edit after finding the experience of Ultramarine's POV-pushing frustrating. That is not good for the project.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 16:31, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ultramarine has made this portentous statemtent before. Does this have a point? What offense is he suggesting? (A question he has never bothered to answer.)

<li>Ultramarine is repeatedly speculating about the real names and relationships of two demonstrably distinct editors. So far as I know, collaboration is not forbidden, it is encouraged. I saw no pledge to avoid working with friends (or relatives for that matter) when I joined.

<dd>For my part I got driven away from editing the DPT article by the actions of both Ultramarine and Septrionalis.

<dd>That settlement would have been, if not desirable, acceptable.

The recent research after around 2000, see <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_sandbox5_2282.html" title="User:Ultramarine/sandbox5">User:Ultramarine/sandbox5</a>, is ignored.

<dd>I'll be honest: I don't have the foggiest idea of whether or not someone's in the wrong here. The subject matter is way too confusing to me. If I was the only admin, I'd probably block you both again for sterile revert warring. A week for each revert is the maximum permitted, that could add up rather quickly. I strongly recommend you both stop editing the article, and if you don't quit it then I will ask the ArbCom to make an additional motion banning you from the article. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 22:01, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Septentrionalis obviously does not like that others correct the strange anti-democratic text he had created and guarded during several months.

<dd>The finding of fact in the arbcom decision was the maintaining of two separate and parallel versions which was reverted between. This is not the the case now. I will not again participate in having two separate and parallel versions. This was a mistake and the arbcom decision successfully prevents this. I think that the recent edits have created a much more correct article without having two different version. So I think that the arbcom decision has been very successful.</dd>

<dd>I think that if you examine the edits since I started edited the article again, there has not been sterile edit wars. Instead numerous findings from recent studies has been added, adding the view of the majority of the researchers in this field. Something Pmanderson almost completely ignored in the text he had created during several months of unilateral editing and which selectively described the view of the critics. So there has not been sterile wars, but instead a constructive improvement, adding the view of the other side. Again, the maintaining of two separate and parallel versions was a mistake, which I regret. However, this is not the case now and I think that if the recent edits are examined it will be found that the article has been improved by also adding the view of the other side. <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 13:21, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This kid has been trying desperately to get me banned from Wikipedia, just because he doesn't like my edits. He's been harrassing me, and even stalking me to articles he doesn't even edit to delete my edits simply because they are mine (he even admitted it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AInfinity0&amp;diff=47593081&amp;oldid=47575440" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AInfinity0&amp;diff=47593081&amp;oldid=47575440" rel="nofollow">[314]</a>), so I can't even avoid him if I try. He knows I'm on probation (which in my opinion, I should not be on --the arbitrators are apparently over-worked and didn't take the time to verify the charges against me), and so as a result he has been trying to take advantage of that probation (especially the vague "tendentious editing" probation). He's making claims of "tendentious editing" and POV hoping that administrators will see that I'm on probation, assume I'm the bad guy and give him the benefit of the doubt. Please do not fall for it. I am, and have always been, dedicated to providing sourceable information and writing in an NPOV manner; I'm even more careful about it now that I'm on probation. He's posted to the Administrator's Noticboard/Incidents several times to try to get me banned. This is just an extension of edit warring on his part. Instead of dealing with the sourced information I bring to the table that conflicts with his POV, he resorts to trying to take advantage of my probation, and the prejudice it tends to create in a person's mind about me when they see that I'm on probation, to try to get me banned. He's extremely unethical. Thanks for taking the time to understand. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 02:23, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, note that I am banned from editing the Administrator's noticeboard for 3 months. This is a result of me defending myself against similar charges from infinity0. It's inexplicable why I was banned from there by Essjay. All I can think of is he saw I was on probation and, from that, assumed I was the bad guy and should not be allowed to respond to the harrassment from infinity0. Or maybe he thinks I got a little too heated in my defense. Go figure. But, I am tired of being harrassed by infinity0. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 02:38, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I banned you from ANI after consulting with quite a few other admins; you were disruptively commenting all over the noticeboard. You then proceeded to make personal attacks against myself and several others, and a two week general ban was applied. I moved this report here in good faith, under the assumption that you'd learned your lesson and would follow the rules; instead, I'm rewarded with further attacks on my character. I'm beginning to think another Arbitration case should be considered sooner rather than later. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 11:05, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think that's true. As far as I know, I didn't make a personal attack against anyone. I'm certain that I didn't make one against you. I would really like to see quotes of this.

<p>RJII, you think you are without fault. You are on probation for a reason. I report you for many reasons. I have made this request based on things you have done, not things you have not done. You have repeatedly turned around my criticisms onto me. Stop acting like you are the victim. You have been very aggressive on many articles you edit, and it is impossible to build consensus with you. You ignore other editors' comments, not just mine, and you carry along editing the article as you see fit without taking into account even remotely the possibility that your edits are bad. You need to correct this attitude. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 10:24, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just for the record, I must say that I agree with most of RJII edits on the “An Anarchist FAQ”. Also, it seems to me that infinity0 is really trying to make it easier for himself to push through his point of view in this and other articles by banning his main ideological opponent. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 13:01, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I tend to agree with Vision Thing for the most part, but I'm blocking him for 24 hours for being markedly discourteous.

<dd>Just for the record. I disagree that there was anything "discourteous." I think you're really making a stretch with that.

<li>editing articles (recently) from which C. is banned: e.g., <a href="../../../d/e/v/Developed_country.html" title="Developed country">developed country</a>;</li>

<p>As an editor of some of these articles, and not necessarily a policeman of them, I find Cantus' behaviour wholly frustrating and counterproductive. And, despite prior sanction and warnings, it doesn't seem that Cantus is either willing or able to modify his behaviour. I request that this editor's behaviour be reviewed and, as prescribed in the ArbCom ruling, that some corrective actions be taken; <s>in the very least, the article recently moved (point 4) should be returned to its prior locale.</s><i>(NOTE: I believe this has been dealt with for now.)</i> Thanks.

<p>I believe these are sockpuppets of this user ... for which <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Cantus_3_b823.html#Sockpuppets_and_reverts" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Cantus 3">C. was also sanctioned by the ArbCom regarding (remedy 4)</a>. This is untenable. I'm unsure how to proceed; however, this behaviour – which I'm led to believe is all from same user and not just coincidence – requires further investigation and that added corrective measures be contemplated if necessary.

<p>He has violated these restrictions and has had his 12 month period reset on December 23, 2005 see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive58#User_RK" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive58#User_RK" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive58#User_RK</a></p>

On January 15, 2006 he violated those restrictions again and was blocked for 4 days and had his 12 month period reset.

<p>On May 25, 2006 he violated these restrictions again and was blocked for 3 days and his 12 month ban reset.

<p>This is his 5th violaton, I am therefore blocking him for one week and reseting the 12 month period. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 03:22, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is not insulting to say that Zapatancas is SquealingPig nor have I been censored for saying so, for Zapatancas to claim that the accusation is false is not credible. i was blocked for making attacks against Zapatancas for not stating that he was SquealingPig and his refusall to acknowledge tyhe truth doesnt mean I am attacking him which I am not. By claiming that I am making a false accusation i could equally claim tyhat Zapatancas has broken his no attack parole by claiming that I am making a false claim when I am not but as it is Zapatancas is the one harrassing me and not me him, ie see his two further complaints below. All I want is for him and his friend Hagiographer to leave me alone, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:15, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>SqueakBox is placed on personal attack parole with a decision that explicitly states that "This remedy is to be interpreted broadly to include unwarranted assumptions of bad faith".

<p>I believe that <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkanking_aa8d.html" title="User:Skanking">User:Skanking</a> is a sock puppet of SqueakBox. It was created in April, when the case against SqueakBox had already been posted. His user page is very similar to that of SqueakBox and so are his edits, related to subject like Honduras <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Honduras" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Honduras" rel="nofollow">[321]</a> or La Ceiba <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=La_Ceiba&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50781371" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=La_Ceiba&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50781371" rel="nofollow">[322]</a> or Zapatero <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62021589" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62021589" rel="nofollow">[323]</a>. He probably created it to avoid the one month ban imposed on him by the arbitration committee. The message below (Ras Bily is the sign of <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkanking_aa8d.html" title="User:Skanking">User:Skanking</a>), posted in the arbitration enforcemente although it does not belong here as I'm not affected by any arbcom decision adds aditional evidence.

<p>Absolute paranoia by this strange user. I am not SqueakBox, he got on my watchlist today because he left me a message ages back and I spotted that Hagiographer was persistently vandalising Squeak's user page. because I revetrted him he calls me Squeak's sockpuppet. How daft. And his insinuation that only Squeak would want to edit Honduras articles is frankly insulting to a Central American like myself, as if only gringos would want to or have the right to edit pages on Central America and Honduras, a country I know well being from Belize and working on the boats when I were a young man, thus knowing Ceiba where I had a girlfriend and many sweet memories. This guy Hagiographer really seems to have a problem, makes me for one not want to have anything to do with wikipedia again. Its only a bit of fun but this guy seems seriously enloquecido and I dont want to be dealing with a peligroso, siendo ya viejo. If Hagiographer doesnt want his behaviour commented on he should not have edited here in the first place. Any fool can he see he is a zapatancas sockpuppet only created to harrass squeakbox. yuck! <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkanking_aa8d.html" title="User:Skanking">Ras Billy I</a> 18:28, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fuinally I would add that were I the sockpuppet of squeakbox I would not have revealed myself to repair squeak's page, he could have done that himself. It would make no sense if I were his sockpuppet to reveal myself. But it seems that logic isnt Zapatancas strongpoint, suele ser con los hablantes de ese idioma. <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkanking_aa8d.html" title="User:Skanking">Ras Billy I</a> 18:32, 13 July 2006 (UTC) <i>Italic text</i></p>

<p>Guy Montag should be banned from the <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deir_Yassin_Massacre_eb47.html" title="Deir Yassin Massacre">Deir Yassin Massacre</a> article, and the unilateral move should be undone due to lack of consensus for that move and votestaking.

<dd>I'm not getting involved on the move and re-write; that's a content issue of which I really can't judge. However, his behavior in rallying votes on the issue, and the "broken record barnstar" he posted on the Talk page were clearly disruptive.

<p>After disputes that arose at CfD, where I was the closer, I became aware of the issue(s). I did my best to resolve the conflict as an independent party, and thus became an involved party.</p>
<p>These pages were fully annotated (by me) with legal and historical references. Apparently, SPUI is some kind of wiki-lawyer, without formal legal experience.</p>
<p>I am not a member of the Canadian bar, but I'm reasonably sure that the usual common law and statutory construction still apply there.</p>
<p>I request a block of at least 1 month, as I see that blocks of days and weeks have happened in the recent past.</p>

<dd>While WAS warring isn't acceptable he also is not the one on probation here. SPUI shouldn't be getting any further "warnings" or "chances". He's breaking the rules of his probation and as such should be blocked. If it were me or Rschen warring I would expect no less. But we're not we've backed off of these disputes and are respecting and abiding by the Arbcom.

Because if admins aren't going to enforce the probation (which you can't argue you did violate earlier) then it obviously doesn't mean squat and the parties aren't really subject to it any longer. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyBGood_3156.html" title="User:JohnnyBGood"><font color="green"><b>JohnnyBGood</b></font></a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnnyBGood_d6fd.html" title="User talk:JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>t</b></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JohnnyBGood_a89f.html" title="Special:Contributions/JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>c</b></font></a> <b>VIVA!</b> 21:03, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

At <a href="../../../c/a/s/WT%7ECASH_48cf.html" title="WT:CASH">WT:CASH</a> SPUI has begun changing all articles to use his {{Infobox CA Route}} infobox despite the consensus to use the current one {{<a href="../../../r/o/u/Template%7ERouteboxca2_2dc9.html" title="Template:Routeboxca2">routeboxca2</a>}}... and he tagged all articles with {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-infobox_a240.html" title="Template:Cleanup-infobox">cleanup-infobox</a>}} to enlist the public in his crusade... does that amount to "disruption"?

<dd>For what it's worth, he's done the same thing to articles in <a href="../../../w/i/s/Category%7EWisconsin_state_highways_d45e.html" title="Category:Wisconsin state highways">Category:Wisconsin state highways</a>. The Wisconsin DOT does use the "State Trunk Highway XX" format officially, but <i>almost nobody else</i> uses it, and even the DOT often uses "WIS XX" in public documents (see <a href="http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/definitions.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/definitions.html" rel="nofollow">[330]</a>). Furthermore, if it is his opinion that these articles should be renamed to use the "State Trunk Highway" designation, I see no reason why he would modify all links to other Wisconsin highways in the articles to the Highway XX (Wisconsin) format, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wisconsin_State_Highway_16&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64845123" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wisconsin_State_Highway_16&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64845123" rel="nofollow">[331]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wisconsin_State_Highway_11&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64881917" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wisconsin_State_Highway_11&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64881917" rel="nofollow">[332]</a> for examples. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/y/User_talk%7EBryanG_f39b.html" title="User talk:BryanG">(talk)</a></sup> 22:06, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What is the real status of the state highway dispute? Has the RfA gone final and <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> just ignored it, or is it still in dispute? I'm not going to create any more Tennessee state articles until this is settled. SPUI is <i>very</i> knowledgable about transportation issues and in many ways a valuable resource to Wikipedia, but this has really gotten to be <i>beyond</i> ridiculous IMO, not because that anyone who disagrees with me is ridiculous or even necessarily wrong, but just because of all of the productive man-hours that could have been used doing good things that have been devoted to this issue instead. <a href="../../../r/l/q/User%7ERlquall_e541.html" title="User:Rlquall">Rlquall</a> 01:01, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is his third disruptive highway warring in the last week per the two cases below. He has already been warned to follow his probation on at least one previous occasion and has obviously not taken it to heart. I too am subject to the same probation and if he isn't required to follow the arbcom's decision then what is the point of Arbcom at all?</p>

TDC, rather than a block under your revert parole I'm putting you on notice. Please place objections to edits by other editors on the talk page and avoid multiple removals of new material such as the two I cite here.

<dd>As for the <a href="../../../f/s/l/FSLN_6da0.html" title="FSLN">FSLN</a> article, I apologize if I misunderstood; I didn't realize that <a href="../../../n/r/c/User%7ENrcprm2026_854a.html" title="User:Nrcprm2026">James</a>, or <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESeparateIssue_9934.html" title="User:SeparateIssue">SeparateIssue</a>, or <a href="../../../f/i/e/User%7EFieldlab_eba7.html" title="User:Fieldlab">Fieldlab</a> had not edited the article in question.</dd>
<dd>What about the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Fonseca_4572.html" title="Carlos Fonseca">Carlos Fonseca</a> article? To give you a summary, I deleted from the introduction claims of Fonseca being a KGB agent, retaining them in another section ("Early Years"). This was reverted by <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Torturous Devastating Cudgel</a> saying noone notable is disputing it. In my view, allegations such as this need notable backing and not notable disputing. And as far as I know the only backing is from a book by Mitrokhin. If there are other references that he was a KGB agent, they should be introduced in the article (and I will of course accept them)</dd>

<dd>There isn't really space or time here to get into content and verifiability, but "nobody notable is disputing it" sounds very weak to me for such a claim.

<dd>TDC has a long history of this (backed up by his Admin pal, Mongo). He seems not to have moderated his behavior, despite many warnings.

<dd>recreation of deleted material. The category Instantnood is reverting to was deleted - twice. The category existed in a limbo state because CfD didn't delete it a year or so ago but it did not have a proper purpose co-existing with Companies of the PRC. I noticed it's been empty for a while (two months based on what 'nood reverted to) so put an orphan tag on it. 'nood objected to the orphan delete, then re-created it after deletion, then it was nominated again, and deleted again by a different admin. So instead of recreating the category (which still had no articles), he restored the articles to the redlink category (presumably hoping someone else would click it and hit save?).</dd>

<dd>These are the same edit wars he has been banned for before. Just different articles. As I've claimed before, I think some of the long term ones are on a schedule.</dd>
<dd>I was not involved in the move war. I reverted the Newspaper categories. I also reverted the company articles (because he put the articles in the category, but didn't recreate the category a third time). I did not remove these articles from his preferred category in the first instance (but I'm sure I have done some similar companies in the past).</dd>

<dd>re: hangon tag. From my memory, I put on db-empty, it was deleted, 'Nood responded by recreating and putting on the hangon tag (fair enough, actually, speedy deletes should be reviewable, even post fact of deletion). But didn't remove the hangon tag when he was done (as it states you should). So he was able to put forth an argument against a speedy delete, and it was deleted again. His argument was heard and presumably considered. (and if he wants it reviewed again <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>.)</dd>
<dd>What is subterfuge and acting against policies, was then re-populating the category in the articles, but not actually re-creating the category. That is just some sort of lateral move of the lost argument to a new battleground. That is what makes this worth enforcement. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 22:09, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The article is literally loaded with copyvio's, for time constraint, I only will show the evidence for the first three section, and that can be found here: <a href="http://www.kimvdlinde.com/wikipedia/Deir_Yassin_Copyright_violation.doc" class="external free" title="http://www.kimvdlinde.com/wikipedia/Deir_Yassin_Copyright_violation.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.kimvdlinde.com/wikipedia/Deir_Yassin_Copyright_violation.doc</a> The remaining two sections are done in part, and could be good or bad with regard to the number of copyvio's. What is clear is that the copyvio's are from various websites, and in part from pre Guy Montag (inserted by others), although all new insertions that I found originate from him. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 02:50, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This edit war by Ian is after he was cautioned by ArbCom not to edit war and use dispute resolution to resolve disputes.

<dd>I find this appeal to the enforcement of Arbitration by <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Pitchford_f7f8.html" title="User:Ian Pitchford">Ian Pitchford</a> to be a bad faith attempt to gain an unfair advantage in a content dispute, over an editor who has been sanctioned in the past. As <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> notes, multiple editors have resisted Ian's attempt to change a long-standing consensus.

<dd>Yes, while the summaries are a bit vague, I can cite many more from many authors, including yourself, who have used vague and even very much inapproperiate edit tags. His "fix" was removing your supposed "fix" that was more like widespread catastrophe. Since you introduced your own "cleanup" tags and proposals for "renamings" without initiating a discussion with anyone involved in the project or its pages, it is only fair that the tags be removed. As with one such incident, I labeled my edit summary: <i>Removing SPUI tag.</i> <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 13:18, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Both SPUI and Rschen7754 need to stop. SPUI got 31 hours for edit-warring, which was quite nice to SPUI, if I do say so myself. While the infractions are not the same (SPUI edit-warred, while you did site-wide changes), but I find both just as disruptive. You're nitpicking over the issue. Since you can't move the articles, you're changing the terminology in links and within the article. For everyone's sake, <b>stop it.</b> I'm blocking Rschen7754 for 31 hours as per the precedent above, though I think both of you deserved 2-3 day blocks. SPUI, if you revert during Rschen7754's block, I will block you without warning, and it'll certainly be for longer than 31 hours. Rschen7754, if you continue these edits after your block, I will do the same. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 03:30, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm quite concerned with how <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> handled his reverts of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ohio_State_Highways_6bb9.html" title="List of Ohio State Highways">List of Ohio State Highways</a> page. I moved the page from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_numbered_highways_in_Ohio_7b8a.html" title="List of numbered highways in Ohio">List of numbered highways in Ohio</a> for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of state highway pages are in the <i>List of {state} State Highway</i> naming convention.</li>
<li><i>List of numbered highways in Ohio</i> seems to be quite lengthy for something that should be short and to the point.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm aiming for uniformity here.</p>
<p>Instead of discussing the matter first, SPUI reverts a days worth of work on three pages, a template, and a main article page. I find this very unfair and unbecoming of a user who is still fighting his revert charges.</p>
<p>Along with that, SPUI wishes to delete the <a href="../../../o/h/_/Template%7EOH_Highways_1f01.html" title="Template:OH Highways">Template:OH Highways</a> page, which I had to painstakingly assemble (and was not even complete). His reasoning was not very clear at all. My reasonings for doing this was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the huge amount of clutter on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_numbered_highways_in_Ohio_7b8a.html" title="List of numbered highways in Ohio">List of numbered highways in Ohio</a>, which has a horribly dated design, non-user friendly interface, and is not uniform with other state highway projects.</li>
<li>Seperate the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_numbered_highways_in_Ohio_7b8a.html" title="List of numbered highways in Ohio">List of numbered highways in Ohio</a> page into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Interstate_Highways_in_Ohio_49fd.html" title="List of Interstate Highways in Ohio">List of Interstate Highways in Ohio</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_U.S._Highways_in_Ohio_29aa.html" title="List of U.S. Highways in Ohio">List of U.S. Highways in Ohio</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_State_Highways_in_Ohio_e8df.html" title="List of State Highways in Ohio">List of State Highways in Ohio</a> to conform with other state highway projects, such as <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_State_Highways_0f8a.html" title="West Virginia State Highways">West Virginia State Highways</a>. This reduces the main page clutter and page size, and presents the user with an easier navigating interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm trying for some uniformity here, much as what SPUI is asking for the route/highway designations. Instead of seeing this, he reverted it, undid all of my work and other user contributions, and is taking all of this one big step back for the sake of having "his way" once again. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 05:29, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> has struck again with the vandalism at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Routes_in_Vermont_2959.html" title="List of Routes in Vermont">List of Routes in Vermont</a>. I categorized the page into Interstates, U.S. Routes, and State Routes, with a sub for Decommissioned and Named Routes. This cleaned up the page considerably, since the old format was cluttered, unreadable, and very... spartan. It was a dated design and non-user friendly, and this puts the page in compliance with other state highway projects. See my original comment just above.</dd>
<dd>His lack of an adequate reason is just another way of "getting his way."

<dd>It is degrading into an edit war. SPUI reverted the page once again, claiming that VT F5 did not exist. Instead of doing a simple edit to the table to add the route, he reverted the page. Mind you, VT F5 did exist in the table in the <b>new version</b>, so SPUI is pushing around some excuse to revert the page. Note that I will not engage in an edit war, as my rule of thumb is take it to discussion (which is here, linked from the talk page of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Routes_in_Vermont_2959.html" title="List of Routes in Vermont">List of Routes in Vermont</a>) after two reverts. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 06:09, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This users problems with me seemed to have arose after i reverted a vandalistic blanking of a page which they performed. I don't know the argument between this user, or the user he/she is referring to, nor do i wish to be part of their argument.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I ask the user kindly to not vandalise articles by blanking, or vandalise my user page, an action which this user has redone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am under the impression this user seems to dislike working with others, or having others views represented. The article in which i changed was for poor grammer and wording, and vague comments. I reworded them to make them easier to understand, an action i have performed on many articles in the past.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have been using Wikipedia long enough to know what Vandalism is, mostly from reading what a user posted on my discussion page. From what i understand, maliciously deleting segments of an article is Vandalism, an action which this user, Deathrocker, performed.</dd>

<dd>I am only here to make my side of things clear. I hope this is taken into consideration in light of this user's very one sided view to his/her peers. VandalismCorrector.</dd>

<p>1. I reverted blankings by an anon, that happened before the user. This was stated before, as the anon had blanked a large number of articles, similar to what Deathrocker had done before starting this sherade. I have had no connection to the user Deathrocker is claiming i reverted.</p>
<p>2. Once again, i was reverting a blanking by an anon that came before the other users edit. As there had been multiple edits since that point, i was forced to do it in pieces. Deathrocker has chosen to manipulate links to show what he wants, which is easily disproven by looking at the articles history page.</p>
<p>3.4.5.6. Once again, the user has manipulated links. If the articles edit historys are checked, i made several edits on all the articles in pieces, against an ip adress that had blanked sections before.</p>
<p>I do not understand why this user Deathrocker is attacking me for reverting them after they blanked an article, or why they feel they must manipulate links and lie to get me into some form of amendment for actions i have not even performed. Despite this, checking our contributions and the mentioned articles history pages reveals a very different story to what this user is saying.</p>
<p>I find it also notable that from looking at this users contributions, that they seem to not work well with their peers. The Aiden article has seen large amounts of reverts of any edit, minor and large, by Deathrocker, whenever somebody made an edit that deleted or reestablised sections that this user added or removed.</p>
<p>I still do not wish to be part of whatever argument this user has against working with others, and i once again ask this user to just leave me in piece and to stop harrasing me and other users for reverting them when they maliciously blank sections of an article. VandalismCorrecter.</p>

<dd>VandalismCorrecter, if you feel that other users are "manipulating links" to make a case against you, you might find it beneficial to your case if you provided some links of your own. Unfortunately, you cannot, because I have checked the histories of the articles in question, and there is not a single blanking edit that I can find that you have reverted. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 21:02, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The edits i reverted where from a string i followed. I found an ip adress that had blanked the gothic metal article some time ago. I followed their user contributions and checked up on several articles history. I found in many of the articles that partial reverts had been done. Because of this, and valuable edits made after the lost information, i slavaged the lost information and replaced it in its former place.</p>
<p>Would you also be so kind as to explain how i may post my own links, as i am not overly educated in the use of html code. Thank you. VandalismCorrecter.</p>

He is banned from editing those articles, and on probation with regard to disruptive behavior on talk pages, where he remains an active contributor. The final decision in their case is here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Terryeo/Proposed_decision" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Terryeo/Proposed_decision" rel="nofollow">[423]</a>. I was one of numerous editors who provided testimony to the ArbCom.</p>
<p>I have had some positive exchanges with Terryeo recently, so am reluctant to point this out, but this recent bit of talk page disruption is so egregious that I believe he should, at least, receive a reminder from an adminstrator that what he is doing is not acceptible. On Image_talk:Superpowerbldg.jpg (his is the very first post on the page), Terryeo blatantly misrepresents a copyrightholder's release so as promote his contention that Wikipedia is biased against Scientology.</p>
<p>The image author, Andreas Heldal-Lund, who runs the "Xenu.net" website, writes on his site: "Critics of the Church of Scientology (CoS), including Wikipedia which is NPOV, are free to use images and text on this site that are made by me if proper credits are given."</p>
<p>Terryeo wrote on Image_talk:Superpowerbldg.jpg: "Isn't that interesting&#160;? Andreas Heldal-Lund apparently owned the photo and so, got to make a statement. He said: Critics of the Church of Scientology (CoS), including Wikipedia .. are free to use images and text on this site (xenu.net site). Isn't that interesting. Andreas Heldal-Lund gives Wikipedia permission to use the photo because Wikipedia is a critic of the Church of Scientology, according to Andreas Heldal-Lund. Terryeo 09:20, 6 August 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>I don't think draconian measures are required, but I do think that such hijinks should not be permitted to pass without notice.</p>

<p>PS: As is spelled out in detail on Image_talk:Superpowerbldg.jpg: 1. Heldal-Lund is not a native English speaker, thus some awkward sentence construction is hardly unexpected. 2. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroidCat_71d5.html" title="User:AndroidCat">AndroidCat</a> has stated that he emailed Heldal-Lund, asking him to add the line specifically granting Wikipedians access to his content, despite the fact that Wikipedia is not a "critics" site. Undaunted by these facts, Terryeo continues to amplify his claims about the bad faith of Wikipedia with regards to Scientology, and to generally engage in disruptive behavior. -- <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 16:50, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BTfromLA's lately added paragraph which states information is untrue in that at no point have I stated nor implied anything about Wikipedia with regards to Scientology except to express confidence that Wikipedia's policies will always result, in the end, in a good presentation of information. BTfromLA's statement that I have claimed <i>bad faith of Wikipedia</i> is a personal attack and untrue. I have made statements on the page he specifies, those statements address Heldal-Lund's statement which appears there. If BTfromLA is unable to read the printed word to understand what it says, and present it as stated, he certainly should engage in more user discussion rather than misrepresent the stated word here. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 18:22, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh good. BTfromLA posted to my user page but didn't spell out what he was talking about. Now I see what he is talking about. Yes, I certainly made that posting to that article's <b>discussion page</b>. I idiomatically reproduced the text under the image from the article, selecting the portions of the text which make my point and leaving out some information between commas, qualifiers, etc. to produce exactly what Heldal-Lund said about Wikipedia. Which is, "Wikipedia is a critic of the Church of scientology" (according to Heldal-Lund). That is exactly what he states there. And I find that to be quite interesting. Which attitude also explains why he has a link on the front page of his personal website to Wikipedia. Quite interesting.

<dd>While Terryeo is correct that the controversy about the photo has cooled, this does not alter the fact that Terryeo was engaging in gratuitously disruptive behavior when opening the discussion as he did, omitting the key phrase in the license when he quoted it, and pursuing his position that Heldal-Lund believed Wikipedia to be "a critic" of Scientology against all evidence. He also issued a flurry of charges that various editors, myself included, had been personally attacking him. In my case, at least, this was untrue, as I believe the administrators will conclude. As to his assertions about the "bad faith of Wikipedia"--a characterization with which he takes issue--Terryeo's comments can be understood in terms of his repeated, longstanding claims (currently posted on his user pages: <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">User:Terryeo</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_subpage1_3d00.html" title="User:Terryeo/subpage1">User:Terryeo/subpage1</a> ) that many if not most of the Wikipedia editors who work on Scientology articles are people whom the Church of Scientology has "expelled and declared to be suppressive (to freedom of religion)" who "wear black hats" and "do not wish to have the subject presented in a neutral sort of way." He claims that "this activity is the result of Wikipedia's editing policy. It is not likely to change. Its form suggests the situation might grow more extreme over time, instead of the articles growing more factual over time." <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 17:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that this is horribly incivil, but the provocation from Zaphnathpaaneah is unacceptable as well. If Deeceevoice is blocked (I'm not doing it now as it appears it's mainly over, but I don't oppose such a block), I suggest that Zaphnathpaaneah get a similar punishment. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 04:28, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Deeceevoice is not rascist, I would testify to that without hesistation in a court of law based solely on her behaviour at wikipedia, and I think those who claim she is are the more likely to be suffering from that sickness themselves, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 04:02, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whether or not deeceevoice has behaved unreasonably was settled by her arbcom case (ruling: she has). This is the enforcement page. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">Justforasecond</a> 22:37, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
