<p>Each state has its own rules which are the ultimate authority concerning admission to its bar. Generally, admission to a bar requires that the candidate do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earn a <a href="../../../j/u/r/Juris_Doctor_dd74.html" title="Juris Doctor">Juris Doctor</a> from a <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_school.html" title="Law school">law school</a> approved by that state (often, but not always, this means accredited by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Bar_Association_b11f.html" title="American Bar Association">American Bar Association</a>); or, where permitted, participate in an approved Law Clerk program ("reading the law").</li>
<li>Pass a state-administered <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_examination.html" title="Bar examination">bar examination</a>. Usually this consists of several parts administered over two or three days, typically including:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multistate_Bar_Examination_b833.html" title="Multistate Bar Examination">Multistate Bar Examination</a> (MBE), in all states except <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington.html" title="Washington">Washington</a>, with <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> as another exception;</li>
<li>A <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_responsibility.html" title="Professional responsibility">professional responsibility</a> ("ethics") exam, usually the <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multistate_Professional_Responsibility_Examination_5941.html" title="Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination">Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination</a> (MPRE);</li>
<li>State-specific examinations, such as essays in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington.html" title="Washington">Washington</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be certified (usually by the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_bar_association.html" title="State bar association">state bar association</a>) as having the good moral character and fitness to practice law.</li>
<li>Apply to that state's authority responsible for licensing lawyers and pay required fees. Upon approval by that authority, the admittee takes an oath to comply with the rules governing the practice of law in that state, and receives a certificate of admission.</li>
<li>Some jurisdictions have additional educational requirements; however, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuing_Legal_Education_e50f.html" title="Continuing Legal Education">Continuing Legal Education</a> (CLE) is generally a matter of license renewal, not admission.</li>

<p><a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> offers the <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_privilege.html" title="Diploma privilege">diploma privilege</a> for admission to the state bar. Graduates of ABA-accredited law schools in the state—currently, the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquette_University_Law_School_c5bb.html" title="Marquette University Law School">Marquette University Law School</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_Law_School_2ac4.html" title="University of Wisconsin Law School">University of Wisconsin Law School</a>—may obtain admission to the bar of Wisconsin through the diploma privilege without taking any examination. To qualify for the diploma privilege, the graduate must have met <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/sc/scrule/DisplayDocument.html?content=html&amp;seqNo=19684" class="external text" title="http://www.wicourts.gov/sc/scrule/DisplayDocument.html?content=html&amp;seqNo=19684" rel="nofollow">certain criteria</a> with regard to the courses taken in law school and the graduate's performance in those courses. Law graduates seeking the diploma privilege must still meet the state's character and fitness requirements.</p>
<p>Graduates of out-of-state law schools, even if they are Wisconsin residents, must still take the Wisconsin bar exam to be admitted in Wisconsin. Likewise, graduates of Wisconsin law schools must take the bar exam for other states in which they are going to practice.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_86db.html" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> launched the <a href="http://www.piercelaw.edu/websterscholar/" class="external text" title="http://www.piercelaw.edu/websterscholar/" rel="nofollow">Daniel Webster Scholar Honors Program</a>, an alternative bar certification program, at the state's only law school, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Pierce_Law_Center_b0a7.html" title="Franklin Pierce Law Center">Franklin Pierce Law Center</a>. Students apply to the program during the spring of their 1L (first) year, and only 25 are accepted annually. Webster Scholars go through an intensive, practice-based program under the supervision of New Hampshire judges, attorneys, and bar examiners. Students who graduate from the program are exempt from taking the New Hampshire bar examination, although they must still pass the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination and also meet character and fitness requirements. The first class of Webster Scholars will graduate in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2008.html" title="2008">2008</a>.</p>
<p>A number of U.S. states do not grant reciprocal admission for attorneys who obtained their bar admission through the diploma privilege, requiring those attorneys to take that state's bar exam, regardless of the length of that attorney's practice.</p>
<p><a name="Reciprocity_.28Admission_by_Motion_Without_Examination.2C_Admission_by_Comity.29" id="Reciprocity_.28Admission_by_Motion_Without_Examination.2C_Admission_by_Comity.29"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Admission_to_the_bar_in_the_United_States_0fa0.html" title="Edit section: Reciprocity (Admission by Motion Without Examination, Admission by Comity)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reciprocity (Admission by Motion Without Examination, Admission by Comity)</span></h3>
<p>Many states allow for <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reciprocal.html" title="Reciprocal">reciprocal</a> admission to the bar of that state if an individual is licensed to practice in another state and has actively practiced law for a number of years. Depending on the state, there may be limitations on reciprocity, such as requiring a minimum score on the <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multistate_Professional_Responsibility_Examination_5941.html" title="Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination">Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination</a> (MPRE), or even that the applicant have taken a bar examination in the previous jurisdiction. For example, Rule XIII of the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> Board of Law Examiners allows attorneys practicing full-time 5 of the last 7 years in another state and who meet minimum scores on the MPRE to be admitted to the Texas bar without having to sit for the Texas Bar Examination.</p>
<p>Most states that allow reciprocal admission define "full-time practice" to include not only attorneys working in law firms or solo practice, but also law teachers in accredited U.S. law schools; military <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge_Advocate_General%27s_Corps_48bc.html" title="Judge Advocate General's Corps">JAG</a> attorneys; federal and state government attorneys; judges, magistrates, administrative law judges, and similar officials; and in-house corporate counsel. Some states, however, have their own quirks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> requires that any position used to qualify an applicant for reciprocal admission, except for a judgeship, involve an attorney-client relationship.<a href="http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/guidelines.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/guidelines.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> This means, for example, that an attorney who works for the federal government as a legislative drafter cannot use his or her experience to gain admission in Virginia, while a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Attorney_82a9.html" title="United States Attorney">United States Attorney</a> can do so. Also, a law professor cannot use his or her teaching experience to qualify for admission in Virginia.</li>
<li>In <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_4016.html" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a>, Rule 4.0 of the Rules for Admission to the Practice of Law, which governs admission without examination, makes no mention of in-house counsel as being engaged in the practice of law. This means that a lawyer who has worked exclusively as in-house counsel is ineligible for reciprocal admission in West Virginia.</li>
</ul>

<p>A number of jurisdictions will issue, without examination, a limited license to practice law to attorneys already admitted in another jurisdiction under specified conditions. The most common limited licenses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legal services attorneys: Attorneys who practice exclusively in <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_aid.html" title="Legal aid">legal aid</a> centers that service mainly low-income clients, or in <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_defender.html" title="Public defender">public defender</a> offices serving indigent criminal defendants. Depending on the jurisdiction, attorneys who work in one or both of the named entities may be eligible for such a license.</li>
<li>In-house counsel: Attorneys who are employed by a corporation or other business entity that is not in the business of practicing law, and who perform legal services solely for their employer.</li>
<li>Foreign legal consultant: A person with formal legal training from a country other than the United States, who is permitted to engage in activities that would otherwise constitute the practice of law on the basis of that training. Common designation for attorneys who are "seconded" to American law firms to learn American law and to cement cross-firm ties.</li>
<li>Legal professional&#160;: A small number of states license paralegals and others who routinely prepare legal documentation.</li>

<p>Admission to a state's bar is not necessarily the same as membership in that state's bar association. There are two kinds of state bar associations:</p>

<p>In Texas, for example, the "<a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Bar_of_Texas_4577.html" title="State Bar of Texas">State Bar of Texas</a>" is an agency of the judiciary and is under the administrative control of the Texas Supreme Court. See Tex. Gov’t Code section 81.011.

<p>There is a statewide voluntary bar association in every state that has no mandatory or integrated bar association. There are also many voluntary bar associations organized by city, county, or by other community, such as the <a href="http://www.hnba.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.hnba.com/" rel="nofollow">Hispanic National Bar Association</a>.

<p>In many states of the U.S., admission to the bar of a state does not entitle the admitted attorney to appear and plead before the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appellate_court.html" title="Appellate court">appellate courts</a> of the state. However, admission to the bar of the appellate court is usually a fairly simple matter of paying a nominal application fee and taking an oath of admission.</p>

<p>Admission to a state bar does not entitle the admitted attorney to appear and plead before the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_district_court_75c5.html" title="United States district court">United States district courts</a> or any <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_d1a3.html" title="United States Court of Appeals">United States Court of Appeals</a>. As with State appellate courts, admission to the bar of a federal district or appellate court is granted upon payment of a fee and taking an oath of admission. These requirements are often different (such as not requiring a fee) for attorneys who appear before federal courts on behalf of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_government_6d14.html" title="United States government">United States government</a>, such as <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Attorney_82a9.html" title="United States Attorney">Assistant United States Attorneys</a>.</p>
<p>An attorney must apply to each district separately. For instance, a <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> attorney who practices in federal courts throughout the state would have to get admitted separately to the Northern District of Texas, the Eastern District, the Southern District, and the Western District. To handle a federal appeal the attorney would also be required to be admitted separately to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fifth_Circuit_803a.html" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit">Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals</a>.</p>
<p>Some federal district courts have extra admission requirements. For instance, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Texas_6c77.html" title="United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas">Southern District of Texas</a> requires attorneys seeking admission to attend a class on practice and procedures in that District, while the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Florida_e167.html" title="United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida">Southern District of Florida</a> administers an entrance exam.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_District_Court_8b0d.html" title="United States District Court">United States District Courts</a> (Federal trial courts) condition their admissions policies on those of the state in which they are located. Generally speaking, a Federal District Court will admit a lawyer to practice provided that he or she is already admitted to practice in that state. Thus, for example, a lawyer admitted in California may automatically be admitted to the bar of a Federal court in California, but could likely not automatically gain admission to a Federal court in neighboring Oregon.</p>

<p>An attorney wishing to practice before the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Supreme_Court_e75f.html" title="United States Supreme Court">United States Supreme Court</a> must apply to do so. The attorney must have been admitted to a state bar for at least three years, and the application must be sponsored by two attorneys already admitted to the Supreme Court bar. A fee and a written oath are also required. <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/bar/barinstructions.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/bar/barinstructions.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<p>Various other specialized courts, e.g., the United States Tax Court, have separate admission requirements. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Tax_Court_94be.html" title="United States Tax Court">United States Tax Court</a> is unusual in that a non-attorney may be admitted to practice. However, the non-attorney must take and pass an examination administered by the Court to be admitted, while attorneys are not required to take the exam. Most members of the Tax Court bar are attorneys.</p>

<p>Persons wishing to "prosecute" patents before the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office_ee96.html" title="United States Patent and Trademark Office">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO)—i.e., represent clients in the process of obtaining a patent—must first pass the <a href="../../../u/s/p/USPTO_registration_examination_1aab.html" title="USPTO registration examination">USPTO registration examination</a>, frequently referred to as the "patent bar."</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../j/u/r/Juris_Doctor_dd74.html" title="Juris Doctor">Juris Doctor</a> degree is not required to sit for the patent bar. Lawyers who pass the patent bar exam may refer to themselves as <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_attorney.html" title="Patent attorney">Patent attorney</a>; non-lawyers are referred to as "Patent agent". Patent agents may not hold themselves out as licensed <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney.html" title="Attorney">attorneys</a>.</p>
<p>The USPTO requires that, to sit for the patent bar, each individual must have earned a bachelor's or master's degree in a "hard science" or <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">engineering</a>, or accrued a certain number of credits in undergraduate science courses; the number of credits depends on the specific discipline. A <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_science.html" title="Computer science">computer science</a> degree is acceptable, so long as it is received from an <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accreditation_Board_for_Engineering_and_Technology_5d0c.html" title="Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology">ABET</a> accredited program. Although the admission requirements do allow substitution of technical experience for technical education, in practice that is rarely done.</p>
<p>Most patent lawyers have a relevant four-year degree and many have graduate technical degrees. Legal ethics rules prohibit lawyers from using the title "patent attorney" unless they are admitted to practice before the USPTO. These additional requirements make patent attorneys very rare and are in high demand by many companies, making a starting salary of $145,000 quite average.</p>
<p>Passing the patent bar is not necessary to advise clients on patent infringement, to litigate patent issues in court or to prosecute <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trademark.html" title="Trademark">trademarks</a>. However, only registered patent attorneys or patent agents can prosecute patents in the USPTO.</p>

<p>The American legal system is unique in that, with few exceptions, it has <i>no</i> formal apprenticeship or clinical training requirements <i>between</i> the period of academic legal training and the bar exam, or even after the bar exam. Two exceptions are <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware.html" title="Delaware">Delaware</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermont.html" title="Vermont">Vermont</a>, which require that candidates for admission serve a full-time clerkship of at least five months (Delaware) or three months (Vermont) in the office of a lawyer previously admitted in that state before being eligible to take the oath of admission.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_12.html" title="October 12">October 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the Washington State Supreme Court adopted amendments to Admission to Practice Rule 5 and 18, mandating that, prior to admission, Bar applicants must complete a minimum of four hours of approved pre-admission education.</p>
<p>Many law schools have tried to rectify this lack of experience by requiring supervised "Public Service Requirements" of all graduates, see <a href="http://www.brandeislaw.com/psp/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.brandeislaw.com/psp/index.htm" rel="nofollow">University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law Public Service Requirement</a></p>
<p>In most states, therefore, anyone with a J.D. (or equivalent experience in the states that allow it) may immediately take the bar exam and be admitted to the bar, and then may immediately seek out clients and start filing papers with a court. The current system has been heavily criticized, since clients often end up subsidizing the apprenticeship of young lawyers.</p>

<p>A successful applicant is permitted to practice law after being sworn in as an officer of the Court. Upon admission, a new lawyer is issued a certificate of admission from the state's highest court and a membership card attesting to admission.</p>
<p>In some states, e.g., Texas and California, new lawyers are also issued a unique <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_association.html" title="Bar association">bar association</a> identification number. In certain jurisdictions where the unauthorized practice of law is a serious problem, the state bar number must appear on all documents submitted by a lawyer, to enable the court to confirm that the lawyer is a member of the bar in good standing.</p>
