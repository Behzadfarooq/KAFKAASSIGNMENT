<p>Okay people, this talk is escalating into argument for argument's sake. Please, let's take a step back and realize something: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a battleground</a> - we are not here to make war with each other, we are here to work together to the betterment of the Encyclopedia. This "IRC vrs non-IRC" argument is divisive and unfair. People will communicate however they want, and that cannot, nor should be stopped. We should be working together, and communicating, after all. Everyone that edits on Wikipedia, from the newest editor all the way back to <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimmy Wales</a>, are valued and respected editors, and we should be helping them to contribute to the Encyclopedia and helping keep the environment positive. All of us together can improve this encyclopedia, and arguing over communication media isn't going to help that.</p>
<p>As Piotr and Ghirla are in Arbitration, and Jimbo has endorsed and overturned the block of Giano, I don't think this conversation, saving the last section, serve any further purpose. I respect all of you greatly, so I beseech you, please, let us work together to better the encyclopedia instead of taking time here in such a divisive argument. ✎ <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_6d1a.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon"><font color="#696">Peter M Dodge</font></a> ( <a href="../../../w/i/z/User_talk%7EWizardry_Dragon_3463.html" title="User talk:Wizardry Dragon"><font color="#696">Talk to Me</font></a> • <a href="../../../w/n/p/WP%7EWNP_d2ca.html" title="WP:WNP"><font color="#696">Neutrality Project</font></a> )</span> 20:03, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This all stems from a simple boilerplate civility warning I left him (which is apparently "infantile and hostile") after he was getting too out of control on Mackensen's talk page. Now he turns his glare on me. Threatening to have me desysopped and banned? C'mon. And yeah, the usuals (Bishonen, Geogre, Ghirlandajo, and Irpen) are going to step in now and defend Giano ... but they defend him no matter what he does because they're all in this little back-scratching clique together. I'm posting this here to solicit some response from other administrators: is this kind of behavior really acceptable? Do you want to work in an environment where users routinely have blow-ups like this and are only encouraged by admin inaction? --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 14:03, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Unlike some people, I am going to spell out exactly what it is in your above post that is a personal attack. "he usuals (Bishonen, Geogre, Ghirlandajo, and Irpen) are going to step in now and defend Giano ... but they defend him no matter what he does because they're all in this little back-scratching clique together." is a personal attack.

<dd>There is no incivility in Giano's posting, just a mild warning. "This little back-scratching clique together", however, is blatantly incivil and I demand apologies. Such comments may indeed lead to desysopping. If your posting is expected to trigger an uproar from all sorts of IRC fairies who habitually indulge in incivilty on IRC and then pontificate about civility during their occasional appearances on-wiki, I suppose it would be nice to see them here. Foundation employees have no wild card for incivility, for what I know. The community is aware that your dispute with Giano goes back to the time when your energetically defended Kelly Martin's postings demanding "an enema and a major fight that flushes 20-30% of the en-wiki community". This page is not part of dispute resolution procedures, so I advise you both to move your dispute to Requests for comment. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 14:20, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not going to comment on the persons here (not least because I'm guessing I've already been pre-emptively dismissed as an 'IRC fairy', which Ghirlanajo won't consider to be uncivil). But, please, if we are going to have a conversation about civility, can we perhaps compete to outdo one another in civility, rather than the reverse?

<dd>I find Cyde's reverting of the removal of the talk page warning particularly ironic when he asked whoever posted it to leave it and let Giano deal with it himself. By that logic, shouldn't he have left Giano to undo the removal of the warning, and limited himself (Cyde) to posting a new message pointing out to Giano that the warning had been removed? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:39, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think this needs some type of dispute resolution such as RFC or MedCab. This is not going anywhere if this is going on and on. Both sides should stop fighting and this is getting the community tired of all this. Just <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">cool down</a> guys, we can settle this. Nothing both of you say makes any difference, just be civil to each other and don't tell each other to be civil or vice versa, like what Sjakkalle said. Both sides are telling each other not to be incivil, this doesn't sound too right. I suggest both parties stay away from each other for a while to cool down.

<p>I'm rather surprised to find out that the discussions on my talk page have prompted this affair; if there's any mediation to be had, it's between Lar and Giano. I've never seen a civility warning have it's desired effect--no one likes being told their being uncivil. At the same time, I don't see the need for allegations of de-sysoping. The Arbitration Committee has set ample precedent that you have to abuse your admin tools for that. Finally, I agree with Cyde on one point: Giano is more than capable of taking care of his own talk page; we all are. If I think someone's cluttering my talk page I can do it myself without anyone else's help. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 15:07, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Shouldn't this be discussed at <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>? On another note, we seem to need a policy on civility notes. Who can issue them, and who can rever them. It seems that recently there is a trend to remove such notes (ex. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGiano_II&amp;diff=95776779&amp;oldid=95776477" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGiano_II&amp;diff=95776779&amp;oldid=95776477" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ghirlandajo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95798412" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ghirlandajo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95798412" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, etc.), which in turns causes other users to complain that they were removed... I'd suggest that only certified editors of WP:PAIN, who should be elected like admins, should have the right to issue such notes, and that in those cases the notes issued by them should not be removable by non-PAIN certified users. This will put an end to the problem.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 16:04, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but the problem is who may be considered a "certified editor of WP:PAIN". Who is supposed to "certify" these guys? The problematic warning you cite was added by a non-admin who is active on <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>. When I attempted to discuss the issue with him, he simply removed my messages from his talk page on several occasions. Do you consider yourself a "certified editor of WP:PAIN"? I see you have been commenting on each message posted there during the last day or two. Do you want to run the board and "issue" warnings to your opponents?

<li>Thank you, Mackensen, for that clarification. To the issue at hand: What I see, so far, is personal. Cyde is taking things very personally and becoming personally involved in trying to "stop" persons, etc. This is counter to the spirit of Wikipedia. The fact that, above, he would even try to reach back to the Giano RFAR to mischaracterize Fred Bauder's rejected finding on the meaning of a policy is simply more evidence that Cyde is extremely <i>angry</i> rather than anything else. He had not been involved in interactions with Giano II on Mackensen's talk page, had not been involved in any interactions with me, and yet his vote on my ArbCom run, his desire to "stop" "people like" Giano, etc. is showing a very deleterious mindset at present. I hope that I am wrong (I often am), but I honestly cannot see any justification whatever for Cyde's words. I would love to "assume" good faith, but my imagination is not sufficient for finding a way to do that when someone comes along and announces a campaign to "stop" another user. It's rather like those people who want to "stop filth on television": they should not watch the show. Similarly, Cyde can not scanning everyone's <i>talk page</i> for "evidence." A good administrator waits for a complaint. He doesn't go looking to create one. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:06, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>In other contexts, other issues, with other disputants, I've objected to "double standards" where one or more parties held others to stricter standards than themselves, and I've argued for keeping a single standard. Now I begin to think that may not be sufficient to the needs. Better still would be to hold oneself to the stricter standard, and extend leeway (and some forgiveness) to others. That way the waves of mutual recrimination would be dampened out at the start, rather than growing, heterodyning in a feedback loop, as seems to be happening at present. Just a thought. <small>– <a href="../../../s/a/j/User%7ESAJordan_b760.html" title="User:SAJordan"><i>SAJordan</i></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/j/User_talk%7ESAJordan_266c.html" title="User talk:SAJordan">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SAJordan_0c1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/SAJordan">contribs</a></sub> <i>19:49, 22 Dec 2006 (UTC).</i></small></p>

<li>I can't understand a word the person above is saying, but he probably agrees with me. I have been reading and re-reading various posts of Cyde's mostly admittedly those concerning me, and have come to the conclusion we are dealing with someone fairly young here, at most a late teens. We all get out of our depth at that age, so lets all say Happy Christmas and forget it. Perhaps though at some stage during 2007 we need to have a big think about junior editors and ages and responsibilities. IRC seems always to be a problem eternally with us, I know James Forrester has decreed IRC conversations off limits but that was in the days when wikipedia was much smaller - and he was more powerful. I think the time has now come to re-think that policy too so 2007 promises to be an interesting period in Wikipedia's history. Wikipedia is going places in internet history, it must not become a victim of it's own history. So lets wish each other a happy Christmas and productive new year. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 19:55, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's sort of pointless to bring it up now, but I was asked (via the much-maligned IRC, no less) to note that I think the community should strongly prefer using tailored warnings to communicate with experienced users, rather than templates, since templates are definitely written with new users in mind.

<p>We hear a lot of talk about 'at some point' or 'they can't get away with this'. But I've begun to ask myself: what is the end game here? What solution are we realistically wanting? Cyde banned? Giano blocked? Perhaps others too? The problem is that loose cannons go off, and the various groupings raise the defcon in defence or attack. Where does this end? Actually, when all cools down, I find I actually agree with folk like Geogre on far more issues than I disagree. And some civil conversations with others (yes, in IRC!) convinces me it doesn't have to be this way. I don't want to be sanctimonious, but perhaps all of us could work on cooling it. Are certain people uncivil at times. Yes, and we all know who they are? Are certain people sometimes hostile to the point of trolling? Yes, and we all know who they are. Can these people be otherwise? Yes, I think so. We all know it would be better if it were. Please let's all use whatever influence we have (particularly on those we think might listen to us - and not on those who are likely to react negatively to us) to cool things.

Actions? Ok. Worse still, we have taunt and counter, badger and follow, charge and countercharge, and all that <i>can</i> occur then is that the people behind the names get angrier and angrier, and then someone says "booger," and the other person blocks, and then we're at ArbCom.

<li>Oh, and the IRC side issue: IRC is a great place to be pleasant, to banter inanely, and to burn some time. It's a fun place to blow off steam, too. How could it not be? That's the function of all chat. It's a horrible place to argue, in both senses of the word. I've never been against bantering with my fellow Wikipedians. I'm generally an amusing and mellow fellow (I got top 2 percentile in chatter and banter on the GRE), but IRC is a terrible place for formulating on-wiki actions <b>unless</b> it is followed by on-wiki deliberation and transparency. It's not that fine a distinction, either. Wikipedia actions have to be established and accountable on Wikipedia. People on IRC should have the sense to know that, whatever IRC says, they have to find their evidences and provide their rationales on the project. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:49, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The person <i>is</i> to blame, but our vagueness is more to blame. Having an ArbCom that lived on IRC didn't help, either, as we had tremendous reluctance to spell out coherently and clearly best practice. Additionally, the much touted "gang" and "herd" mentality at IRC is very much to blame, too. While Cyde maligned the "back scratching" of a few of the academic writers, if such a thing existed (and it doesn't), it wouldn't have a patch on the self-defense instinct of people on IRC who rush to defend their pastime and/or IRC "friends" (quotes around friend because of my views on the illusoriness of all this mess). So, if a person is found out acting plainly on the basis of non-accountable process, we will see some very shrill defenses. It is disappointing that so few people think independently and weigh the issues dispassionately. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:33, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm inclined to agree. I for one would <i>love</i> to see a productive discussion about the policy and accountability implications of IRC's lack of transparency -- in particular the "on-wiki actions should be justified on-wiki" school of thought appeals to me quite a bit, as a rule of thumb if nothing else, and I try to stick to that. IRC is a medium, it's a tool, and like any tool, it can be used effectively to better the encyclopedia, or it can be abused. I think it is a <b>damned shame</b> that the discussion has become so heated -- all of this incessant name calling accomplishes nothing and only makes the problem worse; it encourages "factions," scares people away, and hurts any chance of reaching a consensus of any real sort. As I said, I'd love to see a productive discussion, but I can say for sure that when I see a phrase like "IRC fairy," my blood starts to boil, and the chance of a good talking-over is inherently diminished -- I'm not trying to defend anything, or single anybody out, here, and I'm sure that any number of other examples could be brought up, on all sides. I guess what I'm asking for is this: those of you who really care about Wikipedia, please try to put your petty squabbles behind you, and strive to reach a legitimate agreement. I implore you, all of you, act your age and let the anger go.

<p>Chairboy has blocked Giano for 48 hours. Giano is saying on his talk page that this was all decided on IRC. I've asked Chairboy to unblock, particularly if he was involved in an IRC discussion. I'm requesting two things: first, and most important, that Cyde stay away from Giano from now on, and in particular that he stay away from any warnings or admin actions; and second, that people stop discussing admin action against Giano on IRC. It starts to look like harassment, and whether it's intended that way or not (and I'm sure it isn't by at least some of the parties), that's what it <i>looks like</i> to some bystanders and probably to Giano too. Admin actions like this, especially controversial ones, shouldn't be decided on IRC because it leads to nothing but trouble. That's surely a lesson that must have been learned by now. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:46, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Being an occasional resident of the IRC channels, I can tell you that IRC is just like real-life and on-wiki- there's no close-knit clique (or if there is, it's two or three close friends, and others dissent). Most of the time in controversial situations, there's a significant amount of discussion on more than one side of the issue. And frankly, I've dissented more than a few times on blocks that I thought were unjust, etc., leading to continued discussion on the blocks both on and off-wiki. The thought of an IRC clique controlling Wikipedia is just absurd. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 10:02, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The block was not organized in any way on IRC. The only involvement IRC had before everything exploded was that an admin gave me a diff of Giano being incivil to someone. After that, the decision to block based on his subsequent actions was mine and mine alone. There was a discussion on IRC where I counseled someone _not_ to block him because the block rationale they provided was improper, and another user in the room appears to have misinterpreted that as planning/coordination, but that is absolutely not the case. In response to the assertion that sharing the logs with Giano was proper and licit, I'll have to disagree. It's a violation of the channel rules and undermines the privacy expectations each participant has agreed to. While I know that I have at all points operated on the channel in a manner completely consistent with the ideals and ethics of the project, the fact that someone would make such a gross violation of trust is very disapointing and personally troubling. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 00:47, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Chairboy, can you say who gave you the diff of Giano allegedly being uncivil? Also, can you say exactly what the channel rules are? We can't have a situation where a channel that operates in absolutely secrecy has any effect on Wikipedia administrators. I can see the rationale for no public posting of logs, but for no one to be allowed to say anything whatsoever is absurd. This isn't an in-camera hearing of the UN Security Council.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:51, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

The 'channel that operates in absolute secrecy' (which, incidentally, any admin can join) had an effect on that particular administrator. Indeed based on conversations there, he endorsed the block and, after discussion, agreed to lift it for the wider good of the project.

<dd>I fail to understand the logic here. A block is either a good call or a bad one. The blocking admin is alone responsible for his/her call. This call was a reasonable one (although I think ultimately unhelpful). I'm not sure what is meant by 'people who previously tried to get Giano blocked'. I've previously blocked Giano, does that count? Since everyone in the channel is an admin, anyone who believes someone should be blocked can just do it. However, it isn't the first time I've asked people to take a look at a diff I've caught (wanting a second opinion), and found someone blocked the offender before I did.</dd>

<li>This is <b>disgusting.</b> How long do we get to bandy about a diff? Can I now block Giano on the same comment and then claim, "Hey, it was just me by myself?" The "any admin" channel is similarly ridiculous, as there are at least two people who are not administrators who <i>are</i> on there, and there are people who are who won't go near it. The very existence of the thing was an attempt to gain greater secrecy, and that means opacity. Playing legal games now to say, "Well, someone showed it to me on IRC but I made the decision" is disengenious. Anyone ever heard of the bias of the first move? Basically, if I go to your talk page and say, "Oh, my goodness! Look at this horrible personal attack" and link, then you go to read <i>specifically a single comment looking for the attack.</i> If you are not skeptical (say, the person telling you is someone you've bantered pleasantly with for days), you may indeed <i>see</i> that vicious personal attack. Now, if all this happens on a talk page, there is some chance that the "attacker" will show up to explain the context, the intent, and the standing. If it happens on IRC, though, you're just getting that biased view. When a person makes a point of attacking IRC coteries, that person's going to be hunted and hounded extra especially. Doing <i>anything</i> "by the attention of someone on IRC" is a horrible, disgusting move. <b>Confer!</b> <b>Confer some more before you block</b> and confer openly. What is AN/I? What is its purpose? IRC blocks are, if ever, justifiable only in emergencies. Hours old diffs of Giano being mean are hardly emergencies. (Oh, and then the "Help, Bishonen's not assuming good faith" is really terrific.)

<li>I want to make clear that I don't doubt Chairboy acted in good faith. However, in general, I wonder why people discuss blocks on IRC rather than on AN/I or by e-mail? AN/I has the benefit of being public, transparent, and can be quoted. E-mail is private for anything sensitive. IRC is neither fish nor fowl. It's public enough to invoke a gang mentality in those who use it, yet not so public that we're allowed to quote from it, which just strengthens the gang mentality. There's no point in denying this, because I've seen it time and again, and I've been stunned every time I've witnessed it (and the two facedness takes your breath away!). There's no gang mentality by e-mail, or at least it's harder to create it given the limited numbers. Anyone who can't see IRC has a potential for creating that atmosphere doesn't understand human nature. Even if we think we're not succumbing to it, we might be. Doesn't it therefore make sense to use AN/I for most blocks, e-mails for anything sensitive, and IRC for general discussions not involving individuals? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:36, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have no aspersions to cast on Chairboy's intentions, but the process was awful. It's common sense to deliberate, to use AN/I, to make deliberations <i>especially for blocks</i> as transparent as possible. Not doing that is absolutely wretched, whatever the intentions of the person doing it. Instead of accepting this point, which would certainly make me feel better, we're getting another battle, which doesn't help my peace of mind at all. Insisting that one's actions are above reproach is rarely helpful. If people are reproaching you, there's probably <i>something</i> you could have done better. (Unless you assume bad faith in every single person questioning you, but, if you do that, you're really off the path.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:07, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

If that. I don't really think you need IRC to get two faced behaviour. Human nature being what it is and all...

<li>The nature of IRC lends itself to the herd mentality in a way e-mail doesn't, or at least much less so, because the latter's private and the numbers involved much smaller. With IRC, there may be dozens or even hundreds of people watching, and there's a certain amount of grandstanding. I've seen more experienced editors basically issue instructions to very young or inexperienced ones, and minutes later, they're off doing the thing that the experienced editor didn't want to do himself. It's all very well for people to claim that everyone on IRC acts of their own freewill, but how realistic is that when the age and experience differences are very significant? The important point is that IRC-related blocks frequently cause trouble, so why not just avoid them? If someone raises the possibility of a block on IRC, directly or otherwise, the sensible thing to do is for one of the admins present to initiate a discussion on AN/I to see whether the off-IRC voices concur. That's particularly important in the case of a controversial block. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:56, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Geogre, the truth does not require your approval. You can assert that I've misbehaved and conspired and cabalized all you want, but it's simply wrong. If you feel I have acted improperly, if you feel that I'm lying or otherwise doing wrong, then put your money where your mouth is. Open an ArbCom case so that the logs can be reviewed by disinterested parties. JWales reviewed the situation and endorsed the block. I corresponded with SlimVirgin in email regarding some of the specifics of the discussion. Either make a formal complaint and follow it through or apologize for your inappropriate insinuations. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 07:23, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How often has the point been made about articles, that Wikipedia needs not merely <i><b>truth</b></i> but <i><b>verifiability</b></i>? The same should apply to accusations and disciplinary actions. It may be <i><b>true</b></i> that umpteen dozen admins on IRC endorsed my blocking you indefinitely for death threats (and protecting your talk page so you can't even post an "unblock" appeal); and it may even be true that "all the lurkers support me in email"; but you have no way to <i><b>verify</b></i> either of those claims, so you'll just have to take my word for it. However, since you know first-hand that you <i>never uttered</i> any death threats, my word on the matter is unlikely to satisfy you. So isn't it convenient for me that I've just prevented you from publicly defending yourself or denying the charges? And that if you try to do so from different accounts, I can just keep blocking you as a sockpuppet? Under those circumstances, you might want to have open process, with all assertions proven by citations of an open and verifiable record. As an abusive admin, I have just as strong a motive to keep everything secret and unverifiable, off the record, and avoid having to prove anything, or even specify (let alone cite) what threats you supposedly made. (With that in mind, see <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Blocks_%26_protections#User:SAJordan" class="extiw" title="commons:Commons:Administrators'_noticeboard/Blocks_&amp;_protections">this</a> and <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_Archive_6_7452.html#Threats.3F" title="User talk:Zscout370/Archive 6">this</a>.) This scenario is why the whole IRC issue is raising people's hackles. It brings up memories of the <a href="../../../v/e/h/Vehmgericht.html" title="Vehmgericht">Vehmgericht</a> and other "secret tribunals" of the past, and of stories by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Kafka_d4e6.html" title="Franz Kafka">Kafka</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">Orwell</a>.

<li>Indeed, the truth does not require approval, and it is similarly not your possession. You have been asked, several times, to answer germane questions. You still want opacity. In what way does this help? As for "apologize for inappropriate insinuations," you'll have to <i>tell me what they are,</i> just as you really should <i>tell Giano</i> what you are blocking him for. Oh, and giving him a chance to explain would have been nice. Giving him a chance to reduce the heat would have been nice, too. You have, indeed, behaved inappropriately by following along the well worn path to unilateralism. You will note that my comments were directed at this affair, and not so much a single person. This affair illustrates, <b>again,</b> the use of stale diffs and, most distressingly, the <i>refusal to confer.</i> You indicate, one place, that you did confer, but it was on IRC (where no one may see or say), but then you say that you made your decision solus. I repeat: before blocking <b>consult and confer</b> and do so on Wikipedia. This is good practice, and it <i>does</i> require approval. All administrators should (must, except in emergencies) confer and deliberate in any shadowy area. This was a very shadowy area, and yet you felt that, on the basis of a first move call for action, you could act without warning and mediation and resolution and conferring. That can only be done if you believe you have a pipeline to the divine truth or divine rights (or if you are acting unthinkingly, of course). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:23, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Again, you're calling me a liar. This is grossly <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivil</a> and an injust mischaracterization. What are your motivations here? I didn't block Giano because of a conversation on IRC. I got a diff from a novice admin who wanted to know if the text in it was a blockable offense. I told the admin that it was not, but volunteered to ask Giano to be nice. I then went to Giano's user talk and left him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano_II&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95991911" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano_II&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95991911" rel="nofollow">this request</a> to be civil.

As a response, I restored the warning and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano_II&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96002251" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano_II&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96002251" rel="nofollow">told him I was blocking him</a> for repeated incivility and personal attacks against me when I asked him to knock it off. At no part of this was there any IRC collaboration to plot his blocking. As far as I can tell, another admin in the group misinterpreted my counseling to the novice admin as some sort of plot, but anyone who actually reads the log will see that it's ridiculous. At one point I mistook Giano for someone else and characterized him as a wikilawyer and said something to the effect of "If you block someone, you need to make absolutely certain that it's a proper block. You can't just block based on a feeling, there needs to be a specific policy violation", and mentioned that Giano would properly assert against an improper block. Blocks are bad juju, and I don't like doing them, that's why I counseled the new admin about how to avoid getting into a crapstorm and blocking innocent users. Between you and bishonen, my actions have been mischaracterized and you have whole cloth fabricated motivations and conspiracies that simply <b>do not exist</b>. Create an ArbCom request, Geogre, please. I beg you. If it's the only thing that will get you to stop libeling me and the only thing that will help us begin healing this weird rift in the project that you and bishonen seem determined to create, then let's get it over with. The logs can be privately reviewed by the Arbitration Committee without violating the trust of the admin IRC channel (which exists not to plot and make Wikipedia policy, but as a place where people can bounce ideas off each other and either get a positive sanity check or a thwack on the back of the head to correct a mistake) and breaking its effectiveness as one of Wikipedia's heroic inanimate carbon rods. Apologize for your gross mischaracterization of my motivations and actions, open an ArbCom case (which I will gladly assist with in any way possible), or you stand ready to clearly communicate to everyone here that your goal is not to create a better project, but is instead to disrupt and impugn innocent folks with whom you personally disagree for one reason or another. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 16:51, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Uh, what "characterization of motives?" I don't see any, unless you count way up there, where he says that he doesn't have any aspersions to cast at your intentions.

<p>Indeed, there was no characterization of motives. There was a characterization of behavior. When Betacommand was called out for his improper block (blocking without warning, blocking without conferring), he conferred with Chairboy, whose measure of conferring was to think it over and just <i>block</i> without using AN/I or consulting with another administrator. That is bad practice. There have been no personal attacks here, just tremendously bad actions. When blocking, <i>confer</i> and <i>do so openly.</i> How hard is that to take to heart? Chairboy, you can keep begging for an RFAR, but I am not "accusing" you of anything. I am flatly stating that your actions were bad practice, improper, and invalid. They were. Take that as a "personal attack" only if you consider community input to be always harmful. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:48, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most major Wikipedia channels, including #wikipedia and #wikipedia-en-admins, allow logging for <b>personal use only</b>. Thus, keeping copies for one's own use would be fine, and, presumably, reading logs to generalize a situation and responses would be fine. Quoting logs, making logs public, or sharing logs without the permission of all participants in the discussion is prohibited.

Now that it's no longer the middle of the night, I do remember: the background was Betacommand's extremely dodgy block of Irpen, which has been criticized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=95967671#User:Irpen_blocked_for_48_hours.2C_please_review" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=95967671#User:Irpen_blocked_for_48_hours.2C_please_review" rel="nofollow">here on ANI</a> for being done without warning, for giving only the vague reason "personal attacks", for coming without a block message, and for being imposed at the last minute before Betacommand went off line. (On Betacommand's talkpage are many more queries and comments, including this trenchant summary by Geogre: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Betacommand&amp;diff=96038362&amp;oldid=96015912" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Betacommand&amp;diff=96038362&amp;oldid=96015912" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.) Betacommand's block of Irpen was pretty soon undone, but Irpen remains crushed by the way his block log now looks. I saw clearly last night on en-admins the usual old callousness about such things, exhibited by some admins (those most active in the matter): the too-frequent incapacity for understanding the amount of harm done to good-faith editors by blocks.&#160;:-( Blocks were actually discussed in terms of editors <i>wanting</i> to be blocked, "wikilawyering" to be blocked, "dancing" to be blocked; rather than in terms of the shock and pain of getting an enduring black mark (so very easily inflicted!) in the block log. Whatever. Giano was one of the people criticizing Betacommand over the Irpen block, and Betacommand's reaction was apparently (not that he needed to take stock, being a new admin, and reconsider doing such blocks) but that he needed help from more experienced admins in putting a stop to such Personal Attacks against himself. He joined #Wikipedia-en-admins to ask, and Chairboy advised him. Considering the rate at which Chairboy's accusations against me personally seem to be escalating above, I'd <i>really</i> like to go into more detail at this point, and to preferably use exact quotes from the discussion of the blocking of Giano, but I confess myself unnerved by the different things different users are saying about whether, or how much, the logs can actually be quoted in public. Let me go out on a limb, though, and ask the following editors if they will permit me to quote <i>their</i> words here on ANI.

Bishonen interpreted this in just about the worst possible way, and if my language was unclear, I apologize, but saying that I was plotting to kill you or otherwise conspiring as part of a big mean IRC cabal is just flat out wrong. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 20:34, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aside from obvious vandalism, blocks of established editors should be discussed here or on AN.

<li>I agree. If an established contributor is to be blocked, at the very least they should be given a chance to defend their actions. I feel the "anti-IRC" argument is misplaced however. Plenty of blocks have probably occurred by AIM/MSN/YIM group chats too. I would even conjecture more happen there as more Wikipedians I know use these messenger services as communication media than IRC.

<li>Perhaps, but I see irony in the fact that you were unblocked per an IRC discussion in the admins channel as well.

<li>Jimbo interceded on your behalf.

I am not sure of the contents of the discussion, as I was not a party to it, but I know for a fact that it was conducted over IRC. For my part, I also discussed the matter with him.

<dd>A quick correction. JWales did not unblock Giano because of issues related to IRC. He unblocked Giano because he feels Giano is a valued member and he wants everyone to be happy.

<dd>Well, this is what I was getting at about people being a bit hypocritical. People who go on search and destroy missions for "incivility" and "personal attacks" should at least be consistent in seeking to exemplify civility (and not talk about getting quick kills or escalate situations with volatile editors and not admit no fault) and avoid itching for fights. RDH doesn't go hunting civility breaches, and neither does Giano. Of <i>course</i> we should all be civil, but when we make ourselves wardens of everyone else's behavior and not our own, when we go hunting for what we are <i>sure</i> must be personal attacks, then we get distorted into the monsters we claim to want to destroy.

<p>Well, that was apparently a non-starter.

I've suggested to Chairboy on IRC that he might like to do the editing himself, to shorten the very long section from Betacommand's question to jwales's exit, and especially to remove the irrelevant people, but he doesn't wish to. OK, I would have liked to explain how I see what happened on en-admins yesterday, but meh, forget it. I'm only sorry Slim's questions are destined to have no replies. Hey, could somebody who's sure they understand the rules tell me, though: is there any objection to my e-mailing the logs to SlimVirgin?

<dd>Giano, I would suggest you didn't do that without permission. The reason is alluded to above. If you give out information given in confidence without the permission of all involved, then there could be legal implications, and I certainly wouldn't want that happening with anyone here.

<dd>You'll have to read Chairboy's "permission" more carefully, Peter. It contains conditions that make it unusable. There were several people there whom a publication would be likely to embarrass. I simply wouldn't do it, even aparat from the fact that they'd be highly unlikely to give permission for it.

<dd>Giano, I wish to take this opportunity to apologise for using sarcasm in your presence, as it is obvious unhelpful. I will attempt not so to do in future (though I imagine I will fail, sadly).</dd>
<dd>Yes, it is theoretically my call as to all of the rules in all of the IRC channels (that's <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC_Group_Contacts" class="extiw" title="m:IRC_Group_Contacts">my job</a>). Yes, it is my job to oversee the enforcement of said rules. No, I did not actually make this rule up. Yes, I support it personally, but it would be utterly inappropriate to use my position to further a personal objective of mine. No, I do not enjoy "power", and would not boast about it. Yes, I sometimes make a joke of it. Further questions are welcome, of course; transparency in this role is not necessarily a bad idea.</dd>
<dd>The rule and its rationale are as follows: IRC is not Wikipedia. IRC is not under the control of Wikipedia, or any part thereof (the me-who-is-on-IRC is not the me-who-is-on-here; such is the nature of having various hats). Things that happen on IRC are equivalent to things that happen on MySpace, or in a telephone conversation, or in a pub. They are meant to be analogous to e-mail - all participants get a copy, but it is utterly morally vile (and generally illegal) to forward private correspondance to another party without permission of all those involved. Were we to publically log the "private" IRC channels, they would, err, cease to be private, and all these "cabal"-like discussions that so many people seem to think occur there (wrongly, as far I am aware) would move to somewhere that they cannot have as many people take part in the discussions (by the very nature of having a private channel), and, as they wouldn't be part of the official Wikipedia IRC network, I would have no <i>ex officio</i> ability nor authority to be in said channel, and so wouldn't be able to monitor such things.</dd>
<dd>I think that it is very sad that those people who choose not to use IRC (it takes very little effort in most circumstances) consider those who do do so to be part of some microscopic group that plot against the rest. It is not really very in-keeping with wikilove, AGF, and other core parts of what our community is about (for those that have forgotten&#160;:-().</dd>
<dd>Finally, please note that <tt>#wikipedia-en-admins</tt> is not an "official" channel (as said above), but is for informed discussion, so various particular people who are no longer, or have never been, sysops are still welcome there - and, by extension, people who <i>are</i> sysops but are disbenefits to the discussion could be asked, or forced, to leave (though I do not believe this has happened yet).</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the explanation, James. You've explained the rule — that it's analogous to e-mail, with all participants receiving a copy. Two questions: first, whose rule is this? Second, can the rule be modified so that anyone who would be entitled to be on the list (basically, any admin) may ask to receive a copy after the fact, assuming a copy exists? In that way, situations like the above would be avoided. The secrecy is breeding suspicion. A number of us here have tried to deal with this situation, and are having to feel our way along in the dark. I have not seen the logs. I don't know who said what. I would like to know, not so I can blab about it, but so I can inform the way I approach the situation. If admins could request the logs in future for any situation that turns controversial, the people on the channel will be more careful not to do controversial things on it, and if they do, it'll be easy to see how it evolved so it can be more easily avoided in future. Do you have any thoughts about that? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:28, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The rule is that of the IRC community. It has been the rule for longer than I've used IRC for the Wikimedia projects (that is, it's been a rule since at least 2003). I'm sure it <i>can</i> be modified, but in the same way that any policy in Wikimedia can - consensus has to be convinced of the need for and appropriacy of change. As to the particulars of your proposal, I would observe that it violates the primary point of the logging ban (that what is said in private, stays in private), and so I doubt the community would be terribly in favour of it. You can ask, of course, but I don't fancy the proposal's chances.</dd>
<dd>I'm also somewhat unsure of your implict premise - that each and every single sysop can be trusted with such information. By "trusted", we mean trusted not to react adversly to it, not to leak it to other people or organisations such as "Wikitruth" - in essence, not to bring the project into disrepute (that <i>is</i> what we're all here to do, isn't it?&#160;;-)). This is in general an exceedingly difficult thing to ask of people - for example, I would not necessarily feel comfortable seeing logs about myself, or about something "politically sensitive". I would say that the ability to trust all sysops with such information is not something that can easily be handed down - it is up to each conversations' participants to judge for themselves whether or not they trust the people in-channel at the time to. Given the rampant lack of trust and factionalism present in the sysop cadre, a rot that has been festering for quite some time now, I can see no way of getting to the point where such a thing would be possible.&#160;:-(</dd>
<dd>I don't think that it would be appropriate for me to comment about the individual cases that come up here, of course, so I'm afraid that I might not be of as much help as you might expect in solving this right now; I have had a quick look, and it seems that I was not in-channel at the time of this conversation (there were a few problems with IRC servers), so I'm just as much in the dark as everyone else. Sorry.&#160;:-(</dd>
<dd>I'm sad that you have seen people become suspicious just because they do not know everything; it seems somewhat petty to my mind, really - but then, I'm used to the concept of circles within circles and all that from my extra-wiki life.&#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>Thank you James so your statement on IRC: that if you were to make personal attacks you would do them on IRC because you control it, and had personally ruled it was not under the Arbcom's jurisdiction" was not true then? <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 11:20, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that was a sarcastic observation. Anyone who knows me even vaguely would be able to tell that.&#160;:-) I would not make personal attacks about others - ever - so the question is moot.

<dd>James, if making the logs privately available to any admin who asks isn't tenable (and I take your point about trust and Wikitruth, and other venues), would it be easier to request, or to introduce a rule (I don't know how the channel works and what rules exist, or how they are introduced) that no-one is allowed to discuss on the IRC admins' channel the proposed block of an established editor, and that anyone doing so will be asked to leave the channel, or some such? Not including proposed blocks of vandals, or drive-by editors, of course, but the blocking of anyone established in the community should not be discussed at all on IRC. Would that work? I think it would go a long way to re-establishing some trust. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:16, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My understanding is that any admin is entitled to use the so-called admins' channel. Therefore, any admin could be present at any time and be watching or logging for themselves. My recollection is that Danny set it up for the benefit of admins. Therefore, it makes sense that any logs may be passed to other admins by e-mail with or without the permission of the participants. This would get round the absurdity of Wikipedia admins trying to discuss an admininstrative issue on the Wikipedia admins' noticeboard, but not being allowed to know what was said. In future, I suggest that any admin may request a copy of the logs from any other admin who happens to have them. Who are the channel operators so I can check this with them? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:46, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it's <i>my</i> understanding that the channel is not restricted to enwiki admins, but is rather open and devs and commons admins get access too.

<dd>I still don't understand why it's not allowed to just publish these logs in any case (with the exception of confidential stuff, of course), soo.. what if we allow logs to be published whenever an admin action was involved (same exception)? Whenever someone says "I discussed this on IRC and then blocked him/protected the article/whatever", it should be possible to find out what was said by whom, IMHO. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 03:08, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One of the long-standing rules on #wikipeida channels on IRC is that publishing a log = ban on IRC.

<dd>I'm guessing that IRC chats have the same status as telephone calls, and in North America you may record your own telephone conversations and allow others access. You may not do it unless you're part of the conversation. However, I find this resorting to legal questions pointless. We're not children and we're not enemies.

<dd>I have not participated in this discussion, and have never yet been on a Wikipedia-related IRC discussion, but for the record, the law about recording phone conversations varies greatly from one place to another. In the USA, for example, in some states ("two-party states") both sides to a conversation must consent to any recording, exactly as Centrx says, but in others ("one-party states") either party to the conversation may record unilaterally (at least as far as the purely legal aspect is concerned). When the two parties to a call are located in different states with different rules, of course, things get complicated. If one then tries to extrapolate to an IRC channel with hundreds of participants, it becomes clear that this is not going to be a useful analogy one way or the other, for better or worse. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 12:33, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A useful analogy is chatting around a table. You know who is present, and that they are trustworthy enough not to record your real-time conversation and advertise it elsewhere. If they were to record it, you would not speak freely or comfortably, and you may just go sit at another table altogether. If there is official business to be conducted, it can be done at the <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> table, but if a certain table is logged, people will simply choose to go to an unlogged private table, a private table that may be unsupervised and to which you have no guarantee of entrance. It is one thing to take notes at a board meeting, and another thing entirely to record every business (or totally non-business) lunch and post the transcripts in the company lobby. Surveillance will not solve the alleged problem, it will just send it underground, and has other effects besides. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 22:43, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand that my contributions in IRC are not released. They remain my copyright. If anyone were to log them and offer copies to over 1,000 admins that would surely be a breach of copyright, freenode policy, and the law in certain countries. I would strongly resist that, for a whole host of reasons. With 1,000 potential logs (even if for private use) it would impossible to enforce a 'no publications' rule. If logs are published, then they are searchable. If someone can search through my informal chatting on IRC, then they can almost certainly compromise my pseudonymity. Slim this is dead in the water.

<p>Let me offer my two cents, with the disclaimers that I am an admin but I almost never frequent IRC. I strongly support the notion that IRC logs should be logged and public unless the channel is restricted to a given group, like admins. In that case at the very least the logs should be available to all admins. That said, I do not think that the admin IRC channel should be password protected in the first place; I don't believe that anything we admins discuss needs to be 'secret'. Wikipedia is an open community, and this should apply to all levels of our decision making.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 14:40, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Utterly and absolutely not. When I use IRC, I am chatting informally. I may inadvertently give away personal information. I choose to do that knowing that there are 10-50 people in the room, and I run certain risks with my privacy. My choice. However, if any of 1,000 admins could have the logs, that changes the dynamic: it would then be impossible to prevent logs being published on the web. Personally, I would cease to use the wikipedia IRC channels immediately. Now, no doubt some will say that if people stopped using the admins channel that would be a good thing. Well, think again. The advantage of these channels is that there is a cross-section of Wikipedians in them. They are not a select cabal. If an admin says something inappropriate about user:x, there is a fair chance that someone else will question it. (Indeed, in the recent Giano blocking, bishonen, I and others were in the room and able to question the block, and ultimately have it removed.) If these relatively open IRC channels become totally public, what will happen is that private channels will be used. Admins who are seen as 'hostile' to whatever group controls them will be excluded. There channels exist already. I have occasionally been in them. And the potential for abuse (or at least 'group think' developing) is FAR higher. I'd have to see them become the norm.</dd>

<dd>IRC can be abused, and disastrously. But I've more often seen it used in excellent ways. It can be used to bring together users who only only scream at one another on wiki. It can allow someone considering a course of action to get a sanity check, good advice, or a quick explanation. People are people; media are neutral. The wikipedia IRC channels have the excellence of being more discrete than the open wiki, but more representative than back channels. Let's not wreck that. I respect those who would like all interaction between wikipedian admins to be public, but sorry, it isn't going to happen. Opening the logs of the wikipedia IRC channels will have quite the opposite effect to the one you desire.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 01:22, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes. Or instant messages, or have a private channel on IRC. As a wiki admin, I think I should have the right to view the logs of past IRC admin chat whenever I want to, just as I can view the records of ANI discussions here.

<dd>We may never be able to stop certain people being so childish, but it would at least stop the practice of certain admins using #wikipedia-en-admins as their own cabal playhouse; a place for their "friends" to coordinate actions against their "enemies". I have seen the log where Chairboy's block of Giano was organised, and the behaviour was simply vile - they decided to block him, and then tried to work out how they could nail it on him (I have the logs to prove it, and I'll be damned if I won't post it if I need to - this should not go overlooked because of bureaucracy). It was also striking how suddenly their tone changed to one of politeness and civility when Jimbo entered the channel and brought playtime to an end. Frankly, I think it's about time we dumped the pretension that what goes on in IRC is somehow seperate from that of the project; that conversation makes a damned good case, in my mind, why Chairboy at least, and quite possibly Betacommand, should be desysopped. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 21:46, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your conclusion ill-fits the facts. I'm not disputing that Chairboy et all may have acted totally inappropriately (actually, I can't comment on that, as I missed that bit of the conversation). However, think what happened next. 1) Bishonen was in the channel and objected to what had happened. 2) I called jwales into the channel to get the situation resolved and the block lifter without a wheel-war. Had the admin's channel not existed, or been so public that people felt uncomfortable using it, the IRC conspiracy would almost certainly still have happened, the block would have occurred, but the conversation would not have been heard by independent persons and the block would not have been lifted. Even at its worst (and plenty good goes on in IRC) the admins channel is far better than the alternatives.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup>

<dd>Perhaps so, but #wikipedia-en-admins <i>is</i> being used repeatedly by one clique in this dispute to further their disputes with the other; I saw the same again in action last night. This behaviour should not be tolerated at the best of times, and it should certainly not be tolerated in a major Wikipedia channel. It reflects badly on the project, and leads to good people having good reason to feel threatened in using a channel that is supposed to be for Danny and similar folk to contact other editors in the event of some kind of emergency issue. The fear that people might take bad behaviour underground is not an excuse for letting it go on in public. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 22:17, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But your point is it isn't public enough....or is it that it is public and would be better underground...sorry you're loosing me.

<dd>While I disagree with your assertion, Rebecca, I think this is a fine opportunity to help fix this problem. As I did not coordinate or conspire to block Giano, I would like to formally request that if you feel my actions were improper that you initiate an ArbCom case to that affect. That way, the complete logs could be provided to the ArbCom and the matter could be resolved. I have asked Geogre, Giano, and Bishonen to do this, but they have not for their own reasons. I respect the strength of your convictions, Rebecca, and ask you to step up to the plate so we can fix this. The community is being fractured by this and this drama weakens the goal of producing a world class encyclopedia. If a formal review by uninvolved people is required to resolve the situation, I gladly volunteer for the scrutiny with which it comes. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 22:01, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you. If I thought it would help, I would create the case myself, but I think that would look theatrical. If there is anything I can do to assist, please let me know. I know that I did not collude or conspire to block Giano and that my decision to block him was based completely upon his behavior when I asked him not to attack other users. If the ArbCom feels that I have acted maliciously or with disregard for the project, then I will take whatever lumps they proscribe. The integrity of the project is the most important and anything that distracts from the goal of writing an encyclopedia is a Bad Thing.

<p>Ah, this is being <s>discussed</s> <s>argued about</s> turned into a major dispute here as well. Can't this all be kept in one place? Is there enough of an agreement that something needs to be done to create a proposed policy page, and shunt all the discussion onto that page's discussion page?

<p>Hello. I edited a spelling error in an article on Hemorrhoids. You can find the article at this link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemorrhoid" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemorrhoid" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemorrhoid</a>.</p>
<p>In the section on Squatting, the word "casual" is misspelled, and should actually be "causal." The sentence should correctly read: "Hemorrhoids are very rare in nations where people squat to defecate [3], but this epidemiological argument doesn't necessarily prove a causal relationship." I made the change and marked this as a minor edit since this was simply the correction of a spelling error. A bot immediately changed the correction back to the original content. I'd like to have the bot's edit reversed, and the bot dismantled (okay, just kidding about the dismantling; the bot was just doing its job). Thanks.</p>
<p>By the way I wasn't sure where to report this issue.</p>

The forked article should be speedied and likely will be without intervention, but does this action on the part of Zeq constitute a violation of his probation or is it skirting a violation because while he is being disruptive (creating unnecessary articles) and he is playing around with the contents of the article (copying it into the fork), he is not actually editing the original article proper (i.e. <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a>.) --70.48.71.15 22:52, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not that anybody necessarily cares what I think, but I don't believe that Zeq's creation of an article is a violation of his probation. In any event, I think a more interesting question is, who is User:70.48.71.15, really? I have just a bit of difficulty believing that this is some random anon that started editing today and just happens to know about article-probations that were enacted more than six months ago... especially in light of past sockpuppeting activities in and around the articles in question. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 00:53, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your argument appears to allow the following example:
<ul>
<li>A vandal creates a page with "Jimbo sucks" as the content.</li>
<li>Someone marks the page for speedy deletion.</li>
<li>The vandal claims, "Please keep it for a couple of hours while I improve it. It takes out time to flesh out my idea."</li>

<p>Um ... Fresheneesz has had issues with how he's addressed policy matters in the past. As indicated on the MfD page, while I think parts of his essay could be more tactfully worded, I think putting his thoughts in the form of a self-contained essay rather than using the tactics he's used in the past represents an improvement in user conduct that should be encouraged. I understand that there is strong opposition to the philosophy contained in the essay, which takes an extreme position on the continuum, but comparing the page to a scrawled "Jimbo sucks" is not going to elevant the tone of the discussion here or on the MfD. (Yes, I fully understand that Yuser31415 was pointing out a flaw in the form of the argument rather than making a direct comparison, but my point remains.) <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:26, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

However, creating a page called "jimbo sucks" is obvious slander... which is against policy somewhere. Since my essay is not based on slander - but on serious discussion of the way inclusionism and deletionism works - its not the same thing. I've fixed some of the wording, and I don't think its derisive any more. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 05:07, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you misenterpreted the MfD. I am nominating the page for deletion since it consists of an effort to belittle deletionists and praise inclusionists. With what intent you created the page for is largely unrelevant; instead it is the considerable bias toward inclusionists and your attempt to unify the views of the many thousands of Wikipedians that would disagree with you I dislike. And with all due respect, I would appreciate it if you and I could continue to let the MfD take its course naturally.

<p><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaneshk_9519.html" title="User:Ganeshk">User:Ganeshk</a> has again unleashed his WikiProjectIndia template-adding bot. The bot is tagging hundreds of articles re Bollywood actors and actresses with the India template. Here's an example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Gayatri_Joshi&amp;curid=4466355&amp;diff=96186147&amp;oldid=81955960" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Gayatri_Joshi&amp;curid=4466355&amp;diff=96186147&amp;oldid=81955960" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. The bot was stopped on November 6 and he restarted it on December 23 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Ganeshbot" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Ganeshbot" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>). This is just plain pointless! It fills up the top of the talk page with huge templates (you have to scroll and scroll to get past them into actual discussion) and it's unnecessary. What possible good does it serve, other than the egos of the Indian editors (we own XXX,XXX articles nyah nyah!). This sort of thing spreads. A Pakistani editor tried to claim <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salwar_kameez.html" title="Salwar kameez">Salwar kameez</a> for Pakistan (even though the items of clothing in question are worn in many countries) and one editor insists that <a href="../../../d/h/o/Dhoti.html" title="Dhoti">Dhoti</a> belongs to India and Hinduism. This is bad enough when you have one editor adding project templates one at a time -- fending off an attack by a bot is hopeless. Can we please BAN template-adding bots? And revert the dang bot edits? If it isn't important enough for someone to spend the time to add it by hand, after discussion with the regular editors, then it isn't important to the project. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:47, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see no evidence that the "assessment process" is producing any results. We had a list of "to-do" items at WP:INCINE and the response (even from me, and I should be be more dedicated) has been tepid. WP:INCINE is the project devoted to Indian cinema ... if we can't get editors to work on actor/actress articles, then what good is an India template going to do?</p>
<p>If adding templates doesn't help produce better articles, then it's nothing but ethnic/religious/nationalist tagging of the sort that has mired thousands of articles. Are we adding US templates to all the US actor and actress articles? NO .... but I did find a great example of the idiocy of template-mania: have a look at <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_Clooney_cc18.html" title="Talk:George Clooney">Talk:George Clooney</a>. He hasn't lived in Kentucky since 1982, but someone has claimed him for WikiProject Kentucky.</p>
<p>We let anyone start a project and plaster templates all over heck and gone and there's absolutely no discussion or approval required. This is something that can't be done with links? or even categories? No, we have to have a great big graphic that says "Kilroy wuz here". That's bad enough, but automating it? The last time Ganeshk turned his robot loose, it was tagging articles related to Iranian history with WP:IN templates and the Iranian editors were extremely upset. Please, let's turn off the bot until we can have some high-level decisions about projects. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 02:01, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Ownership" of Indus Valley Civilization is hotly contested subject. Claiming it for India without even considering that this claim might be controversial is thoughtless. It's also not at all clear to me that if someone is an "Indian actor", the Indian part of the concept takes precedence over the actor part. Why pick India, instead of cinema?</p>
<p>Real-life is not a UNIX file structure, with everything neatly hierarchically arranged. A particular article may be relevant to many categories or projects. Grabbing it for ONE project and ignoring any other areas of interest or relevance is provocative. That was exactly what was wrong with the Pakistani editor trying to claim salwar kameez. Since it's provocative, you don't do it by bot. If you want articles assessed, put up a SMALL assessment template, that doesn't claim the article for any one project. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:24, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Who said anything about "ownership" or "claiming"? There's nothing unusual about having multiple projects add their tags to the same article (although you seem to be complaining about this as well?); and all the tags I've seen now say merely that the article is "within the scope" of a particular project, avoiding even the mildly controversial "part of" a project wording used in the past. That Ganeshk is only applying one project's tags is not intended as a slight to other projects; they're perfectly free to add their own tags (or even get a bot to help them do so). (While there have been some bots that have tagged articles with multiple projects' tags in a single run, this usually requires more coordination than it's worth, in my experience.) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 03:33, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zora, Tagging does not mean "ownership" or "grabbing" or "claiming". It means taking responsibility to substantially improve the article to FA-standard. Indian actors are tagged with <code>cinema=yes</code> parameter so that they fall into the Cinema workgroup of the India project. If someone is a Indian actor, both Indian part and the actor part apply.

<dd>There's nothing wrong with the indie bot tagging bollywood stuff. Indian cinema project is listed under the wp india. The actors are also indian. this is perfectly acceptable. As for indus valley civilization, it has the word indus in it. islam and the islamic state of pakistan didn't even exsist. indian women also wear salwar kameez. there's nothing wrong tagging it.--<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDangerous-Boy_5f44.html" title="User:Dangerous-Boy">D-Boy</a> 06:06, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my opinion, the template should be made as small as it could be. If possible, it could have a show/hide option defaulting to hide, so that those not interested see the discussions straight away. I thought adding a project template does not imply ownership, and that articles can be tagged under several different projects. As far as the bot is concerned, since the project templates/assessment, etc. are relatively new things, we do have a big backlog of articles, and so a bot is handy. Of course, merely tagging doesn't achieve much, and it's true that many bot-tagged articles run at the risk of being forgotten again. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 07:21, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Ganesh's and Deepak's comments that template tagging does not mean ownership. The literal meaning would be "This article is associated with this WikiProject." The size ohwever, is a contentious issue. Since some articles will have many templates, a size reduction is inevitable and necessary. As others have mentioned, the bot is extremely efficient compared to humans and only a small proportion of the articles it tags would be considered controversial "taggings." At times you can't blame the bot. Take <a href="../../../d/h/o/Dhoti.html" title="Dhoti">Dhoti</a> as an example. Zora mentioned that Dhotis are worn by people outside of India but the all but one sentence in the entire article talks about Dhotis being worn outside of India and even that sentence is unsourced and randomly inserted. Someone should be <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">bold</a> and write firstly about Dhotis being worn in other parts of the world in Wiki-style. Personally if I read the article, I would have doubted that they are worn outside of India. Most importantly, more than one template can be added, therefore template tagging does not suggest ownership but rather association. <b><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Gizza</font></a></b><i><sup><a href="../../../d/a/g/User_talk%7EDaGizza_180b.html" title="User talk:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Chat</font></a></sup></i> <sup><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DaGizza_583c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DaGizza"><font color="teal">©</font></a></b></sup> 13:12, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ahem these are <i>Indian actors</i> being added with a <i>WP India</i> tag. Its logical. Editors that disagree either have not fully understood the rationale for tagging or have issues that need to be worked out. Judging by the consensus formed (in which only one editor thinks tagging <b>Indian</b> people with a <b>WP India</b> tag is offensive) I think Ganesh's bot should be reinstated with all priviledges, and Zora reprimanded for disruptive behavior and blatant racism.<b><a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman"><font color="purple">Baka</font></a><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman"><font color="red">man</font></a></b> 01:09, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(That's just the last few days. I could get more if I went back further.) If I were a racist, I wouldn't have spent the last few years editing Indian cinema related articles, working on Indian clothing articles, <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desi.html" title="Desi">Desi</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partition_of_India_a525.html" title="Partition of India">Partition of India</a>, etc. If he calls me anti-Hindu and racist, it's in the same partisan spirit that some rightwing US politicians and commentators call their political opponents anti-American and suggest that they're working for Al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>If I'm anti-anything, it's anti-nationalism. Of any kind. I've pulled back from the Iran-related articles because of lack of time and sheer weariness at being the constant object of attack, but when I worked on those, I was regularly accused of being anti-Persian, an Arab-lover or an Arab, etc. We have a problem on WP, in that cadres of patriotic editors (often of one political tendency) stake out their turf and fight off interlopers. It's hard for many US and UK editors to see this, because they may not be familiar with non-US or UK political struggles, and it is easy to believe people who claim to represent a whole ethnicity, nationality, or religion. If it were a US editor showing up and claiming to represent all Americans, he/she would be hooted off the stage with a shower of rotten tomatoes.</p>
<p>It's not just me objecting to the India bot. Others have complained. Ganesh says that he has the best intentions and I just don't understand but ... if various people, who otherwise have had no other association with me, complain about having a huge India template slapped on a talk page without so much as a by-your-leave, then he is doing something that upsets people, and he should reconsider what he's doing.</p>
<p>If articles are to be assessed, I suggest that a simple, tiny box on the article would produce more assessments. Many encyclopedia users don't know that the talk pages exist. Just put up a button that says "Has this article been helpful? Click to assess it." Or some such wording. This would pop up a questionnaire or a rating bar. Start with a few high-traffic pages and experiment with different versions of the questionnaire or bar, until we know what works. As for the templates: if they were one-inch square and stuck off on the right side of the monitor, and said only "Interested in working on other articles related to X? Click here" (click taking you to project page) that might work. Or better yet, just <i>one</i> button that says, "If you'd like to work on more articles like this, click here," and then a menu of related projects would pop up. All the same size. No competition to draw more editors with a bigger template.</p>
<p>There's a great book called <i>The Inmates Are Running the Asylum</i>, about computer interface design. It's tricky stuff, and programmers and systems engineers are notoriously bad at it.

At is still called hijacking history. NEWS TO EVERYONE! there's plenty of room for everyone's tag. pak call the tag offensive. well, you know what, I find the pak tag offensive. they would never change their tag and tag flag off it. seriously, let us be. we don't hurt anyone. India was the country where Gandhi was born. It's people are under attack from islamics, maoist, and some questionable missionaries. The president is muslim, the pm is sikh, and and italian women who never gave up here italian citizenship almost became pm. Also, india tag should be on bollywood articles, because for one thing, bollywood originated in INDIA!

There are a lot of hindu extremists on this board, and with them being members of forums like HinduUnity, you cant possibly call them Neutral in any way.

<p>So how does a republic of India flag make it onto so called "ancient Indian" history articles. Your argument is ridiculous. Just because you havent stolen all of our history doesnt mean you havent stolen most of it. Pakistans flag is just as valid as having an ROI flag. Both countries were born in 1947. And India was never united prior to the British Invasion.

<p>Zora, I had thought about hiding Indian project tag when cinema parameter is set. But this does not work in cases where actors have turned into politicians (<a href="../../../r/a/j/Talk%7ERajesh_Khanna_32cf.html" title="Talk:Rajesh Khanna">Talk:Rajesh Khanna</a>). In these cases, both cinema and politics are set to yes. The India tag is on so that other sub-groups can be tagged to the article talk page. Too many checks make the template complicated and hard to maintain. If template size is an issue, there are ways to make it small. Ideas such as "link-only", "category-only" should be discussed at the Wikipedia-level and not be forced on one project (India in this case).

<dd>Zora, you're completly missing the point. <b>Wikiprojects don't take ownership or claim articles</b> There is no reason an article cannot fall under the scope of Wikiproject India, Wikiproject Iran and Wikiproject Pakistan. The more projects involved in working on an article the better. It seems to me that you're the one imbuing nationalistic overtones into something that should be neutral. 75.105.178.150 16:39, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, thats a long discussion! I think Zora's ire was meant to be vented towards my <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostBot_9e88.html" title="User:LostBot">bot</a> as that is the bot that has been doing most of the tagging of WP India articles. So I am sorry that I took so long to respond. I was off to a Xmas vacation. Hope you all had a great one too!</p>
<p>Now that the discussion has already gone on long enough, can we start moving towards the resolution? I am trying to put down the problems and their solutions point by point:</p>
<ol>
<li>Large templates eating up talk page space: We already have the small template solution for that.</li>
<li>Irrelevant articles getting tagged: Both Ganesh and I exercise extreme caution while tagging articles. We pick them up from categories and leave out ambiguous cats. Errors are however bound to creep in and we can remove them in good faith.</li>
<li>Nationalistic tagging: I told Zora before and I say it again. This is not the Indian government trying to own articles. Wikiprojects exist to give a structure to related articles and that is all that we hope to do apart from giving them more visibility. I am also one of the early members of Wikiproject Pakistan and planning to run my bot for Pakistan related articles as well.</li>
<li>Assessments: There are quite a few people assessing articles even if not at the desired speed. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_India_Outreach_Newsletter_Next_Edition_620e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject India/Outreach/Newsletter/Next Edition">We are trying</a> to get more editors <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_India_Outreach_Newsletter_December_2006_3eff.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject India/Outreach/Newsletter/December 2006">to do it</a>.</li>
<li>Blocking of the bot: I feel blocking of any good faith editor, even a bot, should not take place without discussion. Why block when you can discuss especially when the bot has been <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_Ganeshbot_5b25.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Ganeshbot">specifically approved</a> for this purpose??</li>

<p>Bakaman. That was a start. I clearly remember you saying that there was no such thing as Ancient Pakistan. At least we have made progress. Anyway. I am not talking about a few time empires. I am talking about united as a nation. Ancient Roman empire had the entire Europe united, does that mean they can claim the history of the whole of Europe. According to you, they can. Think about what you are saying. India was only united because of the Brits, and Pakistan didnt stay united with British India for too long. And I distinctly remember Pakistan being part of the Alexanders empire while the rest of India was not. That must clearly mean Greeks can claim the Pakistani history...right? <a href="../../../u/n/r/User%7EUnre4L_fd85.html" title="User:Unre4L">Unre4L</a> 21:19, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
India didnt exist prior to the 1800s. The whole region was SCATTERED with provinces, THERE WAS NO UNITY, so please for the love of god understand, that Ancient India is referring to the entire subcontinent, not a country. And the reason why Pakistani history is different from Indian is because the entire Subcontinents history should not be grouped together. Just like you dont group the entire of Europe's history together. And another reason why this shouldnt be done is because India is now a country, and confusion is created regarding which India ( out of the 10 or so you have in your dictionary) you are referring to. <a href="../../../u/n/r/User%7EUnre4L_fd85.html" title="User:Unre4L">Unre4L</a> 21:19, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please dont throw random figures around in the air. Those numbers mean nothing to me, since people like you are in direct control of them. Empires have risen all over the region. And India wasnt necessarily the middle of them. Pakistan was a part of the Persian empire, but we dont claim to be a part of Iran. I will repeat what I have said at least 100 times before, and you fail to understand. You should know your history better. Its a fact that India did not exists as a country prior to British Raj. The greeks were never good at Geography. They preferred to name continents rather than countries as they didnt care about them. Greeks called Africa, Libya because it was the country they entered first when they went into Africa. India was the same concept to them, the entire region was grouped together. In your mind, the Sindhi's and the Baluchis are Indian? Well guess what, they have never been known as Indian except the British Raj. Yet their history is still classed as Ancient Indian.

<p>Look at the article on <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historiography_and_nationalism.html" title="Historiography and nationalism">Historiography and nationalism</a>. The projection of nations back in time is now viewed with suspicion by a growing number of historians. Neither India nor Pakistan tags belong on ancient history articles. Nor, I think, do Iran tags belong on Achaemenid articles, etc. However, it is going to take time -- a lot of time -- to convince editors to stop distorting ancient history to fit it into nationalistic narratives, especially when many academic historians are still doing this. However, the bot campaign that sparked my complaint was not aimed at history articles, but actor/actress articles. I do not see why Indian actor/actresses should be annexed into the India-project empire. Actor/actresses from other countries aren't being tagged in this way. I don't think it makes any SENSE to divide up all of WP along nationalistic/ethnic/religious lines. Especially when actors and actresses travel widely and work on projects in various countries. This hasn't been the case with Indian actors/actresses, but it's starting to be. Aishwarya Rai, for one, is acting in non-Indian films.</p>
<p>I'm starting to see the project tags as spamming. What are they but invitations from one or more people who have declared a "project" to get others to join the project? Big splashy ads, that's what they are. Note that when I say this, I'm condemning myself too, since I started a WikiProject (WP:INCINE) and acquiesced when Ganeshk started putting up tags for it. I don't think the projects are a bad idea, if they give people working on similar articles (similar being loosely defined) a forum for discussion, but advertising for them is a blight on WP.</p>
<p>Instead of filling up talk pages with competing ads, how about my suggestion that we have just one button that says, "Click here if you'd like to work on other articles like this"? That would pop up a page of ads for projects. All the same size and format. Arranged alphabetically, so that there's no squabbling about getting top billing. Then another button for assessments. Don't link the assessments to projects -- that's giving projects, and the people behind the projects, "ownership" of the articles. All you need is another button that says, "Click here to assess the current state of this article." Two small buttons. Each an inch or so square. One on the right, one on the left. A big improvement on the Times Square billboards that greet editors now.</p>
<p>I'm going to start pushing for this in various fora. In the meantime, please keep national bots out of actor/actress articles. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 02:21, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

First, every single project can make an assessment, both of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Assessment_0e4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment">quality</a> and of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Release_Version_Criteria_a3de.html#Importance_of_topic" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Release Version Criteria">priority</a>. Those assessments do <b>not</b> have to match, as an article that covers a broad subject can be of great quality in one aspect, but deficient in another. Moreover, it is very, very common to have the importance/priority assessments be different. Then, different projects have different parameters and different methods to process articles. One single template cannot conceivably accomplish all the things the various WikiProject banners can do.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps, the best solution will come once Stable Versions are enabled, and metadata can be stored directly on the database.

<p>It's hard for me to believe that "it can't be done". How about this: we have a new tab on the bar on the top. Right now there's five. We can add a sixth, for templates. Call it "Relevant projects" or something like that. Again, all templates to be the same SMALL size and arranged alphabetically. That's a very top-level hack that shouldn't be too hard. I've noticed -- and imitated -- something similar to this, on user pages. When barnstars start taking up too much room, you put them on a separate page and add a link. Heck, add another tab, for "Assess article". Tabs instead of buttons. OK? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:08, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Such a change would probably be handled best as a separate metadata <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Namespace" class="extiw" title="m:Help:Namespace">namespace</a>, which would then be obsoleted quickly once Stable versions are [finally] enabled. Then, all of the metadata in pages (not just WikiProject banners, but things such as {{<a href="../../../f/e/a/Template%7EFeatured_8cc7.html" title="Template:Featured">featured</a>}}) would need to be moved to that namespace. Ideally, this should have a much more technical solution on the MediaWiki core level... it would be nice if getting a metadata field in the <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/revision_table" class="extiw" title="mw:revision_table">revision table</a> were an idea that gathered enough steam. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 08:16, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yep, it would need to be a new namespace (which would entail having the developers do stuff). A "metadata" namespace might be feasible, I suppose; but it seems to be a layout isse rather than a conceptual one. Hence, the obvious question: what is the perceived problem with the "small" option on the templates? (It should be pointed out that it would be quite feasible to have all the various talk-page templates display <i>only</i> in the small option, or display in the small option by default, rather than having to enable it. We can certainly reduce the size of the templates and move them off to the side of the page without any complicated namespace shuffling. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 18:45, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Zora, while I have no issues keeping a bot out of ambiguous articles such as Indus Valley etc, I disagree with you about the Indian actors tagging. The simple fact is that WP:INCINE is a child project of both WP:INDIA and WP:CINEMA. WP:INDIA can be considered a child project of WP:COUNTRIES and so on. What's different between Indian actors, politicians, doctors or any other profession? There are many other country based projects. See the huge list <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Council_Directory_Geographical_9ab6.html#Countries" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Geographical">here</a>. What is special about the India project that makes it nationalistic? <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;aq=t&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLJ,GGLJ:2006-38,GGLJ:en&amp;q=define%3anationalistic" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;aq=t&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLJ,GGLJ:2006-38,GGLJ:en&amp;q=define%3anationalistic" rel="nofollow">Nationalistic</a> is a negative word according to Google.

<dd>I object strongly to having notable people routinely classified by nationality (or ethnicity, or religion). If you want to put articles related to history, government, and cities under the India project, fine. If you want to put articles related to the movie industry in India under the India project, fine. The film industries have to function under Indian government rules. Trying to grab anything and anyone related to India for the project is offensive to me -- especially when it results in large flag-bedecked ads being inserted into the talk pages. If we don't insist on classifying <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna (entertainer)</a> by nationality (UK?

<dd>Nationalistic project tagging in South Asia-related articles is just out of hand. I've been quietly working on various South-Asian related clothing articles for years, and now we have attempts to grab <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salwar_kameez.html" title="Salwar kameez">Salwar kameez</a> for Pakistan, and <a href="../../../d/h/o/Dhoti.html" title="Dhoti">Dhoti</a> not only for India, but for Hinduism. This is just nuts. If the Scottish editors here have refrained from trying to tag <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilt.html" title="Kilt">Kilt</a> for Scotland, then surely the South Asian editors can leave the blankety-blank clothing articles alone.

<dd>Zora, you need to give some valid reasons as to why exactly you <i>object strongly</i> to having the templates on the talk pages and what exactly is offensive to you. The only reason you repeat is that you dont like seeing large templates on the talk pages. For one Madonna, there are many other actors that are tagged by nationality. See <a href="../../../n/i/c/Talk%7ENicole_Kidman_1d97.html" title="Talk:Nicole Kidman">Talk:Nicole Kidman</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/a/Talk%7EHeath_Ledger_bbe9.html" title="Talk:Heath Ledger">Talk:Heath Ledger</a> to name just a few. I cant understand why you must object only to actors? And I cant understand what nationalistic motives you see behind the tagging. As far as your thoughts about project tags being ads, thats a much larger issue, and others have been patiently explaining you about the small templates. You may like to take it up at <a href="../../../c/o/u/WP%7ECOUNCIL_bae4.html" title="WP:COUNCIL">WP:COUNCIL</a> but please give some valid reasons here about why one must not go ahead with taggging of actors by nationality — <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush"><font color="olive"><b>Lost</b></font></a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 06:16, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I, and others, have said that using talk pages for project spam is offensive. It takes up the prime area of the page for advertising. Too bad that you don't see a dislike for advertising as valid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't care as much if the advertising were off on another page, where it didn't blare out at you every time you opened a talk page. Categories don't shout the same way. I rarely get upset over categories, but the project ads are right in your face.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for tagging by nationality -- you referenced the talk pages for two actors, and both talk pages are full of passionate arguments about why this tagging is right/wrong. Nationality isn't simple, which is why you have arguments. Actors are a particularily mobile bunch. If someone has two passports and homes in several countries, what nationality is he/she? What nationality is Madonna? Please, leave the actor articles out of national and regional tagging projects. (Having the Hawai'i project tag slapped on Nicole Kidman is just ridiculous. I live here and I've never even seen her name in the local paper. Does she have a second home here or something?) <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 10:07, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been watching this go on for a while now, and I've got one question: What exactly is the problem? If someone adds a template to a talk page to signify that it is involved with a WikiProject, that does nothing wrong. I recently reverted Zora's removal of the {{<a href="../../../w/p/_/Template%7EWP_Pakistan_baab.html" title="Template:WP Pakistan">WP Pakistan</a>}} tag from the talk page of the article of what is explicitly stated to be the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salwar_kameez.html" title="Salwar kameez">national dress of <b>Pakistan</b></a>. There is nothing wrong with what Ganeshk or anyone else is doing in tagging articles with the tag of the correct WikiProject. There are hundreds of other issues to be dealing with right now, like <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">improving an article</a>, and I must say that keeping tags off of talk pages should not be at the list of things to do on Wikipedia.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 10:19, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ryulong, you've opened Pandora's box here. I've been working on a fair number of costume articles, for years, and they typically don't have national tags plastered on them. Your reversion to the Pakistan tag has resulted in the addition of an India tag <i>on top of it</i> and a revision of the categories on the bottom of the article so that India is on top. Anupam tried alphabetizing the categories but no, our Indo-Pak warriors won't have that. I anticipate years of discord as Indo-Pak editors play tag wars on any article remotely related to South Asia. Dangerous-boy left this message for me on my talk page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZora&amp;diff=97126626&amp;oldid=97012518" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZora&amp;diff=97126626&amp;oldid=97012518" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. Apparently the sight of Pakistan's crescent flag is just too much for some people. Flags are bad things to put on articles or article talk pages. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 18:13, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's getting worse. D-Boy added India to the categories and the India tag to the talk page, so Ryulong deleted the India categories and the Indian tag. This is nuts! I restored the India categories and removed the Pakistani tag too. Could we have a special task force dedicated to policing Indo-Pak conflicts online? We have groups of extremely nationalistic editors using WP articles as battlegrounds. Many articles. Handling this piecemeal is not handling it. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:00, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh dear, this is again moving off topic. Zora, let me repeat that I have no issues keeping my bot out of ambiguous articles. I would also have no issues if there was consensus not to have any wikiproject templates at all. However, I do have issues if you single out overtly India related articles (in this case Indian actors) and create a controversy where there is none. And there is no Indo Pak war on. The nature of Wikipedia is such that there will be disagreements if an issue is controversial and we already have ways for dispute resolution and are also clear on how to deal with edit warring. But let me request you again to address only the issue of a bot tagging overtly India related articles — <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush"><font color="olive"><b>Lost</b></font></a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:50, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I saw you removed the WP:PAKISTAN tag from an article that says it is involved with Pakistan and I reverted it, and I removed India because I did not read the article entirely, but then reverted both you and myself on that page. People are not fighting over what article belongs to what nationality. They are just tagging based on nationality or cultural identity. If there was a Punjabi WikiProject (not that I know that there may be), there would be a tag on the Punjab article for both that and WP:INDIA. An article on an Indian actor would be affiliated with WP:INDIA just like <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhi.html" title="Gandhi">Gandhi</a>'s.

<dd>For actors, these are just two random ones that I clicked on. I can give you many other examples.

<p>Anyone who disagrees with Bakaman is automatically a "racist" or "anti-hindu",wheather it's me or Zora or anyone else.And yes Bakaman purposefully gets Indian administrators to ban users who insult India or Hindusism.These administrators go to the extenct of banning them for a week.When Bakaman could have gone to a neutral administrator and given him a link to a Hindi dictionary.But the reason why Bakaman goes to Indian administrator for help is quite obvious. <a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadirali_c5a5.html" title="User:Nadirali">Nadirali</a> 21:01, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's really funny being called "a racist" by a person like Bakaman(the true racist)."You reffer to some textbooks as your sources"(thus branding anyone who disagrees with her as a madrassa fanatic)Just read what she says up there."Its not unlike you atried to rope in User Ragib for a pan-Islamic bond".Anyways I have no intention in the future with interacting with trolls like Bakaman or Kumernator or the rest of the gang.I don't really care about getting banned by some biased or nationalistic administrator as Unre4L did.But trolls like these are just not worth a good reason for getting banned. <a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadirali_c5a5.html" title="User:Nadirali">Nadirali</a> 00:42, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
