<p>If you wanted to get rid of an editor, man, this would be an awesome resource. Go straight to a list of people who have already identified themselves as being willing to make a "difficult" block, request that your chosen enemy be terminated for such and such pretext of a reason, and <i>presto</i>!</p>
<p>You all are looking at it the wrong way. Instead of gathering all the harshest admins together and organizing them, why not think about the whole concept behind the thing? Your average J. Q. Vandal has neither the will or intelligence to pursue any serious harassment. Who are these people that engage in harassment? I hypothesize that they are typically editors with strong POVs, who get involved in some shitstorm or another, let their tempers get the better of them...what's the best way to deal with these people? Is it really to go to the hardcore sysop brigade for prompt resolution? To me, this is another step in a slide towards blocking editors outside of process for flimsy reasons. People who make threats should have a hard time figuring out who to concentrate their threats on, because there should be a significant number of people involved in some reasonable process that ends in their blockingâ€”and moreover, you give people a fair shot, talking calmly and sympathetically to them, you're probably pretty likely to avoid needing to block anyway, and harassment never becomes a serious issue. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:56, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see this as list of the "harshest admins". At least I don't see myself as particularly harsh. I signed myself up because when I saw the sad Gator1 case, I wished I had been the one making his blocks since it would have saved him all the mess it got him into, and I would have been practically immune to the same myself. Of course, Gator1 could have asked me (or anyone else) to block the trouble user if he suspected something like this would happen, but making such a request, ask for someone else to do their dirty work so to say, could be perceived as being rude and he really wouldn't know who it was ok to ask. With a list like this he'd know. I would gladly have made that obvious block for him, and I wouldn't lose any sleep (or my day time job) because of it. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 06:05, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I concur with Shanes comments on this matter. I can see Everyking's point about out of process blocks...in all liklihood though, if the situation is such that a "tough" admin is requested by another admin, then adequate links to support the rationale should be all that is necessary. In the case of a nonadmin making the request, I think the page should ask them instead to report the situation to AN/I, AN or 3RR depending on the situation. This would help ensure out of process blocks would not happen I would hope. I personally have little belief that if an admin were to contact another admin listed here, that there would be much reason to believe that the blocked editor had any reason to edit this site. We don't have to tolerate any harassment here or outside of Wikipedia as a byproduct of our good intentions to protect the project and it's editors.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 06:26, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, let me say that I agree with a power structure that can block from on high, especially regarding folks who do the absurd and try to affect real life identities. Second, let me say that I endorse and support everyone who has created and signed up for this page. That said, my first thought was, "Let's rename it Wikipedia <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Chamber_beb6.html" title="Star Chamber">Star Chamber</a>." Please do not misconstrue what I am about to say as any indication that I don't agree with the brave and noble folks involved in this.</p>
<ol>
<li>The real life stalking and harassment we have seen is effective exactly to the degree that our real world employers and associates are fearful and uncomprehending, and, until our own real world employers and associates understand the Internet and the rule that one in a hundred users is crazy and one out of a hundred of them is dangerously crazy, we're <i>all</i> susceptible. Unless we are retired, we're susceptible <i>in the future</i> for what we do now, so the young admins need to know that.</li>
<li>The stalking and harassment cases are sometimes dangerous to employment, and we probably need an indemnification or general form letter of support from the WikiMedia Foundation that can be sent to attest nobility and worth that can be mailed in any such case, if desired.</li>
<li>Employment issues are going to be rare, although quite serious, but the threats of physical violence, sexual harassment, and harassing e-mail (real harassment, not whining...just ask some of the female Wikipedians who have experienced it), "outing," and other forms of psychological and physical assault are another level and possibly as common. (Once they cross the line from "crank" to "dangerous crank," there's no telling whether they'll go all the way to "criminal" or stop at "aggravating.") While having brave admins willing to risk contact (folks administering their own domain are in a good position, as they can blacklist without asking and change e-mail account on a dime) is great, such cases as these require a truly anonymous and truly impenetrable identity.</li>
<li>Some of these things (#3, e.g.) require <b>fast</b> response, as in "within 24 hours." We have had a Wikipedia admin who had his opponents show up in his dormitory room and threaten physical violence, for example. He was able to have the police arrest them, but he had to do that because they had found him and lived in the same city. It's a crap shoot whether your harasser lives in your city or not. If you live in NYC or London, there's not a bad chance that they do. If you live in <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surprise%2C_Arizona_4eb0.html" title="Surprise, Arizona">Surprise, Arizona</a>, there's a good chance they have to travel too far to bother you.</li>
<li>Therefore, I recommend, in all seriousness, a Wikipedia:Emergency injunction that is straight to ArbCom and, most specifically, the Foundation and/or Jimbo. Since we have these clerks hanging around, let's give them something to do and let them act as triage, but <i>only if turnaround is less than 24 hours.</i> If there is an emergency injunction necessary, we should have a set of automatic responses, really, possibly including
<ol>
<li>Letter of support</li>
<li>Contacting the abusive ISP</li>
<li>Contacting jurisdictional law enforcement</li>
<li>Creating a block from an impersonal Foundation identity</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>These would be reactive, I realize, and wouldn't stop the first contact, but they would offer quick and monolithic support. There is probably no way to stop the first contact, the first threat, the first approach, while remaining Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, these are the ideas that occur to me, and, again, please, please do not let this get folks to think that I am not supportive nor to get us off topic and off track. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:56, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Myself, as long as I use my real name it doesn't matter how much personal information I reveal.

<p>I don't see how a dangerous cases for an Admin would be different for another? This issue is about privacy, if some sick POV pusher will go on threatning an Admin, that this Admin is ready to take the risk won't change anything. I think there is a lot better solution, problematic cases could be blocked by an anonymous admin. If a cases becomes out of control and someone start making threats, the admins involved in administring the article in question could request in a private mailing list only accessible to Admins the article to be administred by an anonymous admin, from the maining list a number of Admin(excluding the one that place the request) volonteer to run an anonymous administrator account. Those accounts could be called something like admin001, admin002 etc. and their passwords reset after each uses. If there is an abuses by one of the anonymous admins, or a precieved abuse, a user can always report let say admin002 and the edits. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 03:16, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Ghost Admin idea is one I toyed with before I wrote what I did, above. There is a problem with having a Ghost Admin as a first responder, though: it's pretty contrary to Wikipedia. Basically, anyone getting molested <i>short of a ban</i> already has solutions in having others take a look. We're trying to find out what to do when the block/ban itself results in the harassment. The best I can come up with is a WikiMedia account (so it's not anonymous but rather official), and that would need process to ensure that it was not abused, and that's why I suggested an emergency injunction system: there would be a system in place and yet the result would be an official action, and a <i>set</i> of actions that would be uniform enough to take the legs out of any "favoritism" and "POV clique" argument. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:31, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do agree with you, but unless I have not understood exactly what you meant, 3/4 of the points you proposed are rather acting after something like this happen rather than prevention. I think the best bet would be to concentrate more on preventing things like this to happen than placing all or most the ressources on the 'acting after the event.' <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 20:19, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not an admin, and I think the block I'm requesting here is "difficult" for other reasons than the ones mentioned on this project page thus far.</p>
<p>Nonetheless if this would lead to a block it would be a "difficult block". The issue below has also been reported on:</p>

<p>Could:</p>

<li>The list then be sorted alphabetically by the admin's name?</li>

<p>Might as well be open about the fact I removed Essjay from the list. Seems simple and straightforward enough, because he can nolonger block anybody.
