<p><b>Started 2006.01.17 17:39</b></p>
<p>There are many opinions regarding adminship held by a variety of people, and a number of perennial complaints about adminship or the related procedures. Several issues have been debated to death a number of times already, and there seem to exist good arguments on both sides of the issues. This <b>straw poll</b> seeks to find out if a substantial majority of editors believes that certain changes should be made to our procedure or precedent.</p>
<p><b>This is NOT a policy proposal, nor is this poll in any way binding</b>. This is a gauge of public sentiment. However, if public sentiment is that a certain policy would be beneficial, effort can be made towards creating a policy proposal. Voting may be evil but learning public opinion is not. If a public opinion is obvious, people may want to take it into account for their future actions or judgments.</p>
<p>This poll consists of a number of statements that people can express agreement or disagreement with. Feel free to comment on your opinion. I've attempted to compile all frequently-expressed statements; that should not imply that I agree with any or all of them. If I've missed a couple, please let me know. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 17:39, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I've recently seen an admin with 2,000+ edits ousting from Wikipedian an editor with 50,000+. This is just inacceptable. It's very easy to amass several thousand edits, posting flattering messages on talk pages, get promoted to adminship and start to intimidate those wikipedians who really write this encyclopaedia.

<li>Yes, please. Too many admins seem to take their status as a license to role-play (which is much easier than writing articles to academic standards) and there is no doubt many are elected by groups of friends who approach Wikipedia more as a community website for social interaction rather than an encyclopedia. Personally, I don't think admins should be elected by the online mob, but should be appointed by bureaucrats, according to academic reliability and trustworthiness, who've been carefully selected for the task by Wales. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Witch_eb39.html" title="User:The Witch">The Witch</a> 19:27, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would support raising the standards, but I'd like to ensure that the standards do not cause any current admins to be de-adminned. Myself and plenty of other great vandal-fighters, policy people, etc. clearly do not meet the standards that are being bandied about by a group of people. I'd rather not see a bunch of great admins lose their powers because all of a sudden we need to be more strict about who has the power. <a href="../../../m/o/0/User%7EMo0_25cf.html" title="User:Mo0">Mo0</a>[<a href="../../../m/o/0/User_talk%7EMo0_eb76.html" title="User talk:Mo0">talk</a>] 22:32, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes. We have people who were adminned after only a month or two with the project. 6 months to a year of solid edits plus good judgement on policy matters would be much more suitable. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 15:08, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe that there should definitely be a minimum length of time in order for one to be even nominated an admin. Also too much weight is given on the edit counts.

<li>Higher standards indeed. Length of time and significant (not just 20,000 commas or welcome messages) edits should be included in some sort of standard for RfA. But there should also be wiggle room for people to vote their gut feelings. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">talk</a>)</small> 22:07, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not higher "official" standards, but I think many of the regular RFA voters need to have higher "personal" standards.

<li>Yes. Setting the cutoff higher will mean that only admins who have never done anything controversial (and who therefore have probably never done anything important) will make it. Instead, voters should rethink their standards, focusing more on responsibility and accountability and less on edit counts and conflicts from the past that people will dredge up. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">ɹəəds</span><span style="color: #63f;">ɹ</span></a> 21:29, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

This problem would be lessened if there were several levels or types of adminships - there's no obvious reason why "the mop" must be paired with the ability to take disciplinary action. It's unrealistic to expect admins to be equally competent in all things.Timothy Usher 23:24, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Are there even any official standards for becoming admin? The only standards that matter for adminship are personal and community standards (rough lower limit on edit count, stuff like that). Thus I'm leaving this comment in this section and not the one above. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 23:38, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Agree.</b> As a person who's been told to "f*** off" by an administrator who then proceeded to blank my comments on his talk page, I think that administrators need morality. - <a href="../../../k/o/o/User%7EKookykman_8247.html" title="User:Kookykman">Kookykman</a>|<a href="../../../k/o/o/User_talk%7EKookykman_d743.html" title="User talk:Kookykman"><font color="black">(t)</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><i>e</i></font></a> 18:23, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>There is no real need to mess with the standards of promotion. We get plenty of good candidates and most of them go off to benefit the encyclopedia. The real problem is that it is too tedious to deal with that small minority who after becoming admins fail to adhere to community standards for someone in that position. Hence standards keep going up to try to avoid those problems, but ultimately that's like trying to cure a hangnail by cutting off one's hand. If admins were more accountable for their behavior, it would be much easier to regard promotion as "no big deal". <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 19:47, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think this should be a separate issue. And I don't see anything defining this. It's all very warm-and-fuzzy, but can't be useful without defining "accountable". <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">Avriette</a> 20:07, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sure. If standards would be higher we would lose many good potential admins. But accountability should also be higher for administrators. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 20:11, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Absolutely. If we didn't have to worry that we were effectively promoting administrators for life, there wouldn't be as much concern about the possibility of a bad promotion. A sensible, community-oriented de-adminship process is <i>necessary</i> to ensure that adminship remains "no big deal". <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 20:18, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I hesitantly agree.

<li>I think this is a better view of this part than standards per se. 1000 edits and 2 months are enough, if they are GOOD edits and if the person was REALLY paying attention. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:26, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Adminship should be no big deal, and a person who has proven him- or herself responsible can be trusted with the tools.

<li>Ditto Sjakkalle.

<li>Agree with this viewpoint as well, though I think the requirements for starting a deadmin process should be non-trivial. I wouldn't want an army of sockpuppets being able to deadmin someone who blocked a POV-pusher for borderline incivility, for example (this example is not as clearcut as, say, blocking a blatant vandal). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 16:46, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Precisely what DF said. The vast majority of admins are unobjectionable, and many who are objectionable probably could not have been weeded out early on.

<li>I entirely agree with the posters above.

<li>Definitely need more accountability. It should be easier to put an admin on probation, and easier for a user to see who is an admin, and where to complain.

<li>Definitely. It's sometimes hard to play a psychic in discerning whether someone would make a great admin in the future.

<li>Exactly. We need more admins, if anything we should be lowering standards. Raising demands only contributes further to the perception of admins as an elite class.

<li>Sarcasm aside, there are no established admin standards. Some admins are less than pleasant to deal personally while they preform admin tasks (or one admin task) flawlessly.</li>
<li><b>Admins are not examples to the wikipedia community</b>, admins can make errors. Adminship is NO BIG DEAL, do <font color="red"><b><u>NOT</u></b></font> make it a big deal.</li>
<li>Admins are, simply put, people with greater access to wikipedia tools such as the ability to delete pages or block users. Almost anything an admin preforms is "revertable" with the exception of media (images) (and several other things I am not comfortable enough to discuss as after all they are vunrabilities/bugs etc.).</li>

</li>
<li>Because we <i>don't</i> have official standards, the "unofficial" standards will be set by Wikipedians and will evolve over time, as it has already. I trust that this will continue to do so; we are already (for the most part) nominating good Wikipedians deserving of adminship. <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> <small>(<a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a>)</small> 23:19, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: For my personal standards: 1) the editor should have been around long enough and done enough edits in a variety of areas on the Wikipedia so that I have a reasonable confidence in their ability to use the added <i>privileges</i> of being an admin without causing problems. 2) The should have a broad range of experience editing both the project namespace and the Wikipedia namespace, and will have explored many of the nooks and crannies on the Wikipedia, so that they will have the knowledge of most of the Wikipedia <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">Rules and guidelines</a>, as well as some of the unwritten procedues and traditions, so that they don't get into trouble when they start using their new admin "powers". If they don't meet those two requirements, in my opinion, they aren't ready to be an admin. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 23:54, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think understaning of the blocking policy is essential. Discussions regarding unjustified lengthly or indefinite blocks, or blocking users essentially for disagreeing with an admin in a content dispute are frequent at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>. Some candidates are asked questions like "when would you block / not block?" at RFA, but some aren't. I think that there should be some mechanism to check the candidate's understanding of blocking (and protection) policy. A couple of questions, for example. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConscious_cf76.html" title="User:Conscious">Conscious</a> 10:20, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As there are no set standards, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense. However, what I've seen of personal standards are often far too high (or terribly illogical). I'd support seeing the b-crat being given wide latitude to interpret RFA results (dismissing obvious bias votes, or votes where the only justification is non-sensical). This would encourage people to carefully consider their votes lest they be discounted by the closing b-crat. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 08:24, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I disagree with most of the comments in "agree" because they equate edit counts and duration on the site with "standards". "Standards" should be quality of edits, quality of debate, intellect, maturity, communication skills, number of <i>hours</i> spent on the site. Raise standards in a meritocratic way? Quite possibly. Impose a mandatory number of edits? No. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 12:43, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>What standards?</b> -- Nominations succeed or fail based on an amazingly wide range of criteria. Each RfA regular has his or her own private standards but they are all over the map. "The standards for becoming an admin should be higher than they are now" -- this implies that there <i>are</i> current, generally-accepted standards; but there are not. If you allow me to restate the proposition as "There should be general standards for admin nominees" then I'll agree -- but I would not support particularly high explicit standards. Different kinds of editors perform well (or poorly) as admins and any strict standard will probably include rouges and exclude potentially useful mop-wielders. Without a doubt: <b>No fixed, official edit count minimum for nominees</b>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">John&#160;</a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reid_5801.html" title="User talk:John Reid">Reid</a> 02:17, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The number of edits is important, but also the type of edits.

<li>The standards for new users should not be very high, but I think admins should definitely be allowed to vote.

<li>I feel there should be some standard; people who do not understand the responsibilites adminship entails should not be voting.

<li>I'd like to see a minimum number of <i>recent</i> edits to keep out users who stopped editing ages ago, but who make a surprise appearance for the sole purpose of voting against someone they had a fight with.

<li>I support some sort of standard, but only a very low one. At the same time, I strongly oppose any strictly editcount based system, editcounts are extremely misleading. At the same time, any other system would probably me too complex. To prevent sockpuppetry, I say only count votes from users with contributions at least three days prior to the nomination. Otherwise, give the bureaucrats the discretion to evaluate voters. Still, allow comments, but not necessarily votes, from any user. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 21:19, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, I would say that they atleast have the experience of a couple of One Month and say 30 edits. I say one month, because if the min. limit is below that, it will not be too much of a problem for users to create multiple accounts and support themselves.If it is reater than a month, it will be quite irritating for a user to mmake multiple acounts a month in advance, and then wait a month before putting up a RFA.This will discourage sock-puppetting.What do you say?<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctor_Evil_2dce.html" title="User:Doctor Evil">Doctor Evil</a> 21:07, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm with <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> on this one: a very low threshold, sufficient to eliminate the obvious sockpuppets, isn't a bad idea, but that's <i>all</i> it should be.

<li>In effect there are now, as annons and compelte new uers are likely to be disregarded -- these should be made more explicit. 100 edits and 1 month sounds not unreasoanble to me, but any figure is somewhat arbitrary. However, users without suffferage should be aallowed and encouraged to comment, and particularly to draw attention to any problems that they had with the candidate, or on the other hand any particularly positive interactiosn that they had. This should ideally refer to specific events, for which diffs could in priciple be found (although a relative newcommer might not be skilled at providing diffs so they shouldn't be required). <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:34, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree that there should be some suffrage amount, but it should be fairly low. I like the 100 edits / 1 month number.

<li>Perhaps a bit low, but seems like a starting point that might reach consensus. While the arguments below regarding the b-crat's responsibility to check for sockpuppets and low-edit/low-activity voters are fine in theory, in practice it is hard to imagine them checking every single voter.

<li>Interesting, but the ranks of the administrators include most of Wikipedia's most involved editors. While it would certainly prevent an "old boys club" mentality, it would disenfranchise a very knowledgeable and important faction. Some part of me likes the idea, but I'm very conflicted. Perhaps we could, this is just a random idea, create two voting sections on RfA. One for admins, one for non-admins. Then at the end, we could attach percentages to both of the vote counts to arrive at a final tally (perhaps 70% for the non-admins 30% for the admins.) Under the mentioned percentages, a debate might end with a tally of 20/10/5 for the non-admins and 15/5/1 for the admins, this would produce a final, adjusted tally of 18.5/8.5/3.8 (I think that math's right). <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 21:29, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongly disagree</b>. First, RfA is not a vote, but a consensus building mechanism.

Second, any attempts at stratifying the community of Wikipedia beyond "editor" leads to significant problems not the least of which is most likely impacting the pool of volunteers...which we ALL are.

<li><b>Strong disagree</b>. Obviously sockpuppets should be damned to hell. But suffrage rules are bound to center on two things: editcountitis and months of membership. Both have <b>nothing</b> to do with whether you should vote or not. Hell, I've edited as an anon for some time, I knew most of the policies before making an account, but by suffrage rules I probably wouldn't be able to vote!! The problem is not new users; stupid votes just come from stupid people, and any open society has quite a few of those around.

<li>I strongly agree with Lar on this not just in RFA polls but in all our polling scenarios. Strikeouts are perceived as confrontational and are frequently misunderstood. A comment achieves the same end but does so in a way which is perceived as adding facts to the discussion.

<li>If you feel the need to comment on something, do so.

<li>Agree with what people have already said. Who is to judge whether or not something is in "bad faith".

<li>Bad faith votes speak volumes about the voter, not the votee. It should be the goal of a responsible Wikipedian to weed out the bullshit.

<li>Striking out other people's words has the connotation of effacing or vandalizing them -- in the real-world sense of "vandalizing", not specifically the Wikipedia sense.

<li>Personally, I am not a fan of completely discounting any vote (other than sockpuppets). But a user who votes against almost every candidate or votes against without providing any reasoning, or votes in favour of almost every user without providing any reasoning, then there's no need to give further consideration to their vote in the event of a close call.

<li>This is kind of vague. There's no way to group 800 or so administrators and rate them as one group; indubitably, there will be people that think certain administrators are "satisfactory" while others are "unsatisfactory". <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> <small>(<a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a>)</small> 23:24, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Almost all of the administrators on the English Wikipedia do a very good job. The problem is that roughly 1% of them cause way more than their share of problems—sometimes from their regular editing on the Wikipedia, and sometimes from their actions as administrators. Eventually every one of the problem admins will do enough that the ArbComm will have no choice but to de-admin them, but until then there will be huge amounts of time wasted discussing those admins at WP/AN, at WP:AN/I, in RFCs, etc. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 00:21, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ditto BlankVerse. For every "rogue" admin we hear of, there are probably at least a half dozen out there doing a brilliant job. Are there terrible admins? Yes. But are there also good admins?

<li>Ditto BlankVerse too. The problem is, which 1% is it? I suspect my list of the 8 "worst" isn't going to match anyone else's. But I am in awe of the vast majority of admins who seem to do a lot of thankless and hard work on a regular basis and I'm glad they all care enough to keep doing it. Even if I think there is a need for some change. I'm not sure this is a meaningful question, though. Do we want to list off who we think is bad?

<li><i>Deadminship</i> should be more easy. This will discourage inaproporate usage of admin power such as locking a page and making pov edits (not particularly accusing anyone but such stuff has happened). Having said that, this system should not allow trolls to have another playground. Should be an arbcom-like community determining in my view (how about burocrats making the review? They have the power to deadmin after all right?). This poll (Discussion (job performance)) is flawed. Out of the 800+ some are more than decent, while some sucks or are inactive (why do they still have admin level access?

<li>Absolutely agree. This is probably the most important of the proposals on this page. Admins are the public "face" of the Wikipedia, they are some of the most active editors on the Wikipedia, they are the ones responsible for enforcing Wikipedia Rules and guidelines, and <i>they should know better</i>! Also see the comments on my <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse">talk page</a> for more of my opinions on the matter. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 18:37, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem that I see right now with the Wikipedia is that exactly the opposite is happening. If you've been here a long time, you've are given lots of slack for any of your misbehavior. Look at <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">User:Ed Poor</a>, for the prime example, who was given enough rope to eventually hang himself (figuratively). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 19:07, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think this is the biggest issue facing Wikipedia currently. Admins should be held to <i>at least</i> the same standards as regular users. When an admin and a regular user both violate 3RR, civility, NPA, harassment, or whatever... but only the user gets blocked (or the admin gets unblocked quickly) it sends a terrible message. Admins should not be required to be perfect, but they must not be held to a <b>lower</b> standard of behaviour than everyone else. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 18:51, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The name alone implies higher standards which should be maintained, though in practical concerns (1RR, 2RR?) I'm not sure what that higher standard should be. --<i><a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7EReflex_Reaction_620a.html" title="User:Reflex Reaction"><b>Reflex Reaction</b></a></i> (<a href="../../../r/e/f/User_talk%7EReflex_Reaction_64a3.html" title="User talk:Reflex Reaction">talk</a>)• 18:53, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The problem is that admins currently may do whatever they want without any fear of being defrocked. I know admins guilty of copyvios, gratuitously unblocking vandals of their own nationality, intimidating other editors, indulging in wheel wars, inserting "fuck off" in every other edit summary, etc, etc. This is a profanation. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> | <a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">talk</a> 19:00, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>While I totally understand and respect the difficulties in publicising and documenting facts such as the ones you claimed above, I feel I need to at least make such a request: Can you provide documentation for these claims you make? (Admin accounts uploading copyvio material - this should be easily provable; bad unblocks - this is more vague, but details would help in allowing others to make up their minds; intimidating - I'm sure this is true; intimidation is, while not a good thing, very commmon on Wikipedia - I'm sure accounts with sysop privilages have done it as have logged-in accounts, and ip accounts; wheel wars - also, yes - this has happened, the records are available in the Block or Protection logs; profanity - I suspect you exaggerate - do you litteraly mean "every other edit summary" - but the general point of profanity use - I also agree that this occurs, by all types of accounts, admins included; "etc, etc" - Can you be more specific?) <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 10:24, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>yes, and for non-admin actions as well. after all, admins are <i>promoted</i> in the first place because of non-admin behavior. if you've got the right temperament to be an admin, you'll meet a higher standard in all regards. the system is based on trust. if i can't trust your judgement as an editor, why should i trust your judgement as an admin? <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 19:07, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Currently, administrators have no effective accountability to the community following their promotions. It's a bizarre dichotomy: you need over 70% support to become an administrator... and 0% support to keep it. Arbcom is clearly not an effective sanction. We've seen an increasing willingness by a small group of administrators to forget that they act on behalf of community consensus and beginning to think that they <i>are</i> the community. This has to stop, or it will cause very serious problems for Wikipedia down the road. I have to wonder if Wikipedia's IRC channel is a part of the problem. A lot of the <a href="../../../w/h/e/WP%7EWHEEL_fbcc.html" title="WP:WHEEL">wheel warring</a> I see here is <b>exactly</b> like the infantile crap I witnessed on IRC a couple of years back (and is the reason why I stopped using it). <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 20:23, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Agree</b>. With increased power, comes increased responsibility. People look to admins to see what a good wikipedia citizen looks like, and what type of behavior is expected. When a admin abuses their position, harasses another user, or makes poor judgment calls in a controversial situation, it reflects badly on them, reflects badly on Wikipedia as a whole, and encourages bad behavior on the part of others. <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 20:40, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agree with <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus</a>. Moreover, I think that higher accountability for admins would go a long way to correcting the dismaying trend of seeing adminship treated as a mark of social status. Adminship is a job, not a privilege, and anyone unable or unwilling to meet the requirements of that job should not be kept on. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 21:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Currently unless policy violations are flagrent enough for the arbcom to act (and they are settign a high bar on this) there is nothing that can be done except engage in wheel wars, which is very bad for the project, or let a determined admin have his or her way. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:37, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree but not because of some of the above reasons. I think that though Admins need to be accountable for their actions, I think that their actions are less important than everyone thinks. What sum of loss to Wikipedia is an editor (with dubious edit history - POV, personal attacks, incivility, unco-operativeness) not being able to edit for 24 hours? One or two good edits if that?

<li>This has probably been said a million times before, but the admins are a more visible representation of Wikipedia than normal editors, and as such we need to be held more responsible for what we do, even if it involves no admin powers whatsoever. Also, I agree that there needs to be a faster way to de-admin people. Right now the admins that are causing problems appear to be doing so because they know that what they're doing is not approved of, but they won't be losing the ability to do it any time soon. <a href="../../../m/o/0/User%7EMo0_25cf.html" title="User:Mo0">Mo0</a>[<a href="../../../m/o/0/User_talk%7EMo0_eb76.html" title="User talk:Mo0">talk</a>] 22:39, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree. Each admin should have their actions scrutinized, and be <b>subject to reelection</b>. There is frequent abuse of adminship: blocks out of procedure (even indefinite ones), incivility etc. Less than 2% of admins were stripped from adminship for violations. There is practically no accountability and what should be a technical matter, becomes too often matter of abuse of power. Reelection should be a procedure, and wrong decisions should be made transparent, and a basis for denying reelection - that will ensure accountability, like in any democracy with free election.

<li><b>Agree</b> – To become an Admin, most users can’t have 3RR violations or being banned for any reason is pretty much going to end in that RfA failing. The rules shouldn’t change after becoming an admin. If any admin is in or acts that are deemed, an atrocious act that clearly demonstrates the lack of civility (clear cut 3RR comes to mind) then I would go as far as saying that admin should be desysopped and require RfA a week later if that former admin desires. First the admin clearly shows that lack of negotiation skills and would rather be involved in shouting matches then resolutions. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupercoop_2229.html" title="User:Supercoop">Supercoop</a> 19:33, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Agree</b> - The <b>vast</b> majority of admins are doing a great job, but there needs to be a clear way to hold admins to the highest possible standards, without diminishing their ability to do their job.

<li>The current problem (with <i>some</i> admins, certainly nowhere near all) is their abuse of power. Anyone can edit, so it's not an abuse of power when an admin gets weird on a certain article. However, if in the middle of an edit war, an admin in <b>any way</b> tries to use his/her adminship as some sort of sword to hold over the head of a "mere" user (i.e. subtly implying on the article's talk page that any user who changes the admin's most recent edit may find themselves blocked a few minutes later), then that should be treated as seriously as if the admin went ahead with an actual abuse of power. In short, threatening users into silence in order to win an edit war (or any other argument on Wikipedia) should be considered an "admin action" whether they actually carry out the threat or not. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 19:05, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>From above: "<i>Adminship is no big deal, but abuses of power should be. There ought to be a much clearer, more streamlined way to deadmin someone.</i>" Changed my mind, slightly. Any "abuse of power" that occurs is tied directly to the enhanced abilities of an admin. Even if they are making POV edits, there is no abuse of power until they use blocking/page protecting/threats of such to enforce their editorial will. Rollback may fall into this category, but I'd prefer to see that become a full-user priv, not an admin "power". -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 17:32, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There should be accountability of the mis-use of admin tools, particularly as non-admins cannot revert. I would definitely include rollback in that category. Speedy deletion seems adequately catered for at the moment, it is less hard to get something speedy undeleted. Some of the other actions though are too hard, slightly more subtle in terms of whether you esclate the issue or not, so the answer tends to be not to escalate or query becaause you (the non-admin) would rather just edit and add info.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 20:34, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Agree</b>. There should fairly obviously be repercussions for abusing admin powers. However, an admin shouldn't be held to higher standards on simply editing an article. As stated around wikipedia, admins have no more or less power than other editors for simply working on articles. Adminship isn't a trophy, and it shouldn't be a liability. When an admin is simply working out in the mainspace without using any of the extra powers or mediating, they should be held to the same standards of normal users, not higher. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwizard1232_75b2.html" title="User:Mathwizard1232">Mathwizard1232</a> 01:42, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think I agree with this. I'm not even entirely sure what this is getting at; is it trying to suggest that admins who engage in vandalism, revert wars, personal attacks, etc., things that non-admins can do, should not suffer any consequence for it? I mean, an admin who engages in a personal attack isn't doing anything "as an admin," but if a regular editor could be blocked or warned for it, they should face the possibility of losing administrative privileges for it. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 02:11, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In my experience, problems with administrators are dealt with satisfactorily by the current process. Administrative actions are as transparent as they can reasonably be.

<dd>I'll give you an example - I saw a case where an admin threatened to block a user if they again reverted a page the two were disputing, then actually <b>did</b> block the user for reverting, then protected the article to the admin's preferred version, then <i>falsely</i> claimed the user had violated 3RR, then declared that they would block the user indefinitely if the user continued to edit war. Wanna guess what happened when the user complained? The <i>user</i> got threatened with more blocks for 'harassing' the admin. That's what 'more accountability' means... let's start with <b>some</b> accountability. <b>Any</b> accountability would be nice.

<li>This is all too vague to mean anything. Admins who break the rules are already held accountable for those actions; admins who abuse admin-only powers tend to accrue more attention in that regard than the rest of us.

<li>I think this conflicts with "adminship is no big deal".

<li>The big problem right now is that there is no way to hold a misbehaving admin accountable except through peer pressure or a very long RFAr. If you block them, they can unblock themselves. If you protect an article, they can still edit it. And when they edit war with "regular" editors, there is always the unstated threat that they can block or ban the person they are in conflict with. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 18:59, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Adminship <i>is</i> a big deal, regardless of what the guidelines say. It may not have been a big deal in the early days of Wikipedia, but these days nobody just saunters in, makes a few edits and gets elected as an admin a week later.

<li>Normal users should act like administrators, only without the powers. In fact, all members of the community should aspire to become an administrator, just that new users don't have this because we need to make sure we can trust them. So yes, administrators need to be more accountable for their actions, but other users too. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 18:49, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Accountability as in equal rules apply to all is good. Accountability as in "this jerk is on a campaign to censor me, I'll make sure he pays for this" is not.

<li>Agree with Natalinasmpf. Even before I signed up for an account, it was a goal of mine to become an admin (which I achieved), and I would recommend that all other users have a similar goal. And I think that admins should continue to be accountable for their actions even after becoming admins (like the vast majority are). <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 19:08, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Right, Natalinasmpf. I don't want to be an admin, I don't see how it would help me, but "editor" is also a position of responsibility. Couple general points:</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>It's a weird system, where it's fairly easy to become an admin but then it's "tenured" in that admins are very seldom de-adminned. In most organizations, if its easy to get hired its easy to get fired, or else if its hard to get fired (tenure) its hard to get the position.</li>
<li>Saying "admin is no big deal" doesn't make it so. People go WHO-HOO I MADE ADMIN. They should be saying "Oh damn they made me be an admin" and there should be more turn-downs of admin nominations, maybe. Maybe new admins should be forced to work on articles that need work but are really boring and no one want to work on them, or something.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Admins should be held accountable <i>by their peers</i>. Regular users shouldn't get a say. I know a few admins who are rather unpopular amongst the "rabble" because they get their hands dirty with all sorts of ugly but necessary blocks and interventions. But they are definitely well-respected amongst their <i>peers</i>. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 23:45, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The idea that wheel warring can truly be 'for the good of the encyclopedia' is ultimately ludicrous. Destabilizing behavior does just that - destabilizes. The encyclopedia does not exist without the community, and the community is not indestructible. Besides, both sides think that they're acting for the good of the encyclopedia, of course. Admins should stop, wait, and bring in the community; acting unilaterally, they're like arrogant gods, fighting with no regard for the lesser beings they step on. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 01:44, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Agree.</b> Wheel warring should be grounds for immediate temporary loss of admin tools, and permanent if repeated enough times. There's simply no good reason to repeatedly do or undo an admin action, because there are few things that need urgent action. If they did, they would be obvious to everyone and there would be no disagreement. Discuss first and don't ever undo another admin's actions without discussion and some consensus first. That's the only way to nip wheel warring in the bud.

<li>Gosh lots of comments. I'll register polite disagreement on both points. In fact I challenge the use of the term "wheel war", which implies an abuse of power, when alll that is happening here is a difference of opinion on how that power should be used in the interests of Wikipedia.

<li>I sympathize but I believe repeatedly redoing admin actions stems from a false sense of urgency.

If something needs to be done, it'll wait until tomorrow, or most likely someone else will do it if it urgently needs to be done.</i> I think Tony would do well to heed those words.

<li>Disagree - you could say that wheel-warring is inappropriate, but it isn't inappropriate use of admin powers, because that supposes that it could be done without admin powers.

<li>Of course "wheel warring" (what a strange term) is a bad thing. However, given that blocking a user means revoking their editing privileges, and given that some blocks are indefinite, there need to be reasonable processes in place to review and undo unfair blocks. When an admin is overstepping blocking policy, this needs to be reverted. It is important to have peace and harmony among administrators, but it is equally important to be welcoming and not to bite newbies. Whenever possible, disagreements over blocking should be resolved in discussions, of course, but sometimes it may be desirable to hold a poll. An admin who feels that they are backed up by common sense, process and policy in reverting another admin's block should not be accused of "wheel warring" unless they do so repeatedly.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 02:58, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wheel warring is bad. Deciding what constitutes a wheel war, however, is tricky. Who gets to make the call? Certainly, the two parties in the dispute can't make that determination. If they were level-headed enough to be seriously thinking about the consequences of a wheel war, they would be very unlikely to be in such a dispute in the first place. I guess I'm not sure what question this section of the poll is supposed to answer. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 04:08, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that this is usually wrong, but I believe that it's more important to ensure that users are not unfairly blocked. Also, one undeletion or unblock does not a wheel war make, and punishing people for a single action like some people appear to be suggesting above doesn't make sense. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 01:28, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Clearly admins occasionally do dumb stuff with their powers. If one does such a stupid thing, it should be undone by another admin. If they redo it, that's when I'd say it becomes wrong, and reundoing it wouldn't be wrong. Unless, of course, when there's consensus for the other side. But who decides whether there's consensus?

<li>This really is a tough one. With the constant flood of new users, many of whom seem more interested in other aspects of Wikipedia than building an encyclopedia, consensus can and does get it wrong sometimes. I will say this: going against a consensus of trusted users (roughly speaking, admins), is always wrong, unless you're Jimbo. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 20:09, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Note that Jimbo recently discerned consensus by noting a <i>lack</i> of activity of admins to undo something that had been done. I don't think Jimbo's particularly interested in real consensus. That to me is one of the fundamental issues; the culture being supported is subversion of consensus when common sense thinks you should. Except, common sense isn't the same across cultures, borders, and continents. Thus, dispute. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 21:03, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think Jimbo <i>should be</i> particularly interested in real consensus. Wikipedia needs layers that cut through all the process and bureaucracy. Without it, we become more government than encyclopedia. However, right now the only member of the layer that has the power to cut through the red tape by fiat is Jimbo.

<li>Agree, but equally as important is not <b>acting before there is a consensus</b>. If something that requires admin powers to do is against policy or no policy exists, the admin should ask other users before making the change (unless it is not controversial in any way). IAR should not be used for actions that only an admin can undo, just regular editing. If there's something that they want to do in the spirit of IAR, they should ask other users first (and not just their friends). If it's truly for the good of the encyclopedia, most editors will usually agree. There are a few cases where an action would be in the best interest of the encyclopedia but doesn't gain consensus. In that case, it should be taken to a higher authority. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 13:02, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Gratuitous ignoring of consensus by administrators therefore undermines the community and, ultimately, the entire project.

<li>Absolutely. suspected violations should shorten their terms. Incivil and intimidating attitude towards users should give rise to speedy reelection and deadminship. Limiting term to 12 months would give rise to 2-3 admins reelected daily - this can be shortened by every user being able to cast an objection, and then the admins with few objections could have longer terms, while particularily abusive admins would have their terms shortened. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 04:19, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As written above, it's too sweeping a statement. As an example, an AFD discussion may show apparent consensus to keep a particular article but if evidence shows it to be a copyright violation, it has to go. We can't just "vote" to overturn copyright laws. Likewise, a discussion's apparent consensus to delete an article which would result in a violation of GFDL can not be supported.<br />
I believe that consensus should be respected. Decision-making through consensus-seeking is one of our core principles. But there are some situations where you have to do what's best for the encyclopedia and, if necessary, take the consequences. Overruling the consensus of a particular discussion on a point of principle or policy should be done rarely and is always subject to review. If the deciding admin is found to have been in error, some form of censure may be appropriate. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 04:21, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Don't be silly. Even if it were deleted, it would still be in use. Common sense beats any policy that could ever be written down. And we need to use a hell of a lot more common sense than we do now. But, IAR should never be used as a reason for doing something. If anyone argues about it, either tell them why they're wrong, or apologize. Ever mentioning IAR anywhere is likely to attract IAR lynchmobs, which don't help ANYTHING. They won't get IAR deleted, they won't make the use of it change *at all*. They'll just annoy people. I hate overly bureaucratic crap, such as real life governments. "I made 4 reverts in 25 hours! I did not violate 3RR!" is a perfect example of a complaint from a ruleslawyer that was blocked through IAR. In real life, they put teens that are under the age of consent on sex offender lists and jail them, for having sex with other people under the age of consent, but of very similar age. And if the age of consent is 16, someone 17 could have sex with a 15 year old and get busted for "statutory rape". Do you see a problem with that? Legal crap doesn't tend to use much comomn sense. This post could be shortened to two sentences: IAR doesn't do anything. Common sense, or lack thereof does. Oh, and i'm not against age of consent laws. They just need to be enforced and written with common sense. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac">Phroziac</a> <sub>.</sub> <small>o</small> º <sup>O (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhroziac_3a1f.html" title="User talk:Phroziac">♥♥♥♥ chocolate!</a>)</sup> 04:35, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It can sometimes be difficult to draw enough attention to a possibly NPOV or similarly inappropriate article to gain consensus over the devoted POV-pushers.

<li>It depends on what you understand by consensus. In Eastern European topics, we have seen votes rigged in a variety of ingenious ways: sockpuppetry, campaigning in national wikis and outside websites, etc. It takes ArbCom months to discuss the problem and to issue a ruling.

<li>On the one hand, the answer's easy: nobody (especially not admins) should ignore consensus. However, the difficulty lies in what "consensus" <i>is</i>. Too many people on a "don't ignore consensus!" bent assume it means vote-counting. Two examples are AfD ("we have 67% for delete! You must delete now! Don't ignore consensus!"), and the Kelly Martin userbox thing (one of the issues that cropped up in discussions is what sort of user counts towards "consensus", and whether one sort's consensus can overrule another's). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 02:19, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ditto fuddlemark. I also think nobody should ignore consensus, but occasionally other factors must be taken in -- for instance, we very well can't break the law. I don't care if everyone on the bloody 'pedia wants to use a fair use image where it would obviously be inadmissible, it's got to go. I also think consensus isn't going to scale for very much longer as a method of decision-making. It should always form the backbone of Wikipedia, because a wiki's nature depends on consensus, but I think at some point we'll need to have other inputs into decision-making, probably from Jimbo/the board or something like that. But that's immaterial. The point is; don't ignore consensus unless you have a bloody good reason to. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 13:04, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Many recent events that suggest a small number of admins repeatedly abuse <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> as a tactic to prod the community (e.g. to draw attention to a pet issue, to create a community turmoil that might break up a logjam or deadlock). Typically, the ensuing hostilities are more damaging than the original problem was. For the instigator, a pet issue is addressed, albeit at the cost of harming the community. More and more, the response is, "A mistake was made. Move on and forget about it." There is no disincentive to repeating the charade. We cannot expect that the number of these fiascos will decrease if we do not change our response to them in some way. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 18:43, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Consensus should be respected and followed in most cases. However, if it is to be ignored in favour of the right thing then a valid explanation must be given. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 00:22, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It can be difficult to determine what actually is consensus. For example, if a relatively small number of experienced users provide well-argued agreements in accordance with policy for a certain position, and a large number of inexperienced users vote against the position but don't really address the other users' agreements, I would say that, if there is any consensus, it is for the position, not against. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 01:36, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Consensus is a rare beast, but when it's here, you shouldn't ignore it.

<li>Just about every place Wikipedia uses the word consensus in its process, it isn't actually consensus. usually, it's a vote gauged on a super-majority. we need to either stop using the word consensus or start living out the meaning of the word. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 06:31, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In my experience, most admins do not know what <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> is all about. Too often they take any content dispute for vandalism and use rollback button gratuitously just to show off. As an aside, rollback summary with its "block" function may appear intimidating to good faith editors who dare oppose an admin. Anyone who used rollback button to revert non-vandalism and to save time required for an edit summary, say, five times, should be defrocked as a matter of course. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> | <a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">talk</a> 19:15, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Aside from the caveat that "vandalism" needs to be very explicitly defined, I see no reason for the revert tool to be used when a hand-edit and an edit summary will help everyone understand what was done and why.

<dd>Oh yeah, and while I'm thinking about this, every administrator, at one point, had to manually insert all edit summaries. Why does the rollback button suddenly make this too hard?

<li><b>Strong agree</b>. Any well-meaning editor deserves an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summary.html" title="Edit summary">edit summary</a> when reverted. The rollback button is associated with fighting vandals. Any editor reverted with the rollback button will feel that his/her edits are just as worthless/harmful as vandalism, and not worth an explanation for why the reversion took place. While I don't want any strong rules, I <i>implore</i> admins to not be lazy and give very careful thought and considerte attention when reverting somebody's edits. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 03:03, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree.

<li>Agree, although I have seen this done only once to a good faith user (not me), it was once too often.

<li>ONLY For malicious activity such as vandalism and spam. Revert your own self manually. There should be diferent rollback buttons which adds "Reverting Vandalism" or "Reverting Spam" as well as perhaps customazible ones for other malicious activity.

<li>I've suggested this idea a few times. there should be an Edit Summary box right beneath the rollback button. this way rollbacks wouldn't just say "Reverted edits". <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 06:33, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Rollback should definitely not be such a big deal. It's just an interface, and it should be improved (and made available to more people!)

<li>Instead of forbidding useful functionality, the functionality should be expanded: There should be a small text input box next to the rollback button. If you enter something and press rollback, it is used as the edit summary and it is the same as a regular manual revert (not marked minor). If you don't enter anything, it uses the standard edit summary and behaves like the current vandalism rollback. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 03:43, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The rollback feature should be modified to accept edit summaries and a list of checkboxes to pick the most common reasons for rollbacks (vandalism, newbie edits, copyright vios, etc). Having both of these options would allow for more explanations and still keep the advantage of speed that the rollback button has. --<a href="../../../p/s/2/User%7EPS2pcGAMER_3063.html" title="User:PS2pcGAMER">PS2pcGAMER</a> (<a href="../../../p/s/2/User_talk%7EPS2pcGAMER_9645.html" title="User talk:PS2pcGAMER">talk</a>) 07:32, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agree. If you don't have functional email or won't let wikipedia's send email from wikipedia, don't impose blocks.

<dd>My impression was that the built-in MediaWiki e-mail doesn't give out the recipient's e-mail address. It just lets you send via a form, and gives the recipient your e-mail. So you could be bombarded by hatemail through Wikipedia, but you couldn't be signed up to spam lists unless you respond via e-mail (you could always respond on their talk page). —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 05:21, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Disagree. It's an easy enough modification to Mediawiki to allow banned users to post on say "Wikipedia:Unblock me please" or on the talk page of the admin who issued the ban (with the obvious problem that it would result in admins' user pages being vandalised even more than they are already).

<li>Disagree. I do have my e-mail link active because of current community standards, but I only block for non-controversial reasons (obvious spamming, repeat vandalism in the face of warnings) and don't see any reason to read flame mail about it while at work.

<li>A few things. Firstly, I would appreciate some sort of equivalent to "you have new messages" if I get a private email through Wikipedia, at least telling me to check my email, ie. "A Wikipedia user has emailed you". Secondly, I remember there were plans to selectively ban users from certain articles, but not others - when will this be implemented? An inverse could hold true - ban a user from all articles except talkpage, blocking admin, noticeboard, etc. which could be selected as necessary. Some people (ie. anons) also abuse their talk page privileges too much, to the extent we have to protect it. We should be able to implement some cap on the rate of emails, posting on talk pages, etc. etc. if necessary (ie. hate flood mails, or hate messages)...also, the template:unblock function should be extended to the software - an equivalent to the "you have new messages" kind of alert would be received if a user an administrator blocked tried to appeal. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 03:02, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Arbcom's job is to resolve disputes in the Wikipedia community. I must admit that I'm baffled that they did not take the cases involving the userbox fiasco. This is perhaps our most contentious issue, and one that has the potential to literally tear the community apart. (The amount of digital venom spewed over this issue, on both sides, is astounding.) And Arbcom refused to listen. Hopefully, the new election will result in an arbitration committee more willing to act when necessary. That said, I think that it would make sense to have a process besides Arbcom to handle cases where an admin no longer has community consensus. (Note that this would not even necessarily entail a specific finding of wrongdoing - it is simply that administrators must have the continued trust and support of the Wikipedia community.) <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 20:38, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oversight is essential</b>.

<li>Members of ArbCom have stated they are not a punitive body. It is not their job to be applying punitive measures. If that is the case, then ArbCom is not the appropriate body to be bringing deadminship pleas to. Instead, we need another body for handling such functions. Are such functions needed? I say yes; it isn't enough to just get a promise from someone that they won't do "X" again. We don't let criminals loose because they promise not to do it again. There does need to be consequences for negative behavior, else we encourage anarchy. In small communities this is not needed.

<li>I agree with this on principle, but I am concerned with the notion that ArbCom personnel may feel compelled to vote one way or the other due to political considerations.

<li>The point is that regardless of whether it should be a role or a status, some users have made it a status. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_RFA_Reform_5d25.html" title="User:Linuxbeak/RFA Reform">elsewhere</a> the issue has been raised (correctly, in my opinion) of voter blocs, professional voters, etc. ArbCom can't possibly be free of this.

<li>I don't know if ArbCom is the correct body to enforce this or not, but I think the threshold for de-adminning an admin needs to be much lower. The process needs to be open and accessible to non-admins, as they are often the ones at a disadvantage in disputes with admins. I think there should be a particularly low threshold to de-admin an admin that abuses their powers to control the content of the encyclopedia, either through blocks, rollbacks or (un)deleting pages or that uses their powers to circumvent process. – <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug Bell</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a><b>•</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doug_Bell_cc6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doug Bell">contrib</a></sup> 19:05, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have my doubts about arbcom/some arbcomers since my case, however I agree deadminship should be a simple process. However since arbcom is overwhelmed with much more serious cases (admin abuse is not a serious problem, at very worse a burocrat can end the misery of an admin out of control) maybe burocrats should vote among themselves like arbcom. Again this process(es) should NOT give trolls any breathing room. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cool Cat</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Cool_Cat_9377.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Cool Cat">@</a></sup></small> 20:53, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This needs to be the first step in handling admins who are disruptive, not following policy and/or wheel warring. I think this should be implemented independently of any discussion about RFA improvements. In the same manner as we temp block editors, temp de-opping will help focus an admins attention. I'd like to see a bureaucrat be able to place one of these blocks for a day with no other input or discussion.

<li>Agree and propose that a blocked admin should lose access to sysop powers for the duration of the block as well as editing powers.

<li>In an edit war, the participants are blocked until they cool down and banned if they can't keep their cool.

<li>Yes, although I'd call it "suspension" and I'd give the power to any two admins, with an additional 12 hours for each additional admin above 2. It would be for at least 1 day, and at most 1 week (14+ admins are unlikely), and could not be re-invoked within a "probation" period of the same length (the next step during such a probation period would always be permanent).

<li>Good idea. Burocrats should have this power. Burocrats, that are few, should have shorter terms, and more power. They should be able to place de-adminships (temporary) or force elections; admins should fear burocrats, and burocrats should be accountable to the people. We need checks and balances on power.

<li>Wikipedia runs best on consensus. We vote for the ArbCom members, they decide on admin privileges in these cases. No one but Jimbo, who must have ultimate control over the worst things (he's got <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">Executive powers</a>), should be unaccountable or act unilaterially where there is no chance to undo actions. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro</a><b><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarro5_1808.html" title="User talk:Harro5">5</a></b> 20:53, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No one but Jimbo or the ArbCom; I agree with Harro5. I wouldn't trust anyone else in acting unilaterally in these situations. Administrators have passed through RfA, a rigorous process that I usually do trust (I recently commented in an RfA poll that I've seen several candidates get their candidacies destroyed when somebody uncovered one bad edit), so to allow one user to override that is a mistake. From the userboxes controversy alone, one can see the potentially destructive effects of a single user acting unilaterally. However, if the whole ArbCom (or several members of it) acts, then there is enough accountability there to keep one user from revoking another's adminship simply because they don't like a particular admin. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> (<a href="../../../i/d/o/User_talk%7EIdont_havaname_83b4.html" title="User talk:Idont havaname">Talk</a>) 23:49, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agree with Nae'blis, being "no big deal" cuts both ways, however I'm not sure there is a satisfactory and workable manner for this to be done, Stewards keep away from their "home" projects so wouldn't be ideally placed to enact without instruction from someone else. Giving the ability to Bureaucrats would (I believe) be significantly widening their remit and as not necessarily selected with that in mind might cause more tension as having an arbitrarily assigned "elite".

<dd>The power (rather obviously) already exists - both Devs and Stewards can deop at will. But they do not. This section is basically stating that they should.

<li>It would have to be implemented carefully, but I think 'term limits' for admins make alot of sense.

<li>Perhaps with an excusal mechanism (as in jury selection)... it should be easier to deadmin someone than admin them, but admin should not be "for life". If the mechanisms for deadminning are corrected, term limits may not be necessary. An admin that has made a lot of enemies??? Maybe that admin needs a break, let someone else step up.

<li>While this is a logistical nightmare (making this an agree in principle but neutral in the real world<sup>TM</sup>), I think this would probably be the best way to make deadminning easier. There has to be some sort of accountability. And regarding the potential for trolling, that's what 'crats are for, right?

<li>Maybe put people on admin probation for a year. (I think they do that at .de.wikipedia.) If the extra buttons have gone to someone's head that will have shown after a year. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 18:07, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Given the current hierarchy between admins and non-admins and lack of checks and balances some reconfirmation or even re-election process should happen semi-infrequently. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 21:08, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin baas</a> 21:29, 18 January 2006 (UTC) Probably the easiest way to make de-admining easier than admining, an automatic community vote bypasses the obstacles of arbcom or what-have-you. The community is the proper check. Should be fairly infrequent, as voting consumes time. I like the idea of a comment page for each admin - and I think the periodic reconfirmations should be on that comment page, so people are informed about the admin they're discussing and checking. To counter a common argument made in the disagree vote - so what if an admin gets wrongly deadmined? There are plenty of others to pick up the mop and continue mopping the floor. It's no big deal. On the other hand, if an administrator abusing their powers is not desysoped, that is a big deal.</li>

<li>Yes, but it should be periodic reconfirmation by bureaucrats, not by editors. Goes with the way some places handle judges: elect by people, confirm by appellate judges.

<li>Absolutely. Arbcom has been given an opportunity to handle such issues, and the results are clearly not satisfactory to the community. I'm confident we can come up with a process that will not risk the horror stories feared by its opponents. Minimum edit counts (1000, perhaps?), a cooling-off period of a week between the action and the filing, requiring multiple users with separate grievances - there are a lot of ways we can have a sensible, community-oriented process without degenerating into a circus of vandals and trolls. Hopefully, it will not have to be used often. Out of our 700 or so admins, I expect between 6 and 12 to lose their adminship if such a process is implemented. These will be our most controversial admins, and on the whole our project will be better off without these powers in their hands. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 20:44, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Admins are granted their powers by community support, and should keep them for only as long as they maintain that support. ArbCom can adjudicate specific disputes, but it cannot decide the more general question of community support—only the community itself can do that. The details need discussion, but one approach would be to use a Requests for reconfirmation page for initial evaluation. If a request generates significant support there, it can proceed to <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfA_0b0c.html" title="WP:RfA">RfA</a>, where actual reconfirmation would occur. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Smith_0e3f.html" title="User:Tim Smith">Tim Smith</a> 16:39, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agree - there needs to be some mechanism in place to deal with problematic behaviour, admins or otherwise. The current mechanisms seem to be ineffective when a problem user also is an admin.

<li>If there was a procedure that for temporarily removing admin <i>privileges</i> from misbehaving admins, and if the ArbComm would take seriously any major misbehavior from admins, this is not necessary. I see too many potential problems with a community-based method of deadminship. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 18:47, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>BlankVerse is right. We need a simple procedure that allows for the <i>fast</i> <b>temporary</b> removal of admin privs from any admin that has gone rogue. Any community-based procedure would take days to carry out, and could easily be circumvented as long as the admin was popular enough to get all his/her friends to come pile on the vote. I suggest a system whereby, if a complaint of serious abuse of power is lodged, a vote of three admins (or whatever number is determined to be optimal) in agreement would be enough to compel a bureaucrat to remove the admin's privileges while some sort of RfC on the matter is allowed to play out. (I also think that, in order to protect against the possibility of any admin cabal working behind the scenes to quash any complaint, a vote by regular users should also be enough to force a bureaucrat action, but it would require a supermajority and a quorum ... say, perhaps, a minimum of 100 votes cast, with 75% or 80% in favor of removing the admin's privileges.) --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 19:19, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I tend to agree with <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse">User:BlankVerse</a> to soiem extent. But if a person has truly lost the trust of the communinty, deadminship uis appropriate. Any such process would need to be devised to avoid it being an un-popularity contest, however, which would be tricky. I wouldn't support this unless a good process was devised.

<li>Arbcom is for <i>arbitration</i> of <i>disputes</i>. It is <i>not</i> a substitute for community consensus decision-making. It <i>doesn't</i> decide whether the community trusts someone.

<li>I should point out that many people thought a priori that having public voting for the ArbCom election would turn into a mud-slinging spitefest. But it didn't, and in fact turned out quite well.

<li>Arbcom is not the right place for this.

<li>About 75% of the oppose voters say this should go through Arbcom instead. Well, the problem is that Arbcom isn't doing the job. There have only been three cases in the Arbcom's entire history where an admin has been deprived of their powers as a result of a ruling (see <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFDA_5218.html" title="WP:RFDA">WP:RFDA</a> for details). And Arbcom has flatly refused to hear recent cases that involve a great amount of community strife - most of it involving good-faith users on both ends, not the "trolls" that the oppose voters are so worried about (unless your definition of a troll extends to anyone disagreeing with you). How many people believe that <i>all</i> 700 or so administrators are qualified? That <i>none</i> of them deserve to lose their status either for repeated defiance of consensus or simply because they no longer have the confidence of the community? I'm pretty conservative in this regard, myself - I figure maybe 1 percent of the admins (just about half a dozen) really need to be desysopped. 1% of the admins are responsible for 90% of the conflicts, and I think we all know who that 1% consists of, and they are a detriment to Wikipedia and the Arbcom hasn't done anything about it. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 16:12, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As an example of the above, look at the Arbcom elections. Some of the most controversial administrators are (or were) running, and received significantly less than 50% support. Often, their refusal to abide by consensus in their administrative actions (including wheel warring) was specifically cited by voters as a reason for opposition. Certainly, the standards for Arbcom are (or should be) higher than for ordinary adminship, but looking at the elections provides a pretty good rough indication of which administrators are too controversial to operate effectively and which ones have lost the confidence of the Wikipedia community. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 16:18, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This is fraught with difficulty (e.g. possible mass sockpuppetry to kick back after a block). It needs to be easier to get people demoted from sysop if they cause problems, it needs to be an open community-based process, I'm just not entirely convinced it needs to be <i>this</i> suggested process. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 20:37, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I say Wikipedia is based on consensus, but frankly, the current methods for gauging consensus are largely just bad. They either a) give excessive authority to the closing admin/bureaucrat or b) promote unexplained or generally stupid votes. A community-based solution is what we should aim for eventually, but with a number of added rules to turn it into more of an informed discussion than a blind vote. For instance, clear criteria could be set by genuine community consensus (as opposed to consensus of a tiny handful), and every vote would have to justify itself according to those criteria, in ten words or more. Maximally clear and narrow criteria would be devised, e.g., "repeatedly blocking users without giving sufficient notice", in the manner of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">CSD</a>. If anyone disagreed that a vote conformed to the criteria, they could post their criticism of its rationale, and if the original vote's poster didn't respond within two days, it would be discounted. The poll would close to new votes after a certain number of days, then end two days after discussion finished.
<p>Or something like that. You get the idea. For now, ArbCom is probably the only real option, but motions for summary desysopping should be default in cases of sysop abuse. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 05:37, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>How about recall voting style? If a good number of people want a recall vote (say five or ten or so), then a <s>vote</s> discussion for consensus occurs.

However, there are some useful tools that admins have that could help with their job and their everyday contributions.

<li>Arbcomers should only deal with arbcom, Arbcom is an <b>indecent process</b> (arbcomers have to deal with other peoples incivility and disputes as well as other goodies). Arbcom is like suicide with overwhelming workload. Arbcomers neither have time to use checkuser privilages or admin powers nor burocrat powers. A checks and balances must exist.

<li>I don't see the conflict here. B'crats basically are admins who can also clsoe RfA's.

<li>Myself.

<li>Yes.

<li>Linuxbeak hit it on the head.

<li>This is indeed a problem.

<li><a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_USER_0a47.html" title="WP:RFC/USER">User RFC</a> is probably the worst, most useless process on Wikipedia (with the possible exception of <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>). Article RFCs are flat-out ignored (at least in my experience). As stated by many others, RFC is often considered a prelude to <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">arbitration</a>, rather than a serious attempt at <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> in and of itself. It's also a forum for venting grievances, which makes it inherently problematic. What is worst of all is that with all the venting, there are <i>no actual consequences</i>. A few of the most controversial administrators have openly declared contempt for extensively certified RFCs against them. Result? Nothing happened. What's the point of even having RFC if it is simply useless paperwork that serves as an opportunity for people to get even angrier? Even keeping discussions within the bounds of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a> is almost impossible in some cases. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 16:32, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agree, but it's all in how you treat it. If RfC comes up with a consensus then simply enforce that consensus. This would probably require a stronger consensus in the RfC, but if that develops and a user continues to violate it despite polite admonishment, then they could fall under the disruption clause for blocking. If that consensus never materializes then either ignore the behavior or take it to arbcom. Yes I reallize the difficulty is in who decides the consensus, but that could be worked out fairly easily I think. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 23:27, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My RFC against Davenbelle and Seteriotek had one solid thing that the users were problematic and were stalking me. What was the point? Everyone ignored it including arbcom. And an arbcomer suggested a year long block on me over THAT. Also some RfCs cant be deciving as RfCs can be troll heavens. RfC must be fixed.
<dl>
<dd>Let me elaborate. Currently the dispute resolution process <b>expects both parties to cooperate</b>. Well, on many occasions that <i>can't</i> happen, especially if one party is wikistalking another. RfC must have teath.</dd>
<dd>I do not see why we are having second thoughts in blocking problematic users. I would be better of if obviously problematic behavior by Davenbelle and Steriotek (to the point of opposing me receiving barnstars or voting oppose on RfA before the nominator <i>after</i> the arbcom case.). I had oppose votes on my RfA due to the RfAr case filed to get rid of my stalkers. (I dont understand the logic (that I am not admin worthy because I was harassed/stalked) <i>but</i> I guess people were playing "safe")</dd>

<li>I tend to think that people forget that these are requests for <i>comment</i> so that the subject can see what the community thinks, and then change their behaviour to meet community norms. People tend to see them as just a means of escalating dispute resolution. Having said that, if someone gets lots of RfCs against them, it may be an indicator of significant problems. In that light, I think it would make sense to add a punitive aspect for someone who gets multiple RfCs (e.g. maybe have <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_de-adminship_8eb9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship">Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship</a> require three certified RfCs over the past year among other things). <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 01:27, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>ArbCom should still be able to de-admin. Bureaucrats should be given the power, but stewards would have to do the actual de-adminning, as bureaucrats do not have the technical power, and it's unlikely that the devs would change this for us (like with the rollback thing). I think maybe a straw poll should be used to gauge community consensus, active bureaucrats should determine what they feel to be the consensus at the end, publically comment, and if they agree to desysop, then they list it on requests for permissions. Or we could just hire <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Norris_8c98.html" title="Chuck Norris">Chuck Norris</a> to arrive, and beat the cruft out of the admin until they post for voluntary desysopping on requests for permissions.

<li>ArbCom has certain situations when they should be active, and they make decisions in those situations.

<li>Giving desysop permissions to bureaucrats is actually quite easy, from a technical standpoint, so if it is wanted, it can be done (just like with the <a href="../../../r/f/r/WP%7ERFR_c883.html" title="WP:RFR">rollback privileges</a>, the Devs don't want to do it until we're <i>sure</i> we really want it).

<li>No friggin' way. When the expansion of checkuser privileges was proposed, I could see the possibility that it could easily be abused. Although things seem to have settled down now, I saw several cases in the beginning that looked more like fishing expeditions rather than valid checkuser checks, as the persons who had checkuser rights played with their new toy. There is absolutely no reason to expand checkuser priledges beyond those who currently have it. IPs can, for example, reveal which the company where a person works, which dorm they are in at school, etc. I know there have been at least two cases where there were threats to go to editor's employer over an editor's behavior. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 14:26, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No way. An IP address isn't some kind of instant poison but no one who doesn't know what they're doing should have access to this, and this is and should be enforced by Foundation policy, not "consensus" or any other community process. We already have admins doing IP and range blocks who aren't familiar with IP addressing, let's not make this worse by having people who don't understand the nature, persistence, reliability and meaning of the information they get from CheckUser going around making accusations. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 22:04, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Can't see the justification. If it is to identify potential sock-puppets, then wrong conclusions can easily be drawn.

<li>I do think it's essential that we have more rapid <a href="../../../r/c/u/WP%7ERCU_f1af.html" title="WP:RCU">sockpuppet checks</a>. Perhaps this can be accomplished without granting CheckUser access to additional users. The problem is that ArbCom members are already extremely busy and have little time to hunt down sockpuppets. I'd support having the ArbCom (or Jimbo or the Board) grant access to a few more users, but would strongly oppose any "Request for CheckUser access" process. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 14:37, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think there is room for a CheckUser <i>light</i>. I don't know what form it would take - perhaps something like you give it an IP and you give it a username and it says "yes this user has logged in from this IP and gives you the last date" or "no, this user has never logged in from this IP". You can find out a surprising amount of information with just an IP address. It shouldn't be necessary to know <i>all</i> the IPs they've logged in from. Oppose per Carbonite regarding RfCUa. - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 15:46, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm in favor of designing a "CheckUser Express" tool that would be accessible to all administrators and could do sockpuppet checks without giving out actual IP information. This would be more complicated to program than ordinary CheckUser (which I understand relies on a high degree of intuition) but it would be more effective. For instance, someone might enter two user names and the tool would return a message saying: "These users are on an AOL proxy, so IP comparison is infeasible here." Or it might say "These users are from the same domain, but different IP addresses. The domain is: (whatever.net)." (If the domain was an ISP, of course, this would be inconclusive - but that's already the case with normal CheckUser). Or, of course, "These two users share the same IP address". (Maybe even "These users are on the same subnet, but not the same IP.") This information could be provided without needing to give admins access to personally identifiable information. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 16:26, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This has been discussed in the past and the general consensus is that any automated solution isn't especially feasible since CheckUser is more an art than a science.

<dd>Indeed, it often takes me half an hour of poring over CheckUser output, whois information, edits, and other content before concluding whether editor A and editor B are really the same person or not.

<li>No, checkuser shouldn't <i>necessarily</i> be extended to others, but sockpuppet-checking should be easier. In the long term, make a checkuser-lite that would either confirm or disconfirm a proposed match, and tell you how many addresses they matched on and how many of each user's edits were made on each of the accounts for each address, without telling you what the actual address is. Maybe then give this power to all admins, but log each use and require legitimate suspicion before running it, with oversight as any admin process. Until then, extend checkuser a bit, but not too much (maybe give it to all bureaucrats). —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 05:52, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Strongly agree - any concerns about a potential admin's capacity to use the big tools can be brought to light by seeing how they use little tools. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 21:59, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree. Images can't be undeleted, so the standards for that ability should be stricter than for other abilities.

<li>People are not certain if I am adminworthy. My RfA had a lack of concsnsus. There should be a layer of semi-adminship that people are given access to for example block people, etc... (all revertable stuff) while still dont have access to lets say deleting images (which cant be reverted). One should only be adminised after a trail period. As much as one suggests they are admin worthy, are they really? Allow people to demonstrate how worthy they are. This layer should be a temporary test period for all admin candidates. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cool Cat</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Cool_Cat_9377.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Cool Cat">@</a></sup></small> 21:45, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>An intermediate layer could establish that one would have to revert a user at least twice before the power to block that user appears as an option.

<li>Strongly agree.

<li>Strongly agree. I see the best policy is to move toward a system in which users rate each others' contributions and their editing power reflects the number and quality of their ratings. Such a system would not be perfect, but users rating other users works well for eBay. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitteneatkitten_415d.html" title="User:Kitteneatkitten">Kitteneatkitten</a> 03:19, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree, admin is supposed to be no big deal but it is, give users rollback and delete after X edits and X months/years.

<ol>
<li>There are a number of things that are given to admins only because they're things that require some level of trust before they can be accessed, but they don't have to do with enforcing policy. Per <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_access_levels_a601.html" title="Wikipedia:User access levels">Wikipedia:User access levels</a>, some of them are already implemented, like being able to access <a href="../../../u/n/w/Special%7EUnwatchedpages_54f8.html" title="Special:Unwatchedpages">Special:Unwatchedpages</a> and being able to view deleted versions of pages for DRV or CSD-G4. I don't have a good sense of the community yet, but if there <i>are</i> admins who rarely use their blocking powers, but became an admin so they could have access to few extra things, then a lower level might simultaneously allow more users to use these tools productively, provide a longer period for users to prove themselves trustworthy, and also perhaps encourage users to give more scrutiny to admins during the RFA process. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 23:37, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I definitely think Rollback is a tool, not a power. Of all the Admin tools I'm familiar with, only Viewing Deleted Versions/Deleted Edit Histories/Special:Unwatchedpages seem to be similarly 'non-powered, but trusted'. I'd favor adding these to most users in a similar way to Move. A completely new layer is probably unnecessary, but this WOULD make Adminship "more of a big deal". -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 21:53, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agree with nae'blis. I think like Move, the Rollback tool should be made available to users automatically after they reach some threshold of activity and time. Perhaps at a higher threshold, Viewing Deleted Versions/Deleted Edit Histories/Special:Unwatchedpages should similarly be automatically enabled: <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.

<li>I don't consider rollback to be a "real" admin tool, since it basically just speeds up the process of reverting. None of the other admin tools (blocking, protection, deletion) can be undone by a non-admin. I support wider access to rollback, but not through a "Request for Rollback" procedure.

<li>Rollback is a special case. Maybe it should have a "reason" field added and then be made available to all registered users, or there should be an easy way of getting it once you have a bunch of edits (but then maybe have it removable by any bureaucrat). Doling out other admin powers is very different, for the reason Carbonite states. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 06:12, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Being blocked does not technically prevent an admin from blocking, protecting, deleting or rollbacking anything. Admins can unblock themselves (which is entirely proper when, among others, hit by the autoblocker when they share an IP with a blocked user), but in several cases this is strongly frowned upon. <b>In those cases where an admin should not unblock himself</b>, he should also not perform any other admin actions, such as blocking or unblocking others. Block means block.</p>
<p><b>THIS POINT IS MOOT</b> because the devs have prevented admins from doing this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, being blocked does prevent an admin from protecting, deleting, and using rollback. While blocked, the only action an admin may take is to block or unblock (in case of a block due to the autoblocker).

<li>Certainly (and the autoblock exception is of course very reasonable). Just because it's technically doable but doesn't mean it should be considered OK.

<li>I agree. There is one problem that I can see, however, if the bug gets fixed. An admin might be more likely to use an illegitimate block in an editing dispute knowing the other admin would stay blocked. If any admin does a block in an editing dispute, then they should be blocked for abusing their admin privileges. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 19:44, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agree. They shouldn't edit at all, let alone use admin functions. The software should be fixed so that a block on an admin has the same effect as a block on a regular editor.

<li>In fact, blocked admins should be completely blocked, i.e. <b>unable</b> to do anything, not just choosing not to voluntarily.

<li>An admin should be able to unblock themselves if caught by the autoblocker (probably by far the <i>most common</i> reason an admin is blocked). In addition, if the block is clearly illegitimate you shouldn't be <i>required</i> (advised, yes, required, no) to wait until someone finds out and unblocks you. I have seen too many illegitimate blocks (like some of the ones Ed did, for an example that comes to mind quickly) to support this idea. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 19:07, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the autoblocker is catching admins, FIX the autoblocker so it doesn't invalidate names that already existed before the block went into effect. This has broad support at <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_proposal_01f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy proposal">Wikipedia:Blocking policy proposal</a>. Additional names that existed beforehand (sockpuppets-in-waiting) can be blocked shortly thereafter, if they resume the vandalism/disruptive behavior. If an admin is blocked unfairly as apparently happened with Ed Poor, then <b>some other admin</b> should unblock them. I don't see how anyone could block every admin before one would notice, and if the software allows that through scripting, disallow it. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 19:20, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>The autoblocker catches admins? Doesn't that mean the admins it catches are using the same IPs as vandals and POV warriors?

<li>Blocking someone should not be de-sysopping them.

<li>I remember when an admin was blocked once, he went on RC patrol and did a fantastic job with his rollback button. I don't think it's right to ask administrators to refrain from good faith actions like this. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 10:40, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Incredibly, I agree with Tony Sidaway here. Indeed, I think the fact that blocking doesn't disable the rollback function was intentional. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:50, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Depends, of course, on why the block was made. I see no problem with an admin rolling back vandalism while blocked, but of course they shouldn't rollback non-vandalism and especially not if the edits related to the reason why they are blocked. Admins mostly should not use block/unblock and protect/unprotect while blocked, mainly because they are unable to explain their actions by posting on the relevant talk pages. Admins should certainly stop acting in any wheel war when blocked.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 23:02, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm happy with the way things stand. Auto IP blocks need to be avoidable.

<li>I don't see anything particularly wrong with making admins unable to unblock themsleves and having an admin ask another admin to perform an unblock. Sure, it is a minor inconvenience if your IP is accidentally blocked for some reason, but that is the case for <i>every single non-administrative user</i>. If it's good enough for Joe Editor, it's good enough for everyone else. Perhaps it would even be incentive to be more careful with autoblocker or aggressive IP range blocks.<br />
Looking at the balance, on the one side, we have the convenience of being able to unblock oneself and not having to ask someone else. On the other side, we have wheel warring and potential need for some emergency deadmin procedure if someone really loses temper and decides to be destructive.

Most of the items on this list are worth discussing on their own worth and at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p>I'm not saying we should all boycott the polls. This is just meant as a reminder we shouldn't take it too seriously. It would be detrimental if the results of this poll would come back to haunt other discussions on the matter ("the poll indicated most people said X"), rather than discussing the actual content of the matters. Be careful with polls, especially with issues as divisive as these.</p>
<p>We want to come together rather than make camps. Just my two cents. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Minister_of_War_9b5a.html" title="User:The Minister of War"><u><font color="navy">The Minist</font></u></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><u><font color="green">e</font></u></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Minister_of_War_9b5a.html" title="User:The Minister of War"><u><font color="navy">r of War</font></u></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Minister_of_War_5304.html" title="User talk:The Minister of War"><sup><font color="navy">(Peace)</font></sup></a> 10:20, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Polls and votes are traffic builders and give Wikipedians the illusion that they belong to a community.

<dd>To keep the wiki-spirit, it would probably be more suitable to have even more admins and to make them less mighty by limiting the executive. Maybe for big decisions two admins should be needed. Having less admins which are neccessarily more powerful will only worsen the situation. --<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.57.216.138.html" title="User:68.57.216.138">68.57.216.138</a> 23:09, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Whilst each of the questions in the poll seems valid and useful, it seems to me that trying to do all this at once, in one poll, isn't the best way to go about it. I've created <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Policy_matters_6e1f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Policy matters">Wikipedia:WikiProject Policy matters</a> as a possible long-term way of coordinating these meta-policy issues. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 00:36, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Polls are not evil. Discussion and attempts to build consensus are helpful, but having a poll is also a helpful way to get a sense of how different opinions are represented, numberwise. For example, if five vocal users support an idea, and 18 less vocal users oppose it, the fact that one side has a clear majority is more obvious with a poll than with trying to sort out lines upon lines of discussion. A poll is simply an easy way of saying "Ok, so who and how many people support this idea, and who is opposed to it?". Ideally, we can have both polls and quality discussion to go with them. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 03:58, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
