<p>Hi, I wanted to report two users posting legal threats of "Oregon Police" on my talk page. I reverted the edits. I have no idea who they are. The users posting the legal threats were User:Vigilant and <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerryg_42b1.html" title="User:Jerryg">User:Jerryg</a>. I looked at their contribs, and to be honest, I fail to understand why they are even on WP since their entire posting history seems disruptive. Sorry for bothering folks with this, but I read the policies and they state users should report legal threats. I have noticed these users also seem to be associated with <a href="http://www.cornsilks.com" class="external text" title="http://www.cornsilks.com" rel="nofollow">www.cornsilks.com</a> and I had worked with one of the admins <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">User:Katefan0</a> on some of their vandalism on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chad__Corntassel__Smith_84db.html" title="Chad &quot;Corntassel&quot; Smith">Chad "Corntassel" Smith</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Byrd_%28Cherokee_Chief%29_84dc.html" title="Joe Byrd (Cherokee Chief)">Joe Byrd (Cherokee Chief)</a>.

<dd>Jeff, your reading comprehension is pretty poor for a Chief Scientist. I was reminding you of a threat you posted here on Wikipedia about contacting 'Oregon Law Enforcement' about my stalking you here. And I stand by the comment. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerryg_42b1.html" title="User:Jerryg">Jerry</a> (<a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerryg_b2ed.html" title="User talk:Jerryg">Talk</a>) 05:12, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've taken a look, the diff covering both edits is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASint_Holo&amp;diff=47908799&amp;oldid=47784632" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASint_Holo&amp;diff=47908799&amp;oldid=47784632" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, neither makes a legal threat. The reference to Oregon police is since they believe to you to be a reincarnation of a user blocked for making legal threats, I assume one of the threats that blocked user made was to report one of the users to the Orgeon police. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 07:33, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Since I was named in an arbcom dispute raised by the blocked user, could another admin look into if there is any merit in the claim that this is the blocked user and act appropriately, e.g. asking the two users mentioned to AGF, or dealing with the block evasion as required. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 07:37, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm.. on the one hand, <a href="../../../l/i/b/WP%7ELIBEL_4020.html" title="WP:LIBEL">WP:LIBEL</a> suggests we should delete these from the page history. On the other hand, the rumors of James Levine's pedophilia are so widespread and longstanding (almost everyone involved with professional classical music in the U.S. believes that they <i>know for a fact</i> that Levine is a pedophile, a state of affairs which has held steady for at least 25 years), that I think it's worthwhile to mention the rumors in the article, if only to point out what the facts are: (1) no boy or man has ever publicly accused Levine of molesting him, (2) Levine has never been arrested or charged with anything in his life, and (3) (I'll have to look up the reference for this but I remember reading it) the rumors started shortly after Levine rejected a singer from something he was conducting for not being good enough, so it looks a lot like nasty revenge. So the question is, is it encyclopedia-worthy to have a section in his biography saying "These rumors exist and have been reported since X (with a citation), however no credible evidence exists to suggest that they are true"? (I have the same question regarding the rumors about <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Lee_Curtis_190e.html" title="Jamie Lee Curtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>'s alleged intersexuality.) I think such rumors <i>do</i> belong in articles, because people are going to come to Wikipedia wanting to find out the "true story" and will be surprised to find no mention of it, and will be inclined to add it themselves, sometimes (though not in this particular case) in good faith. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 08:14, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This discussion probably belongs on the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Levine_c6f3.html" title="James Levine">James Levine</a> talk page, but wouldn't Wikipedia policy on <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> demand that a published source be referenced to make even these claims? <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 13:54, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The specific discussion does belong there, but what I want to ask here is more general: if sources can be found confirming the existence of widespread rumors, and sources can be found showing that these rumors are unverifiable, isn't it encyclopedic to give that information? Every attempt to do so at <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Lee_Curtis_190e.html" title="Jamie Lee Curtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a> has been reverted, and given the current atmosphere at <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Levine_c6f3.html" title="James Levine">James Levine</a> I suspect attempts to do so there will be reverted too. I think it's better to have a section saying "The rumors you may have heard have no basis in fact, here's why" rather than ignoring them altogether. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 14:52, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This same sort of problem occurs frequently at <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_Aiken_b79b.html" title="Clay Aiken">Clay Aiken</a>. Whether or not he is gay, and only he could tell us for sure, there are lots of longstanding rumors about his orientation, and those rumors should be reported, if there is documentation of the rumors and they are widespread. But blogs and Usenet postings wouldn't work. Are there print cites of these rumors for Levine? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:20, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've had a lot of harassment in the last week from vandals who think that <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/GAY" class="extiw" title="m:GAY">I'm a faggot</a> <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">for following policy</a>. Even after a tounge-in-cheek comment on my user page that I have a girlfriend (for the record, I'm straight). Even after protection of user pages, there have been people emailing me saying "You are a faggot". Just because I blocked them, <b>just because I followed policy</b>. Just because I'm an admin. It's not just me with this harrassment, female admins get imposters with sexual and crude names. Anyone who follows policy is automatically harassed. There needs to be harsher penalties for harassment/homophobic comments. Otherwise, the project will deterioate with innocent editors leaving <b><a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESceptre_44d8.html" title="User:Sceptre"><span style="color: #09F">Sceptr</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color: green">e</span></a></b> <sup>(<em><a href="../../../s/c/e/User_talk%7ESceptre_51b5.html" title="User talk:Sceptre"><span style="color: #606">Talk</span></a></em>)</sup> 16:10, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do think that admins, when acting in their official capacities (cf., in their capacities as editors), ought to be more willing and better able to handle receiving vituperative or pejorative comments. It is often suggested that police, for example, inasmuch as they are people in whom power is reposited and who are expected to be well-trained and trustworthy, must handle situations more calmly and with tougher skin than might other people; what are <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighting_words.html" title="Fighting words">fighting words</a> to most people oughtn't necessarily to be so for the police. We also apply different <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a> standards--in general--when dealing with figures who are public, especially those who are volitionally so. Here, admins agree to take on added responsibilities for the project, and, as such, are bound to upset more people than they would as simple editors; I think it follows that they should be willing to accept, without reaction, more criticsm--even where made in bad faith and in contravention of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>--than would a "simple editor". I should say that I do see that many users, upon becoming admins, show more tolerance for harassment/abuse against them, and so I think that most have the right idea in this respect. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 18:10, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think most/all of us accept that we will face abuse at times, and vandalism of our user pages. That doesn't make it right, however. Unlike the police or the military we're not paid, nor do we send people to prison or shoot them. Some of the "offenders" here (in addition to not grasping that this an encyclopedia!) no sense of perspective. The Gator1 case illustrates that beyond all measure really. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 20:33, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Promising not to clutter AN/I anymore after this post...IMHO, Zoe's rape analogy is not particularly apt, if only because here the conduct about which I write is only discursive. I agree with Kingboy that, even as one accepts that he/she will be the victim of personal attacks, he/she needn't to concede that just attacks are proper, and I never meant to offer a normative view apropos of personal attacks. What I meant to say, what I think I did say, was that admins should have sufficiently thick skin that, when personal attacks are levelled against them for things done in their official capacities, they oughtn't to seek the issuance of/to issue a block. With respect to Zoe' Gator1 analogy, I don't think that such a comparison properly flows from what I said; there is surely a difference between one's making a personal attack on a talk page and one's taking extra-Wiki action, toward which proposition I adduce that one who refers derogatorily to another editor is not blocked for the same amount of time as one who negatively involves him/herself with another editor off-Wiki or disseminates personal details. None of this means that I countenance personal attacks--I don't, and I don't make them--but I think that an admin must overlook those attacks made against him/her for his/her admin actions, unless those personal attacks are profoundly disruptive to Wikipedia. After all, one of the reasons for which we have <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>--I think the primary reason--is that the making of personal attacks disrupts the collaborative environment on the existence of which Wikipedia depends; where criticism is directed at an admin qua admin (as against admin qua editor), there is little disruption of the editing process. I regret any inference made from my comments to the effect that I support the making of personal attacks against admins or that I think the anon in the Gator1 case was correct to act as he did; I mean simply to say that, where a user, objecting to an admin action, imputes bad faith or employs hostile terminology, an admin, both as a trusted Wikipedian and as someone who has elected to be "the public face of Wikipedia" to many first-time editors, should perhaps simply overlook the attack (I think, FWIW, as I said above, that most do). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 21:43, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey, look at the bright side. All that vandalism and hate mail means someone cares about you. Um...maybe not in a good way, but in some way. Most users are largely ignored. Until I started voting for stuff and joined esperanza, I never got any messages. Most users barely get anything unless they average over 200 edits a month, or they're pissing a bunch of people off. It's only blockings and deletions that give you a red badge of courage, and for that, you must be an admin. Sometimes I actually wish I was an admin, because then I wouldn't have to go out of my way to find stuff to fix when I log on. There would just be a bunch of people waiting for me, bitching on my talkpage. You have to enjoy the bitching and the vandalism.

<dd>Comment: Please keep comments specific to the article to that talk page... But regarding the problem with Sachs adding POV nonsense, it's already hard to add unsourced stuff as a number of us have that article on our watchlist and remove any edits like that as soon as we see them. Please do not try to solve a problem that doesn't exist by making radical changes. Sachs is just like a lot of netkooks out there, no need to get bent out of shape, as we handle these kind of incidents all the time. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 16:55, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sachs is under an injunction not to make attacks against Cornwell or use her name to promote his book. The edits here were partly to article space but also to places like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_alerts_4982.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts">Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts</a>, and <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Requests_for_Assistance_1619.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance">Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance</a>. The question is, should these allegations be removed from wikipedia, not just from article space but from these other spaces, and should the edits be deleted from the page history instead of just reverting (due to the injunction). I don't know what the answer should be. By the way, I have access to the full court decision if someone wants it. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:22, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually I'm a bit more concerned now as I have found the allegations are on the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Talk%7EPatricia_Cornwell_5fcf.html" title="Talk:Patricia Cornwell">Talk:Patricia Cornwell</a> and have not even been blanked. Sachs is apparently under an injunction in the US from making these allegations so he went overseas, however we are still in the US. Has a Foundation attorney ever expressed an opinion as to whether the allegations should be deleted or can remain? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:33, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

The list above is based on his activity in the last 3 days. Previously he was insulting other users (who he knew were capable to understand Russian) in the similar way; an example:<br />

In his recent conflict with another user <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:Space_Cadet" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">[ref]</a>, they both were banned for being “gratuitiously impolite in the edit comments”. But it didn’t stop the Kuban kazak from sharing the great potential of the Russian language.<br />
I put a few warnings on his talk page, but he removes it without explanation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKuban_kazak&amp;diff=47875135&amp;oldid=47873932" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKuban_kazak&amp;diff=47875135&amp;oldid=47873932" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKuban_kazak&amp;diff=48150668&amp;oldid=48150127" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKuban_kazak&amp;diff=48150668&amp;oldid=48150127" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKuban_kazak&amp;diff=48154971&amp;oldid=48151327" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKuban_kazak&amp;diff=48154971&amp;oldid=48151327" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.<br />
All of this is worsened by edit wars (between him and me) on <a href="../../../o/l/e/Oleksander_Koshetz_faf2.html" title="Oleksander Koshetz">Oleksander Koshetz</a>, <a href="../../../k/r/y/Kryvyi_Rih_Metro_Tram_8ccb.html" title="Kryvyi Rih Metro Tram">Kryvyi Rih Metro Tram</a>, and a few other pages.<br />

<p>Hi. I was just wondering if there's been a Wikipedia directive about changing all footnotes throughout the whole thing thing to reference note. <a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECydebot_35fe.html" title="User talk:Cydebot">User talk:Cydebot</a>, clearly trying to be helpful and pro-active, has created a bot that's been making summary changes to that effect (at <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Strange_ff58.html" title="Doctor Strange">Doctor Strange</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daredevil_%28Marvel_Comics%29_111b.html" title="Daredevil (Marvel Comics)">Daredevil (Marvel Comics)</a> and elsewhere).</p>
<p>I left this message at <a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECydebot_35fe.html" title="User talk:Cydebot">User talk:Cydebot</a>, to sum up my concern:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This seems like a pretty big summary change throughout Wikipedia, without any consensus that I can see here, at least. I'd like to get an Administrator opinion before your bot continues. Some editors prefer traditional footnotes, and unless there's a specific Wikipedia directive against them, I'm not sure it's good idea to make widespread changes that's just one person's personal preference.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks. Hope my questions aren't out of line. -- <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 17:24, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The current changes, replacing the outdated {{<a href="../../../f/n/_/Template%7EFn_2c6f.html" title="Template:Fn">fn</a>}} to {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_0622.html" title="Template:Ref">ref</a>}} does not seem to be changing the style or content, its just replacing an outdated template. However, this is clearly in preparation for converting all citations to the Cite.php format. While I personally like and use the Cite.php format (and would like to be able to request the bot' attention to a page I am editing) I do not think that a mass conversion to Cite.php would be at all good. As long as other methods of referencing are considered acceptable, I do not support mass conversion to any one particular method. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:40, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Just a note, Cydebot is run manually, so if anything is going wrong I am sitting right here watching it and will take action. I'm also continuously monitoring my talk page, so if you have any immediate comments or concerns it's best to bring them up at my talk page (rather than ANI or Cydebot's talk page). And yes, Thatcher's summary is pretty accurate. Cydebot isn't changing {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_0622.html" title="Template:Ref">ref</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENote_9446.html" title="Template:Note">note</a>}}, he's just changing all of the really old footnote/reference styles to be somewhat up-to-date. All of the conversions made to Cite.php using <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_Ref_converter_1043.html" title="User:Cyde/Ref converter">Ref converter</a> are done strictly manually. I'm going to hold off on Cydebot's work on references for a bit and work on the block notifications instead, so there's plenty of time to comment on this issue. May I request that you discuss it on <a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECydebot_35fe.html" title="User talk:Cydebot">User talk:Cydebot</a> though, as this board tends to run rather fast and a discussion of references doesn't exactly fit in amongst all of the vandalism reports&#160;:-P <b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA">Cyde&#160;Weys</font></a></b> 19:14, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The vandal stalker with the blocked IP range of 80.90.38.0/80.90.39.149 found out who I was and where I worked and sent a letter to the firm implying legal action and asking the firm if I blocked him as a member of the firm or my own and complaining about freedom of speech in a blatant attempt to frighten me and get me in trouble at work. It freaked them out and I had to look like an ass explaining myself. So I'm done dude, forget this.Please feel free to post this on a noticeboard and see if anyone has ideas.

<dd>No, that sounds like a really terrible idea. Don't mess with the man's work unless he asks you to. His boss probably doesn't give a hoot about whether Gator is a good wikipedian. He might very well care that Gator does a lot of editing here during the day. So, keep your nose out of his work unless he asks for help. As to how he was identified, his user page specified his law specialty, his town, and his college. Probably not real hard to figure out from there with Google's help. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 07:17, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi. Really I am on a break (or at least trying to be - compare my <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=BD2412&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=BD2412&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" rel="nofollow">editcount</a> from this month to last if you don't believe me. Frankly, I think we should call Jimbo on this one. I'm in a similar situation to Gator1 - if someone were to contact my work about something that happened here, they might freak out as well. Jimbo, of course, is immune to such ministrations. I am not particularly familiar with cyberstalking statutes, although I know they exist. I'd advise Gator1 to get a copy of that letter (if he has not already got one) and peruse it for any claims that would amount to <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defamation.html" title="Defamation">defamation</a>. I do not know that there is any precedent to look to, but a Wikipedia admin might be considered a limited-purpose public figure for the purposes of defamation and invasion of privacy, meaning that someone making a public complaint about an admin's conduct <i>as an admin</i> would have to be shown to have <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actual_malice.html" title="Actual malice">actual malice</a> for a cause of action to exist. If this person is making any untrue statement while advocating that Gator1 should lose his job or suffer some similar consequence, that <i>might</i> be enough to show actual malice. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 01:51, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually Gator's a lawyer himself, iirc. He's dropped enough information that a determined person could figure out where he works. Things like this make me think that the identity of the blocking admin needs to be hidden - instead of saying "you have been blocked by..." say "you have been blocked, click here to contact the blocking admin". A person would still be able to track down the block via the block log, but it makes it harder to draw the ire of the person blocked. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 03:52, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My thoughts are with Gator1, I hope nothing of further disruption occurs in his personal life. I would like to suggest two things, though. I recently had an incident similar to this whereas I posted personal information on Wikipedia and was threatened to have it removed immediately, thus did everything I could to eliminate it. In Gator1's case, I noticed two things that should be done to complete Gator's complete removal from Wikipedia, its mirror sites, and other archives, for his personal safety. <b>(1)</b>—I noticed his talk page archives are still intact, and believe they should be immediately removed given the original talk page is deleted. <b>(2)</b>—A major problem I had with my incident was <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>'s cached versions of the personal information I published. A quick review of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> search revealed that both <a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:X6SP8viRsUQJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Gator1+user+Gator1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external text" title="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:X6SP8viRsUQJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Gator1+user+Gator1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">Gator1's user page</a> (which contains personal information) as well as his <a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:1-d_gcxJXlgJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gator1+user+talk+Gator1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external text" title="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:1-d_gcxJXlgJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gator1+user+talk+Gator1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">talk page</a> and its archives are completely intact in their pre-deleted form, under the Cached versions of these pages. I recommend someone visit Google's "AUTOBOT" which would immediately remove the cached versions from their site, or wait a few days for their automatic removal..thought it may take up to 4 weeks. Sorry for the difficulties, Gator1, and I'm sorry you are leaving Wikipedia for good. Good luck and I hope you can perhaps make a new user name and visit.

<dd>Good suggestion, HappyCamper, however I have run into an obstacle concerning the Google cache pages that I was planning to request for deletion from the Google archive. It is a problem that only a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrator.html" title="Administrator">administrator</a> can fix, and I was hoping that you or perhaps <a href="../../../a/l/h/User%7EAlhutch_2589.html" title="User:Alhutch">User:Alhutch</a> could assist me. While I was at Google requesting the removal of Gator1's user page and his talk page, the automated system noted that User:Gator1 and User talk:Gator1 did not have the <i><b>appropriate META tags</b></i> required for deletion of the cached pages. With my previous experience on the matter, I am sure of the fact that the only way for a page to acquire these tags is either to delete the pages completely at Wikipedia, whereas the tags would be entered into the HTML automatically, or to contact Jimbo Wales and request that he alter the HTML codec himself (he being the only person with access to this). Since the first option is easier, I suggest an administrator do so now so I can complete my request for the cached page removal. You'll note that both User:Gator1 and User talk:Gator1 have this template&#160;: {{deletedmiscpage}} rather than the pages just being removed, as traditional, so I suggest they just be removed. Thanks to the administrator who does this, I'm sure Gator1 would appreciate it as having your personal info. accessible on Google is less than desirable. — <small><a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyInSane_3df2.html" title="User:CrazyInSane">CRAZY</a></small>`<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazyInSane_e382.html" title="User talk:CrazyInSane">(<small>IN</small>)</a>`<small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CrazyInSane_cf68.html" title="Special:Contributions/CrazyInSane">SANE</a></small> 05:02, 8 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The only real option is to completely blank the pages. Technically, a deleted page cannot be protected, and I do not want to remove the protection if the stalker is going to come back. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 05:07, 8 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I thought that they were protected anyway? Regardless, this is a difficult tradeoff, but I would be inclined to help Gator1 have is stuff removed from the Google cache first. If another administrator wants to restore that single edit, (or simply add another tag again), please feel free to do so. However, I think a better alternative is to keep very vigilant for a little bit, while hopefully in 2 days the Google cache clears out. After 48 hours, we can replace those tags. At least, doing so will give this google cache clearing a chance. We can accomodate this I think. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 05:15, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agree with HappyCamper on this one, I successfully processed the requests through Google to remove the cached pages immediately, and they should be gone within a couple of days. I think we owe it to Gator1 to play it safe and keep these pages deleted until the Google cached versions are eradicated. — <small><a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyInSane_3df2.html" title="User:CrazyInSane">CRAZY</a></small>`<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazyInSane_e382.html" title="User talk:CrazyInSane">(<small>IN</small>)</a>`<small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CrazyInSane_cf68.html" title="Special:Contributions/CrazyInSane">SANE</a></small> 05:18, 8 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Protection is automatically removed once you delete the pages. However, it does prevent anon IPs from starting the pages. The problem is that an established user can still leave a message on Gator1's talk page (or even the user page). So the best way now to deal with this issue is that we still can put the pages on our watchlists. <a href="../../../1/0/q/User_talk%7E10qwerty.html" title="User talk:10qwerty"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">10qwerty</font></a> 05:21, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wish Gator1 were here to comment on the best course of action, but personally I think it's best to assess the Google caches first, because that's where a stalker could pick up on his personal information. Restoring the User:Gator1 and User talk:Gator1 pages would result in Google's BOTS to ignore the requests to remove the cached pages, thus they (including their prominence as the top search results when someone searches for "<i>Gator1</i>") would continue to be available through Google for up to 4 weeks. — <small><a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyInSane_3df2.html" title="User:CrazyInSane">CRAZY</a></small>`<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazyInSane_e382.html" title="User talk:CrazyInSane">(<small>IN</small>)</a>`<small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CrazyInSane_cf68.html" title="Special:Contributions/CrazyInSane">SANE</a></small> 05:28, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know how Google handles this request and so take your (CrazyInSane's) word for it. Or anyway I try to. But I don't fully follow the logic. More broadly, any statement here that it would be better for X not to happen will I presume be avidly read by our friend allegedly in the vicinity of Luxembourg, who will then do his or her best to make X happen. Further, I of course know nothing of the content of any email (and don't want to know it), but I did do a little looking around in the user and talk page history and found very little information there about Gator. I learned one thing about Gator that I (perhaps naively) find entirely innocuous, and I saw considerable evidence of the user or users of several IP numbers being obnoxious or worse. I am not versed in law, but I wonder whether it might actually help if these obnoxious messages were, if not in plain sight, at least accessible via the history tab. But I defer to others, and particularly to the wishes of Gator. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:13, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This situation must be taken very seriously as the project is doomed if excellent editors can just be driven out by people who obviously have no interest in building an encyclopedia. When I was a sys admin (in the "real" world) I had a normal user account and did all my work requiring special access from a separate "system manager" account. For me it was primarily so I had an unpriviliged account I could use to check if I'd messed up but this harrassment of Gator1 does argue for a division of the admin duties from normal editing. Maybe an admin forum for discussing blocks etc could be created which would not be visible to anons and new editors? Whatever something must be done to stop this happening again and I can only hope that Gator1 can find a way of returning safely. Hope he's reading this as I'm sure he needs a boost at the moment.

<dd>Gator is one of an increasing number of admins who've been threatened, stalked, or abused on Wikipedia, on other websites, and in real life, because of their admin actions. I agree witih Sophia that it's time to do something about it, but it's hard to know what. A few people tried to set up an admin-only board a few months ago (where non-admins could read it, but not post to it), but it was quickly shot down as unwiki-like, so a board that non-admins can't even see likely wouldn't work, although there's an admin-only IRC channel I believe (or there was: I've never used it, so I don't know whether it still exists). Even with such a board in place, users would still get to know who blocked them, and we're often called to account and have to post here about blocks anyway. I can offer no solutions, except that the lesson for people who want to become admins in future is to make sure that your screen name is not connected in any way to your real-life identity. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:48, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In my opinion after I took a quick glance at the deleted history, Gator unfortunately gave away too much information on his user page – enough information that a determined person with enough time could easily look up on Google and other online directories.

<p>I think this is just ridiculous, what is wrong with a person when they find it neccesary to email some poor guy's boss and complain. However, I'm not sure that other people emailing his boss in support of Gator would be the best course of action. The only way I think it would be beneficial would be if the person was influential enough that Gator's boss would recognize the editor's real-life work.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 07:55, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What an awful situation. This suggestion may be totally out of line - if it is, please forgive me - but I infer from what Mongo has suggested that some of the clues to Gator!'s identity may be found in article talk / other user talk spaces. If Mongo (or another informed editor) knows where these clues are to be found, could they be expunged to prevent anyone else who may think that it would be amusing to 'copycat stalk' Gator1? <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colonel Tom</a> 08:57, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm concerned that reopening to delete areas that may have personal information may offset the google cache as described above...admittedly, I am completely ignorant of these issue. I have watched Gator almost since he first started editing, and I don't recall him making any comments aside from what he does and in what State he does it. I never remember him posting his Email, home address phone number or using his actual name...maybe he accidentally responded to an Email from this vandal and that gave up his real name, which I have gotten from him when he Emails me. I set up a "bogus" Email account for Wikipedia, that does not give my actual name, and the Email is through Yahoo...I highly recommend others do this as well, through whatever service they use. I don't want to alarm people but just trying to emphasize the importance of privacy if indeed you work a potentially sensitive career or have a particular need for animity. Gator did ask me to block this editor before...I just retrieved a lengthy email from him dated 3/28/06 and am scanning it to see if posting it here is any help.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 09:10, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Looking over the email, it is actually a long comment sent to Gator by another editor in regards to this IP vandal. Gator wanted my feedback on whther I thought his six month blocks were fair, and sent me the Email he had received from another Wikipedian. Apparently, Gator has run afoul of a particularily resourceful and hostile Usenet veteran with a nack for privacy invasion. I may ask the original emailer if he minds if I forward the information to Jimbo or the Foundation...because this means there is actually not one but two people who may have been forced out from editing due to threats in real life by this vandal.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 09:26, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One way may be to advise new editors to keep their real ID's private and warn/delete personal information on sight. Maybe a wiki project on editor anonymity is needed to see what the community thinks. Also <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> could be modified to make it clear that whilst you need to be bold with article information and editing you should not be so with revealing your true identity. We need to warn users when they start as most breaches of privacy are likely to happen when they are new and keen and by the time they are established and want to go for admin status the damage will already be done. The e-mail idea by MONGO is a good one and should be recommended too. Most kids are now taught about internet security/anonymity at school (at least in the UK) but anyone out of their teens is unlikely to have learned about this and may not realise the potential problems.

<p>I really don't want to bring it up with them again. If I can get through this week without being fired, I'm happy. I am watching the AN/I page and I did give you the IP range, to do with as the community feels is appropriate. To clarify: this nutcase sent an actual snail mail letter directly to the firm, not an e-mail. Which only made it worse I think. It stated that a made up committee in Luxembourg had nominated me for some sarcastic award for blocking the IP range, that the committee was going to go to court and make a stink about it in the papers and wanted to know if I was acting as an associate of the firm or by myself (which freaked them out the most). Anyway, I'll lt you know what my job does with me. I'd just like to know how he got my name. Thanks, G</p>

<p>I am very sorry to read all this. The stalker, as you will see on the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Talk%7EPhaistos_9752.html" title="Talk:Phaistos">Talk:Phaistos</a> archives, has long plagued Usenet as "grapheus" and has actually managed to sue his nemesis there (although he didn't press charges in the end). Gator has blocked him on WP for making threats of real-life harassment to another editor. I think that <i>yes</i>, now would be the time to contact the guy's ISP and ask them to terminate the guy's account. Tell them that their entire range is blocked from editing en-wiki because of that one bad egg. The stalker has shown extreme resilience on Usenet, pursuing his single cause with manic determination for <i>years</i>. Gator was brave to apply the block single-handedly, but I think the lesson from this should not be to hide your identity because there are mad people. It may mean you should be extra careful when editing on company time, but I have a hard time imagining a reason why Gator's employer should be concerned about some guy from Luxemburgh complaining about him having performed an administrative action on a private website where he is authorized to perform such actions. I do hope you will be fine, Gator; in the meantime, if Jimbo can be bothered, he could lift Gator's block and re-instate it himself, so Gator's name will not continue to show up as the blocking admin and there will be no doubt whatsoever about the wiki-wide agreement on blocking the stalker. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 00:28, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wonder whether we should create a list of admins willing to take on blocks of extra-difficult people such as this guy. The list could comprise admins who know there's nothing to link their Wikipedia identities to their real-life ones, or who don't care if there is. In that way, other admins who are worried about being tracked down, or who've already been threatened, could discreetly contact one of the admins on the list and ask him/her to take over. There are drawbacks to this (because it creates a list of perceived tough and not-so-tough admins), but it might still be better than the current situation. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:53, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Trolling aside, I feel they fail to distinguish between Gator's career as an attorney, and his actions on Wikipedia as an administrator and as a member of the Mediation Committee. These actions are paralegal, but not judicial. Wikipedia is not a court of law. I agree that Gator should look to his colleagues for legal advice; however, what we discuss here concerns actions on Wikipedia. It should not be construed as <b>legal</b> advice, but may still be helpful. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Grigory Deepdelver of Brockenboring</a><sup><small><a href="../../../a/r/c/User_talk%7EArchola_c035.html" title="User talk:Archola"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></small></sup><a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_The_Centrist_Fellowship_1c2b.html" title="User:Archola/The Centrist Fellowship"><font color="#404040">TCF</font></a> 01:36, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>NLSE: Please just remove the block on 71.141.0.0/24 becaues it is utterly pointless. It is part of a giant, complex American pool of IP addresses that are near-randomly distributed on a moment-to-moment basis by SBC. Perhaps in your Asian hierarchy, with its emphasis on conformity and hierarchy, you can do a meaningful block on a /24, but here in America, where freedom is the basis of our success, your block just makes you looks stupid. Here, if you do not believe me, take a look at this page: <a href="http://www.scconsult.com/sbclist.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.scconsult.com/sbclist.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.scconsult.com/sbclist.shtml</a> . And let me tell you: for the hundred of thousands of wealthy, bill-paying SBC DSL customers, when they reboot their router, they get a vastly different IP address from a vast and fragmented range. Let me also note that SFNC21 (San Francisco-21) and PLTN13 (Pleasanton-13) are, in many ways, merged into one huge pool for San Francisco Bay area SBC customers. Your block just shows your inexperience with how the Internet works. For you own sake, please just remove your ignorant block. It means, for all practical purposes, zero effect on your target, and will be almost 100% "collateral damage". -- <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESillymemine_81f9.html" title="User:Sillymemine">Sillymemine</a> 15:55, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm also a lawyer and I'm willing to do some legal research on this incident, if U.S. law applies. (I don't have competence in any other country.) It would help enormously to know which jurisdiction's law applies. (Some of the points BDA raised flow from the First Amendment, and are standard throughout the U.S., but the incident also raises some issues as to which state laws probably vary somewhat.) Perhaps someone could email me privately with (1) the state in which Gator's workplace is located (I probably have no use for any more precise information); and, if known, the states in which (2) the sender of the threatening letter and (3) the headquarters of that person's ISP are located. I'm not an admin but I'll treat any such information sent to me as a confidential attorney-client communication. I realize that, even if Gator has a cause of action against the malefactor, Gator might choose not to pursue it, for fear of causing more trouble at his workplace. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 07:40, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>MONGO was one of those called on by Morton devonshire in his POV push to delete an article<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=48167806&amp;oldid=48141874" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=48167806&amp;oldid=48141874" rel="nofollow">diff</a>; I don't think an admin should participate in such an action. Additionally, MONGO's recommendation does not articulate a valid reason for deletion: "<b>Delete</b> So a few Bush haters and terminated employees got together and complained...no surprise." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bush_Crimes_Commission_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=48221360&amp;oldid=48220405" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bush_Crimes_Commission_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=48221360&amp;oldid=48220405" rel="nofollow">diff</a> One could possibly infer that his reasoning is that it is nn, but a closing admin could just as easily ignore his recommendation for lacking a reason.

<dd>Seems pretty clear to me that he's saying it's non-notable. I'm sure he would expand his reasoning if you asked him to. As you say yourself, a closing admin could just as easily ignore his recommendation for lacking a reason as that admin could infer that MONGO meant it was non-notable, so if anything your argument seems to be that his vote commentary isn't persuasive enough. If the closing admin wanted more information about what MONGO meant, they too could ask on his talk page. If MONGO deleted the page in question out of the blue and left that as a rationale, yeah, I'd say that would be inappropriate. But this is simply an AfD vote. I see nothing here out of the ordinary or against policy whatsoever—I've seen votes far more terse than that on AfD—and aside for your implicit request that MONGO elaborate on his position, I don't really understand the grievance you're claiming. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 17:46, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'll grant you both that it isn't an especially egregious action, but nonetheless feel the conduct was unbecoming. Again, the objections I had were: (1) that MONGO should have not participated in the POV push to delete, or if he felt he really had to then should have noted that he'd been asked to participate (as Jersey Devil noted), and (2) that an admin should articulate valid reasons to delete, rather than leaving their reason open to interpretation &amp; that their reason should not be expressed in such a derogatory POV way - particularly when there is a POV push on the AFD. As I said, perhaps that sort of behavior can pass for the average user, but I think admins should meet higher standards. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 18:03, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Per kingboyk, I dont see how this is relevant to this board. MONGO is not acting in any administrative function on that afd, and while he <b>is</b> an administrator, administrators are just regular editors with a few extra buttons...and I've seen plenty of regular editors make far more snarky comments. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 18:12, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the edit summary on QE is self-incriminating: he actually called someone to confirm QE was employed there??? I reverted for you, because this smacks strongly of self-promotion, but this discussion really <b>should</b> take place on the relevant Talk pages.

<dd>I think when two of make identical reverts, only one of them shows up on the log. It's just to confuse us and make us think more than we need to.

<dd>I've left notes on both of the talk pages about this. I'll need people to keep on eye on it when he gets back from the block, though. I'm afraid I wouldn't support an AfD in this case.

<p>I don't understand the indef block. Can someone please exlain what he did to justify this? I looked through his most recent contributions and I don't see anything that bad. Also, I don't think the talk_page/project_page edit count is a problem. He has several hundred article and article_talk edits. He seems to have limited himself to editing a proposed project over the last month, but I don't see there is anything wrong with that. I don't know of any policy that says that one must edit in all spaces simultaneously. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 00:38, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>His article talk edits have mostly been edit warring over the poll about the Muhammad cartoons, likewise his article edits. No positive contributions. As Sam said above,

<dd>Stifle, Ryan Delaney is quite right. Dismissing our basic insistence that images be sourced as "copyright paranoia" is unhelpfully flippant. It's fine to ask that we be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> when we remind people that we need this information, but it isn't okay to encourage people to revert image-cleanup procedures. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 18:16, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There's been previous discussion about this user and a similar issue <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive85_8805.html#User:R.D.H._.28Ghost_In_The_Machine.29" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive85">here</a>, and I, unfortunately, have doubts that this issue will be settled quietly, either. The earlier conversation quickly derailed into one side begging for exceptions to clear-cut Wikimedia copyright policy. In short, fair use images were removed from the R.D.H.'s page after two months of ignored warnings by at least five separate users, <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (neutrally, to prevent edit warring) protected R.D.H.'s user page after fair use images were removed, <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> and <a href="../../../r/2E/d/User%7ER.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29_1bea.html" title="User:R.D.H.

<dd>I can hardly believe the assessments made here. I'm not saying RDH isnt hotheaded and sarcastic - he certainly is. But <i>people</i>, lets have some perspective. The images concerned were mostly bordering on PD. Furthermore, the guy is not a troll, but a wonderful contributor on actual content. Sure we could ban him, but perhaps, <i>maybe</i>, some Tact<sup>tm</sup> would help to actually keep good contributors inside the Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Of course he <i>has</i> had a rather hot head lately. But personally, I can understand his frustration. He's trying to make some beuatiful articles, and <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattKingston_4e5c.html" title="User:MattKingston">User:MattKingston</a> suddenly starts listing his contributions on IFD, noting not that the images are problematic, but rather that the user is problematic. He doesnt even have the common decency to actually <i>tell</i> RDH his work is being undone. Now ask yourself, would you be slightly angry if this happened to you?</dd>
<dd>Seriously, if you destroy somebody else's work, you should realise that you're bound to affect them in some way or another! Whether the delete/edit/revert was justified or not, this is one situation in which we need to be doubly civil. We all know that the exodus of good editors is one of the largest problems on the Wiki, yet nobody seems to link it to this kind of behaviour. I daresay almost all of the editors who left, did so because their work was destroyed by some untactful other editor.</dd>
<dd>To top it all off, there is a casual conversation with threats to take him to ArbCom, and hoping that his dwindling editing count is a signal of him maybe stopping Wikipedia and his "vandalism an uncivil" actions <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattKingston_7cac.html#Re:_RFA" title="User talk:MattKingston">(see here)</a>.

<dd>I'm sorry that on my above posts that I forgot to sign, hopefully I won't forget to sign this post. MoW, I think you'd have a more clear picture of the situation if you reviewed the entire history of the interaction between RDH and myself. You'll note that every message I've ever left on his talk page has been removed without responding to it (often with an incivil edit summary). And that every time I've notified him that an image has been tagged, he's reacted by simply removing the tag. Every image that I've posted on IfD was in clear violation of WP policy. As for his stuff "bordering on PD", an example of an artist that he stole from was Andre Jouineau (see upload summaries at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=R.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=R.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>). Now it seems to me, from amazon<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/Author=Jouineau,%20Andre" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/Author=Jouineau,%20Andre" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>, Mr. Jouineau still earns his living from the paintings he produces. This image was tagged as {PD-old} by RDH. Yes, I say without hesitation that if a user engages repeatedly in uploading someone else's copryighted work and tagging it as public domain then they are a problem. One would have to be very naive to think that any of the other images that he uploaded (and refuses to provide sources for) are PD. Perhaps his contribution to article text is valuable to the project, and perhaps his text is original or free, but his image contributions are worse than unfree, they couldn't even pass as fair use. I'm greatly dismayed that he's been permitted to continue with this behaviour for as long as he has.<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattKingston_4e5c.html" title="User:MattKingston">Matt</a> 22:30, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your're absolutely right, plagiarism need to be dealt with. But is that <i>really</i> what we are talking about here? In this regard I think Stifle's comment above is on the money. RDH is too laissez-faire, and you are too restrictive. Check out <a href="../../../l/o/u/Image%7ELouis_lazare_hoche.jpg_a609.html" title="Image:Louis lazare hoche.jpg">Image:Louis lazare hoche.jpg</a>. The artist has been dead for <i>181</i> years. Nonetheless, you "mercilessly" tag it as plagiarism, because there is some question about who did the colouring. Now, I dont find RDH's comments on "copyright paranoia" very helpful, but I can sympathise.</dd>
<dd>But I'll repeat what I said. It has little to do with the fact that you put them up for deletion. Whether or not your nomination has any merit is a matter for an IFD discussion, not here. What I am concerned about is your total disregard of the fact that somebody worked his ass off to put it up there - in good faith - and you didnt even bother to inform him of the fact that you were undoing his hard work. Regardless of whether or not you are right on the copyright (which in some cases is up for debate as well), your conduct (and lack of it) towards him, and the comments on your talk page hoping he is going to leave, are very VERY unbecoming for any editor.</dd>
<dd>If you want him to assume good faith, and be civil, fair enough. But reflect on your own actions as well. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Minister_of_War_9b5a.html" title="User:The Minister of War"><u><font color="navy">The Minist</font></u></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><u><font color="green">e</font></u></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Minister_of_War_9b5a.html" title="User:The Minister of War"><u><font color="navy">r of War</font></u></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Minister_of_War_5304.html" title="User talk:The Minister of War"><sup><font color="navy">(Peace)</font></sup></a> 10:34, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm. I did go into the history, just didnt think I'd need to go back to March! Indeed, it seems you did warn him. My apologies.</dd>
<dd>Still, the comment "ban this guy already" at the start of the thread, and the discussion hoping he'd leave the wiki really arent pretty, and certainly gave me the impression of being vindictive. Too many good editors are pushed off the wiki by such things, which should be avoided at all costs. I can now see where these remarks came from though.</dd>
<dd>In an attempt to bridge the frustration you both seem to have with eachother (and I have had a derivative of), perhaps I can help. I really do think RDHs contributions are valuable, and I feel they're worth fighting for. If you dont mind, I suggest keeping the problematic images up for a bit longer, so that we can keep searching for the sources which RDH didnt mention.

<dd>Thank you, and I appreciate that if you were unaware that this was a long standing issue that my behaviour seems inappropriate. And I certainly could have made an effort to continue notifying him despite his behaviour, but I've been lazy as of late. Regardless of whether these images are resolved, or whether he ever comes back, I still think he needs to be banned until he acknowledges his behaviour, agrees to play by the rules, and provide complete and honest information on the images that he uploads. As for the USMA, I don't believe that they're a division of the US federal government (they might not be a government institution at all). They have a copyright notice on their main page. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattKingston_4e5c.html" title="User:MattKingston">Matt</a> 17:55, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>hmm... I expect a good number have left after becoming disillusioned that we were building a free encyclopedia here. It's very draining when a user is able to flout policy and copyright laws and no-one seems to have any interest in doing anything about it. I've now had to run over to the commons and warn them there about his uploading copyright material and tagging it as PD. Good to see that everyone's taking this so seriously. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattKingston_4e5c.html" title="User:MattKingston">Matt</a> 01:42, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>For a few days now, <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurt_Leyman_1ee7.html" title="User:Kurt Leyman">Kurt Leyman</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperDeng_2807.html" title="User:SuperDeng">SuperDeng</a> are revert-warrying on the article <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Budapest_dc85.html" title="Battle of Budapest">Battle of Budapest</a>. Kurt keeps on editing the article, and Superdeng reverts it. The problem is that Kurt himself has a quite heavy backlog of doubtful edits and while some of his edits are quite good, some are not.</p>
<p>I was about to propose to both of them to take their respective edits, sort them (since I wrote the orginal page, I know the subject) and create a new version, asking them to no longer bicker on this page. But I need your support for that.</p>
<p>Incidentally, <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> advised me to post here too.</p>

<dd>Thanks for a quick reply Woohookitty. Indeed, these two are following each other on the site. However, it would appear that Kurt changes sensitive content on these pages. In the case of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Budapest_dc85.html" title="Battle of Budapest">Battle of Budapest</a>, however, all of his edits are actually quite good, improving my original English, but two or three totally **** up the page. And SuperDeng reverts them back in bulk. I would like to take their respective edits, mix them and modify my own original article with those. However, in order to do this, they must stop their edit wars... Hence my post here...&#160;:) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr">grafikm_fr</a> 11:40, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We're speaking from 2 different perspectives.&#160;:) You are looking at a resolution on this one article, which is fine. I'm looking at it as an admin...and we have to stop ridiculous revert wars like this, especially when it encompasses several articles. As I said, what I have above is just a sample. I could've presented several more cases. If it was a major WWII battle, they've revert warred on in the last 2 weeks. It needs to be stopped. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 11:43, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>It seems to me that Kurt, knowing Deng's irascible character, provokes him on purpose. Deng added important material to many articles, which I've never seen Kurt do. His contributions to Wikipedia are limited to pushing pro-Axis POV in numerous articles, though he occasionally makes grammatical improvements too. For example, in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_War_0986.html" title="Winter War">Winter War</a> he sparkled an edit war by repeatedly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Winter_War&amp;diff=47335011&amp;oldid=47326285" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Winter_War&amp;diff=47335011&amp;oldid=47326285" rel="nofollow">changing neutral phrases</a> like "The Soviets failed to take advantage of their numerical superiority at the start of the war" to heavily POV stuff like "As a result of both arrogance and incompetence, the Soviets also failed to achieve a decisive superiority at the start of the war". I can't see other reason for adding such sentences as "Sentimental Finnish veterans frequently boast that for every one Finnish soldier who died, ten Soviets lost their lives in the Winter War" - except pushing one's POV and provoking revert wars. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">-трёп-</a></sup> 11:54, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, he made the change to all of the 'DefCon' pages (0-5). I wound up marking them all with 'noinclude' tags so that those pages can be considered without impacting all the userpages which link to them (I tracked it down because I noticed right off that I recognized alot of the impacted users as vandal fighters). Generally I don't think that this meets the speedy deletion criteria, but there are obviously some touchy issues here so I left the 'delete because' notice on the pages themselves while we sort it out. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 14:28, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

Coincedently, the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clothes_free_movement.html" title="Clothes free movement">Clothes free movement</a> saw its light just months before at the beginning of Januari 2006 when the commercial <i>The International Naturists Association (INA)</i> changed its name in Januari 2006 to <i>ClothesFree International, Inc.</i> see <a href="http://clothesfree.com/namechange.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://clothesfree.com/namechange.html" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>.

Could someone check when the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clothes_free_movement.html" title="Clothes free movement">Clothes free movement</a> page was created and who did it?

<p>This is the message that I get when I attempt to edit anything.</p>
<p>Your user name or IP address has been blocked from editing. You were blocked by GraemeL for the following reason (see our blocking policy): "Autoblocked because your IP address has been recently used by "Brandubh Blathmac". The reason given for Brandubh Blathmac's block is: "Sockpuppet"." Your IP address is 216.194.3.216.</p>
<p>I have denied being the sockpuppet they accuse me of, and I don't even know this chap they insist on conflating me with, but I do know that I have yet to be provided either with a scintilla of proof of these allegations, or an arbitration hearing at which I can speak on my own behalf and will abide by whatever the arbitrators feel is fair. They have even accused me to "hopping IPs" even though I only use one computer, the same computer, my home PC!!</p>
<p>It is NOT FAIR that this group - Jtdirl, Demiurge, Camillus, GraemeL., Ali-oops, et al) can collude and censor me indefinitely/ permanently because they regard me as an inconvenience. I refuse to be cowed into editing anonymously or being forced from the Wikipedia community.</p>
<p>I know I have done good things and I know there are revisionists and censors prowling Wikipedia to revise or airbrush their own pet topics, and I have been on the watch against them, particularly Demiurge, who is nothing more than a WANNABE CENSOR who has personally gutted or tried to gut anything he personally does not like, from war criminal <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ante_Pavelic_2ed4.html" title="Ante Pavelic">Ante Pavelic</a> to the history of domestic terrorism in the United States to <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-Code_0581.html" title="Pre-Code">pre-Code</a> movies/history of film censorship in the US to the refugee policies of <a href="../../../e/a/m/Eamon_de_Valera_90a6.html" title="Eamon de Valera">Eamon de Valera</a>'s Irish Free State during WW2, et al. He has been caught red-handed by other Wikipedians (third parties, if you will) in this habit several times, and been forced to back down. I don't know if he is on anyone's payroll or if he is working pro bono, but I do know he is a censor and a review of his edits will confirm this.</p>
<p>Review their edits (especially Demiurge) and their history of interwiki collusion regarding myself if you do not believe me. I have read some of their missives to each other including the one where Graeme L. told Camillus and some of the others that he was "getting to the point" where he was going to "indefinitely block" me whenever I log on because I would not let them push me around or threaten me, not because of any editorial abuses he could point to.</p>
<p>I admit that I am not perfect, and that I do occasionally respond emotively to certain issues (such as the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, for instance, and that caused me to lose the respect of Bridesmill who accused me of failing to amuse him/her and of being "disingenuous"), but I stand by the overwhelming majority of my edits and I should be judged on my contributions to Wikipedia, and not on the whims or dislikes of a few who are acting in concert against me, and accusing me of being someone else.</p>
<p>Administrators have more important functions than harrassing those they don't agree with -- such as protecting Wikipedia's name and respectability from those who would exploit the occasional and unpreventable error (such as the folks at wikipediawatch.org).</p>

<dd>(Fixing some more formatting.) I looked too, and besides the fact that you've edited <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernie_Sanders_5f17.html" title="Bernie Sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> a lot more than twice, I see a number of 3RR warnings on your talkpage, and some other good advice, politely given, from Heah. Especially, there are several warnings against thinking that content dispute reverts count as "reverting vandalism" and consequently don't "count" against 3RR. A sample dip into your edits shows that you are indeed calling good-faith editing "vandalism" in your edit summaries. Don't do that, it's a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. Please don't make personal attacks. I'm sorry you've got off on the wrong foot here and are upset, but please use the block time to consider your own part in it.
