<p>I must begin this notice by declaring my bias in this. I am one of the disputing sides in this issue. The issue I wish to raise is the following: In recent days, the deletion process has witnessed two strange cases. The first occurred in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Gay_rights_in_Iraq_63d0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gay rights in Iraq">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gay rights in Iraq</a>. User:Chooserr wished to see this deleted because of pov issues. He then posted this message on <a href="../../../2A/d/r/User%7E_drew_2c46.html" title="User:*drew">User:*drew</a>'s talk page: "You listed yourself as Roman Catholic so I thought I might bring this unencyclopedic total POV pushing article to your attention. It is currently up for deletion here." He left the same messages at the talk pages of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABurwellian&amp;diff=31547398&amp;oldid=31500094" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABurwellian&amp;diff=31547398&amp;oldid=31500094" rel="nofollow">Burwellian</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APitchka&amp;diff=31543290&amp;oldid=31542015" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APitchka&amp;diff=31543290&amp;oldid=31542015" rel="nofollow">Pitchka</a>. Pitchka was the only one who voted. When I nominated Category:Pro-choice celebrities and Category:Pro-life celebrities for deletion, Pitchka immediately put notices of this on no less than 57 user talk pages. These users were selected as members of the Catholic or pro-life user categories. The first 30 or so of these users were told: "Hi, I see that you are listed as a Pro-Life Wikipedian, well the Pro-life celebrities category is up for deletion. Category:Pro-life celebrities The abortion zealots don't want anyone to think that any celebrity is actually pro-life." When I pointed out to him that I had nominated Category:Pro-choice celebrities for deletion as well, Pitchka told me: "Am I wrong? I don't think so. Most pro-abortion people don't want this information out. There are plenty of categories and articles that might no appear in an ordinary encyclopedia. This is not an ordinary encyclopedia. So it doesn't matter that you nominated both that is standard operating procedure for people who don't want the info out!" After this, he informed another 25 to 30 users of the ongoing cfd, with the deliberate intention to convince them to vote to keep the category. Of the 57 informed users, thirteen joined the vote (Chooserr, Anti-Anonymex2, Musical Linguist, Dominick, Jakes18, Elliskev, jgofborg, Avalon, Merovingian, Patsw, Eoghanacht, Getcrunk, Shanedidona), all voting to keep the article. In fact, the only keep voter that wasn't contacted was Pitchka, the person who contacted all the others. Technically speaking, these users are not meat puppets. These are all decent and appreciated contributors. However, it's safe to say that their joining the cfd was a result of a deliberate canvassing by Pitchka. Since Chooserr has done the same with an AfD, this behaviour cannot be viewed as isolated acts. This is a clear pattern to influence the outcome of votes. I am contacting the admins about this, because I believe that this case is important to the future of wikipedia. This pattern of behaviour does not just influence wikipedia's content (the decision to keep or delete articles and categories), it also involves wikipedia policy. I fear that wikipedia will be prone to AfD campaigning, that users who have an interest in seeing an article, category, template or stub kept or deleted will canvas a large amount of users, hoping that a sufficient percentage of those contacted will vote and steer the vote in the desired direction. This might open up wikipedia to a "dictatorship of numbers", where a fanatic group of individuals "conspire" ("To join or act together; combine") to influence the content of wikipedia to pander the (in this case religious) pov of the users involved. This would be a violation of several key tenets of wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>praatpaal</sup></a> 00:12, 17 December 2005 (UTC)<br />
<b>Update 1</b>: two more keep votes on the cfd, of Hégésippe Cormier and Christopher Parham. Hégésippe Cormier was informed of this cfd by Pitchka, Christopher Parham was not. This means that of the 16 keep votes currently cast, 15 are from what I call "Pitchka's group" (consisting of the aforementioned users Pitchka, Chooserr, Anti-Anonymex2, AnnH, Dominick, Jakes18, Elliskev, jgofborg, Avalon, Merovingian, Patsw, Eoghanacht, Getcrunk and Shanedidona, and Hégésippe Cormier) and 1 is from a non-related user. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>praatpaal</sup></a> 10:25, 18 December 2005 (UTC)<br />
<b>Update 2</b>: <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">User:Chooserr</a> has today notified 6 users (Pitchka, Speculative catholic, GreatGatsby, Thomas Aquinas, Dominick and Jgofborg) of the AfD on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Student_LifeNet_f340.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Student LifeNet">Student LifeNet</a>. Most of them had also been notified of the aforementioned cfd, afd (on gay rights in Iraq) or both. The users have one thing in common: they are categorized as Roman Catholic Wikipedians. So the behaviour to canvas carefully selected users hoping that their voting will influence the outcome of deletion votes continues, albeit not as seriously as Pitchka's 57 notices. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>praatpaal</sup></a> 19:13, 18 December 2005 (UTC)<br />
<b>Update 3</b>: <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanedidona_a695.html" title="User:Shanedidona">User:Shanedidona</a> has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AChooserr&amp;diff=32563408&amp;oldid=32543999" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AChooserr&amp;diff=32563408&amp;oldid=32543999" rel="nofollow">suggested</a> to Chooserr to "start a Catholic Alliance in wikipedia" in order to "gather votes to defend pro-life articles and similar items." And he/she has proceeded in doing so by creating Wikipedia:Catholic Alliance of wikipedia, "a pro-life group" and "an organization for the purpose of rallying voting on articles about topics such as abortion." This is another proof of a concerted effort to skew deletion votes and fix wikipedia content along religious pov lines. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mr. Mojo risin'</sup></a> 00:53, 25 December 2005 (UTC)<br />
<b>Update 4</b>: And when I nominated Wikipedia:Catholic Alliance of wikipedia for deletion, Shanedidona left notices of this on 50+ talk pages, explicitly telling them: "Please vote and/or tell other people to vote to keep this organization on wikipedia." Shanedidona described the Catholic Alliance of Wikipedia to <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthgriz98_7610.html" title="User:Darthgriz98">Darthgriz98</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDarthgriz98_697d.html" title="User talk:Darthgriz98">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Darthgriz98_3948.html" title="Special:Contributions/Darthgriz98">contribs</a>) as "a CAtholic organization for the preservation of conservative values, basically, CAoW is a redily summonable voting block in case a pro-life article is threatened. ...

<dd>while I don't approve of this sort of campaiging, this is one of the primary purposes of user categories. It's not really relevant <i>why</i> they found out about the vote, it's relevant if they are members of the Wikipedia community. I recognize most of the names you mention (indeed, 2 [Merovingian and Ann] are admins), and I would count them if they I were closing a vote. It's unfortunate (and as I say, I disapprove of this sort of thing), but it's no reason to discount their votes.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean</a>|<a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black">Bla</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">ck</font></a> 01:03, 17 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's perhaps no reason to discount their votes, but it is imo behaviour that needs to be monitored, to prevent it from getting out of control. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>praatpaal</sup></a> 01:13, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A related and perhaps more troubling incident is the AfD vote for <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_rights_in_Iraq_b200.html" title="Gay rights in Iraq">Gay rights in Iraq</a>. The same users nominated the article and canvassed for votes. Several deletion votes resulted that accused the article of problems it never possessed. I doubt these editors read the piece. Other than these individuals, the consensus was to keep. Please read the discussion. I find this disturbing. Gay rights and abortion are contentious issues. I hope this doesn't grow to the point where editors on both sides form activist coalitions. Editors are supposed to base their decisions on enclopedic merit and site policy. In respecting these principles I often edit contrary to my personal politics. When I discovered these efforts to push a discussion - as an honest editor I feel my trust betrayed. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 01:59, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable. We cannot judge consensus if editors set out deliberately and maliciously to sabotage the process. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 01:46, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>While I agree that it's unacceptable, similar behavior has been going on for over half a year and there no feasible way has been suggested for preventing it. If the people involved were acting reasonable and rational, an RFC on the subject would work. But vote stacking generally occurs on controversial issues that people feel strongly about emotionally, so talking it out has not been very constructive in the past. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 21:43, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmm... I count about 10-20 good edits to articles other than conspiracy theory, 9/11, American terrorism, and related talk pages.

<dd>Where are they..? I'm sure there must be a few good edits in amongst the user's total edit count of 579, but I don't see any off hand. The proportions have some interest in themselves: only 119 of them are to article space, 123 to user talk alone. What stood out for me were PM's recent exchanges with two notably unflappable and polite editors, <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a>, on non-existent or nonsense issues, seemingly purely with the goal of somehow, by hook or by crook, needling those users into annoyance. (Unsuccessfully; well done, guys.) A <i>lot</i> of good-faith assumption has already been spent on this user, and has fallen on stony ground. I'm thinking RFAR rather than RFC, sooner rather than later, though perhaps not quite yet.

<p>In my interpretation Peter has been a very worthwhile contributor to wikipedia. Peter fundamentally grasps the concepts of true consensus and collaborative editing and I have a learned a lot from his <a href="../../../0/r/r/WP%7E0RR_694b.html" title="WP:0RR">WP:0RR</a> guideline. I can give Carbonite the benefit of the doubt if he claims otherwise but I think it was reasonable for Peter to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32134396" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32134396" rel="nofollow">conclude</a> Carbonite was trying to damage the acceptance of <a href="../../../0/r/r/WP%7E0RR_694b.html" title="WP:0RR">WP:0RR</a>, first by moving it to Peter's userspace over a header dispute, then after that mistake was corrected and the guideline was moved back, Carbonite proposed a merge of it to a fundmanetally different and perhaps less effective guideline. However, Carbonite continues to maintain the two guidelines are similar which apparently is easy to do as he fails to even acknowledge the evidence to the contrary. I ask all of Peter's detractors to please assure me they are not attempting to stack the deck against him to ease future discrediting of <a href="../../../0/r/r/WP%7E0RR_694b.html" title="WP:0RR">WP:0RR</a> or any other guideline or proposal he might have? Please give Peter the benefit of the doubt and avoid statements such as the above "batshit crazy troll" that are out of line for an admin and portray him and his contributions way too negatively. The list of "few beneficial edits" above is likewise way too negative. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 21:37, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you serious? Way too negative? Take a look at his contribs and find any more productive edits and diffs. I was trying to do PM a favor by pointing out he wasn't <i>just</i> disruptive. Remember also, I was only going through his main namespace edits in areas specified above. And some of my diffs are being generous by calling them productive. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 21:52, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have a tendency to disagree with Zen-master&#160;;-) , but here I fully agree. I also appreciate Carbonite's openly stated attempt to group all &lt;3RR on one page, but I can understand disagreement about it and coming from the 0RR page his actions may look a bit self serving and lacking openness. Apart of that, for an as yet unidentified reason some administrators seem not to understand Peter (see also the discussion with Voldemort on my talk page <a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarald88_9e75.html#A_.26_B.27s_discussion_and_Wikipedia_management" title="User talk:Harald88">User_talk:Harald88#A &amp; B's discussion and Wikipedia management</a>)... perhaps Texans and Dutch speak the same language? (I'm Dutch). Also, most of his edits and proposals that I saw on Conspiracy Theory were definitely good, helping to move in the direction of similar but already featured articles.

<dd>What you have above is all about "portrayal", you aren't letting the evidence speak for itself. Creating a small list of "productive" edits by an editor already labeled negatively can have the effect of getting people to further unquestioningly accept your negative portrayal -- though I can give you the benefit of the doubt if you assure me that isn't your intention. Regardless, please let the evidence speak for itself and refrain from excessive or multi-layered portrayals. In my interpretation Peter's response to Carbonite's actions was completely reasonable (I give the benefit of the doubt to both parties, miscommunication and misunderstanding can happen). Please simply list any other edits of Peter's you interpret to violate any wikipedia policy, and how? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 22:13, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You did/do seem to support the notion Peter has only made "some" or a "few" good edits? That is a negative portrayal and I believe it is completely inaccurate. Perhaps Bishonen and David Gerard are the ones that may have portrayed PM excessively negatively, perhaps inadvertently. Please give me the benefit of the doubt, I interpret the possibility of a hastily made portrayal being excessively negative, perhaps inadvertently, and perhaps even within the motivation of finding "some good" edits. Focusing on some "good edits" of an already negatively portrayed editor can have the effect of switching around the burden of proof, which would be wrong and seems to have almost happened in this case. The actual burden of proof is on PM's detractors to give evidence of any violations, right? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 22:45, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I've been following this page quite closely and seen no evidence of any "violations" by PM.

<li>You apparently haven't been following it all that closely, considering you are unaware that the suggestion that people look for good edits by Peter is actually a serious request by David Gerard, rather than an inadvertent mistake by me. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 23:43, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And I am not even sure why you are arguing with what I did. I was trying to <i>help</i> Peter here. There was a question of whether or not PM had made any good edits anywhere. I, looking for ways to not have him blocked outright, came up with a list of productive edits. That way, no one can say that he has never made a useful edit. I am trying to help Peter, and you are fighting me on it. Why? There are people looking to ban him indefinitely, and I am trying to persuade them to be nice and give him a shot. Did you even read my first comment in this section? I was trying to act in PM's defense. Yet you have already prejudged me as being anti-Peter. Please, continue to assume good faith on my part as I try to save Peter from being banned for good.

<dd>I understand you claim you want to "help" Peter and I can give you the benefit of the doubt. However, what I am telling you is your "help" or someone else's question that you responded to actually has had the effect of an excessive and very unfairly negative portrayal of Peter. The notion that Peter has only made a few good edits is completely inaccurate and taints a fair consideration. What further concerns me is now you seem to be hinting that Peter should be banned for good, that is also completely incorrect. Where did you get the notion Peter should be "blocked indefinitely" from, it seems you are definitely against him now? This page only contains a negative fluff portrayal of Peter, the only evidence presented here involves Peter's supposed "name calling". However, in my interpretation Peter's comparison of Carbonite to a troll made sense given the abusive and stifling actions Carbonite committed, though I give both parties the benefit of the doubt that tensions flare and mistakes happen. But it is starting to seem reasonable a small group of editors are systematically trying to portray Peter negatively because they really don't like his <a href="../../../0/r/r/WP%7E0RR_694b.html" title="WP:0RR">WP:0RR</a> or other posts for some fundamental reason. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 18:11, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Responding to Lord Voldemort, you seem to have accepted as a given that Peter should be "blocked indefinitely" and I think that is a completely inaccurate portrayal given the evidence presented. You say "there are people looking to ban him indefinitely" but where did anyone directly state that (innuendo doesn't count)? I am not "faulting" you for anything as I can give you the benefit of the doubt, I am merely only pointing out what you claim to be "help" has actually had the effect of an excessively negative and unfair portrayal. It is true that it was David Gerard not you that was the one who asked the leading question above: "By the way, has Mr McConaughey made any good edits at all, anywhere?" which should be obvious to see was meant prejudicially, perhaps inadvertently, as David's preceeding sentence contains the phrase "batshit crazy troll"... <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 19:43, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So apparently the answer is no, you haven't been reading what I've been writing? <b>Let me say this one last time, as clear as possible...</b> I was trying to help <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">User:Peter McConaughey</a> from being indefinitely banned, by showing that he has made useful edits, and is not just a "batshit crazy troll". There are people looking to ban him indefinitely (You asked for evidence, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=32235430&amp;oldid=32235405" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=32235430&amp;oldid=32235405" rel="nofollow">here's your diff</a>), and I was trying to stop them by showing PM has been useful. And in fact, I wasn't even responding to David Gerard's question, I was responding to Bishonen's question and comment, "<i>Where are they..? I'm sure there must be a few good edits in amongst the user's total edit count of 579, but I don't see any off hand.</i>" If you continue to assert that I am against Peter, which I never have been (show me the diffs for evidence of me being anything other than civil or helpful towards Peter), I will not discuss this matter with you further. Your continued lack of good faith on my part leads me to believe that you just want to argue, and don't care what has actually been written. <b>Please, before you respond, make sure you read this entire comment.</b> Thank you, my friend. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 19:57, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've always given you the benefit of the doubt that you are not directly against Peter, but I separately can't ignore the overall excessively negative and unfair portrayal on this page. Your citation of David Gerard's suggestion of blocking Peter indefinitely is precisely my other point, where has David or anyone actually presented actual evidence and made a case against Peter (again innuendo doesn't count)? It seems you've been following all the various Peter sections on this page quite closely? The Carbonite "troll" comment is small potatoes and was reasonable given Carbonite's actions that were interpreted as being stifling and I've seen no evidence of Peter "wikistaling" him, if anything an opposite case could be made. The entire concept of "search for any good edits" by a negatively portrayed user further stacks the deck against them, perhaps you have inadvertantly fallen victim to that, though I can also give David Gerard the benefit of the doubt as cases and arguments made hastily can have, perhaps inadvertent, prejudicial results. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 20:49, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Listen... buddy... if you have a problem with David Gerard, take it up with him. Quit debating with me. I would appreciate it if you would stop putting words in my mouth (here, and now seemingly on Peter's page). Why do you keep bringing Carbonite up? I will not argue with someone if you won't even listen. I won't argue with someone who seemingly cannot see that I am trying to save PM, not ban him.

<dd>Perhaps what you claim is my "not listening" to you is instead us simply disagreeing over whether looking for "good" edits is actually "helpful" or not in this case? I maintain that seeking "good" edits has the perhaps inadvertent effect of unfairly reinforcing a negative portrayal and characterization. I bring Carbonite up because the supposed "personal attack" by Peter against him is the only actual "evidence" on this page, but as I explained above I think that was completely understandable given the situation. What else, if anything, makes you think the case against Peter is so strong that redeeming edits must be found to "save" him? I do take issue with David Gerard's apparently hastily made portrayal that also lacks evidence, but I can give him the benefit of the doubt and need not follow it up with him if he refrains from repeating the same, perhaps inadvertent, mistake. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 21:58, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If someone says, "Hey, I'm going to ban this editor unless someone can show he or she is useful", I am going to see if I can show them as useful. I provided quality diffs that show PM as something other than a troll (Again, I don't give a crap if this label was justified, <b>that is not what I am arguing here</b>.

<dd>So you unquestioningly accepted David Gerard at his word that the case against Peter was so strong that redeeming edits must be found to save him, and, you dutifully took it upon yourself to spend a significant amount of time searching for only that without considering the possibility there is no case, and, you have repeatedly made a point of insisting: 1) you have nothing to do with Carbonite, 2) or David Gerard, 3) and you are not duplicitously against Peter? Ok, I can still give you the benefit of the doubt. Going forward, if you really want to "save" Peter, as you claim, then be aware that focusing on "redeeming" edits to "save" him can, perhaps inadvertently, reinforce an unfairly negative portrayal, which is exactly what almost happened in this case in my interpretation. The case against Peter is actually slim to none, no where near having to search for redeeming edits to "save" him. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 22:55, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thryduulf, I'm not familiar with the technical evidence, but there has already been a suspicion of sock puppetry in relation to the RachelBrown account. She violated 3RR together with <a href="../../../8/1/2E/User%7E81.153.41.72.html" title="User:81.153.41.72">81.153.41.72</a> (<a href="../../../8/1/2E/User_talk%7E81.153.41.72.html" title="User talk:81.153.41.72">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.153.41.72_51f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.153.41.72">contribs</a>) at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society_2700.html" title="List of Jewish Fellows of the Royal Society">List of Jewish Fellows of the Royal Society</a>, but one of them said the IP address was not RachelBrown but her flatmate "Lisa." But if you look at the edit summaries, at one point RachelBrown says: "Why do these childish people keep deleting my edits?" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Jewish_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society&amp;diff=28675931&amp;oldid=28672668" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Jewish_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society&amp;diff=28675931&amp;oldid=28672668" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> and less than an hour later "Lisa" reverts to RachelBrown's version with: "As i said, why do these childish people keep deleting my edits?" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Jewish_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society&amp;diff=28678477&amp;oldid=28678199" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Jewish_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society&amp;diff=28678477&amp;oldid=28678199" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> RachelBrown, "Lisa", Poetlister, and one other than I know of, <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELondoneye_eeac.html" title="User:Londoneye">Londoneye</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELondoneye_f33c.html" title="User talk:Londoneye">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Londoneye_0685.html" title="Special:Contributions/Londoneye">contribs</a>), all have the same "voice," make the same types of edits to the same articles, and now apparently there is technical evidence to link them to each other, and to <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewport_447f.html" title="User:Newport">Newport</a> (<a href="../../../n/e/w/User_talk%7ENewport_2ad9.html" title="User talk:Newport">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Newport_4237.html" title="Special:Contributions/Newport">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxwoman_c5ae.html" title="User:Taxwoman">Taxwoman</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxwoman_ecec.html" title="User talk:Taxwoman">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Taxwoman_8402.html" title="Special:Contributions/Taxwoman">contribs</a>). The accounts add names to various List of Jewish xxx articles, but refuse to supply sources, and it has happened so much, it has become a problem. For example, Londoneye added <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurence_Baxter_2ba2.html" title="Laurence Baxter">Laurence Baxter</a> to a list, saying he was Jewish. I couldn't find anything online about this, so I removed it and asked for a source. She wouldn't supply one and reinstated the name, saying in the edit summary that it was "obvious" from his Wikipedia article that he was a Jew. And it is obvious. The only problem (apart from the fact that we're not allowed to use WP articles as sole sources) is that Londoneye wrote the Wikipedia article on Baxter, also using no sources there. This is the the same behavior other editors have experienced with RachelBrown and Poetlister. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:30, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding SlimVirgin's evidence above, RachelBrown did not violate 3RR, her flatmate did who was not aware of Wikipedia rules at that time. She did make one edit under Rachel's account when Rachel had not logged out, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:A_Man_In_Black&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28677019" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:A_Man_In_Black&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28677019" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. Regarding the four blocked users, these people are friends from the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a> who have supported each other on some disputes or voted the same way on some vfds but otherwise have different interests. I think that is quite normal for close friends to want to support each other and should not merit a block. If it is considered not advisable for friends to support each other in disputes or vfds a warning should be placed on the relevant user pages before blocking. Arniep 04:12, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Where is this Arbitration Committee ruling? I was not aware of an Arbitration Committee action against Poetlister or anyone else. This seems most unusual. I wasn't aware that you could be permanently banned because of using sock puppets to try to influence an AFD, especially because AFDs are not "votes". I thought that such a case, if it was true, would warrant a warning only. Why a permanent ban in this case? There also seems to be quite a lot of evidence that they are not sock puppets. It seems extraordinarily odd to suggest that on 22 December 2005 Poetlister acted as a sock puppet for RachelBrown, when RachelBrown's last edit was 10 December 2005, and last regular one was 3 December 2005. Surely that is the antecedent of sock puppetry - as in, not theoretically possible to be true. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 04:29, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You don't get permabanned for that, but your sockpuppets usually are. Note that there's generally no way to distinguish sockpuppets (duplicate accounts by the same person) from meatpuppets (getting your friends into Wikipedia for voting purposes only), and hence both can be blocked for that reason. It is not acceptable to get additional new accounts for voting, and whether they are self-made or made by your friends is irrelevant. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:35, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<p><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMissionary_fe7a.html" title="User:Missionary">Missionary</a> is a sockpuppet of <a href="../../../r/e/t/User%7ERetcon_6ab3.html" title="User:Retcon">Retcon</a>. This was recently proven, as outlined on the following page I created: <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommstein_Retcon-Missionary_Sockpuppet_Evidence_16c1.html" title="User:Tommstein/Retcon-Missionary Sockpuppet Evidence">User:Tommstein/Retcon-Missionary Sockpuppet Evidence</a>. Shortly after I created that page, <a href="../../../r/e/t/User%7ERetcon_6ab3.html" title="User:Retcon">Retcon</a> admitted to this fact <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMissionary_fe7a.html" title="User:Missionary">Missionary</a>'s user page, although it has since been moved to the talk page. I have already slapped the Sockpuppet tag on <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMissionary_fe7a.html" title="User:Missionary">Missionary</a>'s pages, but the SockpuppetProven tag seems more appropriate, seeing as only one of the criteria listed in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html#Tagging_identified_sock_puppets" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">Wikipedia:Sock puppet#Tagging identified sock puppets</a> is necessary and this case already meets two of the three (and we can make a request for arbitration if we want to go for the perfect trifecta). The problem is, the SockpuppetProven tag expands into text that reads, in part, "and has been blocked indefinitely." I asked on <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia_talk%7ESock_puppet_f0d9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Sock puppet">Wikipedia talk:Sock puppet</a> about who to report this to in order for the sockpuppet to be blocked, and I was told that this was the place to bring it. Can someone please apply said block, both to rid ourselves of this pest and to legitimize the appropriate SockpuppetProven tag?</p>
<p>As a related question, I wish to ask, can anything be done about <a href="../../../r/e/t/User%7ERetcon_6ab3.html" title="User:Retcon">Retcon</a> to convey to him that this isn't an OK thing that will just get the sockpuppets blocked and have no consequences for him as he creates another army of sockpuppets?

<dd>The Tommstein/Tomnstein case is pretty clear to me; it's the IP Law Girl/IP law girl case that is unclear. The senior account is the sock and has far fewer edits than the junior account, which is exactly backwards of the usual pattern for an impersonation. This suggests that this is not a normal impersonation; I tend to suspect that the first account is a meatpuppet, perhaps a relative or acquaintance of Retcon's, who forgot her password upon returning home and instead created a new account.

<dd>Fine - and that's (hopefully) the end of that. There is plenty crap for those who like to delete stuff without worrying about this. I suppose the only reason to defend process is that it should (?) come to the right conclusion in the end (if it don't than it's broke) and without some form of process we end up with arbitrary decisions and wheel wars. But then, I suppose that argument doesn't hold up when process causes the wheel war in the first place.

<dd>Oh, c'mon! In a nutshell, events were like this: The article was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_OGTV2_-_From_Tha_Hood_to_Hollywood_e297.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/OGTV2 - From Tha Hood to Hollywood">deleted</a> last month as an inconsequential bootleg (note that the nomination was made by <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">User:FuriousFreddy</a>, whose judgement on rap one can trust). It went to DRV a few days ago, was summarily restored by Tony who trusts neither AfD nor DRV (and has no notion about rap to boot), deleted, restored by Tony and deleted (each time by a different admin) a few times more, and finally restored by David, who thought is was a legit Snoop Dogg album. It is now <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Welcome_to_tha_chuuch_mixtape_vol.1_4555.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Welcome to tha chuuch mixtape vol.1">on AfD</a> again, where it will likely end up deleted.

<dd>"I am an expert on rap, and I say this article should be deleted, so it should be deleted" doesn't fly here. Sorry. If you want to claim that something meets a deletion criterion or two, you need actual evidence, not your own determination, or an appeal to the authority of another editor you claim to be an expert. And that applies to everyone. Again, if AfD lost its mind and decided to defer to claimed expertise rather than find out for themselves, then Tony Sidaway was and always will be absolutely right to override the vote and undelete the article. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 04:08, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tony was dead right to undelete this one, and it's emblematic of the increasingly shitty research that goes into AfDs. That an album does not appear on AllMusic shows nothing except that it is not a U.S. release. Not being a U.S. release is not, in fact, a deletion criterion, nor will it ever be. In the face of an album cover and a link to HMV Japan, one needs to actually do one's homework before arguing for deletion. People who make delete votes without doing basic research should expect to be ignored by the first admin with a lick of common sense to come along. If you want to show that an article should be deleted, be prepared to actually spend more than two minutes searching on a single website. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 03:29, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Garbage, Phil. If DRV had been allowed to run its proper course it would have determined that the album in question was a random mixtape. Now it's back on AfD, and the only thing that has been achieved is that a fair number of people are pissed at the waste of time and the disregard for process that actually works.

<dd>It is difficult to take DRV remotely seriously when there are people who regularly vote with no regard to content whatsoever, and when it routinely feels the need to send every article it undeletes, no matter how wrong the original deletion, to AfD to double check. The original AfD was done on bad research, and anyone who trusts DRV to actually do fact-checking and additional research has never actually read DRV. If you want the deletion process to be taken seriously by people, you need to behave seriously, and stop the playing-to-win bullshit that permiates all of these discussions. It seems as though more people here care about whether this is finally their chance to "get" Tony than actually have any investment in the article. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 03:43, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe DRV was wrong, but at that point you have the option of creating a new article, not based on the old one, that demonstrates notability, verifiability, etc...

<dd>If the issue is "The article is fine, people just didn't entertain the concept that it might be a Japan-only album," though, there's not really anything to change - this seems to be a case where AfD just didn't do its homework, leading to serious doubt. That the doubt turned out to be unfounded, and the album turned out to be non-notable is beside the point - it should never have been deleted until the research had been done. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 03:57, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>"It seems as though more people here care about whether this is finally their chance to "get" Tony than actually have any investment in the article."</i> Oh please. Calling Tony out on yet another disruption of the consensus-forming process isn't "playing to win," it's called "discussing administrative moves that some of us think are stupid", with a dash of "forming consensus." If we were "playing to win," a phrase you seem to love to use, we would engage in different tactics. Just to pick an example of one such tactic, perhaps we'd start an RFArb against him without trying to reach consensus first, either through conversation, mediation, or an RfC. <b>That</b>, it seems to me, is a textbook example of this "playing to win" you seem to be such an expert on. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 04:40, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I don't have to "assume bad faith" to think that when Tony regularly overturns consensus, he's doing a stupid thing. Good or bad faith ain't got nothing to do with it. We have consensus mechanisms to make these decisions, and by cutting them off <i>before they have reached their end</i> he is, <i>in my opinion</i>, committing an offense against the consensus-building process, and insulting everyone who participated in it.

And your persistent adding of Cyrillic spelling of Moldovans toponyms is also persistent and malicious vandalism. Moldovan (Romanian)'s official spelling is in LATIN ALPHABET.

<dd>Excuse me - this is a <b>content dispute</b> not vandalism. Please do not use blocks when dealing with content disputes. Mikka is clearly has a conflict of interest, by blocking Bonaparte for edits to a page in which he is actively involved in editing, and he is also involved in a content dispute with Bonaparte at this same page. At <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tighina.html" title="Tighina">Tighina</a>, there seems to be a dispute between including the Moldovan Cyrillic version of the text. Again, this is a content dispute. Please take this to the talk page. Mikka has a very valid rationale for including this Cyrillic text, but Bonaparte can also make his argument. It is the same at <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Moldova_e6d4.html" title="Republic of Moldova">Republic of Moldova</a>. They are not cases of simple vandalism. If the 3RR is broken, the Bonaparte can be blocked, but not for one week. I hope he is unblocked now.

<dd>I don't think it was right to delete it (twice) while the vote was taking place. It looks very much as if the consensus is going to be for <b>delete</b>, but it would be more respectful of the community not to anticipate the result. I have no wish to keep it, but I can't see that it's going to do any harm to Wikipedia while the vote is coming to a close. However, deleting it a third time <i>could</i> be harmful in the sense of causing bad feeling and frustration. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:39, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course, that applies only to <b>full</b> dates, whre date preferences will work.

<dd>I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the accusation that Regforafd is Mailer Diablo, to say nothing of blocking Mailer Diablo, is wildly premature. Mailer Diablo is one of our most active AFD closers, and is therefore likely to intersect with AFD sockpuppets by sheer happenstance. The evidence does not support the accusation.<br /></dd>

<li>If it can be proven he's using sockpuppets to manipulate AFD, he should be blocked, obviously. But I find blocking him before an sockcheck has been done far too premature. His closures can be reviewed if need be. Blocks should be done with proof or community support. If he's not unblocked yet, I will.

<li>If someone is using sockpuppets to manipulate AfD, it should go to ArbCom or get community consensus. The notion of one admin perma-blocking another based on his own analysis of the evidence, <i>even if far more ironclad than this evidence was</i>, is just plain bizzare.

<li>(<i>after editr conflict</i>) A block on an admin for closing AfD's some of which turn out to include votes by a user who may be a sockpuippet of someone, with no indication that the admin was in any way aware of said sockpuppetry (assuming that there <b>was</b> sockpupetry, which seems not unlikely but is unproved AFAIK) seems to be a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. I think <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">User:Karmafist</a> was rather too fast on the triger on this one.

But unless he actually used this ID to cast multiple votes from different IDs on some AfD, this user has not actually violated policy.

<p>The user GMB is making several politically-motivated remarks toward users on his talk page. Regardless of his arguments, he has ignored two warnings to stop, and is now on a third and final warning. On December 24 he was blocked for 24 hours through 3RR, with 12 hours added to that for his personal attacks then. Most of these attacks are aimed at <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">User:Natalinasmpf</a>.

<dd>The holocaust denier thing isn't quite like it sounds, but a rhetorical flourish of commie-hatred: it's <i>Stalin's</i> "holocaust" GMB is accusing somone of neglecting or denying. If that makes a difference. Anyway, there's nothing unfair about the block, as the article editing is terrible and the talkpage worse, and people certainly have tried with him. But in keeping with Wikipedia's proud tradition of ridiculous tolerance for very new users (GMB only started editing on Christmas Eve) I still think a week-long block might be tried first, with a clear warning that indefinite blocking will follow on its heels if he goes on in the same way when it expires. It doesn't look, from the talkpage, as if he really took the block warnings seriously: he seems quite but-I'm-the-GOOD-guy incredulous about them. Also, nobody mentioned "indefinite", and the reasonable reading of the warnings he was given was probably that he might face another 36-hour block at worst. The difference, psychologically, between a week and indefinite would—optimistically—be that the week might make him see that we mean it, <i>without</i> imposing the hurdle of a potentially humiliating promise to "behave". And it would be very simple to re-block indefinitely if he comes back shouting, there would be no need for any further warnings or blandishings. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 07:19, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it's not a matter of <i>what words to use</i>. If you're thinking "punish" I hope you will write "punish" ... rather than hide your intention behind some kind of political correctness. But if your goal is to punish people for saying the wrong thing, you aren't doing Wikipedia any favors. We've seen enough of folks setting themselves up as tin-pot authorities and sitting in personal judgment of other people's virtue. That kind of thing does a lot of damage to the project.</dd>

<dd>If someone is <i>disrupting the project</i>, then administrators can block them to prevent that disruption.

In this case, there's an account that isn't being used for anything <i>but</i> disruption, so blocking makes sense -- there isn't a real contributor here. (Because of that, "punishment" would be ironic in the extreme -- this isn't a contributor with an interest in being here other than to be a jerk; so what exactly would he be deprived of -- jerkspace?) --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 11:21, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I on the other hand disagree altogether with this witch-hunting. OceanSplash has stated his candid opinion, which he should be able to freely present in the free market of ideas which are discussed in the in the talk page without at once being accused of racism or personal attacks.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, that particular view is shared by many others throughout the world.

<dd>In the free market of ideas editors can take the opinions and ideas of other editors and discuss them and challenge them if they wish.

Isn't it time to let go of the hypocrisy of the insane past milleniums in regards to preventing the free expression of opinions because some dinosaur group somewhere would find that offensive.

<dd>You're argumentation makes no sense for several reasons (and I personally find it highly disturbing from a due process point of view). First of all, administrators are not equal to the Wikipedia community and are not to be considered to be more authorative when it comes to consensus forming. Apart from that, consensus is almost by definition not "de facto" and depends on a large participation at a reasonably visible place, which I don't think ever took place in this case. I doubt much more than, say, 5 procent of the administrators were even aware of this issue before just now and there is obviously a massive natural bias in favor of banning from those who were aware. All I see here is a bunch of administrators acting in collusion, and I'm exactly putting up this notice at the bottom in order to raise awareness among much more administrators. If the unblocking simply depends on a single administrator disagreeing, wouldn't you agree that that would be too much of an intimidating prospective for such an administrator? And aren't the policies not exactly meant to prevent such things from happening? -- <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDissident_e7c0.html" title="User:Dissident">Dissident</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDissident_8a12.html" title="User talk:Dissident">Talk</a>) 15:21, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Arbitration will come out no different. Harassing users by threatening their employment is not acceptable. Perhaps that should be put into the banning policy. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 14:52, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Dissident - this sort of thing needs to be done properly. I'm not aware of blocking policy that permits banning people indefinitely for being "trolls". If Marsden has made (legal?) threats, that's a reason for blocking or banning - but that wasn't the reason given by Snowspinner, and a diff to show the relevant edit would be nice. The only thing I can find is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005%2FCandidate_statements%2FJayjg&amp;diff=30883080&amp;oldid=30868762" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005%2FCandidate_statements%2FJayjg&amp;diff=30883080&amp;oldid=30868762" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which does not seem sufficient justification.

<dd>I'm just asking for evidence of behaviour justifying a ban, and noting that normally such justification should be placed on the user's talk page.

<dd>Threatening people's place of work gets an immediate ban unless and until we can be sure the person operating the account can damn well behave like a decent person and not a thug. (This, by the way, is one of the reasons CheckUser data is guarded with such paranoia — there are enough dicks on Wikipedia that there is real danger of such harassment.) This is unlikely to be negotiable, and in the case of an unblock a reblock is almost certain.</dd>

<dd>Dave, he didn't threaten anyone's place of work. He asked whether Jay was being paid to edit Wikipedia. You must know that that rumour -- which Jay has denied and I take to be entirely false -- has been circulated. Marsden didn't to my knowledge threaten to tell Jay's bosses that he spends time working here. Nor was that what Snowspinner banned him for. It looks to me as though a group of admins has arranged to have a dissident editor banned and now they're making up whatever bullshit reason they can come up with to justify it. -- Grace Note.</dd>

<dd>If you and/or other administrators just stopped at giving him a few cooling-off periods on your own that would have been ok. But the moment it was decided to ban him indefinitely (especially since what the ArbCom hands out is usually in the order of a few months at most) the line was crossed and instead an arbitration case should have been started. The fact that you also protected his talk page twice after he was banned doesn't make any sense and makes it seem that discussion of his case by third parties is being stifled.

<dd>Apparently, wishing to have a process is "stirring up trouble" but just blocking whoever you don't like indefinitely is helping out. Well, it certainly gets the message across to those who disagree with Jay that they must treat him with more care than he has to treat them. I have no doubt Marsden has transgressed and could have done with a month off to think about whether he really wants to contribute to WP, but you're very right, Dissident, this has been handled very shoddily by the party of admins who opposed Marsden and their friends. I'm not Marsden, by the way. Save yourself the work with CheckUser, Dave, if you're checking anyone who thinks that Marsden has been poorly treated. -- Grace Note.</dd>

<p>I have changed the block to one month, backdated to when Snowspinner made the block (16 December). I do not think an indefinite block was appropriate, and I'm not sure some of the previous blocks were entirely necessary either (perhaps I'm missing key contributions of Marsden's). If Marsden chooses to come back to the Wikipedia community, I hope he tries harder to play by its written and unwritten rules. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 10:57, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Marsden has been at this for many months; one month will hardly be a hiccup. I see no evidence whatsoever he's here to write an encyclopedia.

<dd>Well I'm sorry, I think an indefinite block requires somewhat more process. At the least the blocking admin should marshal some convincing evidence in a relevant and accessible place. This has not been done AFAIK, and I've asked several times and looked through Marsden's recent contributions myself. In any case, two admins have now restored the indefinite block without further discussion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AMarsden" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AMarsden" rel="nofollow">block log</a> I find this somewhat disturbing, especially as I was under the impression that indefinite bans were frowned upon, and that blocks should be imposed in a rising pattern except where there is extreme justification (evidence of which has not been forthcoming). Marsden's longest block prior to this indefinite one was 1 week - I would have thought 1 month or 3 months would be appropriate as the next step, if further action is indeed justified. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 22:52, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Marsden made over 500 contributions in 2 months before being blocked for the first time (24 hours) on 10 November (and after several more blocks, indef blocked on 16 December); that doesn't sound like "has been at this for many months" to me (maybe everybody was being very patient with him before November, but anyway...). <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 22:58, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that's exactly right. People were extremely patient with him. He is one of the most vicious editors I've encountered.

<p>This is quite ridiculous.

I'm willing to accept on faith that he's made personal attacks, but I'm not willing to accept on faith that he has done anything worthy of a lifelong ban from Wikipedia.

<dd>Then with respect, look through his contribs, Talrias, and educate yourself, rather than expecting other admins to do it for you. The user has a long history of making serious personal attacks against several editors, admins, and members of the arbcom, including Fred Bauder and Jimbo, to the point where several good editors have stayed away from certain articles because of him; at least two have considered leaving if he continues to hang around; and I believe one did leave, or at least drastically cut back on editing. It can't be tolerated any longer, particularly as he makes almost no contribution to the encyclopedia.

<dd>In light of the fact that (a) Marsden has said he's not interested in being unblocked (b) thinks WP is a lost cause (c) has made personal attacks against probably at least half of ArbCom (giving him cause to demand that arbitrators recuse themselves, and for other known trolls to jump on his bandwagon with the same demand...) (d) is clearly a troll (as an open-minded review of his edits to ArbCom candidates' Q&amp;A pages demonstrates...<i>e.g.</i>, <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005_Candidate_statements_e6ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005/Candidate statements">this</a>) and (e) has used this page as a platform to further his pattern of personally attacking other members of the community, specifically admins (who have the ability to try to put a stop to his disruptions), I see no reason to think that (a) his block should be removed or even reduced to 1 month from the original indefinite block or that (b) if it is, anything will change in his perspective, and consequently, in his editing or harassment style. In most cases, I would say that taking a case to ArbCom would be preferable to handing out an indefinite block, but I'm compelled to agree that the silence of most of the community on this issue isn't ignorance on their part, but rather quiet agreement with it (and since they're interested in editing an encyclopedia more than they are in seeing disruptive and destructive editors stick around), are happy to see that he's at least blocked for a month, and will unlikely be around long once that block expires, since there's little evidence that he's interested in changing his ways, or ever will be. The only thing taking Marsden to ArbCom will accomplish is to unnecessarily drag this out, something even Marsden has indicated he has no interest in. ArbCom, frankly, has more pressing issues to deal with—trying to resolve <i>disputes</i>, not providing counseling services for editors who clearly hold them, the rest of the community and indeed the entire dispute resolution process, in utter disdain. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 05:27, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One might similarly ask, "Why hold a trial for a murderer? It won't bring the victim back to life." In spite of SlimVirgin's and David Gerard's paranoid assumptions that I must be emailing people to support me, in fact I only entered an email address on my WP account in order to question one SlimVirgin on her block of me (as to whether that counts as "e-mailing trolls and asking them to intervene on his behalf," I will not comment). I subsequently used that email address (which for some reason my regular computer does not like to open, and I do not use any other email account to communicate with anyone I've encountered on Wikipedia) to email a couple people who I thought would be interested in my RFAr against SlimVirgin; Poetlister is the only one I am sure I emailed. I have also gotten perhaps six emails from other Wikipedians through that account, although I only look at it once a week at most. A less paranoid (as long as we're throwing around references to providing therapy, I hope no one will object to me using that term) explanation for people's interest in my extra-judicial banning might be gained by <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a>, and considering that maybe some Wikipedians (just as they say) are concerned about due process of law, and about whether Wikipedia has a fair and effective dispute resolution process. I have already decided for myself the answer to that question ("NO!"), but I don't think that any honest person of goodwill should want to discourage anyone from considering such a matter in an enterprise in which he participates: a conscientious person should not aspire to be employee of the month in the Zyklon B factory, for example.</p>
<p>I assert that Wikipedia has become a very dysfunctional project in many respects. I could <i>argue</i> this as well, except that certain people are intent on making sure that my version of the history of my participation in Wikipedia never sees the light of day -- SlimVirgin has made a pastime of controlling my talk and user pages, for example, including deleting a list I had prepared of editors whom <i>she</i> seems to have driven away from Wikipedia. (In recruiting supporters via email and in driving people away from Wikipedia, both of which I am accused of, I am pretty certain that my attackers -- I think I use that term fairly at this point -- are more at fault by far than I am.)</p>
<p>It has become a common refrain among my attackers -- again, I think I use that term fairly -- that "we are here to write an encyclopedia!" And the implication in this is that their actions -- including obstructing me -- are consistent with this end. I don't think this is the case, particularly with their reliance on extra-judicial means: as Dissident noted above, "can you blame outsiders for finding the whole sneakiness about this entire affair troubling?" Even I, having decided that Wikipedia is a lost cause, sometimes wonder if Wikipedia's dysfunction is worse even than I imagine: it strains credulity for me to imagine anything that would lead to the level of secrecy and opacicity that is insisted upon with regard to me.</p>

<dd>Tomer, as a first comment to you, let me say that it is really annoying to have people like you (and FeloniousMonk, and Snowspinner) show up out of nowhere to make blocks or snide comments about me, actions that indicate they have pretty well-developed opinions of me in spite of the fact that I don't know them from Adam. As a matter for your <i>life</i>, Tomer, and not just for your participation in Wikipedia, let me suggest that it is very rarely the case that one side of a dispute is all you need to hear in order to make a fair decision about it. I have no idea, Tomer, why you ever took an interest in anything I have done on Wikipedia. The first I ever heard of you was at FM's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FeloniousMonk#Jayjg_and_Marsden" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FeloniousMonk#Jayjg_and_Marsden" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>, where you made the absurd comment to Huldra that "I have to assume you're unfamiliar with Marsden's activities." Actually, Tomer, Huldra has been aware (usually disapprovingly, by the way) of my disputes with Jayjg and SlimVirgin almost from the time they began; it is really you, Tomer, who is far more likely to be unfamiliar with my activities. My reaction to your "me too-ism" in attacking me from out of nowhere is that you are probably a coward: had you any courage in your convictions, you would have wanted to hear at least part of my side of the story before insulting me -- not out of respect for me, by the way, but out of respect for yourself. Now, you can roll yourself into a defensive ball, hurt that the mean man on the internet disputed your grandmother's assessment about what a wonderful young man you are, but seriously: you come across as a flake when you snipe from afar. Your comment to me just now was the first thing I've ever seen from you that garners any respect from me.</dd>
<dd>As to your immediate comment, I think you miss the point: what any Wikipedian should be concerned about is not, "Are the contributions of one particular editor out of thousands going to be missed?" but rather, "Is the manner by which one particular editor was driven out of Wikipedia something that should be repeated?" As Wittgenstein wrote, "And when I put the ruler up against the table, am I always measuring the table; am I not sometimes checking the ruler?" (And, if the ruler resists your checking of it, should you trust whatever measurements it produces?)</dd>

<p>I now already have two administrators agreeing with me that the indefinite block was excessive without an ArbCom decision and who tried to undo it, only to have others reinstate it. If this isn't controversial enough to trigger an Arbitration case, then nothing is. -- <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDissident_e7c0.html" title="User:Dissident">Dissident</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDissident_8a12.html" title="User talk:Dissident">Talk</a>) 16:13, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would find this much less frustrating if it had been done when the block was made instead of over a week later. It is not as though the block wasn't on AN originally. An arbcom case would be a circus with a foregone conclusion - at least one arbitrator has privately thanked me for saving them the circus with the block. Wikipedia does not really care about process so much as product. If anyone sincerely believes that Marsden is not going to get himself banned from the site through one means or another, they should consider lifting the block. If their only concern is that process must be followed properly, they should not. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 16:21, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't find any discussion on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> of an indefinite block of Marsden (prior to the issue being opened a week afterwards); there's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive54#Marsden" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive54#Marsden" rel="nofollow">this</a> a week before which didn't mention such drastic measures. Blocks (especially long ones, never mind permanent ones) are to be avoided without due process, of which I see no sign. The admin who originally made the indefinite block didn't even notify Marsden, something we do routinely in the case of temporary blocks for vandalism. There is an irreducible minimum of due process required to ensure that power is not exercised arbitrarily; this is as true of Wikipedia as of any other community. If Marsden is leaving anyway then perhaps we can leave it at that in this case, but we should at least draw some lessons from how this case was handled. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 19:48, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rd, look at the start of this thread: December 15 (started on WP:AN). No one responded until December 22. Maybe it took Marsden a few days to e-mail you all and find a couple of people willing to act for him.

<dd>Great. Contrary to implications (and unwarranted <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>) by some parties, I don't care. My primary interest in this affair is to prevent a wheelwar. If you want to propose one of those as an alternative, go for it. My point is, don't say "I disagree with you, therefore I'm going to change your block." Discuss. Resolve. Implement. Don't jump the gun. Doing so only causes more unnecessary friction. I'm quite confident that this whole situation can be resolved without taking it to arbcom (which would be, as I said earlier, futile, since Marsden has set himself up as a vitriolic opponent to at least half of the ArbCom membership), or probably without requiring intervention by Jimbo (who is most likely to support the ArbCom membership rather than Marsden...especially if he digs deeply enough into Marsden's activities). So. Back to what I was saying. Instead of arguing about whether or not the block should be Snowspinner's version or your version, open discussion here in <i>support</i> of a proposal. Like I said, "indefinite" is not "infinite", it's "to be determined". So, let's start determining already. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 13:17, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I implemented a 1-month block, which another admin also did after this was reverted to indefinite. I've said why I thought something of that order was more appropriate. (I'm not actually convinced based on my own impressions that he deserves even that, but it is abundantly clear that those who've dealt more with him disagree, and I defer to their judgement.) In the (messy) circumstances I still think 1 month is sufficient - if he misbehaves on his return (if he returns) further action can be taken; the longest prior block was a week. More than 3 months without formal process or attempt to marshal evidence justifying such a length of ban, or one or several egregious contributions people can point to (eg threats) seems inappropriate. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 15:59, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, Rd, what you did was undo Snowspinner's indefinite block, unjustified or otherwise, and <i>then</i> implemented a 1-month block, a <i>week</i> after Snowspinner's original block, without anything remotely approaching adequate discussion of your action, nor even a cogent challenge of his original block, unjustified or otherwise, and certainly w/o obtaining input from others in support of or challenging your oppostion to Snowspinner's block. I don't want to get into a pissing match about the whole thing, but what you did was to change another admin's implementation w/o discussion.

<dd>To be precise, I implemented a month block, which technically superceded the existing indefinite block. I did so after enough discussion to confirm my initial reaction that an indefinite block without process is prima facie injustified except in clearcut cases (eg threats).

<dd>You're mistaken about at least one thing, Tomer: I wouldn't want anyone on ArbCom to recuse himself in an arbitration over my banning. Having no expectation of anything even vaguely resembling a fair hearing, why would I object to anyone participating in it? Again, what any Wikipedian ought to be interested in is, does the dispute resolution process work? With the thorough lack of transparency and accountability of Wikipedia's "dispute resolution" process at so many levels, on what basis can anyone be confident that a Stalinist clique doesn't in fact run the whole damn thing, injecting its biases into articles with impunity? If you can control information, you can control the world. And, also again, I doubt very much that <i>you</i> have dug very deeply into my activities; probably just enough that you can make an argument for what you want to believe anyway, as long as you ignore half of what you find. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Marsden</a></dd>

<p>Beckjord's edits so far seem solely to promote himself as an expert on these topics and to harass anyone who gets in his way. Considering what I've already seen, as well as reports of his behavior in general found on Google searching for his name (frequent cases of false legal threats to try to quiet critics, etc.), I suspect he's going to give us no end of trouble. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 02:57, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree completely with Bish and DreamGuy. The kind of person that would make an off-wiki site for the clearly anti-Wikipedia purpose of defying NPOV and consensus has no encyclopedic goal of ours in mind.

Four hours later, I blocked Miskin <i>again</i> for a second 3RR at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manakis_brothers.html" title="Manakis brothers">Manakis brothers</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manakis_brothers&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manakis_brothers&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> (along with <a href="../../../c/d/t/User%7ECDThieme_c0bd.html" title="User:CDThieme">CDThieme</a>) as well as excessive edit edit warring at a <i>third</i> article, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Orthodox_Church_8c91.html" title="Macedonian Orthodox Church">Macedonian Orthodox Church</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macedonian_Orthodox_Church&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macedonian_Orthodox_Church&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>. Not to mention edit summaries like "one more time and I'll report you for 'official policy vandalism'," so I made the block 36 hours. Despite all this misbeavior, an hour later, Merovingian unblocked him, without an explanation anywhere, with the reason "Miskin has been reverting the insertion of unsourced claims, and his edits are therefore justified." Funny thing is, I had been talking it out with Miskin, explaining how edit warring is wrong in <i>every</i> circumstance, that even if you're in the right, that's why <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">we have mechanisms</a> like RFC and such to deal with it, and that only vandalism is excepted by the 3RR, <i>not</i> POV-pushing (which would be self-defeating) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMiskin&amp;diff=33057941&amp;oldid=33008257" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMiskin&amp;diff=33057941&amp;oldid=33008257" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>.

<dd>Perhaps it's because administrators unblock him for just that reason that he thinks 3RR doesn't apply to him.

Apparently now from his posts below he knows not to do that again, so there shouldn;t be a problem in the future, but it's inexcusible when admins try to enforce or even overrule a policy that they haven't bothered to read. He shoudl not have unblocked someone without going to the policy page to read it, or to ask about it for the people who did block the person, or the project page used for enforcing the issue. That was clearly out of line. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 00:46, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Per the question above, both the involved admins should probably work on their communication. Merovingian should have (at the very least) notified Dmcdevit when he undid the blocks. Dmcdevit should have asked Merovingian about the unblocks, and notified Merovingian that he started this thread. (My apologies if there <i>was</i> communication that I missed.) Come on, guys—talk to each other! <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 22:07, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Erm, I did the second block, yes, but not in disagreement with Merovingian, it was a separate block. When he unblocked, I decided to take it here rather than reblock or make any further action, putting it up for review. That <i>was</i> communication. I admit I didn't think to notify Mero about this thread, but the point wasn't to criticize him anyway, but to figure out what to do now. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 06:03, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Sorry I'm late!</b> Miskin approached me on IRC and asked to be unblocked. Now, I wouldn't just go ahead and unblock him, so we had a good conversation about what was going on at the articles in question. Miskin had been reverting some unsourced claims, and the other user (<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacedonia_a375.html" title="User:Macedonia">User:Macedonia</a>, IIRC) wasn't discussing his changes at all.

<dd>Well he still did violate the 3RR and even if he was removing unsourced claims, the relevant policy (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) does not exempt anyone reverting unsourced claims from the 3RR. It is not like vandalism, which is an exeption. Also, he has been violating the 3RR in more than one article - that's never good. Talk pages are there for a reason.

<dd>That still doesn't exempt him from the 3RR. The page should have been protected to stop the edit-war and no one should have been blocked (which is what I told the blocking admin and he agreed). Blocks don't stop edit wars - once the blocks are over, the edit-war continues (it has happened). Resolving disputes stops edit-wars. I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMacedonia&amp;diff=32996783&amp;oldid=32990050" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMacedonia&amp;diff=32996783&amp;oldid=32990050" rel="nofollow">offered</a> to lift Macedonia's block if he would use the talk page.

<li>The point is that <i>whatever the end, revert warring is not the means to reach it</i>. Even if you're right, revert warring is still wrong (in fact, most revert warrers consider themselves right, and by definition at least half of them must be wrong). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 23:00, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That was exactly my point. It seems to me (based on the above) that Merovingian also missed that the second block was for a <i>second</i> 3RR in that time, when he unblocked again. Which was the reason that I preferred blocks over protection in this matter; it spanned multiple articles. I also note that Miskin is unblocked right now (and CDThieme never was), should anything be done about that now? <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 06:03, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
