<p>I may have a reason to be biased, but I don't like this policy. First of all it doesn't seem to really say change anything — it just moves stuff around and reasserts existing beliefs. Second, the first rule is far too strict, as many official Wikipedia policies can be and often are broken, and are intended more as suggestions. If someone unintentionally incorporates too much POV into an article, that's breaking policy. If an administrator deletes a page accidentally while attempting some deft rearranging of articles, the page should be undeleted and the administrator reprimanded, but certainly not de-admined. We need more common sense applied and less blanket statements. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Derrick Coetzee</a> 06:56, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>In principle this is a very good and important proposed policy. Two things should be changed though, as a safeguard against abuse: (1) measure 1 is too broad and should be restricted to those policies that concern admin powers. (2)If the request receives a vote of no confidence, it should not be referred to ArbCom. This automaticity would make abuse of this policy more attractive and lead to unnecessary bureaucracy in cases without merit. Concerns have been raised about "lynch mob" behaviour. IMO this need not be the case: if it becomes a problem, we should raise the number of votes required from simple majority to 2/3 majority, or "consensus" (i.e. 80%). A further safeguard could be introduced, e.g. the number of requests for admin review should be limited to one per month per user (not admin). But the principle behind this proposed policy is important: admins are approved by all Wikipedians to whom they should be accountable, and this power should be retained by Wikipedians and not be transferred to some other authority. At present, when admins are approved, it is an expression of trust that is not based on experience with how they act as admin. That's less than ideal, and this review process would improve the situation. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 09:37, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think this is necessary; they would be used so little that they can happily serve as part of RFC. I do like the idea of formalising the process, however. I also raise the question: is RFDA even necessary? The Arbcom could impose de-adminship as part of a penalty for really bad misuse of admin priveledges. -- <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrunt_6e8a.html" title="User:Grunt">Grunt</a> <a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrunt_2a44.html" title="User talk:Grunt">(talk)</a> 02:50, 2004 Aug 26 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the review page would be useful; we need to not only be accountable, but to be seen to be accountable. I also think that this would separate out complaints related to admin abilities from general user complaints. Making personal attacks for example, would have nothing to do with admin accountability - it might be part of a RfC, but has no relevance to a person's use of admin abilities. Keeping the pages separate would allow us to concentrate only on those issues related to administration. But I don't see the need for a de-adminship page as well. Any removal of Admin abilities would have to come from the Arbcom, and all they would need is the information on the RFROAA. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 11:55, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not saying that the review page won't be useful; RFROAA should just stay a part of RFC. RFROAA would not be used often enough to warrant being its own page. If it ever reaches that point, we're doomed&#160;:/ -- <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrunt_6e8a.html" title="User:Grunt">Grunt</a> <a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrunt_2a44.html" title="User talk:Grunt">(talk)</a> 14:20, 2004 Aug 26 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose my main worry is that the pages would just get lost in the general RfC noise. With a separate page it will be visible and open, and easy to see how much (or how little) of a problem admin actions are. It will also help those who wish to keep a closer eye on things here, without having to wade through pages of RfC. It will be especially useful to keep a separate page if procedures in using the page are significantly different from using RfC -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 15:06, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have to agree that I think a separate page would be better. Even if it is not used often, it will serve to show Wikipedians that admins are held accountable. If it is kept in RfC, people might not notice that actual admins are being questioned and actions are being taken to prevent any abuse of power. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyler1534_f063.html" title="User:Skyler1534">Skyler</a> 02:53, Aug 27, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If it is decided to split WP:RFROAA back into a separate page, should it continue to use subpages for each dispute? I believe the style of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Example_user_be59.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Example user">user conduct disputes</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Example_admin_ad1a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Example admin">admin conduct disputes</a> (and <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">VFD</a>, for that matter) has its advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>It keeps the main page simple and easily readable—an index rather than an entire book. Compare <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html#General_user_conduct" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment#General user conduct</a> to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Conflicts_between_users&amp;oldid=2610613" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Conflicts_between_users&amp;oldid=2610613" rel="nofollow">randomly-chosen old revision</a> of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflicts_between_users_62dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflicts between users">Wikipedia:Conflicts between users</a> to see what I mean.</li>
<li>Using subpages keeps the edit history of both the main index and the specific requests usable.</li>
<li>Archiving and linking to subpages is easier; if a link to a prior review is needed there is no need to root through old revisions of a page that, if used as the sole area of debate, will have a massive edit history.</li>
<li>The RfC templates keep the discussion somewhat useful; if used properly they produce (in theory) a straightforward document of the dispute, rather than simply giving flamewars a new arena. Again, compare old revisions of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflicts_between_users_62dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflicts between users">Wikipedia:Conflicts between users</a> to various RfC subpages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, format and organization are largely uncontroversial and easy enough to change if they should become so, so they aren't major issues, but it would be nice to decide this in advance. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a> 04:24, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I worry that some of these procedures skirt too close to quickpolls again. I think one of the things we learned from quickpolls were that the Wikipedia community can be quite like a lynch mob. As such, I tend to think democracy is not the proper procedure for judicial decisions. Perhaps a better solution would be an expansion of the arbcom that would allow them to move faster - say, double the size without doubling the number of votes needed for decisions. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 04:40, Aug 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree with your view. Wikipedia gives any user (even any visitor) the power to modify the most important part of the whole project, i.e. the encyclopedia itself. The assumption that most people will exercise this power responsibly and with skill has served us well, and we've developed effective means of counteracting those who abuse that power. I see no reason why the same would not be true for judicial decisions. Wikipedians should have the right to "recall" abusive admins, (in fact since Wikipedians are the victims of abusive admins, they are <i>best</i> to judge who is abusive) and we only need to think of ways to counteract abuse of this right to make it work. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 09:55, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Editing articles is very different from policy decisions - Wikipedians may not single-handedly alter policy, which is why we're having this discussion. Furthermore, we don't have a democracy regarding editing articles. We have an anarchy that eventually moves towards consensus, or, at least, towards a default position. I don't think that method is going to work for decisions like this etiher. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 15:44, Aug 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a>. I did not say that any Wikipedian should be able to single-handedly alter policy etc. My point is that we need to look at where power lies (in this case, the power to review sysops) and I'm saying power should ideally lie with Wikipedians as a whole, rather than transferred to another authority like ArbCom, as long as this is technically feasable, practical and there are no other serious problems with it. Obviously some things cannot and should not be done by all Wikipedians, like running the servers or accepting donations to Wikipedia. This is not the case for reviewing sysops, which is technically feasable, practical, and there are very good reasons why this should be done by Wikipedians collectively: Wikipedians collectively are much better placed to judge sysops that abuse their powers because they are most at risk, compared to ArbCom which is not necessarily representative (many members are sysops themselves and can defend themselves much better than your "common" Wikipedian). You have not responded to this last point. Please also explain why you think this would not work for decisions like this as you say above, and why safeguards (like more stringent requirements for majority, e.g. 2/3 or 80%) could not make it work. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 09:26, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but I'm just unable to get behind anything that tries to make a distinction between "sysops" and "common" Wikipedians in terms of interests or judgment. You become a sysop because you're a respected and stable member of the community. You become an arbitrator because you're an exceptionally respected and stable member of the community with what the community sees as especially good judgment. I really can't accept a line of argument based on the idea that the arbcom is somehow unqualified to make certain decisions. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 13:47, Aug 27, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course what you say is true for almost all sysops. The thing is that some people (no matter how respected they are in the first place) have and develop a taste for making use of their power against others. That's only human - I'm not even saying that I'm not like that. So to make it easier for admins not to fall for that, it would be good to make them accountable to all Wikipedians. The way I understand this policy, it is not about having a whole lot of votes (the need for which is only rare at present) - on the contrary: ideally the policy will re-inforce a culture of admins using their power with caution. I'm not saying that ArbCom is unqualified, I'm saying that Wikipedians collectively are better qualified because they are more likely to be the victims of rogue admins. You did not reply to my question why you think it would not work if we have appropriate safeguards. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 19:38, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I'd like to see the Arbcom expanded, there should also be a way to review an admins actions at a lower level than that of the Arbcom. They shouldn't be asked to rule on minor transgressions, any more than they should rule on every incident of vandalism or personal attack. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 11:55, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Fair enough. But I think if the transgression is too small for the arbcom to rule on, it's also too small to justify sanction against the administrator for beyond "Hey. Don't do that." Which RfC already provides. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 15:44, Aug 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think there is a level or two between "don't do that" and Arbcom, just as there is for vandalism, personal attacks and other editing problems. We also need to be able to see any pattern of minor transgressions from a particular admin - one or two may be dismissible, but if it is a daily event then we have a problem. But the main reason I'd like to see admin actions separated from RfC is visibility. I would like it to be clear that admins have to stick to the rules, and that we take it seriously if they don't. I think a clear and separate procedure will help to demonstrate that - and hopefully to also demonstrate that mostly we <i>do</i> stick to the policies. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 23:28, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

For example - in the case of a single misapplied block, perhaps the block should be reversed and it simply noted that the action was wrong in this case. If a pattern of misapplied blocks becomes evident, then <i>that</i> might be a time when further action might be needed.</p>
<p>Measure III: "That Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship be a single, stand-alone page instead of a redirect to Wikipedia:Requests for comment."</p>
<p>As I said above, I don't think this is necessary. Any de-adminship would be an Arbcom matter, and related to serious, extensive or repeated violations of policy. In cases such as this, the correct place for the complaint would be Requests for Arbitration (with Requests for Review pages listed as evidence)</p>

<li>Measure I only applies to admin actions. Other bad actions go through the normal channels.</li>
<li>The voting procedures described in Measure II might work better if it were more like the votes of the Arbcom; i.e. if it is determined that an action is necessary, actions should be proposed and perhaps voted on.</li>
<li>Measure III is subsumed by Measure II as a possible action resulting from an RFROAA.</li>

<dd>My main problem is with the seemingly common viewpoint that Measure I should only apply to admin policies and admin actions. Don't we think that Admins should be responsible and held to a higher standard than the rest of all Wikipedians in order to keep their admin status? The measure states "Any explicit violation of any official Wikipedia policy". Why should an <i>explicit</i> violation committed by an admin go through normal channels? It seems like this would be cause to review their adminship. If we don't hold admins to a higher standard as we do with politicians, than we are cheating ourselves of having <i>completely</i> reponsible admins that adhere to all areas of Wikipedia policy, rather than just admins that do a good job in their admin actions. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyler1534_f063.html" title="User:Skyler1534">Skyler</a> 03:11, Aug 27, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My view is that admins are subject to <i>exactly</i> the same rules as any other user. But those are covered by other policies - none of which exclude admins. An example - if an admin were to start vandalising pages, they should be blocked by another admin, just as any other user would be. Now, in reality - that block could easily be removed by the blocked admin, but <i>that</i> would be an abuse of their admin abilities and would come under this rule. So I don't see a need for the original problem to be covered by this policy. However, if an admin reached ArbCom for serious violations of any policy, I would guess that the committee would seriously consider whether they should remove admin rights. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 13:45, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since the ArbCom is not really representative, sysops should be made accountable to the larger community. We should allow a certain minimum number of people to file a motion of no confidence in a sysop, and then use a secret voting process like for the Arbitration Committee (everyone who is here for 3 months can vote). If the sysop then has less than 60% support, he should be desysopped. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 12:33, Aug 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's the point. You act as if sysops are mean on purpose, and that they do it on a wide scale. Admins aren't even appointed without a clear consensus — for example, recently Lucky 6.9 wasn't appointed even though there was a majority of support votes. Wikipedian users don't appoint admins unfairly. Why should the process of desysoping be so secretive when the process of appointing sysops is so open? If the admin behaves unfairly toward the user after the process fails, the issue can be brought up again and again. If there's a case, nobody's stopping you from presenting it. We're a self-patrolling community. If the admin plays dirty, the other admins notice. Desysoping is a task that should not be taken lightly, which is why we have arbitration and why it is long. I'd rather have justice done than to turn off a good user accidentally because of a rushed decision. Voters can be unfairly influenced by trolls and sockpuppets, you know. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:40, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Most admins are OK, but abuses happen. Part of the problem is that there are still sysops from the early days when standards were much lower, and some of those would probably not be accepted today if they had to apply again. See above for why it should be secret. And self-patrolling doesn't work currently. I can present a case, but nothing happens. The admins are in control and tend to protect each other. Only one or two have <i>ever</i> been desysopped, although there were several who have repeatedly exceeded their authority. This lack of accountability has to produce resentment. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 12:07, Aug 27, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In response to concerns of Sannse and others, Measure II no longer recommends referring every action to the Arbcom.

<dd>We're thinking that the three count would apply towards individual actions; i.e. if a really bad admin did a lot of really bad things at once, each really bad thing would count as an individual action and they would be sent to arbcom right away (after vote of no confidence passed); only one vote would probably be required for the entire batch of related actions, though. -- <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrunt_6e8a.html" title="User:Grunt">Grunt</a> <a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrunt_2a44.html" title="User talk:Grunt">(talk)</a> 21:15, 2004 Aug 26 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Right. But then if an admin say, made a questionable block. That one-time occurrence would probably not merit immediate Arbcom action.

<p>I am very active in maintaining <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPages_needing_translation_into_English_8f7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Pages needing translation into English">Wikipedia:pages needing translation into English</a>. There are a lot of times when this results in my speedy-deleting garbage articles in foreign languages. When I'm in doubt, I put them on Vfd, but it's a judgement call every time. So far the clear consensus is that I'm erring on the side of caution. Effectively this seems to say that if someone feels I make one bad judgement call in the other direction, I have to go through some kind of process related not to reversing my action (which I would always willingly do for any reasonable complaint) but over my qualifications to be an admin. I assume dozens of other admins are in parallel situations on other parts of Wikipedia. Our role requires us to take actions. Sometimes we will be wrong. It seems to me that as long as we unresistingly reverse ourselves when we are wrong and we are not often wrong, that is all that can be asked of a human being.</p>
<p>I will admit that I haven't read this closely. I will do so only if it is actually solidified and brought up for a vote. Until then, frankly, I'm just hoping it will go away. In about a year on wikipedia, I have not witnessed a single case of an administrator doing anything significantly inappropriate in his or her role as an administrator (some are hell as editors, but they still will be if they are no longer admins). I think that regardless of probable good intent, this is (1) an attempt to solve a problem that, to the best of my knowledge, does not exist and (2) one more tool that will allow trolls to play with process and tie up the people who are actually trying to do real work. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 00:25, Aug 27, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Whilst I of course respect your opinion, I disagree. I think that Wikipedia needs to have this policy or at least something similar. Right now, administrators are rarely, if EVER, sanctioned, chastised, anything! There's barely even systems set up. We need checks and balances! I'm tired of hearing users complain about cabals and how administrators can do pretty much anything they want. It's true! If I wanted to, I could go around doing about 1000 stupid or destructive things before anyone would talk about desysopping me.

<dd>I agree with you both. We have to be careful that every minor judgement call doesn't become a cry of "policy violation!" We all make these decisions each time we speedy delete or block someone for simple vandalism - we need not to be afraid to make those judgments, and not to be risking days of hassle and accusations every time we do. But on the other hand we also need to change the current climate where there is little or no analysis of admin actions, and anyone who dares to question a decision is automatically presumed to be trolling or worse. Or (if that's a bad analysis of the situation) where that is <i>perceived</i> to be the current climate. What we need from this policy is a balanced middle way, a sensible policy that makes us accountable but does not restrict our daily, legitimate work. Jmabel, please <i>do</i> read this carefully and help to find a way to find this balance - the more of us that do so, the more likely we are to come up with a policy that will actually work. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 13:46, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that we can't act too quickly for people to respond, but if we dally too long the ideas will be ignored and grow stale. I would say that the actual timetable used, five days for discussion and modifications before starting, is just a little short for a proposal of such significance. So I agree with Pir's sentiment, and would suggest that we extend discussion for a few days, and start the survey/poll on September 1st instead, to conclude on the 8th. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 21:22, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Measure 1 is <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tautology_%28rhetoric%29.html" title="Tautology (rhetoric)">tautology</a>: "explicit violation is abuse". <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 08:56, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That misses the point: the crucial thing is precisely determining what is abuse and what is not. This policy is about whether this decision should be made by Wikipedians or not. <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 11:56, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's exacly my point:
<ul>
<li>The term "explicit violation": how does it serve to clarify the notion of "abuse"? Explicit is basically "readily observable". Why subtle, creeping, clandestine viaolations are not abuse? IMO they are even more abusive. And IMO this very proposal, if accepted will be an abuse.</li>
<li>Why "explicit violation" itself cannot be the base of pesecution? I have an impresion that measure 1 (and this whole numbering thing) was introduced simply to look the proposal more "solid" (two items is something not serious. 'Three' is the minimal bureaucratic number.) <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 17:49, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Finally, if a violation is "explicit", why vote? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 18:16, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>See? You yourself are confused with your own language: The "explict" was "violation", not the "abuse". And you still didn't answer my question: what is the difference between abuse and violation in this context, and why measure 1 is not tautology. And why "clandestine violation" is not abuse. Instead, you prefer to spend your time on personal threats. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 21:26, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The whole history of democracy shows that only majors matter of policy are decided by all-people voting, referendum, etc. For everyday issues, power must be delegated and someone must always be pesonally responsible for decisions. <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviets.html" title="Soviets">Soviets</a> is the best example of what will happen if for every issue the voting is required, with responsibility for bad decisions meing diluted, hidden, or manipulated. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 18:01, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I do not think that we can learn much by comparing Wikipedia to imperial Russia in 1917, but if anything your analogy supports my argument: we need safeguards to prevent abuse of power by admins. Suppose some totalitarian organisation, like Scientology or the North Korean government (the Dear Leader is known to use the Internet a lot!), decide to inflitrate Wikipedia. They give a twenty or fifty paid people the full-time job of contributing to Wikipedia. After several months, they'll be very highly respected and popular so they'll become admins without any problem. They'll also get their people in ArbCom. Once they've been installed they change their tune and take over. How would you prevent that if there's no way to de-sysop abusive admins via a popular vote? - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 19:17, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I partly disagree. I have no idea where your figure comes from, but from my experience votes are quite representative. People who decide not to participate in votes probably have good reasons not to: they may be happy with the outcome of the votes&#160;; they may not feel sufficiently informed to take part&#160;; they may not feel sufficiently involved in Wikipedia to have an opinion. As long as every Wikipedian has the right to participate in the vote, and as long as these votes are visible and well advertised, there should be no problem. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 12:04, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<dd>That's the point: "who decide not to participate". The problem is that people DO NOT decide not to participate: the people simply don't know what's happening. They simply have no time to keep their eye at politics. They are busy contributing (in their spare time, free of charge, mind you). And the history of <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolshevism.html" title="Bolshevism">bolshevism</a> shows that a minority can really screw up any good idea, if they concentrate their efforts against the rest. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 18:06, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<dd>This should not be a problem if votes are well advertised. Abusive admins are a nuisance and a concern for all Wikipedians, so I really believe that a large (or at least representative) proportion of people will participate. In addition, and as I tried to explain above, a minority that concentrate their efforts to screw up things is far more dangerous if they are already in a position where they have more power. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 19:22, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A section has been added to the introduction of the proposal. It reads: "The aim of this proposal is not to increase bureaucracy nor to persecute admins.

<p>I confess I decided to run a small experiment to get an idea how these measures are going to be implemented. I made a harmless change in the article: I replaced "Discussion on this proposal shall last" by "The authors of this proposal suggest that the discussion on this proposal shall last". Notice that the article requests: "Please do not edit this proposal", and I <b>DID NOT</b> edited the proposal iteself (Me being good at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_tape.html" title="Red tape">red tape</a>&#160;:-). After being reverted, I re-reverted with the explanation for those who cannot read what they write themselves: "I did not edit the <b>proposal</b>, complying with the preamble. I edited the preamble. Why revert? I made the statement more precise, especially since it is disputable."</p>
<p>After that I've got the following threat.</p>

<dd>Okay, maybe everybody needs to take a nice big time-out here (24 hours at least, though I'm <b>not</b> threatening to block anybody). So right, I don't agree that Blankfaze would have been justified in blocking Mikkalai based on my reading of the policy, but at the same time I think he was acting in good faith and focused on trying to stop a rapidly developing edit war (the warning came after Snowspinner's second revert to the page). And Mikkalai is certainly not helping the situation by taking such a hostile attitude, as reflected in the posts on this page. As for the "experiment", perhaps Mikkalai would do well to consider some of the good advice at <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a>. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 22:01, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<dd>About making existing rules visible, rather than inventing new ones - I've long been of the opinion that we have way too many policy and other pages in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProject_namespace_034e.html" title="Wikipedia:Project namespace">project namespace</a>, and am always a little disturbed when people create even more. It's a form of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:instruction_creep">instruction creep</a>, and also makes it more and more impossible for anyone to actually learn and absorb our policies. Having fewer policy pages would make the remaining ones more visible and their contents more familiar to everyone. That's not really related to this proposal, but I'd like people to be a little more aware of the problem. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 23:57, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Whilst perhaps Mikkalai was <b>being bold</b>, I think that in instances such as this, where there are explicit instructions not to edit the page, that discussion is the wiser route.

I do not believe his edit was necessary or even in good faith, for all he would have to do is raise the issue on the talk page and wait for me to respond" is entirely specious. Not only was no one going to be misled -- as all he was doing was adding <i>a suggestion</i>, but the argument that he should wait for you to respond pre-supposes that you and only you have a right to set the time of the vote. Again, given the politicization, I'd likely have deferred to the author's preferred time, but no one is obligated to do so.</dd>

Rather than avoid being a judge in your own cause by finding another user or sysop to mediate, <i>you threatened to take away a newbie's entire ability to edit over your <b>own</b> edit war</i>.</dd>

<p>You made a change that was against the traditional way of doing things, and justified it with a hysterical post about how the people who were proposing hte policy were Bolsheviks and how their policy constituted abuse. Since then, you have called blankfaze a zealot, a tsar, and said "good fuck to you." Sadly, the disruptive users policy, you are right, does not apply to you in this case - however, you are well past the limit of what is acceptable on Wikipedia, and I strongly advise you to back off. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 00:05, Aug 28, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Advise taken. But what 'traditional way' are you talking about? I was on vacation for three months, now I'm back and lo! there lots of new traditions around and still more under development! Of course I was a bit pissed off, and I apologize. BTW, there is nothing personal here. I never ever blocked anyone non-anon and never reverted more than twice per issue. So I am not afraid I will be de-admined or something. And I am bit worried of your polite wording "sadly". So you are a trigger-happy one, too? Given an opportunity, you'd be more than happy to kick my smart ass, yes? Are you working on a new policy to have this opportunity? You are saying I am hysterical.

<dd>I too have to question the idea of this being the "traditional" way of formulating policies. The traditional way is the wiki way... community editing of a proposal until a consensus version is found. The idea of an "author" of a policy is a recent development, and I'm not yet convinced it has a clear advantage over older methods - although I do appreciate why Blankfaze chose to use the more formal procedure, and I'm interested to see if it works. I think Mikkalai's "experiment" was ill advised - not because it involved editing the proposal page (although I would have personally chosen to discuss the issue rather than edit if I had decided to challenge the procedure) but because it was an edit designed to provoke a reaction, which I don't think was helpful. But I think the results of those edits reinforce the need for some sort of policy rather than otherwise. I feel there is a tendency at the moment for "arguments from authority" by admins, which really worries me. It's not so much any gross abuse of admin powers that concerns me, but rather the small day-to-day pressure to conform to what a small group sees as "correct behaviour"... the edits in good faith that are dismissed as vandalism and the valid disagreements that are automatically considered trolling simply because they go against the opinion of the in-crowd. I don't know if this policy is the right way to tackle these problems - perhaps there isn't a way to do so - I'm too discouraged right now to know -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 22:18, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"it was an edit designed to provoke a reaction" Allow me to disagree here with the interpretation. It was an edit targetting what was worst in the page: an arbitrary deadline, not someone's ego. I disagree with the proposal itself, but I was ready to discuss it, and started doing so in the talk page, with little response. Next thing I noticed is that the proposal is of limited visibility and the deadline is unrealistic, therefore I targeted the deadline, so that people smarter (and more polite) than me can join the discussion. As I admitted, it was especially interesting for me to see what kind of reaction it will cause, and it is only natural. Each time you edit a text written by a person who disagrees with you, it definitely "provokes a reaction". Also, and again, I DID NOT edit the proposal! <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 00:13, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand that you did not edit the proposal (as I clarified in my last edit with "proposal <i>page</i>"). My interpretation of this as an edit designed to provoke a reaction was based on your remark... "I confess I decided to run a small experiment to get an idea how these measures are going to be implemented". Perhaps it would be fairer to say it was an edit designed to see if there <i>would be</i> a reaction. Either way - I don't think this is important now. I'm more interested in understanding your view-point on the idea of a policy, whether you believe one is necessary and (if one is needed) what form should it take. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 20:58, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The proposal is meaningless. If a bad guy is pesistently abusive, there is no need each time list him anew. It is only enough to add more evidence into the initial record of abuse.

<p>Does anyone else find it terribly amusing that the author of a policy designed to deal with abuse of sysop powers threatened a blatant abuse of sysop powers in order to preserve a preferred version of that policy? Was the comedy deliberate?</p>
<p>More seriously: Should this policy address the problem, now demonstrated, of admins who use their sysop powers to threaten or intimidate other users? Admins <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">are not imbued with any special authority</a>, yet right here we see admins trying to use their technical capabilities to whip other users into line—a line (i.e. <i>please do not edit this proposal</i> and so forth) which they had no authority to draw. (They can <i>ask</i>, yes; anyone is free to <i>request</i> that their proposed policies remain unedited, and anyone else is free to ignore that request.) Should this sort of thuggery be penalized as severely as if the threats had actually been carried out? Should some lesser sanction be applied? Or should these abuses go unpunished? <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a> 06:42, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please explain how changing <i>Discussion on this proposal shall last</i> with <i>The authors of this proposal suggest that the discussion on this proposal shall last</i> amounts to being an asshole. I can agree only to be "pain in the ass" (I know I sometimes am.) As a demonstration of good will I can explain my wording <i>act as <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsar.html" title="Tsar">tsar</a></i>: (1) declared attempt to grab ownership (2) forbidding modifications by other persons but for himself and "tructed few" (3) ignoring actual criticism.</li>
<li>I aware of the policy of avoiding personal attacks. But we are talking not about a topical article here. A policy is implemented by people, not by computers. Therefore a significant consideration should be given to the personality issue. More concern should be given NOT to how <b>good people</b> will use it, but how <b>bad gyus</b> will. I wrote repeatedly and am not tired to repeat again (well, there even is a say about a fly in the ointment). IMO the ones who tend to introduce stringent policies usually don't have enough patience and/or desire to resolve issues amicably. They prefer to grab a big stick and kick your wrongdoing ass. Naturally, the fisrt step is to manufacture this big stick... I looked into the history of blocking of bad admins. Well. Some are gone, some are doing well. Wikipedia lives. Now here come new people and try to turn it into police state. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 16:40, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Having reviewed some history of sysop abuses, I wonder if this policy is even necessary. Someone <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-August/029581.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-August/029581.html" rel="nofollow">remarked</a> on the mailing list, correctly, that abuses of admin power are very easy to spot. Public attention is an effective antidote to abuses of power, at least in an open society, and I think this holds true for Wikipedia: for every sysop willing to misuse his or her powers, there are others ready to raise Cain about the abuse—and to undo it. Some users are ready to question even those actions that later turned out to be well-justified, as the <a href="../../../j/r/r/User%7EJRR_Trollkien_70d5.html" title="User:JRR Trollkien">JRR Trollkien</a> block wars demonstrated. This social pressure is a check, albeit unofficial, on the actions of would-be dictators; reasonable people (and the sysop selection process is pretty good about weeding out the unreasonable) aren't going to continue acting against strong community disagreement. If they do, well, there's always arbitration.</p>
<p>There have been and will be extreme cases; <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> is the only one I recall, and s/he was a usually-rational person acting irrationally as a deliberate act of protest. However, even a rogue sysop can't do much permanent damage (maybe image deletions, but I think developers can undo those), and extreme cases can be dealt with in extreme fashion: a straw poll desysopped 168, and emergency appeals to the arbitration committee, or to Jimbo, could be used against any future rampages. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a> 19:29, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>in this case, I believe the decision to unsysop 168 might have been wise at the moment it was done. The fact he stayed unsysoped, that it took 2 or 3 months for the arbcom to take care of the case, and more than 6 months for Lir to be banned, turned it into a sort of a joke. I am not sure the emergency was so high that it was worth it.<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">SweetLittleFluffyThing</a></dd>

<p>What I really find worrisome is what I touched on above, at the end of all the taunting. I am concerned about sysops who merely threaten to use their powers in order to win disputes, but without following through and thus exposing themselves to scrutiny. Sysops and others familiar with policy know that they can ignore hollow threats, but a newer user might not, and unless someone spots an abusive sysop right away, it could have a real and uncorrected chilling effect on debate.</p>
<p>So my question is, should threats to misuse one's admin powers be treated as equivalent to real abuses? (This is my view.) Should they be considered a misdeed, but less severe than an actual abuse of power? Should they be disregarded entirely, leaving sysops free to throw their weight around as they please? Or something else? <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a> 03:28, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would say that such threats could be percieved as personal attacks and dealt with appropriately. Threatening to use admin powers is not the same as actually using those admin powers. -- <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrunt_6e8a.html" title="User:Grunt">Grunt</a> <a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrunt_2a44.html" title="User talk:Grunt">(talk)</a> 18:03, 2004 Aug 29 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>But it is an abuse of those powers in that you have to have those powers in order to make the threat. I think this relates directly to admin abilities and so is a separate issue from a general threat. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 20:58, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I shall only warn you against a potential problem with this proposal. By some points, it reminds the system we use on the fr wikipedia. We are plagued by votes made by sockpuppets. Most of the votes were ineffective to take any action, so the quorum was not even reached for the last vote (people realise their vote changes nothing).</p>
<p>Other than that, I find it curious that only one editor is authorized to edit the proposal (not sure this is a brainstorming) and that in the end, users are only given the choice between supporting or rejecting the entirety of the proposal. This reduces chances to reach the best proposal. Imho.</p>

<p>"In order to prevent misuse of the system, users would be disallowed from listing an administrator on Wikipedia:Requests for review of administrative actions more than one time in any 30-day period."</p>
<p>My understanding of the discussion above was that we were considering limiting User X from making more than one listing in a 30-day period. However, as written this guideline can be read to prevent <i>any user</i> from listing Admin Y more than once in a 30-day period - in fact, I submit that this is the most grammatically sensible reading of the statement. In other words, after having been listed once, Admin Y is then free to abuse admin privileges with impunity for 30 days. It should be self-evident that this is not acceptable. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 18:44, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So a sysop can abuse user X numerous times in a month, but the user abused can only list one? Should the user list the first such abuse, or wait to save his one shot for potentially greater abuse coming later? doesn't this essentially give a sysop a "get a out of jail free" card after the first listed abuse? <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">-- orthogonal</a> 22:44, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, at some point or other we have to rely on common sense and general rule about trolling. Setting arbitrary numerical constraints has its own drawbacks already discussed, I believe (but don't know where). For example, numerical constraits may be easily circumvened by a vicious clique. Anyway, any legal system has its imperfections and has to evolve. IMO we (you and me) seem to differ only in one basic issue: you seem with to start immediately with some strictly defined rules, while I prefer to give initially some slack and set more stringent rules when an actual necessity arises. I may be "hysterical" sometimes, but I do believe that people here on wikipedia are inherently good. Of course, if at some moment <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosa_nostra.html" title="Cosa nostra">cosa nostra</a> decides that wikipedia suits their needs, IMO any number of policies would not help anyway. Therefore I consider "angry" policies as an insult to the majority. Even apparently "vicious" guys around here IMO have good intentions, and it is amazing how most heated discussions eventually arrived to some point of balance without necessity to apply some kind of force. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 04:01, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This proposal (correct me if I'm misunderstanding) already relies on the entire user base of wikipedia to decide whether a sysop's actions were abusive or not, by a straight up-or-down vote. Since that already <i>unavoidably</i> introduces the subjectivity of <i>every single</i> voter, blankfaze's desire to reduce subjectivity seems even more to justified. But since we <i>do</i> have to introduce the subjectivity of voting, and since the voters will already be deciding if sysop's actions were correct, let them also certify if the <i>complaint</i> was correct.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This does complicate the vote, but not too much. Where before we have "concur" or "no confidence", now we have "concur with sysop; allegation unjustified", "concur with sysop; allegation justified", "and no confidence in sysop; allegation justified". Only the second of these alternatives, "concur with sysop; allegation justified" is an addition, and it deserves some explanation.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Basically, it means the sysop was justified, but that the voter feels it was a close enough thing or a gray enough area that the complaintant was justified in asking the sysop's action to be reviewed (the contrary, "no confidence in sysop; allegation unjustified", makes no sense, as it could only be used to punish the sysop for something other than the allegation, something we wish to avoid). If the allegation is held to be justified by a majority, regardless of whether the sysop is upheld or no confidence is given, the complaintant may make another allegation before the expiry period (which is one month, or two weeks, or whatever you decide on). If the complaint is found unjustified, the complaintant may not make another complaint against that sysop until the period expires.</dd>

<dd>This would stop "trolling" complaints just as quickly as having a set expiry period, as unjustified complaints would be decided to be such on the first such complaint, forestalling any others. But justified complaints -- even if it's such a gray area that the sysop is also upheld -- in other words, non-"trolling" complaints of all types, could be made as often as necessary. I'm sure there are flaws in this proposal, and that both of you, blankfaze and Mikkalai, as well as other users, can find ways to improve it, but I think it forms at least a useful basis for further discussion. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">-- orthogonal</a> 04:33, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Anyhow, I'm really open to any and all suggestions on this... surely there has to be some compromise we can all settle on to get this proposal passed.

<dd>As I understand it, we don't have any <i>technical</i> way of preventing anyone from doing this, and if the user in question is "crazed", they'll likely ignore the policy requirements anyway. So a policy won't protect us, and we'd have to treat the crazed user as a vandal. I mean, the policy can't protect us against a vandal bot or a power outage at the server farm or a DDOSing or the civil war that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Titor_c1ef.html" title="John Titor">"time traveler" guy</a> says happens (happened?) in 2005. But my question really is, how many crazed users do we have, and don't we have other ways to deal with any that exist?</dd>
<dd>blankfaze is approaching writing this policy like a programmer, and as a programmer myself, I definitely understand <i>that</i> particular motivation. But at some point we have say, well, there are certain exceptions we can't handle, and we just have to gracefully terminate and let the operating system deal with it. But as in programming, let's not expend too much sweat on rare corner-cases, and instead (my opinion is) let's concentrate on making this thing work under most <i>usual</i> conditions. And christ I'm too verbose. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">-- orthogonal</a> 05:26, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Of course a policy cannot affect external events like power outages. However it should internally prevent itself from being abused, otherwise it will get rejected and rightly so. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 08:58, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>True. But it might be easier to tell if the system is being abused, rather than if bad sysops are being deterred. If so, why not start with no expiry period and increase it when and if needed? Right now, I fear that it gives bad sysops a 29 day "get out of jail free" card. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">-- orthogonal</a> 15:50, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I still think that sysops bad enough to warrant more than one warning in a thirty day period probably warrant the attention of more than one user; therefore the sysop can still be written up within those thirty days (just not by the same person). -- <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrunt_6e8a.html" title="User:Grunt">Grun</a><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrunt_2a44.html" title="User talk:Grunt">t</a> <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union"><font style="display: inline; background: #0000c0; font-size: 12pt; color: yellow;">&#160; ҈&#160;</font></a> 17:45, 2004 Aug 31 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK. Will this be because the bad sysop does things to these other users too? If the bad sysop is just going after one person or a few, how will other people know enough to list him? And if I list against a rogue on behalf of another user, if the sysop is really bad, he may retaliate against me. So I might be reluctant to list in the first place, from fear of potential retaliation, and even more reluctant to list <i>and give up my chance to list and thus protect myself if he does in fact come after me</i>. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">-- orthogonal</a> 17:52, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since the voting is so tight I think the deadline should be extended. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_B._and_Rakim_cec7.html" title="User:Eric B. and Rakim">Eric B. and Rakim</a> 10:00, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't seem tight at all. Right now it's:
<ul>
<li>Measure I - (18/26)</li>
<li>Measure II - (10/3/21)</li>
<li>Measure III - (8/0/28)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Seems pretty clear it's thumbs down on all measures. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> | <a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzheado_fba0.html" title="User talk:Fuzheado">Talk</a> 10:11, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nah, it's not really tight at all. All measures will fail. But thanks for you hope! <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(беседа!)</small></a> 17:28, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like to thank Blankfaze, however, for initiating this, even though I was against the exact wording of the measures. It is a useful exercise to try to sort out what is acceptable administrator behavior, as it has clearly "crept" into areas which have caused problems. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> | <a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzheado_fba0.html" title="User talk:Fuzheado">Talk</a> 01:46, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. I figured there would be considerable opposition to this. I'd still like to see something similar implemented in the future, though. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(беседа!)</small></a> 04:02, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>blankfaze, while I don't think the proposal is perfect, I think it's an excellent <i>start</i>, and I look forward to working with you to develop a policy that can be generally accepted. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">-- orthogonal</a> 04:13, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
