<p>First of all, congrats on joining the admin club!! The difference between the images is the extension, .jpg and .JPG. The latter is on commons and hence cannot be protected from vandalism, (as I am not an admin yet&#160;;-) on commons), it is temporarily uploaded - dunno why, but the default extension seems to be .jpg rather than .JPG and hence it got uploaded as such. btw, the file was huge and took a lot of time to manually download it first from commons and then upload it to en.

If you had contacted Irish users they could have told you that the images were all out of copyright because they all date from a campaign of 1912-1914 which ended with the start of the First World War and helped to find their origins. But now, as they are all deleted and the user who installed them is no longer on WP the pedia has lost an invaluable set of copyright-free historical images and as we can't see what they were we cannot begin to trace them to get them back. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>Ã‰IREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:31, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know you followed process, but why didn't you approach the Irish noticeboard just to check the information? Irish users could have given the information or traced it. The current process is, if you'll pardon the expression, a crock of shit. Major mistakes are being made all over the place because people either aren't notifying the downloaders <i>at all</i> or if they do, aren't doing any homework, just blanket deleting things without cop-on. Much of my time on WP these days seems to be spent cleaning up deletion screw-ups.

<p>Dear Admrboltz:</p>
<p>I am not sure on what grounds you are thinking of removing the "Yaks with loads" image. As far as I know, this book has been considered out of copyright for many years. T. E. Gordon, the author, died in 1902 - thus making his death more than 100 years ago. Also, this book has been reprinted several times at least by publishing companies that specialise in reprinting out-of-copyright titles - two that I have seen have no copyright information in them other than a copy of the original title page of the original 1876 edition, which states simply: "All Rights Reserved."</p>
<p>I have a copy here now reprinted by the Ch'eng Wen Publishing Company in Taipei, in 1971. I have also consulted a reprinted copy in Pakistan (printed in Pakistan) and I owned an Indian reprint when I lived there from 1979-81 but, unfortunately, I can't remember the publisher or any other details).</p>
<p>I see on Amazon.com that there has been at least one more reprint - by South Asia Books in 1994.</p>
<p>I think it is fair under these circumstances to consider the book "in the public domain" and to allow the image to remain on the Wikipedia. If you disagee, would you please contact me and leave a note on my "discussion page" and tell me why? If you have any queries I am happy to attempt to answer them.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>I'm not criticising you, BTW, but our policy. As it stands it has no checks and balances to help avoid unnecessary deletions. So good stuff that could have information chased up is dumped as well as the bad. I came across an article lately which lost <i>all</i> of its images even though the only problem was that the downloader of them, a newbie, had hadn't categorised correctly simply because as a newbie he didn't know how to do it. Those doing the deletions often don't know the factual background to images and their likely source (eg, that all close-up images of popes in St. Peters are certain to have been taken by a papal photographer, because they are the only people allowed to take photographs. The Vatican then release the images to the media as free use images. Or, as is the case here, we can be certain of the timeframe within which those images were taken so we know that copyright would have expired). Recently another image was deleted because it was said we did not know when it was taken, where it was taken and who took it. In fact anyone knowledgeable about history would instantly have known it was taken in the afternoon of 31st December 1916 by the official court photographer for release to the press, but by not asking anyone (in that case not even alerting the downloader) before deletion the deleter had no information to go on. So others had to chase back the images and redownload them.</p>
<p>Because WP is now so big, people simply aren't able to keep an eye on deletion pages all the time. As a result it is vital that deleters alert people before deleting. Maybe we should have specific pages whereby people can post a problematic image, as in the Irish users' page for Irish images, or a historian's page for history images. The current system however is a mess, and is seriously annoying users (I was alerted to this image by a furious user) while losing images we can keep once we do a bit of work in finding their sources, as well as images we clearly cannot keep. All to many deleters don't do anything to establish sources, even contact the original downloader or remove the broken link from articles. The only way the rest of us find out about a deletion is when we find a broken link in an article and mutter "for fuck sake" and something stronger when we find that the original downloader wasn't even alerted that there was a problem with the image, or when we instinctively know from personal knowledge details of what that image was, where it probably came from and its copyright status.</p>
<p>Thanks for agreeing to mention images on country user pages. It may well help the process and avoid unnecessary deletions in the future. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>Ã‰IREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 15:54, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand. I get my share of being "yelled" at too. I just explain, "calmly", why there images were deleted and help them to understand how to fix it (or fix it myself if I erred). There are some people that are never satisfied and I just let them be. Keep plugging away, what you are doing is great! -Thanks, <a href="../../../n/v/8/User%7ENv8200p_b2e9.html" title="User:Nv8200p">Nv8200p</a> <a href="../../../n/v/8/User_talk%7ENv8200p_4d2d.html" title="User talk:Nv8200p">talk</a> 18:13, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your message.</p>
<p>"[...] If you have uploaded other images, <b>please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too</b>. You can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the "my contributions" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion."</p>
<p>If you had done some checking yourself, you would easily have seen from the image history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Test.jpg&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Test.jpg&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> that some stupid vandal (User:Meettheparents) has removed all the details I gave for that image.</p>
<p>I have reverted the page to its original status. I think you might have been able to do that, too.
