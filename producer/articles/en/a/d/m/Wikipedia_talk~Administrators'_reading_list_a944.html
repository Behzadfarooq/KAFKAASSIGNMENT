<dd>Not if we agree that <i>every</i> sysop <i>should</i> read this stuff. By all means, remove what you think isn't essential to dealing with the challenges sysops face around here. A more exhaustive reading list can always go on the meta later. <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEntmootsOfTrolls_3b61.html" title="User:EntmootsOfTrolls">EofT</a></dd>

<dd>Well, as sysops are not <i>required</i> to deal with trolls and whatnot, and as every sysop approaches the Wikipedia in a different way and has different interests and priorities, I don't see how any of it (even the Wikipedia pages) is essential. So I agree this is better on meta. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<p>I agree it probably belongs on meta (restored with EoT's original list), but it shouldndn't be called "sysop reading list". Firstly becasue they are properly called "administrators", not "sysops". Secondly because the very real "challenges" EoT mentions are challenges to <i>everybody</i> here. Or at least to everybody who participates in good faith. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahamN_e872.html" title="User:GrahamN">GrahamN</a></p>

<dd>Yes, that is true. So is there a Wikipedia:conscientious contributors reading list? That might also include <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus_decision_making.html" title="Consensus decision making">consensus decision making</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_content.html" title="Open content">open content</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll.html" title="Troll">troll</a>, and various things on the meta. As for the name, many of them call themselves sysops, and it's a nice short name. And it implies technical responsibilities, as opposed to admin-istrative, so it's probably better, if you don't want them to over-reach their authority. <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEntmootsOfTrolls_3b61.html" title="User:EntmootsOfTrolls">EofT</a></dd>

<dd>I agree, let us make two different lists. They have little similarities anyway. The current <a href="../../../s/y/s/Wikipedia%7ESysop_reading_list_0ae4.html" title="Wikipedia:Sysop reading list">Wikipedia:Sysop reading list</a> is currently a bit boring, but perhaps better over time. In its list, it should include the Wikipedia:conscientious contributors reading list and this one should be a redirect to the meta list. But "conscientious contributors reading list" is too long imho, and could raise spelling mistakes.</dd>

</dl>
<p>And 142.177.79.8 said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"must respectfully disagree - they must spot it and raise issues with it same as copyvio - they don't decide what it is, just note potential for liability in extreme or obvious cases"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since when? I've never seen anything about this in any of the policy documents. What is a sysop to do, pray tell, when they discover a case of libel? Delete it without delay? Protect the page?

<dl>
<dd>Probably just, when they see some unusual reputation-searing quote or claim attributed to someone, sysops can go to that extra effort to validate it, say on Google, as they do for copyvios, weird titles, and if they can't, raise a flag just the same as copyvio. When <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiquote.html" title="Wikiquote">Wikiquote</a> is working perfectly, maybe quotes can be auto-validated so checking will not be the sysop's problem. But it's not like one can just ignore this stuff. Certainly not in "1.0". A good solution is usually to replace "Z claims A" with "Y describes Z's claim as A". This can be done by anyone but if sysops are doing checks for copyright they might as well do it for liability-inducing quotes and claims.</dd>

<dd>Replying to Kat: yes, definitely. There are lots of interesting precedents -- the deletion precedents Daniel C.

There are banning precedents, say <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichael_ban_4185.html" title="User talk:Michael/ban">User talk:Michael/ban</a>. As for page protection: what was that debate Ed Poor was involved in where he made an apology at the mailing list for inappropriate page protection?

<p>I've removed the link to "<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page_Neutral" class="extiw" title="m:Main_Page_Neutral">Become familiar with meta</a>". I don't think that is something we should expect sysops to have to do. I recommend people read the things linked to from this page when I make them sysops, but I don't want to be recommending they read the whole of meta, as I don't think that is relevant to being a sysop. Also, "Main Page Neutral" that was linked to isn't as up to date as other index pages there like the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia" class="extiw" title="m:Wikipedia">m:Wikipedia</a> one. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 15:46, Mar 14, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just became an administrator! However, I have a quick question. Are there any information that should be kept confidential (between administrators only), or are all such information public? I know that on many sites, certain administration information are kept confidential, and I'd like to know if Wikipedia has any such policies.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Danny, I'd say that's call based on your own gut feeling. There's a lot of things that obviously should be kept private (e.g., personal contact information) unless a user otherwise says so. And if you get an email where the sender says something akin to "this is private". However, for the most part everything here on Wikipedia is usually done in the open, for one &amp; all to see. While this can be a bad thing (e.g., were I to rant about User:X merely to vent my frustration on one talk page, it can easily be read by User:X), I think this is a good thing because it forces all of us to be thoughtful in how we act here, &amp; to speak in a respectful manner to each other.

<p>The first item on this list, namely 'account suspensions' is a historical page now and I don't see why it should remain on this list if it is no longer being used. Yes, perhaps potential administrators should know what used to happen, but I'm not sure it should be required reading material. I also suspect that there may well be other pages in the same situation as the list hasn't really been updated for quite some time. What do people think? It would seem sensible to me to remove it from the list.

<dd>I've removed it from the list. It's not been used for ages, and is clearly historical, so no point in reading all about it.
