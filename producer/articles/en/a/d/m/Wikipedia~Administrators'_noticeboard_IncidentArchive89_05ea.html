<dd>The article should be indelibly flagged as advertising and, unless a user can document the herdity claims, also as unsubstantianted and probably bogus. But behind the advertising the article contains some encyclopedia facts. All I am saying, is give flags a chance. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhosts%26empties_0e07.html" title="User:Ghosts&amp;empties">Ghosts&amp;empties</a> (<a href="../../../g/h/o/User_talk%7EGhosts%26empties_7637.html" title="User talk:Ghosts&amp;empties">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ghosts%26empties_bf0e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ghosts&amp;empties">contribs</a>) 16:17, 5 April 2006.</small>

<dd>I started the Annie Travolta page and have been a contributor to many of the Travolta family pages including Margaret Travolta, Rikki Lee Travolta, Annie Travolta, and John Travolta. Many of those changes are reverting vandalism. It is right there in the history. There is no way, shape, or form that could remotely be confused as being in an “advertising scam”. I have NEVER removed members of the Travolta family from listings. I have worked hard to keep the integrity in tact. I think upon closer inspection you’ll see there was an influx of attempts by an anon (66.121.40.132) to vandalizing different Travolta family sites <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=66.121.40.132" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=66.121.40.132" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (changing facts without providing sources or citations). When the anon seemed to be starting a revert war with different users I followed Wiki policy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revert_war" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revert_war" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>and contacted them on their discussion page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:66.121.40.132" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:66.121.40.132" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> to request documentation for the changes being made.</dd>

<dd><i>Its been noticed that you have made several repeated changes to the family elements of the John Travolta page and related pages. The policy at Wikipedia is to try to avoid revert wars going back and forth over the same territory. As follows are what we have confirmed as members of the Travolta family: Margaret Travolta, John Travolta, Ellen Travolta, Joey Travolta, Rikki Lee Travolta; Jack Bannon, Rachel Travolta, Nicole Travolta, Michael Salvatore Travolta, Helen (Burke) Travolta, Kelly Preston, Salvatore Travolta, Molly Allen Ritter, Jonathan Rau, Jet Travolta, Tom Fridley, Sam Travolta, Ella Blue Travolta, Valentino Travolta, and Annie Travolta. This is not an all inclusive list, but all those listed are confirmed. In respecting Wikipedia policy it is always necessary to approach differences of opinion in good faith. Although we have documented each of these individuals as relatives (of different levels of removal or closeness of course) within the extended Travolta family, ff you disagree with any person(s) on this list please provide the documentation and we should be able to come to a simple understanding relatively quickly (no pun intended).

<dd>Firstly, the TV guide link says "<i>There's also some kind of grassroots campaign on behalf of singer/theater actor Rikki Lee Travolta</i>". A grassroots campaign led by who??? Secondly the Chicago Sun Times link is inexplicably not at the Chicago Sun Times website. Thirdly, the person you contacted had removed Rikki Lee Travolta from all the Travolta pages saying "<i>Rikki Lee is not part of this clan</i>" after you had added that name (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.121.40.132_8c42.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.121.40.132">Special:Contributions/66.121.40.132</a>).

Sorry - one person's opinion shouldn't outweigh the facts. And Arniep is trying to make wide sweeping changes purely on opinioin without citing facts and ignoring the facts that do exist.

<dd>THERE'S a strange postscipt to our item the other day about the Internet rumor that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have created a computer-generated actor called "Rikki Lee Travolta." A rather odd actor named Rikki Lee Travolta does in fact exist, and held a press conference in Chicago Tuesday to prove it. "It's good to be alive," he stated. "I am an actor. I am a human being." Travolta, who is of Italian and Native American extraction and claims some family connection with John Travolta, appeared in "West Side Story" on Broadway. He wrote a novel, sports a gunshot wound and claims a doctorate in religious studies. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.</dd>

Both (and several others) are using Wikipedia as a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_battleground" title="WP:NOT">battleground</a>, and in their little nationalistic war over the etnicity of several ancient scienetist have caused/are causing a signifinct amount of "collateral damage" to the articles they edit.

<dl>
<dd>I heartily agree with Ruud, and would be more than happy to support any wide action to settle this ethnic war. While I do agree that Jidan's concerns are not without merit, suffice it to say, speaking as someone who's been investigating this entire matter for some time now, Mani is easily the best of these users. A cursory look at what's been going on here and at a variety of related pages shows a broad spectrum of personal attacks, ethnic slurs, and ingnorant head-butting galore. While I certainly hope some other users/admins do look into the above topics, I firmly believe that only a case that looks at the situation as a whole, and all those involved in it, will end this fighting with some permanency. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 19:04, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's currently an RfAr against <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman">User:Aucaman</a>, instigated by ManiF and friends, which will go to the heart of the matter. It has been my suggestion for a while to widen that case to the whole Iranian group (at least <a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">User:Zmmz</a>, User:Khashayar Karimi and <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManiF_8d90.html" title="User:ManiF">User:ManiF</a>). I'm not sure if all their opponents should also be collected in the same case. We're dealing with one central faction of Iranian editors here, but they battle on several fronts with several other groups (perceived as representing Kurdish, Turkish, Arabic and Jewish POVs against their monolithic Iranian national POV). <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 22:31, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With all due respect, there is currently an ArbCom case involving me, as a concerned user, and user Aucaman who was reported for disruptiveness. Lukas, please refrain from constantly tagging me, or perhaps others as some sort of a gang, or nationalists etc. It is considered uncivil, so take time and please review <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>. The mob you speak of does not exit; but, sporadic editors, concerned with a few unreasonable users, do. You yourself are involved in other fractions with other users in other articles, yet, I do not feel it is appropriate for [me] to comment on it. However please know that, constant finger pointing, and accusations to take attention away from some users who operate more on a political platform, rather than academia is not looked upon kindly by most admins. Refrain from making frivolous allegations and allow the system to investigate the ArbCom case properly. <a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 22:49, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Rather than a 'concerned user', the arbitrators have actually said they are accepting the case to view your behavior, as well. And speaking as an admin, I don't see anything wrong with Lukas' concern; after all, you have been blocked more than once in the past concerning the aforementioned issues. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 22:58, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did initiate the case as a concerned user, and the committee did accept to review my contributions as well, which is welcomed, and frankly fair. I was blocked once for a few minutes for Wikistalking, which was a misunderstanding from my part, since I had left a comment in the talk page of a certain user, requesting help from an admin, yet, you [InShaneee] then unblocked me minutes later. And, in the beginning, I was blocked for the 3RR, as well. None of these, however, were blatant attempts to manipulate the system, rather they can be attributed to inexperience with Wiki policies. As some of the admins may attest, I have tried very hard to compromise with numerous editors<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;diff=47194278&amp;oldid=47191396" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;diff=47194278&amp;oldid=47191396" rel="nofollow">[15]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zmmz&amp;diff=46669711&amp;oldid=46668998" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zmmz&amp;diff=46669711&amp;oldid=46668998" rel="nofollow">[16]</a><a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Zmmz</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../z/m/m/User_talk%7EZmmz_cf88.html" title="User talk:Zmmz">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zmmz_d60c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zmmz">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Zmmz_f8fe.html" title="Special:Blockip/Zmmz">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>)</p>

<dd>Considering the kinds of edit warring and ethnically motivated personal attacks I've seen lately, I'm not entirely sure we aren't dealing with multiple groups here. Thusly, I do think that both sides of the issue should be put together in one case; it might take some time to sort out, but it would present a more balanced view of the issue, and have the advantage of being able to address innapropriate practices on both sides all at once. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 22:46, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Maybe he missed Jimbo's name at the end - I myself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=46623363&amp;oldid=46622280" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bogdanov_Affair&amp;diff=46623363&amp;oldid=46622280" rel="nofollow">deleted an Arbcom-mandated notice</a> in good faith a few days ago and don't seem to have been blocked yet. His opinions on the inclusion of child pornography on Wikipedia aren't grounds for blocking either unless they reach the level of disruption or illegality. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:24, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If he continues with such actions after being warned, I would start with a 24-hour block and progressively work up from there, same as for other people who are disruptive after being warned to stop. Surely indefinite blocks are only for pure-vandal accounts, proven sockpuppets, and ArbCom rulings to that effect!

<p>Doggone it, now I don't have an excuse for getting a new hobby. I had just finishd convincing myself it was a blessing in disguise. Oh, well.</p>
<p>The second example was me discussing the issue of censorship on the talk page of a guideline proposal on censorship. The proposal is currently undergoing a poll. The poll already reveals the proposal does not have consensus. So the question arises, do we need a guideline dealing with people shouting "censorship" or people shouting "porn". Maybe. So I was illustrating the issue with a relevant recent incident.</p>
<p>Concening the article on the lady in question, I deleted two things in the article.</p>
<p>One thing I deleted was the factually inaccurate statement that her real world identity is unknown. That is both factually inaccurate and provably so with public accessable court documents. In this deletion I deleted the word "unknown" in the template on her.</p>
<p>The other thing I deleted was an out of date comment (in the article space, not the talk space) by Jimbo on 31 December 2005 saying:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>As a courtesy while we discuss the issues surrounding this article, please don't add Brandy Alexandre's real name to this article. And please treat SavvyCat with particular respect and understand that if she seems a bit touchy about this article, she has every right to be: it's about her. As a person with a biography about myself in Wikipedia which is frequently used as a place to attack me, I can say that Assume Good Faith is absolutely necessary in a case like this. --Jimbo --</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It is clear that it is out of date because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it says <b>while we discuss the issues surrounding this article</b>,</li>
<li>the discussion in question took place from 31 December, 2005 until 22 January 2006 with no further changes until 3 March 2006,</li>
<li>the talk page says <b>In private email to me, Jimbo stated that he only originally removed the info pending proper sourcing, and only asked that the name not be re-added to the article while discussion was on-going regarding this issue on this talk page (see the hidden comments at the top of the article itself for Jimbo's request).</b>,</li>
<li>and the talk page has not been edited since 24 January 2006.</li>

<dd>I diagree completely with your evaluation of my behavior and the results of my behavior. Let's focus on the results of my behavior and the results of your behavior. I quietly deleted an out of date message that is out of date by the criteria stated within it and furthermore that is now made unnecessary by the <i>Presumption in favor of privacy</i> section of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a> which applies to all such cases and not merely this one. Blocking editors forevermore from editing this article is surely not your intent. Deleting the lie "unknown" <b>removes</b> the label "original name" leaving the casual reader with <i>no clue</i> the name given was not the original name. Now, your behavior restores the information to the article that there is an original name not given by the article thereby bringing attention to it. Your behavior has dragged this issue to the forefront of many administrators' notice when you could have simply asked me WTF on my talk page. You, Sir, are "starting the controversy up again", not I. <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a> states:</dd>

<p>To the extent she keeps her real name from being noteable, it does not belong in the article by this guideline that did not yet exist when Jimbo typed his note. To the extent she makes it noteable, it does belong. If and when that occurs, I won't be the one to do it because I don't care enough about the issue to learn enough about her name's noteability to be able to make that judgement call. In summary, I have not done what you claim; you yourself have. Can we drop this now?

<p>As <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> strongly denies the allegation put before him, I think there should be no further action taken until all sides have been fairly heard and all evidence and discussion has been seen. Blocking a 'sock' only 4 hours after it was alleged to be one and not giving its supposed user a chance to respond or defend himself strikes me as a very unfair and one-sidedt action, and a breach of admin powers. <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> has had numerous <i>content disputes</i> with Owain and his characterisation of events should be acknowldged to be somewhat one-sided.

<dd><s>I am concerned about Mais oui's intent to have both accounts blocked. Even if it is a true case of sockpuppets don't we usually allow one account to edit if it does so productively? I also wonder in general, if 2 friends both edit wikipedia and have similar interests, what's wrong with that? It is certainly a problem if they coordinate their activities to be intentionally disruptive, how can one fairly distinguish between coordinate disruption and simply a case of similar interests (especially when the editor they are in conflict with pushes for them both to be banned). <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:56, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</s> <b>withdrawn</b> <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:29, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not being involved with the conflict, I think this could certianly be the case. I'm afraid that while I do trust JzG's judgement often, I don't see this as cut and dried as him and Mais oui feel it is. If there was meatpuppeting going on, one vote isn't going to swamp many discussions here on Wikipedia. Both accounts have a long history at Wikipedia, so its not like someone was recruited just for that vote. So, in this administrator's opinion we should unblock MonMan. If there really is disruption planned from some collusion we can always reblock. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 18:11, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"these people are not me". How is that a difference? MonMan is not me either! You should not be talking about above-the-board Wikipedia practices, given that this debate was started because of your unilateral moving of a page and then deliberatedly editing the redirect so it could not simply be moved back. Your derogotary treatment of MonMan is completely without substance - just because he agrees with me and disagrees with you he is categorised as "the MonMan account" and his edits are "only used to back up my agenda". It is also telling that an admin who shares *your* agenda had MonMan blocked within four hours of the initial request, with no evidence requested, in the middle of the night US-time so he could not defend himself. I have offered on my user page to have an admin give us both a telephone call to prove we are different people. If every friend I have is automatically blocked as a sockpuppet or meatpuppet after making so few edits then that is not a very friendly introduction to Wikipedia is it? <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/w/a/User_talk%7EOwain_57ea.html" title="User talk:Owain">talk</a>)</small> 08:15, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I believe it is possible for two people to know each other off wiki and have the same interests without being meat or sockpuppets. However, I am no longer prepared to defend <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> (<a href="../../../o/w/a/User_talk%7EOwain_57ea.html" title="User talk:Owain">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Owain_ae5f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Owain">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonMan_436c.html" title="User:MonMan">MonMan</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/n/User_talk%7EMonMan_eee2.html" title="User talk:MonMan">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MonMan_8e1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/MonMan">contribs</a>). MonMan's first edit back in July, 2005 was to a talk page to support Owain's argument about traditional naming of UK counties <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28places%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18258796" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28places%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18258796" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. Of MonMan's 30-some edits, the only edit to an article that Owain has never edited was to list <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newport.html" title="Newport">Newport</a> as a sister city of <a href="../../../k/u/t/Kutaisi.html" title="Kutaisi">Kutaisi</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kutaisi&amp;diff=28514572&amp;oldid=28126766" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kutaisi&amp;diff=28514572&amp;oldid=28126766" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>.

<p>There is something Pythonesque about having a revert war over the issue of how English counties should properly be named. (I can understand abortion or GWB but come on, people). I also agree with Aquilina (above) that JzG is too involved in the same debate and should have asked for comment before placing the block.

<dd>Had to grin at your Pythonesque comment. What is worse is that the "ABC war" (ABC = Association of British Counties, the common link between people pushing this POV) has been going on for years on Wikipedia. 80.255 started it off, later ably assisted by Owain, and now others. And boy do these guys have stamina. Check out their talk pages archives (and the talk pages for lots of British places) for the number of people who've tried to work with them. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 10:01, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm willing to oppose any block of Owain. If the findings were correct and MonMan was his sock, that sock is indef blocked. There have been several cases where we indef block the master and the puppets and then remove the block on the single account the user wishes to maintain. This would then be the implicit outcome of that: Owain continues as the user's account. If the findings were incorrect, and MonMan was indeed just a friend from the same area then I don't feel that any charges of meatpuppetry or disruption would support more than a short block if even that. If I can point out, <b>neither</b> of these users have a single previous block. I'm willing to give a longstanding editor a surfeit of good faith. Considering that your account is a quarter as old and has a block for 3RR you would even get the benefit of a surfeit of good faith. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 13:18, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have an opinion on MonMan other than what I posted above; someone else will have to determine if my analysis and Essjay's <i>likely</i> supports a permanent block or not. On the issue of Owain I think he should be allowed to contribute so long as he is reasonably good about following the rules. If you believe he is using new sockpuppets to influence debate then bring it to someone's attention. If he has a long-term habit of using multiple accounts that might justify action against the master account. For now it seems to be a first offence. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:05, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Syrthiss, Mais Oui has a block for 3RR only because Owain made tendentious edits to a template (supporting his "traditional counties" agenda) and then complained on AN when they were repeatedly reverted.

<dd>I think the checkuser folks are tired of cleaning up Gastrich puppets. I made a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html#Ferreting_out_Gastrich_Sleeper_Socks" title="WP:RFCU">perfectly reasonable checkuser request</a> that got denied for a bogus reason. Apparently its already been investigated, even though this new batch of socks hasn't been checked for sleepers or non-disruptive (yet) puppets. How do I appeal the declination of a checkuser request?

<dd>There usually is no point; a suspected Gastrich sock is blocked indef. I've only had one I had any question about, and that is Please, do, which is unblocked (by me) less than two hours after blocking. What's the point of running checkuser on the obvious ones?

As all of our members are currently at college campuses, we have unlimited access to IP addresses… [I]f one or more of our members are banned we will just start up new accounts."</p>
<p>They claim to be an anti-vandalism group, but any group who could imagine that I am an anti-Semite is likely to have a pretty odd notion of vandalism.

<dd>MuslimsofUmreka had editted the article to be an incoherent and highly POV discussion of the term itself, rather than of political Islamism as a real-world phenomenon as per the article’s original intent. At no point has he engaged in meaningful discussion, but merely repeats his fundamentalist position, which boils down to 1) all Muslims must be Islamists, or are not true Muslims 2) How dare you call all Muslims (by point 1) Islamists 3) you are all racists [sic.] and have no right to participate in editting this article. No matter what anyone says, he always returns to these points.

Maybe I missed some important nuance in this article, but I can't help feeling that this [word that indicates I'm <i>not</i> assuming good faith towards this person] needs to be made an example of. At the least, I feel Petertdavis (it's a real account) has earned much bad faith by writing, "Thanks for the comments Derrick. I acknowledge your opinion, but don’t agree. Are you an employee of Wikimedia?" Discussion?

<dd>I hate it when I try to assume good faith and get taken for a ride. Though he does misinterpret what I would consider as being an established contributor, "a few good edits" is way below the criteria I would use to evaluate this. All in all, the result of this is that I'm likely to be less tolerant of linkspam in the future. Though I agree with the posts above that he hasn't done anything to deserve a perma ban, I've noted the sites he was spamming and now consider them nuke on sight. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeL_c5a8.html" title="User:GraemeL">GraemeL</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraemeL_c70d.html" title="User talk:GraemeL"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:31, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, Llywrch, you do seem to miss the point of my blog post. You won't find anyone more anti-spam than I am. I spend over an hour every day just dealing with spam on different websites I admin and moderate. Yes, it's often difficult to figure out intent behind links that someone drops. Also, the "Derrick Smith" who commented on that article is <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby131313_edf4.html" title="User:Bobby131313">Bobby131313</a>. GraemeL, yes my comment "a few good edits" is hyperbole, is hyperbole now worse than actual link spammers? How about focusing more on this comment I made "So, the question is, if the information violates copyright, why is Wikipedia linking to it? If the information doesn’t violate copyright, why isn’t the information put into Wikipedia itself? Seems to violate the spirit of Wikipedia"? And, Llywrch, if "Derrick" was trying to have a good faith conversation with me, why did he not use his real name, Bobby? IPs don't lie, but people do. But, the big question really is, are Wikipedia admins going to accept someone dropping dozens of links to their own website, particularly when the content at the end of the link is not original, and there's a question whether it violates copyrights of well established publications? Banning me isn't going to make that issue go away. Peter</dd>

<dd>I still can't get past the fact you first accused Derrick of being a Wikimedia employee well before it occured to you to determine if he was Bobby131313 -- expecially when it's well-known that Wikimedia has practically <b>no</b> paid employees. Even if you meant to ask him whether he was a regular contributor, your question still shows a lack of good faith on your part: you attacked the messenger, not the message. Add to that your interesting usage of "link spammer" in your blog entry, &amp; I have to wonder if you truly understand the point of Wikipedia: how you used those two words alone made me suspicious of the intent of your blog post long before I read your comments. Coming here &amp; stating that I "won't find anyone more anti-spam than I am" doesn't negate what I felt was your message -- that if a spammer wants to gets his links into Wikipedia, the first step is to con one or more Wikipedians to help with this.</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is not a tool to increase sales or link clicks, it's a source of information. If you can do it with a link to a website outside of Wikipedia, I think it's great; but far too many external links have no informational value, &amp; are added just to attract eyeballs. Unfortunately, Wikipedians try to act in good faith because we all make mistakes, &amp; newbies make more than folks who have been around for a while, so folks like GraemeL &amp; myself often leave a questionable edit alone as a token of trust. So when we discover that we've been taken advantage by a link spammer -- as your blog indicates we were or can be -- we're more likely to be a little more suspicious of the next newbie who crosses the line, or a little more frustrated with the experiment that is Wikipedia -- or both. Your blog entry encourages this kind of abuse of trust that we are struggling to create on Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Yes, Llywrch, that's what I'm trying to say. Exactly that. You should be a little (maybe even a LOT) more suspicious of the next newbie who starts off by inserting dozens of links to their own website. That's exactly what I'm saying. While I may be lacking in the protocals of Wikipedia, I have been fighting this sort of thing for years. My blog isn't going to bring more spammers here, they're already here. They're all around. Some are just much more stealthy than others. Regarding my comment about "Derrick" (his real name is Bobby, aka Bobby131313) being a Wikimedia employee, that was sarcasm. I'm sorry if my delivery fell flat on that. I didn't for a minute think he really was. Perhaps I can be accused of trolling, but, just maybe, what I'm saying will bring a greater awareness to the administrators here about the nature of link spammers. And, if I can do that, I am helping you build a great encyclopedia. And, that brings me back to the question I asked before, "if the information violates copyright, why is Wikipedia linking to it? If the information doesn’t violate copyright, why isn’t the information put into Wikipedia itself? Seems to violate the spirit of Wikipedia"? One of the most common types of search engine spam is people who copy content from other sources and republish it as their own work. Wikipedia seems to be particularly vulnerable to this type of manipulation, as at first glance, websites such as the one in my example, are packed full of useful information. It's extremely difficult for the search engines to determine which is the original source of this content, and I don't suppose it's any easier for Wikipedia editors. However, I think it's something important to keep in mind when all of you are considering proper editorial control on external linkage. It's a minefield of a subject. Peter</dd>

<p>I don't understand why this horse continues to be beaten. I have never once said or claimed that the information linked to is original.</p>
<p>I'll explain it again. The coin facts and grading guidelines are taken from the 2005 Redbook (out of print). The facts are mintage numbers, compositions, edge types, and the like. No creative content whatsoever. How can a fact be copyrighted? If Nascar publishes the winner of a race on their site, I can't? It's no different. The grading guidelines are just a list of criteria which are strictly opinions. Again, no creative content. Copyrighted? I think not. The coin histories are used with permission and credit given. They are not even on the original publishers site anymore.</p>

<dd>He whitelists admins. I disagree with the idea of a whitelist, as it creates one more division between haves and have-nots.

<dd>I think SPUI should be whitelisted too. I understand why admins are whitelisted, although I do agree that it sucks that that creates a user/admin divide, but the admin list is a good list of trusted users. But I think that almost any user with a significant list of contributions who gets tagged by the bot when they're doing legitimate work should be whitelisted. If they do something against policy, that can be addressed separately. <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> 08:56, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your response, but I don't see any evidence of an agreement on the talk page. Actually, the user who had orginally added the information decided to remove it because he felt he was being harrassed by user <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManiF_8d90.html" title="User:ManiF">user:ManiF</a>. From my experience dealing with user:Khashayar_Karimi (and he is aligned with ManiF) I can tell you that user:Khashayar_Karimi's edit was based on personal reasons rather than on a supposed consenual agreement on the talk page.--<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 06:24, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is the oddest case I have seen in a long time. Either Rikki Lee Travolta is the greatest actor of his generation or the greatest astroturfer of his generation. All the accounts listed here share very unusual characteristics; they were all opened months ago; their only articles in the main space have been to Rikki's article or to insert information about him into other articles; and they have all suddenly rushed to his defense once the article was nominated for deletion. It doesn't seem to fit the requirements for a checkuser since their participation does not seem likely to change the vote outcome. However they look like rather obvious sock puppets and if someone with more experience thinks this is a good use of Checkuser could you please crosspost it for me? Thanks.</p>

<p>The three accounts have been used to triple vote on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Jedi6_7687.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Jedi6">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Jedi6</a>, as well as to game the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">Three Revert Rule</a> on a number of video-game related articles; additionally, specific IP addresses used by these contributors (and only these contributors, across two separate ISPs) have been used to violate 3RR. Interestingly, within minutes of Doom127's explosion, Jean-Luc Picard shows up to change his vote to oppose as well. I suspect that given sufficient time, The Eye would do the same.</p>
<p>Given that I am involved in the situation, both as the bureaucrat that extended the Jedi RfA, and as an admin warning Doom127 on the disruptive edits to the RfA, I don't feel neutral enough to tag and block the sockpuppets, and take action on Doom127. I strongly encourage an uninvolved admin to look into the matter, tag and block the socks ({{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESockpuppetCheckuser_04be.html" title="Template:SockpuppetCheckuser">SockpuppetCheckuser</a>}} should be used), and consider what to do about Doom127. If the community feels it necessary, I'm willing to raise the issue to Arbitration, and forward my evidence to the AC. Additionally, I'm willing to provide my results to another checkuser if they would like to review my findings. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 09:14, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Think you can make it a permanant block, old chum? After all, that WAS the intention (I've left a little on Cambridge's page regarding the care and feeding of them and the purpose of such). It takes a lot of work to create three sockpuppets AND have them have unnoticed edits for the better part of a month in order to create an account implosion.

As you can see, the fouth edit is a simple blanking of the paragraph objected to, rather than replacing it with the previous version, presumably to avoid a 4th revert?</p>
<p>Anyway, since the user has objected to the block on the grounds that I'm involved in editing the article in question (which I am), I request a review of my action by other admins. I thought it was a fairly open-and-shut case, but I'm open to feedback. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 15:12, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By the book, as GTBacchus wasn't participating in the edit war; rather trying to stop it with discussion on talk pages; I think he was sufficiently removed. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 21:44, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would say that the fourth revert, while not technically a revert, was definitely intended to have the same effect — that of removing the paragraph that Goodandevil objected to. I did wonder at the time about GTBacchus carrying out the block himself rather than reporting it. If there's any admin who can definitely be trusted to be fair to those on the opposing side as well as those on his own side, it's GTBacchus. (I say that as someone who has the opposite POV from his.) Nevertheless, to avoid giving people cause to complain (you blocked <i>this</i> editor and you didn't block <i>that</i> one), I think it's more prudent for us not to carry out blocks on pages or editors we're involved with (except, perhaps, in cases of obvious sockpuppetry). If GTBacchus had reported instead of blocking, I'm sure another admin would have blocked. That said, I fully agree with RoyBoy that he wasn't participating in the edit war, and was therefore not in violation of the blocking policy which says, "sysops must not block editors with whom they are currently engaged in a content dispute." <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 00:27, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, that would preclude keeping them deleted, which was decided above was the best course.

<p>That's just a vandal. The old scripts ran under pseudo accounts that nevertheless weren't actually real accounts. Some vandals are rediscovering the name of these scripts and actually registering user accounts under those names, thus hoping to disguise themselves as the script.

<p>On second thought, I have blocked him indefinitely.

<dd>I am going to revert the block back to a week, due to what Guanaco said about "Wikipedia has gained absolutely nothing from his presence". That disagrees with the statements of most of the editors on the affected article, who say that he has been helpful in making the article NPOV, however he is just too hard to work with. An indef block is not on the table in the ArbCom case either, so I don't think it's justified. Thanks for being willing to deal with these troublesome issues, though. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 04:16, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whether Lou actually did help is questionable, as when he came in other editors were already looking at the article and seeing how it could be made more POV. He's certainly not been in the least bit helpful for weeks. That said, I support reducing the block to one week and leaving this to the ArbCom. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 08:14, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd suggest getting an immediate ip check on BirdsOfFire because if it is indeed a sock (as the patterns appear to be the same and the infrequency of the BirdsOfFire edits seem to suggest) then indef. block...

<dd>Ok, at this point it may be worth it to ask the arbcom to revisit the ruling since Hershcel has repeatedly violated the ruling and has created numerous sockpuppets to try to get around it, though for the love of me I don't see how anyone can be so obsessed about Lyndon Larouche to purposefully violate 5 or 6 major guidelines at a time trying to POV skew the article about him. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 05:47, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is getting absurd. I don't mind spending time or conceding points to get articles right, but it ticks me off when it turns out that other editors are pulling stunts that make the job more difficult or that take advantage of the system. The aggressive POV pushing by HK and (what have turned out to be) his puppets is an abuse consensus and of our open editing. In previous ArbCom cases HK could argue that he aided the project on topics unrelated (or barely-related) to LaRouche, like classical music, but recently he has only worked on LaRouche-related articles. I don't think that anopther ArbCom case is needed - the previous cases included addtional enforcement procedures that we just need to follow. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 06:44, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1. I use one computer only. No one else has access to this computer. It automatically logs on to this screen name, and I never log off this screen name. SlimVirgin's accusations of sockpuppetry are an entirely fraudulent and dishonest vehicle for pushing her POV. As far as IP ranges are concerned, I access the internet from an AOL account in the Los Angeles area; there may well be a few dozen other Wikipedia editors who are using these IP ranges as you read this post.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know what the IP addresses are, but I'm guessing they're the same ones that were identified during LaRouche 2 that seemed to have been used by you and at least one of the other LaRouche accounts. In my view, it's more than a cooincidence that another person using AOL in Los Angeles uses the same two IP ranges, edits the same articles from the same LaRouche POV, and even though he hasn't edited in days is there within hours to revert to your version after you ask him to on his talk page. Of course, that doesn't mean you're necessarily the same person; it could be another member of the LaRouche movement that you use as a back-up, but that counts as sockpuppetry for the purposes of LaRouche 2. I don't see what difference it makes, in terms of your probation, whether you're physically making LaRouche edits or asking someone else to. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:00, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have made accusations of sockpuppetry, and yet you "don't know what the IP addresses are"; you're "guessing." I would like Jayjg to come forward and reveal the IP addresses involved, in order to take the guesswork out of this. But then you say that it doesn't really matter, that BirdsOfFire is a "member of the LaRouche movement" anyway. Well, he says he isn't on his talk page, and you routinely brand anyone that gets in your a way a "LaRouche activist." You say that I "asked BirdsOfFire to make the edits instead"; my words on his talk page were "I wanted to call your attention to another article, <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synarchism.html" title="Synarchism">Synarchism</a>, which the Berlet crowd is attempting to convert into a soapbox." Since we are talking about further admin sanctions against my editing, I think that you ought to have the decency to come up with some real evidence, instead of a bunch of half-truths.--<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky"><font color="darkred"><font face="georgia">HK</font></font></a> 23:45, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2. The article <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synarchism.html" title="Synarchism">Synarchism</a> has not historically been regarded as a "LaRouche article"; it does not appear on the "LaRouche template," and I did not add material about LaRouche to this article. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">User:172</a>, in collusion with <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">User:Will Beback</a>, began adding <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, in the form of gratuitous and irrelevant misrepresentations of LaRouche's ideas, to the article, and I objected. SlimVirgin and her cohorts designate articles as "LaRouche related" at their pleasure, just as they designate any editor who questions her tactics as a "LaRouche activist" (as SlimVirgin did BirdsOfFire in this instance, or as Will Beback designated <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">User:Northmeister</a> after that user disagreed with him on the talk page of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_%28economics%29_67c0.html" title="American System (economics)">American System (economics)</a>.)</p>

<p>3. Likewise, re-setting my ban for yet another year, based on spurious charges of sockpuppetry, should be regarded as an example of SlimVirgin's underhanded <i>Nacht und Nebel</i> tactics at their worst. I will emphasize in closing that SlimVirgin and Will Beback are not disinterested Wikipedia admins, merely trying to bring order and make the trains of Wikipedia run on time. They are both impassioned anti-LaRouche activists. One of SlimVirgin's first interventions into Wikipedia was the creation of the attack article <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremiah_Duggan_90f8.html" title="Jeremiah Duggan">Jeremiah Duggan</a>, which is basically a mirror for the <a href="http://www.justiceforjeremiah.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.justiceforjeremiah.com/" rel="nofollow">Justice for Jeremiah website</a>, created by Chip Berlet and the usual gang. Will Beback obsessively compiles lists (see <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_LaRouche_topics_838c.html" title="User:Will Beback/LaRouche topics">User:Will Beback/LaRouche topics</a>) of every article ever edited by myself, or by other editors that he has designated as "LaRouche editors." The two of them constantly compare notes, and they are generally comically misinformed about the objects of their vendetta (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46288338" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46288338" rel="nofollow">this example</a>.)The actions taken against me by these two, under color of enforcing ArbCom decisions, are POV warfare, scantily disguised as administrative action. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky"><font color="darkred"><font face="georgia">HK</font></font></a> 20:43, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You've tried many times to tar me with the label "anti-LaRouche activist." If that were true, I'd have rushed to the LaRouche pages to delete your pro-LaRouche edits as soon as you were banned, but in fact I've hardly looked at them. My interest is only in making sure you don't introduce even more POV, and that you abide by the terms of the arbcom rulings. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:05, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Your job is to bite the newcomers, bullying them and threatening to ban them (or simply banning them outright, as you did BirdsOfFire,) combined with frequent reverts with no edit summaries. Will Beback wikistalks and harasses anyone who objects. However, your credentials as an anti-LaRouche activist were already established in your first month at Wikipedia, when you authored the attack article <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremiah_Duggan_90f8.html" title="Jeremiah Duggan">Jeremiah Duggan</a>.

In summary, Herschelkrustofsky is accusing Cberlet and me of 'defamation' of Lyndon LaRouche, SlimVirgin of writing bad-faith "attack artilce" related to the tragic death of <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremiah_Duggan_90f8.html" title="Jeremiah Duggan">Jeremiah Duggan</a>, and Will Beback of "wikistalking." The attacks violate Herschelkrustofsky's arbcom probation stemming from the Nobs and others decision. According to the most recent arbcom ruling, if Herschelkrustofsky is disrupting the functioning of Wikipedia by making the personal attacks such as the ones posted above, admins are supposed to note the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Herschelkrustofsky is placed indefinitely on Wikipedia:Probation. If in the opinion of any three administrators, for good cause, he is responsible for disrupting the functioning of Wikipedia, restrictions may be placed on his editing, up to and including a general ban of one year. Each restriction imposed shall be documented and explained in a section at the bottom of Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Nobs01 and others. Should any period of one year pass without any such restriction being imposed, Herschelkrustofsky's probation shall automatically end.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Arbcom rulings are meaningless unless admins enforce them. If Herschelkrustofsky is causing disruption on the administrators' noticeboard, the arbcom instructs admins to block him for up to one year for disregarding his probation. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 02:15, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would like to request a review (by unbiased, third party administrators) of SlimVirgin's actions in blocking me and re-setting the one year ban. BirdsOfFire is not my sockpuppet, and I would like to see some sort of evidence that would justify SlimVirgin's actions, other than her own POV agenda. I would likewise like to request a review of Will Beback's actions in blocking me and re-setting my ban on September 30 of 2005, after he had initiated an edit war at the article <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_%28economics%29_67c0.html" title="American System (economics)">American System (economics)</a>. I had not added material on LaRouche or his ideas to this article since the time of the first LaRouche Arbcom decision, although other editors (including Will Beback) have subsequently done so. Will Beback professes to hold the singular point of view that the entire school of economic thought known as the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_%28economics%29_67c0.html" title="American System (economics)">American System</a> is a "LaRouche concept" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dirigisme&amp;diff=43950680&amp;oldid=43947118" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dirigisme&amp;diff=43950680&amp;oldid=43947118" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>. Will abused his admin powers by misrepresenting my edits to this article; he insisted that a reference to the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centennial_Exposition_0807.html" title="Centennial Exposition">Centennial Exposition</a> represented "material which relates to Lyndon LaRouche," a fanciful theory which I regard as an entirely illegitimate reading of the ArbCom decision. Since Will re-set my one year ban in September of last year on the basis of this theory, other editors have begun working on this article, and the section which was disputed by Will Beback has been restored, not by myself, but by consensus of those editing the article<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_System_%28economics%29#Republican_Party_implements_the_American_System" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_System_%28economics%29#Republican_Party_implements_the_American_System" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky"><font color="darkred"><font face="georgia">HK</font></font></a> 00:40, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>HK, you have pushed an unusual POV into several articles recently in a disruptive manner, exactly the behavior for which you have been thrice-chastened by the ArbCom. Lyndon LaRouche has eclectic interests, and <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_LaRouche_topics_838c.html" title="User:Will Beback/LaRouche topics">so many articles</a> are involved that it would be ineffective to block each individually. Therefore, rather than blocking a small number of articles for a long period, I think that a shorter general ban is more apt. The ArbCom has asked any three admins to agree to parole enforcements, and authorizes bans of up to a year. In this instance I propose a general ban of one month. The community has decided repeatedly that it is not going to promulgate ideosyncratic ideologies on the same basis as common wisdom. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:50, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Will Beback is now charging me with having "pushed an unusual POV in a disruptive manner." Even if this accusation were warranted (and made in good faith,) I believe that I would still be within my rights to ask that these accusations be examined by neutral administrators who are not party to the long-standing conflict between myself and SlimVirgin/Will Beback. I contend that these two are attempting to misuse the arbcom rulings as a tactic in POV pushing; if these accusations against me were coming from other admins with no ideological axe to grind, they would carry considerably greater weight. SlimVirgin/Will Beback are attempting to establish a tautology whereby I am designated a "LaRouche editor," therefore any article I edit becomes "LaRouche related" (this is the essential basis for Will Beback's <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_LaRouche_topics_838c.html" title="User:Will Beback/LaRouche topics">list</a>,) and consequently any edit that I make violates the arbcom rulings, <i>ipso facto</i>. Any editor who agrees with me then becomes a "meat puppet," and may be banned by SlimVirgin without warning or explanation. I hope that there are some admins reading this who can see how harmful to Wikipedia it can be, if these tactics by SlimVirgin/Will Beback go unchallenged. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky"><font color="darkred"><font face="georgia">HK</font></font></a> 15:22, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're a self-confessed LaRouche activist, and have been for, as I recall, 30 years or so. You're on indefinite probation and banned from editing LaRouche pages or making pro-LaRouche edits. You have continued to do so from time to time, ignoring that ruling. After repeatedly reverting criticism of LaRouche at <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synarchism.html" title="Synarchism">Synarchism</a>, I reminded you of the ruling and asked you to stop editing that article. Note: I asked you to stop; I didn't block you. You responded by asking another LaRouche editor (who has made only 62 edits to the encyclopedia, most of them LaRouche-related), and who edits from within the same two IP ranges as you, to revert on your behalf, which he did, though he'd never edited that page before. You must have known this was a violation of the spirit of the ruling, yet you felt confident about doing it, because in fact the LaRouche rulings have not been strictly enforced against you. In addition, the other editor hadn't edited in days, yet was able to revert for you within hours of your request. You were therefore blocked for three days (though it could have been much longer) and had your ban reset. You returned from that block making personal attacks and allegations of corruption, as you do at every available opportunity. Now you're wondering why you're being accused of disruption.</dd>

<dd>If you really want to settle down and become a decent editor, the simple solution is to stay away from any article (or part thereof) that deals with LaRouche or his ideas, and stop making personal attacks.

<dd>Again, accusations made against me by SlimVirgin and Will Beback should be evaluated in light of their shared and strongly held POV. Both of them have now sought out opportunities to block me and re-set my one year ban, on grounds which I do not believe can stand up to scrutiny by neutral administrators. However, <i>no other admin</i> has found fault with my editing. I have not received so much as a complaint, let alone a warning, from anyone other than SlimVirgin and Will Beback, since the LaRouche 2 arbcom decision. In the "Nobs01 and others" decision which they cite, there was no finding of fact against me. And, I am not alone in alleging that these two have abused their admin powers to further a POV-pushing agenda. There have been numerous other complaints against these two; see, for example, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_SlimVirgin2_1b0e.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/SlimVirgin2">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/SlimVirgin2</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Cberlet_&amp;_Willmcw" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Cberlet_&amp;_Willmcw" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Cberlet &amp; Willmcw</a> (Willmcw being another user name previously used by Will Beback,) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-02-17_Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche‎" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-02-17_Talk:Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche‎" rel="nofollow">WikipediaWikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-02-17_Talk:Political views of Lyndon LaRouche</a>, or <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_investigation_Archives_2006_03_44b6.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for investigation/Archives/2006/03">Wikipedia:Requests for investigation/Archives/2006/03</a>.

<dd>Far from having "sought out opportunities to block" you, this is, I believe, the first time I've done so since the case against you 15 months ago. As for your having "not received so much as a complaint" from anyone other than Will and me, it was in fact 172 who asked me to look at your activities at <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synarchism.html" title="Synarchism">Synarchism</a>, and apart from Will and me, people who have complained to the arbcom about you, resulting each time in remedies against you, have been Snowspinner, Cberlet, Adam Carr, AndyL, and John Kenney, all good editors. In Nobs01 and others, you were placed on indefinite probation, which sounds to me as though the arbcom is tired of seeing the same behavior from you, so for you to conclude that you have "not received so much as a complaint" from anyone other than Will and me is a little misleading. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:47, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My reference to complaints was with respect to other admins; the arbcom rulings that pertain to me are administered by administrators, not Wikipedia editors in general. My understanding is that 172 agreed to cease functioning as an admin after the second arbitration case against him. Snowspinner initiated the 2nd LaRouche case, but I have not heard from him since that time, and if you will take a look at my post above, what I wrote was "However, <i>no other admin</i> has found fault with my editing. I have not received so much as a complaint, let alone a warning, from anyone other than SlimVirgin and Will Beback, since the LaRouche 2 arbcom decision."

The reason a small number of admins are dealing with you is that we're the ones who are familar with your editing pattern. As I said above, the full-proof way to avoid attention is to stop making personal attacks and to stay away from pages that deal with Lyndon LaRouche and his ideas. We have over one million articles, so that shouldn't be so hard. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:11, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The moment I edit any article, it goes on Will's list of "LaRouche-related articles." I don't recall why Snowspinner re-set my ban, but in the case of Will Beback, it was re-set because of an edit dispute at <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_%28economics%29_67c0.html" title="American System (economics)">American System (economics)</a> that had nothing to do with LaRouche. Will Beback and 172 have both adopted the tactic of crying "LaRouche!" whenever one or the other disagrees with me (see <a href="../../../p/r/i/Talk%7EPrivatization_f93b.html" title="Talk:Privatization">Talk:Privatization</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-Defamation_League_f6f5.html" title="Talk:Anti-Defamation League">Talk:Anti-Defamation League</a>.) In your case, you re-set my ban because of an edit made by <i>another</i> editor, who you then claimed, without proof, was my sockpuppet. I would like this whole business reviewed by a neutral third party. If I were as "disruptive" as you and Will Beback claim, I am certain that other admins would have noticed, regardless of whether they were "familiar with my editing patterns." --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky"><font color="darkred"><font face="georgia">HK</font></font></a> 00:42, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, the list of LaRouche related topics is not the same as your edit contributions. The number of redlinks alone should make that clear. It is no coincidence that virtually all of your edits are to topics related to LaRouche. Adding LaRouche theories to unrelated Wikipedia articles is not permitted, but you have persisted in doing so in an disruptive manner. The linkage between Lyndon LaRouche and the American System is well-known, and the particular theory you were adding can be referenced only from LaRouche sources. You have never shown contrition or admitted any wrongdoing in your three ArbCom cases, and it has become characteristic for you to protest your innocence and claim a conspiracy against you. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 00:57, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I keep saying, the way to ensure that Will has nothing else to add to his page of your LaRouche-related edits is not to make any. Don't edit LaRouche pages, or pages about LaRouche-related ideas, or any sentence or paragraph about LaRouche on an unrelated page. And don't encourage other editors to do it for you. Then you'll be abiding by the terms of the three rulings against you: LaRouche 1, LaRouche 2, and the Nobs01 probation. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:49, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

My response, there as well as here, is to say the following: "Please note that until some evidence of sockpuppetry is presented, there is not much to which I may respond." Allow me to reiterate that I am asking a neutral admin to take a look, also, at the decision by Willmcw/Will Beback, back in September, to re-set my ban, based on the theory that a reference to the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centennial_Exposition_0807.html" title="Centennial Exposition">Centennial Exposition</a> is somehow "promotion of LaRouche." The instructions at the top of this page indicate that this is an appropriate location to complain about the conduct of admins. Note also that although SlimVirgin has twice claimed in this discussion that I asked BirdsOfFire to revert specific edits, you can see for yourself on his talk page that I said only that I wished to call the article <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synarchism.html" title="Synarchism">Synarchism</a> to his attention. The idea that he then became my "meatpuppet" is highly speculative and a reflection of SlimVirgin's relentless POV pushing. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky"><font color="darkred"><font face="georgia">HK</font></font></a> 00:34, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You asked for a neutral admin to look at the block and resetting of the ban. A neutral admin looked at it, and agrees it was done correctly. Now you're arguing with the neutral admin. It's also disingenuous of you to deny that you posted to the BirdsOfFire account page that the account should revert to your version at <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synarchism.html" title="Synarchism">Synarchism</a>. Clearly, by saying you wanted to "call it to his attention," you were not asking him to revert against you. The arbcom ruling is clear: any account making the same pattern of edits as you, and judged by admins to be a sockpuppet of yours, should be blocked indefinitely. We don't need technical evidence. But in addition, that account and yours both edit from the same two IP ranges. It's therefore not clear to me what evidence you're asking to see. You know what IP ranges you edit from. So whatever they are, BirdsOfFire edits from the same ones. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:45, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe that SlimVirgin and Will Beback have adopted an impermissably broad interpretation of the Arbcom decision known as "Nobs01 and others". This decision names Cognition and myself as "LaRouche editors"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Nobs01_and_others#Modify_Lyndon_LaRouch_2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Nobs01_and_others#Modify_Lyndon_LaRouch_2" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>; no other parties are named, and SlimVirgin and Will Beback have arrogated to themselves the authority to apply this ruling to other editors, as an excuse to apply administrative sanctions during edit disputes. At <a href="../../../l/a/r/Talk%7ELaRouche_Movement_dfbd.html" title="Talk:LaRouche Movement">Talk:LaRouche Movement</a>, BirdsOfFire posted the following comment: "I have looked over a number of the LaRouche articles on Wikipedia. It seems that there are more of them than necessary. It also seems that they are dominated by a small number of editors, who have something of a jihad against LaRouche. These editors seem to have done a bit of bullying toward newcomers. I think that those of you who belong to this group should have the best interests of Wikipedia at heart and allow these articles to become a bit more neutral. LaRouche is controversial and a bit of a weirdo -- just quote him, let his words speak for themselves, don't feel that you have to strengthen your case by a lot of theorizing and speculation about what he really means." To extrapolate from this that he is a "LaRouche activist" seems like a stretch; even if it could be demonstrated that BirdsOfFire is a "LaRouche activist," which he says he is not, the ArbCom decisions do not authorize SlimVirgin to block him. SlimVirgin and Will Beback have also threatened to use similar tactics against <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">User:Northmeister</a>.--<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky"><font color="darkred"><font face="georgia">HK</font></font></a> 22:38, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BirdsOfFire made 62 edits to articles, at least 45 of which were pro-LaRouche (and some of those on unrelated pages may have been too, but I haven't checked), and he made 27 edits to talk, all of which were pro-LaRouche. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:54, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This provides the interested bystander with another glimpse into SlimVirgin's POV agenda. By her reasoning, such things as asking for verifiable sources at LaRouche articles, or posting the POV dispute tag, are classified as "pro-LaRouche edits." These articles are full of speculation and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>; to ask that they be cleaned up is not "pro-LaRouche," it's just responsible editing (here is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Synarchism&amp;diff=46258430&amp;oldid=46242872" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Synarchism&amp;diff=46258430&amp;oldid=46242872" rel="nofollow">edit that got BirdsOfFire permanently blocked</a>.)

<p>On March 29, <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/l/User_talk%7EMolobo_b658.html" title="User talk:Molobo">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Molobo_6356.html" title="Special:Contributions/Molobo">contribs</a>) was blocked for a week for his umpteenth 3RR violation. Since that time he's carried on a huge amount of edit wars across a number of articles, not violating 3RR in any one of them, but coming close and certainly violating the spirit of if (which is to stop disruptive edit wars) by doing it on such a wide scale. As a result, I've taken the possibly unusual step of blocking him for a month again for what I see as <i>very</i> egregious and disruptive conduct, and, while that is up for review, I suggest that we consider a more permanent block. Note that I haven't blocked his most frequent counterpart in the edit war, <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESciurin%C3%A6_d3c6.html" title="User:Sciurinæ">Sciurinæ</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/i/User_talk%7ESciurin%C3%A6_4277.html" title="User talk:Sciurinæ">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sciurin%C3%A6_cff9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sciurinæ">contribs</a>), despite similar disruption, mostly because I don't have the energy to look at it after compiling all this (so some other admin probably should). This block on Molobo was prompted by the following.

<dd>I'm concerned that you've implemented such a long block on the user for violating the spirit (and not the letter) of 3RR, but not on his sparring partner, who, from what you say, is guilty of the same. I think that when one interprets 3RR in such a drastic way, one should take great care to make sure it is applied fairly. <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppleseed_fd91.html" title="User:Appleseed">Appleseed</a> (<a href="../../../a/p/p/User_talk%7EAppleseed_0476.html" title="User talk:Appleseed">Talk</a>) 17:53, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There are several contentious issues regarding their places of birth/residence and/or nationality, including the infamous Gdanzsikg Gdilemma. In all cases Molobo has repeatedly trivialized the issues, usually by inserting an unequivocal designation of "Polish" somewhere, even when doing so is misleading, inaccurate, biased, or goes against established consensus or explicit warnings against POV pushing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicolaus_Copernicus&amp;diff=46004508&amp;oldid=46002625" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicolaus_Copernicus&amp;diff=46004508&amp;oldid=46002625" rel="nofollow">This</a> is a typical edit; note that the article already contained a nuanced discussion of the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolaus_Copernicus_4033.html#Historical_background_to_the_question_of_Copernicus.27_nationality" title="Nicolaus Copernicus">historical background to the question of Copernicus' nationality</a> when Molobo made that edit. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Johannes_Hevelius&amp;diff=44885118&amp;oldid=44861932" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Johannes_Hevelius&amp;diff=44885118&amp;oldid=44861932" rel="nofollow">This edit</a> illustrates the same problem. Moreover, Molobo insists on phrasing the debate in terms of verifiability and citing sources, usually referring to the Encyclopedia Britannica to back him up, when the real problem is a fundamental inability or unwillingness to understand and follow the NPOV policy. This smacks of trollish rules-lawyering, and the way things have been going further NPOV and 3RR violations seem inevitable. While an indefinite block could stop all of this, a community imposed editing ban on Poland-related topics, broadly construed, might be sufficient. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 07:11, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Complete support on the block, this was long overdue. I had negative experiences with this user pretty much since he started editing on Wikipedia. I especially dislike his twisting of historical facts and/or Wikpedia guidelines to support his position, and his edit warring, ignoring any kind of majority unless it is his kind of majority.

Although <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">User:Piotrus</a> attempts to represent Molobo as a valuable contributor and has gone to wheel warring because of that, everyone editing Eastern European topics knows Molobo for a ram weapon to spread nationalism and divisive comments all over Wikipedia.

<p>Although I still think that Molobo is not as evil as many attempt to paint him, and that such a long block should be taken before the ArbCom, in the face of the apparently overwhelming condemnation of his actions by the community, and the apparent consensus that a long block is justified here, I will not dispute this block. Nonetheless I have one question: it takes two to have any revert war: are Molobo's opponents all innocent?--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 17:24, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A month block seems fair on Molobo. Many of Molobo's frequent opponents are frequent only because they know his character and follow him around. Molobo perhaps understandably feels victimized and paranoid that his views are being suppressed, and is at the point where he probably feels he has nothing to lose. Molobo is not a bad contributor when he refrains from POV pushing. Perhaps a month would be the a ban of the kind of severity Molobo needs to calm down and reassess his own behaviour. A Permaban is very severe, and I doubt it would do much good, as he would undoubtedly come back with a new identity. - <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 17:35, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This block should have been expected all along as well as Piotrus' followup comment that this should have beed done via ArbCom and otherwise unfair. The ideal world solution would be an ArbCom ruling that would have allowed this user to create content (not an outright ban from Wikipedia) but stripped him of his trolling tools, of which the main are:</p>
<ul>
<li>revert warring</li>
<li>pasting (from outside sites to Wikipedia and from one article into another)</li>
<li>blanking (fragments or images he doesn't like).</li>
</ul>
<p>Prohibited to blank and paste and with the right to revert in Poland related articles restricted to one per day or per week (excluding reversion of simple vandalism) all the values of this "valuable contributor" (as he was called by some who used him as a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battering_ram.html" title="Battering ram">battering ram</a> to advance the "right POV") would still be here but the disruptions would go.</p>
<p>As we all know, that ArbCom submission is complex and time consuming. I once submitted to ArbCom a case against one arch-Troll and it took the Committee about two or three <b>months</b> to rule on an open-and-shut case (with a ruling more severe than I actually requested, btw). The bottom line is that the ArbCom is slow and should be alleviated from plain obvious cases of the user's abuse. The admin discretion should be allowed as it is and the user here is not blocked on the Admin's whim but after a clear pattern of egiting abuse. If he is reformed in a month, good for him and all of us. If he uses this time to write some articles (even within his eternal agenda about wrongs perpetuated against Poles by Russians and Germans) and posts them upon return, this is just as well. While it is regrettable that he comes to WP with the sole intent to pursue such a narrow and divisive agenda, this is a legitimate agenda if he doesn't troll.</p>
<p>Having said that, if I see him back in a month (or in two weeks or whatever should his block gets shortened) back trolling in the full throttle, I <i>will</i> set aside several hours to write an ArbCom case. This needs to be put an end to. If he returns as a <i>contrubutor</i> (rather than a troll) even exclusively to divisive topics, I will welcome that. He, by no means, was the worse of the worst: usually reasonably civil, rarely but sometimes reasonable, just hysterical. So, for now, I say a month long break is what he and we all need. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 21:41, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Although it is clear that a month chill out for Molobo will be benefitial, I strongly oppose an indefinete block of him - as is shown above, there is no consensus for a perm block.

<dd>First of all, it's <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArights_a88a.html" title="User:Arights">User:Arights</a>, not Alrights. Secondly, unless I'm missing something, and I've re-read this several times, this user never said they used sockpuppets in that post; on the contrary, the post says that the person he's complaining about is using sockpuppets, not him. Third, while it's generally considered "uncool", there's nothing specifically wrong with using sockpuppets, unless they're being used to subvert Wiki policy. Fourth and finally, the grievance that <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArights_a88a.html" title="User:Arights">User:Arights</a> mentions in that dif you've provided seems like it is possibly legitimate (though I've done no serious investigation into the matter and so cannot comment on the veracity of any claims made there) and may be more worthy of admin attention than this, the very claim which brought the link to AN/I in the first place.

<dd>I agree that they don't <i>need</i> to use the template or policy. However, if they did choose to slap a WP:OFFICE template on an article, it would serve to emphasize that they were acting in their roles as Wikimedia Board members rather than as regular admins.</dd>
<dd>While most of our admins are bright enough not to undo Jimbo's adminnish actions without discussion and a really good reason, we've probably got a substantial population of admins (particularly newer ones) who might not recognize other members of the Board without prompting. Although wheel-warring is always to be discouraged, tangling with the Board (and the Board's associated legal rights and responsibilities) is really frowned upon. If a WP:OFFICE template could avert such a conflict, I don't see the harm in it being used even if it is not strictly necessary. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 22:35, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This originally started back in January when I removed material which I believed to be unsourced; Vorash subsequently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=34527627&amp;oldid=34382496" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=34527627&amp;oldid=34382496" rel="nofollow">reverted</a>, and continued to do so after that (see, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=35560896&amp;oldid=35168141" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=35560896&amp;oldid=35168141" rel="nofollow">[160]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=35811429&amp;oldid=35697317" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=35811429&amp;oldid=35697317" rel="nofollow">[161]</a>). I dropped the issue after I noticed some websites included within the article's references section, but upon closer investigation they do not support the material that Vorash insists on reinserting time after time. He has also reverted without edit summaries and marks reverts as "minor" edits, despite being requested not to do so. As can be read at <a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVorash_e7ef.html" title="User talk:Vorash">user talk:Vorash</a>, I referred him to the appropriate policy and guideline pages, and his response was to call my message "bullshit" and accuse me of vandalising the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AVorash&amp;diff=35816657&amp;oldid=35589472" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AVorash&amp;diff=35816657&amp;oldid=35589472" rel="nofollow">[162]</a>; he continues to refer to me as a "vandal" in his edit summaries even though I have asked him not to.</p>
<p>I know that this isn't the place to report content disputes, but this has gone beyond that; it's a case of a stubborn and unresponsive user performing blind reverts to a weeks-old version of an article which border on vandalism, and this can all be seen in the page's edit history (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=39686378&amp;oldid=39608623" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=39686378&amp;oldid=39608623" rel="nofollow">[163]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=47577851&amp;oldid=47576495" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=47577851&amp;oldid=47576495" rel="nofollow">[164]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=47725610&amp;oldid=47580318" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=47725610&amp;oldid=47580318" rel="nofollow">[165]</a>, and most recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=48087113&amp;oldid=48003288" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=48087113&amp;oldid=48003288" rel="nofollow">[166]</a>). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=36082148&amp;oldid=36002808" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=36082148&amp;oldid=36002808" rel="nofollow">This revert</a>, for example, re-introduced a factual inaccuracy into the article which had been previously removed (and was only spotted again today).

<li>A week seems a little steep for the 24.2 guy; usually I try 48 hours before I hit 'em with a week (at least for IP edits). On the other hand, for registered users, if they've contributed nothing but vandalism like this guy has, I just block them indefinitely. So I guess I'm drawing some kind of distinction that might not quite make sense. For the third guy, blocking for one silly-ass joke seems excessive. First guy's kinda the same category as the second. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 21:27, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>All right, I am reducing the block length of both of them to 48 hours. In case of the third user, I have already unblocked him; I immediately realized that I had been a bit too trigger-happy. - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 22:34, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
