<p>Wikipedia is loosing good people all the time - they leave or disengage from particular articles because of an increasingly uncivil enviornment, or they determine to stay and "fight it out," adopting a hostile approach, and reinforcing the vicious cycle. Constant low-grade incivility is corrosive, and it is disruptive. If we let it continue, we end up with an enviornment where it is the norm. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 22:36, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you completely. As leaders, I think Admins should be the first to be cited for incivility, even if that means that their powers get taken away. They are supposed to be setting an example, and they so far seem to be setting a bad one. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomarin_f0a3.html" title="User:Romarin"><i>rom</i></a><font color="green"><i><b>a</b></i></font><a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomarin_f0a3.html" title="User:Romarin"><i>rin</i></a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/m/User_talk%7ERomarin_fbee.html" title="User talk:Romarin">[<i>talk</i> ]</a></small> 22:43, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why don't you tell us why Alienus's behaviour doesn't deserve a block instead of screaming about admin abuse? His behaviour is the real topic here, and I've yet to see it defended. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 22:54, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So if Alienus were an admin you'd say he needed to be blocked? or just de-sysoped? I support the block, if that wasn't clear. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 22:52, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the point is that if Alienus were an admin he would not be blocked. Admins seem to be given cart blanche for being uncivil with impunity. The double standard is most clear in this case since all Al did was refer to someone as an "edit warrior?!" I have see countless times where even admins refer to "regular" editors in exactly that manner with not a peep out of anyone about its not being civil. Clearly Al is being singled out, targeted in a manner that is not based upon equal standards. This is another example of admin abuse having the effect of driving out the critical editors, who are among the best and brightest. Many admins seem to have formed something of a club, like some corrupt police unit. The prison vs. guard analogy is a particularly disturbing insight into the kind of mentality we are dealing with here. My opinion of admins has been going down fast (there are a few good ones), and this is just another nail on the coffin of the admin system. Why are so many admins of such low quality? If this perpetuates itself, Wikipedia is in trouble unless it gets rid of admins, or seriously checks their abusive pratices, throws out those who have shown to be terrible examples of the ideals of an ideal wikipedian.<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.121.40.153.html" title="User:64.121.40.153">64.121.40.153</a> 08:04, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, a block that was never valid in the first place, based on a false and unproven claim. That my comment above, a single edit not in an article, while I abided by the the falseblock--to be used to justify another week block is such an ugly blotch on any notion of justice that my unblock notice was answered affirmatively and reversed. Your obsession with me, motivated by your POV disputes is quite transparent, even if you manage to convince others to do your dirty work to prevent me from editing, or undermining my contributions to important issues such as the above. Attacking the editor never will the the same as attacking their argument as much as you try to confuse the two objectives.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 10:45, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suggest that those people concerned with Alienus' approach to editing open an RfC or ArbCom case. This block/unblock cycle is neither fair to the user nor helpful to the project. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 22:48, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The problem with trigger happy admins is that they are more likely to pull the trigger on people they disagree with, or have personal issues with. This block is such a case. <a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_807e.html" title="User:^^James^^">^^James^^</a> 22:50, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>fiddlesticks. Alienus has been warned about behaviour like this <a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlienus_286a.html#Glad_you_are_not_me" title="User talk:Alienus">User_talk:Alienus#Glad_you_are_not_me</a> and this <a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlienus_286a.html#To_what_do_I_owe..." title="User talk:Alienus">User_talk:Alienus#To what do I owe...</a> neither of which, I note, involve any of the admins involved in warning him in the past, in fact GTBacchus was one of his defenders in the past. You're being quite disingenious trying to paint this as some sort of big bad admin conspiracy. The guy is uncivil, he's been warned, he's not stopping and I think it's time that you all (James and Romarin) stopped too because you're way off the mark. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 22:54, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lar, regarding the posts you cite, the first is obviously a joke. And in the second, GTBacchus calls Alienus a dick! And you have the nerve to call me disingenious (see <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>). It seems any accusation will do, no matter how insubstantial. Throw enough mud and some of it is sure to stick. And please refrain from invoking the word conspiracy, as it is usually used pejoratively to tar opponents as tin foil hat wearing loons.

<p>Thank you, pschemp. This is precisely what I'm talking about. Admins can't even control themselves while discussing a case of alleged incivility! And yet Alienus gets blocked for three days for referring to someone as an "edit warrior"?! It's ridiculous.

<dd>Sorry, pschemp, but that's just not going to fly. You state above "nonsense begets nonsense". Thus, you are implying that every time <i>you</i> start spouting nonsense, it is because <i>someone else</i> did first. And calling the concerns of editors "nonsense" is not exactly civil. Just because you don't agree with these concerns <i>does not</i> make them nonsense, and it is quite disingenuous to suggest that those of us who question you are being absurd. If you have actually "given up trying to explain things logically", maybe you should let this one go and allow other editors and admins to take over.

<dd>Al and I have clashed in the past — like others he disageed with I was accused of having a bias for trying to achieve NPOV. (One of Al's inabilities is to understand that his edits are can be less neutral than he himself thinks. But then we all have that failing in some form or other. It can be a particular problem with Al.) I agreed with him however (much to Al's shock!) that Tony's behaviour towards him was prevocative and unnecessarily confrontational. Al can be tactless, while believing that he is being tactful, and provocative while believing that he is being the exact opposite. In this case, having read the comments that led to the block, my reaction is to think that, taken in isolation, they would not warrant a block. However taken in the context of numerous other comments over a long period, and past warnings to stop, a block is understandable. He does push it a bit and a block, unfortunately, was in my opinion only a matter of time. I would hope that Al might get the message and reign in his tendency to preach and judge. We all do it from time to time (I'm waving both hands in the air at this stage. I know I do it). Al tends to be his own worst enemy. There is however a distinction between someone trying to provoke and offend for negative reasons, and those who do it out of a genuine and well motivated belief that they are doing the "right thing". Al is IMHO one of the latter. He needs to ease off on the attack comments. If he does this block, I hope, will be a once-off and not something constantly to be repeated. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 21:42, 3 July 2006 (UTC) 04:28, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't aware of the scale of that. That puts a different complexion in things. I created a template recently that covers a user with multiple blocks called {{<a href="../../../b/l/o/Template%7EBlocknumbers_c62f.html" title="Template:Blocknumbers">blocknumbers</a>}}. In it admins can fill out details of the number of past blocks and warnings a user has, the length of the most recent block and an explanation of the general context if required. It can be placed on the page of someone who is being blocked regularly so that other admins, in dealing with their behaviour, knows at a glance the stats, rather than having to go through their talk page and archives to see what their past behaviour was like. Perhaps you should put the template on Al's talk page so that the context is clear for everyone to see. It also has had the benefit of bringing home to perpetual offenders who may be in denial as to their behaviour just how many warnings and blocks they have received. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 04:49, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please review Al's blocks and you will see that the case is not as clear as Will Beback would have it. Also <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a>'s prison analogy is far more worrying that he realises - see read the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_Prison_Experiment_65eb.html" title="Stanford Prison Experiment">Stanford Prison Experiment</a> to see how the situation we have here can go very very wrong. The truth is that admins are <i>very</i> reluctant to block each other and unpopular editors get blocks for the same actions that admins cheerfully get away with (see my previous post). If you protest your block you are a labeled a trouble maker or accused of making PA's by effectively calling the admins incompetent and I have seen Al's blocks increased in this way. Too much trouble comes from people being "trigger happy" about what is written. One person's offense is anothers wierd sense of humour/reaction to stress. This is an international project and all the time I see underestimated how cultural differences affect the way we approach situations. I'm British so I'm very good at being polite and queuing for my turn to edit 8-). I personally find some US editors "full on" and almost aggressively direct but I have also met many Americans in person who come across the same way. However it is just their manner, their hearts are in the right place and as long as you stick to the facts and sources you should be able to work together. If the integrity of the encyclopedia is most important what we should be looking at here is whether Al was adding to it when he was accused of "edit warring" or whether he was disrupting it. I have not agreed with him on everything but I have never had a problem with him. In fact I'm able to work with several "problem" editors just by not rising to the bait and sticking to what the verifiable sources have to say on a subject.</p>
<p>Now his talk page is protected which is ridiculous especially as it looks from the history as if one admin added a comment by bypassing the protection giving Al no chance to respond <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. If you repeatedly treat someone unfairly you are going to see a "pattern" of them resisting the system. I have been fully convinced that the last few blocks were intended to create an impressive history so as to work towards removing him and have seen nothing here yet to disuade me of that position. As for the juvenile comments by some admins above - what can I say other than that they no show empathy or understanding of the current situation and should be given LEGO blocks instead of admin tools. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a></p>

<dd>I agree with Sophia. This might all be moot since we seem to have already lost now both Sophia and Al--both excellent editors, and certainly much better than many others, including admins, despite their weaknesses. Sophia's point bout the Stanford prison experiment was as pertinent and astute observation as it was obvious given the setting here. The fact her poignant observation is just ignored is telling, as it the irony that it was an admin himself who used the prison/prisoner analogy in the firt place. To Sophia's study refence, I add the equally famous <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milgram_experiment.html" title="Milgram experiment">Milgram experiment</a> as also relevant for some of the social dynamics that are taking place, in particular in the reliance on authority here, i.e. the tendency to assume that if someone is an admin what they say is true and correct, and those who are accused are to be mostly ignored. What follows is that the strength or logic of an argument doesn't matter: AL is guilty and bad, and the accusing admins are good and right, case closed.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 10:54, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sophia, I appreciate your concerns. Certainly some people are odd. Heck, all of us have our eccentricities. I think that Wikipedia is extremely tolerant of different points of view, and of different behaviors. However we have a project: to create an encyclopedia by consensus. We've determined that civility is a necessity for this project to succeed, and so it has become one of our policies. Civility isn't an option, it's a requirement. Boorish behavior is not part of the expected norm. You are exactly right, we should focus on the edits, not the editors. Unfortunately, Alienus does not do that. He calls editors names. He doesn't say, for example, "those edits promote a certain POV", instead he says, "you're an edit warrior". Because he attacks editors he's been chastened repeatedly by a variety of editors. Personally, I think that Alienus makes some positive contributions to the project. But we cannot and do not tolerate incivility. Lastly, Wikipedia works by consensus. Eight different admins have now blocked Alienus. I'm sure it isn't a record, but it is a large number. At this rate he is in danger of exhausting the community's patience. If you appreciate his involvement in the project, then I suggest you counsel him to avoid behavior that could lead to a future, and perhaps indefinite, block. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:57, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There can be no good faith extended to Alienus. He engages in the defense and avocation of trolls being let loose upon our fair wiki. We're here to write an encyclopedia, not take part in a rehabilitation project for disruptive people. One must really question Alienus's devotion to the encyclopedia when he/she speaks so freely of supporting that which would harm wikipedia. He's a openly admitted supporter of trolls. He, and the trolls he supports that would bring harm to this project, must be silenced and denied access to our website. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaman_Zero_2b31.html" title="User:Megaman Zero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegaman_Zero_f80e.html" title="User talk:Megaman Zero">Talk</a></sup> 09:09, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Err, Wikipedia isn't some sort of fortress of civilisation that must be defended against barbarians. Once you start thinking like that, you've bought into the "battle" paradigm that is the root of about 85% or all conflict. And as to the number of editor who've blocked someone, there is an undeniable "pile on" effect where every block gets easier to justify, and people stop counting the number of <i>un</i>blocks. This is not a commentary on this case in particular, just that it's a terrible metric to use in judging how much of a "problem" an editor is. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman">brenneman</a> 09:36, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>FWIW, Alienus has been unblocked four times. Two were to remove blocks, one was to lengthen a block and another was to change the blocking admin. I note that one of those unblocking admins has now posted to Alienus's page endorsing this block, if for nothing else the attacks that Alienus has written on his talk page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61763867" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61763867" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 17:57, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When an editor supports that which harms the project, I think it a valid reason to project the encyclopedia indeed. There is no battles and punishments on wikipedia. That's not the point of this website. When an editor is percieved as disruptive, they are blocked. And if they continue they are blocked longer. As editors of a project to freely distribute knowledge and assist those who seek it, there is no leeway for nonsense. To say wikipedia is not to be protected agaisnt this sort of stuff is entirely inapropriate. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaman_Zero_2b31.html" title="User:Megaman Zero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegaman_Zero_f80e.html" title="User talk:Megaman Zero">Talk</a></sup> 10:25, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive118_7728.html" title="Edit section: Murder and rape threats by 205.234.223.167">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Murder and rape threats by 205.234.223.167</span></h2>
<p>I'm fairly new around here, but <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.234.223.167.html" title="User:205.234.223.167">User:205.234.223.167</a> has been making multiple murder and rape threats against several people today. He's gotten a 2 week block for bad behavior, but still has access to his talk page. I know Wikipedia likes to go through a series of escalating sanctions before permanently blocking someone, but do you always have to do that? Can't there be bad enough behavior (as in threatening to drive to someone's house, murder the editor and rape his wife) that admins might be justified in just cutting to the chase and permanently blocking the IP address altogether?</p>
<p>Here's just a sample of his many cheery messages today: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A205.234.223.167&amp;diff=61929107&amp;oldid=61928844" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A205.234.223.167&amp;diff=61929107&amp;oldid=61928844" rel="nofollow">1</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:205.234.223.167&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61929107" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:205.234.223.167&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61929107" rel="nofollow">2</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A205.234.223.167&amp;diff=61927055&amp;oldid=61924850" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A205.234.223.167&amp;diff=61927055&amp;oldid=61924850" rel="nofollow">3</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:205.234.223.167&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61924147" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:205.234.223.167&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61924147" rel="nofollow">4</a>.</p>
<p>And another question -- Wikipedia is very strict about <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_legal_threats_370c.html" title="Wikipedia:No legal threats">"no legal threats"</a>; editors taking legal action off Wikipedia is highly discouraged. Yet threatening rape and murder is a felony in every U.S. jurisdiction (and with good reason). I think this guy should be reported to authorities in his jurisdiction (somewhere near Chicago?) now, rather than later, but I'm concerned this would get me in hot water with Wikipedia. Personally, I feel only slightly physically threatened, but I suspect that this guy represents a much more real physical danger to people in his own community. If he's a psychopath, I suspect his antisocial behavior is not confined to Wikipedia. I'm happy to report him, but I am concerned that I would have problems with Wikipedia.</p>
<p>So what's the next appropriate step here? Where do I take this issue?</p>

<li>I have a girlfriend who's ex-boyfriend has just been sent to prison for 3 months (18 months suspended) for making death threats and other threats via email. I suggest that this matter is dealt with in a more serious fashion and this users IP is traced and reported to the relevant authorities (i.e. Police) in his jurisdiction. He sounds like an idiot, but in the USA (for example) any death threat is treated seriously (which it should be). Better safe than sorry. (User Name witheld for obvious reasons!).</li>

<p>Dear Getcrunk, I'm not sure why you are so frustrated with the inexpereinced newbies at the Oprah article for including relevant early-life images you consider unsourced, when you as an experienced editor endorsed the use of this Janet Jackson image <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Janetjacksonnew.jpg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Janetjacksonnew.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Janetjacksonnew.jpg</a> The only source info provided is speculation on where the photo came from and the link provided does not even work. It's very difficult for newbies to follow the correct standards and procedures of wikipedia when they are applied so inconsistently by the very people endorsing said standards. I understand that you are acting in good faith and do not mean to be creating double standards or confusion, and thus I offer this as the most constructive of criticism. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardriver_f296.html" title="User:Cardriver">Cardriver</a> 19:01, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A user responsible for a number of blocked WOW socks has been going from one sock's talk page to the next posting the {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} template with the reason "<i>I wish to write attack pages on the following: [insert names of various Wikipedians]</i>". I noticed it because it triggered the IRC bot that notifies of any use of {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}}; I've cleaned what I've found of it up, and after about the fourth one, I checkusered the accounts, determined them to be all from a single IP, and blocked it for six months. I don't expect any collateral damage (it appears to be fairly static) but just in case, it's 82.42.145.158. I strongly recommend against unblocking it unless a legitimate Wikipedian is affected; this vandal is having fun doing WOW moves and then causing trouble via thier talk pages once blocked. I don't doubt for a second they would try to instigate a wheel war over good-faith unblocking. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 09:45, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh, the story doth get better! After being denied the unblock via the IP's talk page by <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofjude_9d65.html" title="User:Bookofjude">User:Bookofjude</a>, he's now attempting to use a doppelganger, User talk:Sunholm1 to deceive someone into unblocking him. Why deceive? Because if he posted it from his actual account, <a href="../../../s/u/n/User_talk%7ESunholm_4507.html" title="User talk:Sunholm">User talk:Sunholm</a>, the unblocking admin might see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/block?page=User:Sunholm" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/block?page=User:Sunholm" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/block?page=User:Sunholm</a> and realize who he is and what he's been doing. (As <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirefox_461e.html" title="User:Firefox">User:Firefox</a> did when denying the unblock).</p>
<p>At this point, I think there it's a good idea to discuss what to do with Sunholm &amp; Sunholm1, as he's proven, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he is the same user that has been doing the WOW vandalism; I held off on saying anything about those accounts because I had a strong feeling he would use them in a manner that would make a public connection between the WOW vandalism and the other accounts. I suggest indefblocks on both, but of course, yield to the judgment of the community. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 10:46, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"KarlaJoanne" ain't going to do much more chatting here, I've blocked "her" indefinitely as a transparent sockpuppet. Just look at the history of contribs, including to Sunfazr's RFA.

<p>Thanks guys, I apprecaite everyone keeping on top of this while I was asleep. (By the way, I answered Theresa's question on my talk page, if anyone was waiting for an answer to that.) There is an open checkuser request on WOW at RFCU that Mackensen has been dealing with; it just mentioned Blueyonder, the same ISP, so perhaps he may have useful information as well.

<dd>Comment from interested party: See background information <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_Mywayyy_ee43.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise/Mywayyy">here</a>. Problem is: He seems to think that he can wear his opponents down by sheer persistence until people get tired and let him have his way. As long as he believes that and he is determined to disrupt, it will be difficult to stop him. In addition to a long-term block/ban, I'd suggest considering:
<ul>
<li>Semi-protect the most affected articles (currently <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalymnos.html" title="Kalymnos">Kalymnos</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samothrace.html" title="Samothrace">Samothrace</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simi.html" title="Simi">Simi</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilos.html" title="Tilos">Tilos</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chios.html" title="Chios">Chios</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mytilene.html" title="Mytilene">Mytilene</a>)</li>
<li>And/or establish a routine of short-term range blocks of range 88.218.32.0/19, in addition to 24-hour blocks of each new block-evading IP as they come in (reports and fast response through <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>).</li>
<li>Carrot-and-stick: Give him an offer to come back under a strict topic-specific 0-reverts parole, until he has successfully sought dispute resolution and reached a consensus with other editors. Otherwise give him an unmistakable message he will be treated as a banned vandal forever.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry i didn'r realise this conversation was here and I've gone and indefinately blocked him. The way i see it it. He has made no attempt whatsoever to even try and work with others, and his blatent evading of blocks cannot be tolerted. I've semiprotected most of the articles concerned to stop the edit warring. I am willing to protect as many as necessary - just let me know of any that I have missed.</p>
<p>If people feel that he can be reigned in then unblock with my blessing, but i feel he should be community banned and be done with it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 20:42, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Does the checkuse script automatically block an IP, or does the blocking need to be done manually? Maybe the user accidentally slipped through the "to block" list. <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.R._Hercules_fd8f.html" title="User:J.R. Hercules">J.R. Hercules</a> 14:43, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's no "to block" list on CheckUser. It is the responsibility of the person who requested the CheckUser to make sure that some sort of action is taken based on the results. Usually it's good enough to contact an active administrator and post a link back to the confirmed results on the CheckUser page. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 15:15, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't understand the reason for the length of this block (two years, two months, two weeks, etc.). Goodandevil has problems with the NPOV policy, as do many editors, and has edit warred in the past. I have no idea if there has been any improvement, as I haven't been following his contributions. But he's not a banned user. He's just a user with a long block log. He's not blocked at the moment — at least not as Goodandevil. While IPs are sometimes tagged as sockpuppets, in my view that's more for identification purposes than for accuracy. If I get logged off and make an edit from my IP, that doesn't make me a sockpuppeteer. It's different if I make three reverts to an article using my username, and then deliberately log off so as to be able to make another three <i>incognito</i>. But Goodandevil last edited under his username on 5 May, so the IP was not being used to get round the three-revert rule. I recall a few months ago, after he had been editing from IPs for some time, he returned as Goodandevil, and said that there had been some problem, now solved, which had prevented him from logging on, but that he had never tried to conceal that he was Goodandevil when posting from IPs.</p>
<p>As I say, I haven't been following his contributions recently, but unless that IP did something that would warrent a ten-week block, I think the block should be undone. Blocking it because it's Goodandevil is not appropriate (unless I'm missing something), because Goodandevil is not blocked, and because the IP is not a puppet trying to split number of votes and reverts between two accounts. Can someone link me to the appropriate entry on the checkuser page, please? Thanks. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 07:25, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not exactly a violation of WP policy, but I find it worth mentioning that after the uproar over his IP edits, Goodandevil proceeded to begin editing as "himself" again as of July 8th. By a strange coincidence, his talk page, including all its old warnings, was archived and blanked immediately preceding these new edits.

The vandalism that was done in his name, as he told the person vandalized, was done while he was away from the computer. Other than that, I don't think any of us has done anything wrong.

<p>I know this is the good place but I'm not so sure about what we should do with <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">User:Charlesknight</a>. I first "met" this guy when I set up my profile. Before I could remove the userboxes that didnt concern me (2,500 edits, Vandalproof user), this guy emailed me wandering why I had these icons(though I didn't how it worked). So I kindly asked him how it worked, (I even had trouble discussing on talk pages) and before he could answer me he vandalized my page. Now I've contributed to many articles and he keeps vandalizing my contributions. As I'm trying to be more and more involved to improve wikipedia I find myself with a weight that drags me down. Actually he motivates me to keep on improving wikipedia a website that I so admire for its real freespeech. Anyway I dont wanna have to deal with him again on his talk page, cuz all he does is remain silent and vandalize. Should I block him or warn him? I've tried once warn him but he didnt understand why he had been warned. Please let me know, I'm in desperate need of help to help this poor fellow. --<a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdelkweli_3492.html" title="User:Abdelkweli">Abdelkweli</a> 16:55, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ok Debate about my actions and methods I'm quite willing to take - out and out lies are quite different.

<p>For those that haven't encountered him yet, General Tojo is one of Wikipedia's more persistent and prolific sock-puppeteers with ovr 60 different sock-puppet accounts.</p>

<p>However, things have sunk to new low today with <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneral_Tojo_3976.html" title="User:General Tojo">General Tojo</a> threatening to undermine the work of three editors today including <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris_73</a> and myself.

This was one of the threats General Tojo sent out today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GENERAL TOJO WAS HERE</p>
<p>I have started reverting everything you have ever added to Wikipedia from the outset. It is not being done by obvious means. A large variety of names will be used. Instead of being obvious by just reverting, the actual wording is being changed bit by bit. This will teach you to avoid reverting my contributions based on your own personal malice and emotional inadequacies. This will go on for several days at a time, and will be resumed every time you revert what I have added. Rather than care about adding information that is useful for people, you obviously only care about your own self sentred ego. --General Tojo 2 14:29, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>General Tojo also openly gloats about his ability to create more accounts at will from within the 88.104.0.0/13 IP block and taunts administrators over possible collateral damage such as <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_General_Tojo_c57e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for checkuser/Case/General Tojo">here</a> and has also threatened to escalate his attacks on Wikipedia. In the last 24 hours, he has used 6 different accounts to revert <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkinson%27s_disease.html" title="Parkinson's disease">Parkinson's_disease</a> ([<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parkinson%27s_disease&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parkinson%27s_disease&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>]) to his own version.</p>
<p><b>Background:</b> It's suspected that the true identity of General Tojo is a biochemist in London by the name of Keith Bridgeman, who holds a patent on a drug called dopavite. His edits to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkinson%27s_disease.html" title="Parkinson's disease">Parkinson's disease</a> are used to promote his view that dopavite can be used to treat the disease, however this form of treatment has yet to be accepted by the wider medical community. One of General Tojo's known sock puppets was "<a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViartis_0b08.html" title="User:Viartis">Viartis</a>". This username has been <a href="http://brain.hastypastry.net/forums/member.php?userid=31382" class="external text" title="http://brain.hastypastry.net/forums/member.php?userid=31382" rel="nofollow">banned</a> (apparently for being disruptive) from the neurology, forum <a href="http://brain.hastypastry.net/forums/" class="external text" title="http://brain.hastypastry.net/forums/" rel="nofollow">BrainTalk Communities</a> (Dan: could you please elaborate?). "Viartis" also runs his own "Parkinson's Disease Forum" at <a href="http://p4.forumforfree.com/" class="external free" title="http://p4.forumforfree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://p4.forumforfree.com/</a> which seems to support General Tojo's views on the treatment of Parkinson's.</p>

<dd>I have seen the discussions on BrainTalk after another user - JD, I think - tipped me off and I did a search. However, I wasn't there during the actual events that led to his being banned, but I believe Paul was. From what I could see, it appears he was banned for behavior similar to what we've been seeing. Oh, and something I forgot - he also used the username "Keith Bridgeman" on BrainTalk --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfsnow_eafc.html" title="User:Profsnow">Dan</a> 19:12, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Three days ago, I noticed the newly created article Toxic causes of Parkinson's Disease being used to spamdex <a href="http://p4.forumforfree.com/" class="external free" title="http://p4.forumforfree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://p4.forumforfree.com/</a> which led to the following AfD: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Toxic_causes_of_Parkinson%27s_Disease_5c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Toxic causes of Parkinson's Disease">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Toxic_causes_of_Parkinson's_Disease</a>. Since then the situation has further escalated with General Tojo making personal attacks and threats against anyone who has spoken out against him or reverted his changes.</p>
<p>For the last month or two, General Tojo has become an increasingly erratic and time-consuming problem to deal with. He's now tying down the resources of at least five editors who now have to be constantly vigilant against his edit-warring and sock puppets. We really do need stronger action to be taken against him now that he taken to making threats.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> This user is unusually disruptive with his multitude of sock puppets and outright refusal to behave appropriately. While I concede that he may have the potential to contribute something useful here and there given his knowledge of the area, his interactional style is extremely challenging and overshadows whatever positive contributions he may hope to make. Plus, he has a tendency to launch some off-color diatribes here and there as an anonymous IP, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAndrew73&amp;diff=62089397&amp;oldid=62082361" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAndrew73&amp;diff=62089397&amp;oldid=62082361" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> by <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Bio Doc</a>, a likely sock puppet. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 21:03, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> Yes, it hasn't been all that fun a time. Several comments could be interpreted as veiled threats:</p>

<p>I request administrative assistance in resolving a dispute with NYTheaterHistorian, whose talk page indicates that he/she is also known as Anonymous anonymous. This individual is a real life stalker, who most recently has attempted to divulge what they think is my current place of employment. This person, who is apparently an Administrator has harrassed me unmercilessly for days on end repeatedly posting slanderous remarks about both myself &amp; my former place of business. They have also falsely represented themselves as having a legitimate affiliation with a close colleagues' corporation.</p>
<p>Based upon their remarks, (what they know and do not know),it is clear to both myself &amp; others that this can be only one of two people (one male, one female). There is a Federal Court order against both of these individuals prohibiting them from harassing or slandering me in any way. Unfortunately, I have had to seek police protection from these individuals in the past. PLEASE, HELP ME!</p>
<p>The pages which have been vandalized are&#160;: Marilyn Majeski, Grove Street Playhouse and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Frankel_961e.html" title="Gene Frankel">Gene Frankel</a>.</p>

<dd>If you believe this to be a real-life stalker, you should probably take the issue to your local police, rather than bringing it up here. Unlike us, they have the power to arrest people if they've broken any laws. Until then, though, please try to avoid labeling these edits as "vandalism" or "slander", since they seem to stem from a simple content dispute. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 02:46, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>DavidGerard, his reply to you was unacceptable, but your "warning message" to him was a diplomatic train wreck. Please find a more congenial way to give people warnings than "work on the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civility</a> or go away". That's kind of asking for a negative response.

Put simply, the question as to whether Ireland is now regarded as one of the British Isles is controversial and disputed. He however insists on trying to erase any suggestion that there may be a question mark over it, and launches rascist attacks on Irish users who seek to try to draw attention to the fact that things are not as simple as he wants to claim.</p>
<p>Last night he was reported for 3RR. No admin was available immediately to deal with it. His response was to keep blanket reverting (up to 5 reverts and climbing) with taunts to all other editors who would not go beyond three). Given the mounting number of reverts, with taunts, I intervened to block him. As I had been one of the people involved in the edit war I put an explanation on the 3RR page, here, and elsewhere, and independent admins judged it the right intervention in the circumstances. Feline's reponse, as usual, as been to post rascist taunts. His most recent one (as well as nutty claims that 172 and I are sockpuppets!!!) involved accusations that I have made "barbed sectarian POV rants" (people who know me here know that I do not make sectarian attacks on people). He added in the (even by his standards) deeply offensive and provocative claim <i>Frankly I imagine someone like him will never be happy until the entire article is replaced by a picture of the potato famine with the caption "YOU ENGLISH B@STARDS!!!!!!" (written in Irish, of course)</i> He has called other Irish users "sectarian nitwits" and made numerous other derogatory comments.</p>
<p>Could someone please intervene with this individual. His rascism and bigotry has gone to far this time. It is bad enough to have him highjacking a page and deleting everything he disagrees with <i>en masse</i>, without accompanying it with a litany of rascist taunts. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 12:03, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Until he stops His ill-fated tactics - which clearly fight against Wikipedia's guidelines - his methods shall be used against himself, unless the administrators intervene.</p>
<p>Among his most recent foul play, the user Leifern has provably participated in pushing false information and improper tactics in relation to the wikipedia's <a href="../../../k/v/e/Kven.html" title="Kven">Kven</a> article, including pushing a splitting of that article, which attempt has now led to a new informational war in the Kven related articles - unnecessarily, as recently a much welcomed consensus had already been reached.</p>
<p>Advocating a mindless blocking of an innocent contributor for the Kven article is also going to backfire against Mr. Leifern, unless he makes a clear effort to correct things, or unless someone else comes for his rescue now.</p>
<p>Administrators, - please - do the right thing now: unblock the user <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Dominique_8658.html" title="User:Art Dominique">Art Dominique</a> immediately! That blocking has not been given any valid reason, only a false accusation of sockpuppetry. Remember, not guilty, unless proven guilty!</p>

<p>Recently I've been having discussions with <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">user:Everyking</a> at <a href="../../../a/s/h/Talk%7EAshlee_Simpson_e3aa.html#Magazine_covers" title="Talk:Ashlee Simpson">Talk:Ashlee_Simpson#Magazine_covers</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/e/Talk%7EPieces_of_Me_dde5.html#Excess_detail" title="Talk:Pieces of Me">Talk:Pieces_of_Me#Excess_detail</a> about what I feel is excess detail in articles related to Ashlee Simpson. I know the history of these Ashlee Simpson articles and I don't want the situation to escalate like it did before, so I've been focussing my comments on the content of the articles, but Everyking's behaviour towards me has been very unsettling. He has become rather uncivil, both on those talk pages and at my RFA (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_Extraordinary_Machine_a75b.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Extraordinary Machine">Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Extraordinary Machine</a>), and I'd previously told him about this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Everyking&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60643674" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Everyking&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60643674" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> but he doesn't seem to have listened; see also <a href="../../../i/n/v/Talk%7EInvisible_%28Jaded_Era_song%29_0f84.html" title="Talk:Invisible (Jaded Era song)">Talk:Invisible (Jaded Era song)</a>. I proposed that we invite users from outside the Simpson-related disputes to comment, but he seems uninterested.</p>
<p>Now I feel I have to say something here because of his most recent edits: he's started commenting on messages I write to other users <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Extraordinary_Machine&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=62341767" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Extraordinary_Machine&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=62341767" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, editing articles I've contributed to recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dangerously_in_Love_2&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62341253" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dangerously_in_Love_2&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62341253" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chemicals_React&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62340501" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chemicals_React&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62340501" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> and now he's performing wholesale reverts of my edits to <a href="../../../t/h/e/These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin%27_%28Jessica_Simpson_song%29_58f8.html" title="These Boots Are Made for Walkin' (Jessica Simpson song)">These Boots Are Made for Walkin' (Jessica Simpson song)</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin%27_%28Jessica_Simpson_song%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62361899" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin%27_%28Jessica_Simpson_song%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62361899" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin%27_%28Jessica_Simpson_song%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62365371" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin%27_%28Jessica_Simpson_song%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62365371" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, He refuses to explain why he did so and doesn't seem to care that he is undoing useful changes I made to the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin%27_%28Jessica_Simpson_song%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62363818" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin%27_%28Jessica_Simpson_song%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62363818" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. I want to resolve these disputes with him, but I'm finding it extremely difficult dealing with his behaviour, which I feel is unacceptable. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 13:40, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This appears to be a content dispute, because I don't see Everyking using any of his admin tools against you. The only admin-related stuff I see would be his commenting on your RFA, and commenting on you being a new admin and pushing your weight around. Even though he's made these comments, he hasn't actually used any admin tools against you. Perhaps you should use the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">dispute resolution</a> process. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 13:53, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd advice trying to make smaller edits at a time. For example your edits to <a href="../../../t/h/e/These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin%27_%28Jessica_Simpson_song%29_58f8.html" title="These Boots Are Made for Walkin' (Jessica Simpson song)">These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin'_(Jessica_Simpson_song)</a> radically shrink down and rewrite the article, rather predictably causing James to do a wholesale revert. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 13:59, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Extraordinary Machine, it's difficult to discuss this here, as Everyking himself is banned from posting on ANI. It's not clear to me from your post if any of your admin actions are involved in the comments Everyking's been writing to you and other users, but if there's anything beyond a pure content dispute, I think you'd better take it to the ArbCom rather than ANI, because of his ANI ban. There's no obvious place to post it on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Everyking_3_84a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Everyking 3">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Everyking 3</a> or <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>, I know. Perhaps at the "Requests for clarification" on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>? I won't discuss any of it here myself, just supply these bare facts: per Everyking 3, Everyking is prohibited from commenting on other administrators' actions<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Everyking_3#Everyking_prohibited_from_commenting_on_administrators.27_actions" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Everyking_3#Everyking_prohibited_from_commenting_on_administrators.27_actions" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> and is required to familiarize himself with the particulars of a situation before commenting on it.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Everyking_3#Everyking_is_obligated_to_familiarize_himself_before_commenting" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Everyking_3#Everyking_is_obligated_to_familiarize_himself_before_commenting" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 15:54, 6 July 2006 (UTC).

<dd>The injunction says: "Everyking is prohibited from making comments on non-editorial actions taken by other administrators <b>other than on the administrator's talk page</b>, a Request for comment, or a Request for arbitration."

<dd>No one's going to like what I'm about to say, but it seems to me that a content RFC would be the "wider community input" on the articles. My suggestion would be that each of the sides (and I wish it weren't down to sides, but it really has been EK vs. World in a lot of this) state a view as clearly as possible and then get community input on an RFC. My view on the monomania is well known enough, but I have a lot of sympathy for EK and the way folks have mobbed him, too. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:35, 6 July 2006 (UTC) (Even I don't like what I said.)</dd>

<dd>I know that content disputes aren't supposed to be listed here; it's the incivility and following me across pages that I was most troubled by, but I didn't know that this page was specifically for leaving a complaint about an admin's sysop tool-related edits rather than their general editing behaviour. So sorry about that, and I only mentioned the Simpson dispute to provide some background; I didn't mention it with the intent of parachuting in admins familiar with the history of these articles.</dd>
<dd>I didn't know about that RFAr, but although it says "Everyking is obligated to familiarize himself before commenting" (which I don't feel he did in this case) it doesn't say he can't comment about an admin's actions on their talk page. In fact, I probably would have written the message he was criticising me for if I wasn't an admin, though I do feel his intent was to antagonise me by commenting on it in the way he did. Also, he hasn't reverted at <a href="../../../t/h/e/These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin%27_%28Jessica_Simpson_song%29_58f8.html" title="These Boots Are Made for Walkin' (Jessica Simpson song)">These Boots Are Made for Walkin' (Jessica Simpson song)</a> again.</dd>
<dd>As for a content RFC for the Simpson pages...well, I listed the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a> dispute at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_ART_747b.html" title="WP:RFC/ART">WP:RFC/ART</a>, but nobody commented.

<dd>Dang, I was afraid you were going to say that. See, there are <i>certain users</i> who have exhausted community patience even though they're not people anyone wants to block, so no one wants to get involved, because it's a bad time guaranteed for all. I know that the oldsters who remember the Ashlee ... kerfuffle?... just hope to never speak of it again, and the youngsters probably don't understand the whole background and therefore give bland and obvious advice. I suppose it is up to behavior RFC, if a content one has failed. It's too bad. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:34, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ordinarily, if an editor was being difficult, you would first try a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">user conduct request for comment</a>. In this case, since he has apparently been before the arbitration committee 3 times, it seems (to me anyway) that you should take it to them, and if they want you to try an RFC first they will tell you. Arbcom doesn't deal with content so in your request to them, be sure to focus on how his conduct has been a problem. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:51, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the info.

<dd>It's a netherworld situation. On the one hand, the issue is behavior about his interest, but, on the other, it is fairly obviously due to a somewhat excessive interest that the actions are taken, so ArbCom will have a hard time accepting and avoiding making a content ruling or a ruling on a person's excessive desires for writing about a particular subject. On the other hand, a conduct RFC would need involved parties, and there aren't many (because of the bad memories, maybe, and because the people who wanted to provoke Everyking have stopped). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:49, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tried to post this at the RFA talk page but was autoblocked for using AOL - move it if you want.</p>
<p>Essjay removed my RFA question <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FMboverload&amp;diff=62369552&amp;oldid=62357135" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FMboverload&amp;diff=62369552&amp;oldid=62357135" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> from many RFAa although many answered it and no one else complained. I dont want to be blocked so I will obey Essjay and not ask it again. Do you think it is OK if I use this AOL autoblocking question instead?</p>

<dd>Why not just say what you mean? "Is it better to block an AOL IP temporarily to stop a vandal, if it may affect several potential AOL Wikipedia contributors?"

<dd>I suggest that your RfA edits would be a lot less likely to be removed if you were to abandon the the real-world allegory and ask directly about AOL users or autoblocking. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 16:49, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From the way you post this, I get the impression that you still have no idea why Essjay removed your question. I guess the point is that the question is either completely irrelevant, if the two situations (blocks and shooting in a war) are incomparable, or very distasteful and over the top if they imply that you consider the two situations comparable. As suggested above, just ask what you want to know in terms of the actual situation that you want to know about (AOL blocks). I can understand your frustrations with those autoblocks, but let's keep things in perspective here. --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">Joanne</a><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoanneB_dae6.html" title="User talk:JoanneB">B</a> 21:23, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gufran has only one contribution after the 3RR block on the IP address, and I also noted recommendations on the IP's talk page that he should register. Not very sporting to tell someone to register and then accuse him of being a sockpuppet. I politely advised him that <i>if</i> he is that IP editor, he should sit out the rest of the 24 hour block. I suggest waiting a bit to see if he will observe this or not. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:31, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In addition to this prod v. CSD dispute, the user has also userfied numerous doomed articles.

Userfying what seems like an autobiography is one thing, but userfying doomed articles, especially those that appear to be vandalism (like the Ajpowers example), just doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>I've already been through this with him/her on the user pages of myself and the user, but this was to no avail.

<dd>It's not so much the fact it's being done...it's the fact that it's being done out of process that concerns me. We have the hangon tag for a reason. We also have a check &amp; balance system in place already. If the administrator who is patrolling speedy deletions at the time feels it could possibly be a prod instead, they'll switch it to that. I don't think that it is appropriate for this user to change speedy deletes to prods just in case someone might want to edit it in the next five days. We have deletion review if a user feels a deletion of an article is out of process. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 04:33, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The userfication bit looks like an attempted <s>runaround</s> end-run of the article speedy-deletion policies. User pages are supposed to be for actual editors, not some sort Wikipedian substitute for MySpace, so they don't belong. And, since some of them were created by TruthbringerToronto cutting-and-pasting the text of the doomed articles, they're immediately in violation of the GFDL, to boot. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 06:10, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Oh, for Pete's sake! "It's not so much the fact it's being done...it's the fact that it's being done out of process that concerns me. We have the hangon tag for a reason. We also have a check &amp; balance system in place already. If the administrator who is patrolling speedy deletions at the time feels it could possibly be a prod instead, they'll switch it to that." This is— and there is a nicer way to say it, but it does not, alas, spring to mind— pure, unadorned bollocks. Removing speedy tags for an article that <i>any</i> user other than the article's original author feels is not a speedy <i><b>is perfectly appropriate</b></i>. We have {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} for a reason, but that reason has been <i>repeatedly</i> obscured by people who make idiotic comments like Metros232's quoted.

<dd>Can you explain to me, then, why it is appropriate to change something to a {{prod}} instead of the speedy delete tag in the manner s/he is doing? To change something that's listed as speedy deletion as a non-notable biography to a prod tag that says "nn-biography". What does that mean? "You're right, it's non-notable, so we'll wait 5 days to delete it as non-notable". If TruthBringer was removing the tags in order to say "no, you're wrong, this subject is notable and here's why" that's one thing and I would have absolutely no problem with someone removing a speedy delete tag I was wrong on, but to just simply say it's non-notable is inappropriate. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 14:41, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, here goes. Ready?
<ul>
<li><i><b>Notability is not a speedy deletion criterion!</b></i></li>
<li>TruthbringerToronto is trying to Do The Right Thing By Those Who Tag Articles Inappropriately by changing to {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPROD_4af6.html" title="Template:PROD">PROD</a>}}, so that the delete-it-delete-it-delete-it-waaaah brigade still get their precious deletion, but an inappropriate speedy is not committed.</li>
<li><i><b>Notability is not a speedy deletion criterion!</b></i></li>
<li>{{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} exists <i>only</i> so that the original author of an article can object to a speedy tag inappropriately applied. That is the sole extent of its scope. The rest of us don't need to use it, and should not be told to use it.</li>
<li><i><b>Notability is not a speedy deletion criterion!</b></i></li>
<li>Administrators do not have special status. You should not be reverting a non-admin action and telling the person concerned, "only admins may make that decision", that's terrible behaviour. We are not the only ones who can remove an improper speedy tag.</li>
<li><i><b>Notability is not a speedy deletion criterion!</b></i></li>
<li>Someone removing a speedy tag is not saying "this is not deletable", and shouldn't be expected to be saying such a thing. What they're saying is "hey, this is not a speedy candidate, maybe we should think about it for a little bit in case someone actually cares about this article."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>We do a pretty good job of making sure we don't accidentally delete too much rubbish. I'm baffled as to why people insist on ruining that by insisting we follow ridiculous policies that don't exist except as the Chinese Whispers-sponsored folly of their own imaginations.

I see where you're coming from on a lot of your points, and I'm sorry it appears that I won't be on your Christmas card list this year, but I don't think that the articles I tag are inappropriately tagged. It's not like I see a band page, say "Oh, I've never heard them on the radio before, DELETE." I know some users do, yes, but please don't lump me in with that category, I think that I research and try to find independent sources and other coverage that is necessary. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 15:17, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I did indeed lump you into that category, and I apologise if you don't belong. Please understand that saying things to the effect of, "Only an admin may remove speedy tags, non-admins must use {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}}, no matter how stupid the speedy is," instantly sticks you into the "utter morons" category until you prove otherwise. Of course, if you can promise never to say something like that again (and not to drool on the carpet), there might be a way back into my Christmas card list after all...</dd>
<dd>As for notability, please read the CSD again. Pay particular attention to certain words that start with the letter 'a', end with the letter 't', and have a number of other fine letters (namely an 's', an 'e', and an 'r') in between. If I write an article that says "Metros232 is a popular author with many pubished books to his name", then that <i>cannot</i> be speedied under A7. AfD may reveal that Metros232 being "popular" means "his mother loves him", and "published books" means "vanity press", but you can't say "despite this asseriton, he's non-notable" and speedy him. The subject of an article need not be immediately obvious as <i>notable</i> in the sense we use on AfD to avoid being speedied: there just has to be an assertion of notability. And we set the bar very, very low. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 15:25, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is a very true statement you make about the assertion aspect. Take a look at this article for example Guillaume_Buckley. It is quite obviously a hoax, but that doesn't fall under CSD G1 as patent nonsense. And while the person who is the subject of the article is clearly not notable in reality, his article says he is, so we must go based on that. Such a double-edged sword sometimes. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 15:33, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, Guillaume Buckley is hardly the poster child for the view that people should think before they insist on an article being speedy deleted. It's a case of an article so blatantly detrimental to Wikipedia that we can, using Common Sense™, get rid of the bastard with a clear conscience. It's not Policy Says X or Policy Says Y that dictates our decision on whether to speedy, PROD, or AfD an article. The best example might be an article about a band. "Me and Skazz just put a band together. People would probably like us, if we could just get a gig." is an obvious speedy; there's no assertion of notability there. A decent article, but the subject fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and you really doubt we should have an article, well, that's AfD material. In-between it gets a bit trickier, but {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} is there to ease the strain on those who just can't face the idea of nominating a bad article for AfD. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 13:26, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">User:Vesther</a> is removing comments on article talk pages due to them containing what he sees as "foul language" - in one case, the word "shit" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sennheiser&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=62496091" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sennheiser&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=62496091" rel="nofollow">[60]</a> which is, at least here, about as far from profane as possible, and again for the word "crap" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sennheiser&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62312517" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sennheiser&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62312517" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> (see above...).</p>
<p>His justification is that "little children" or "minors" might see it. Now, if the article space is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> censored for the protection of minors, why should the article talk space be? He stated: "I can't allow young children to see it, others might be offended by it.", which is definately an attempt to censor for the protection of minors.</p>
<p>His warnings to those that use language that offends him also seems to suggest that its Wikipedia policy to remove comments containing "foul language" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:35.9.6.175&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62497329" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:35.9.6.175&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62497329" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>.

All the time he limits himself to doing that, let's leave him be. i don't care if he hates me. <i>If</i> he goes back to removing/altering people's comments elsewhere, them that is a different matter. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 00:41, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem, though, is, upset for what? His threshold for "insult" is, at least for the moment, so low that his ability to work together with anyone in the spirit of a Wiki is severely compromised. I have no problem with a leash at this point, but it's going to have to be a very short one, lest he encounter someone less forgiving than you or I... <tt style="color:#161;">RadioKirk <small>(<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk">u</a>|t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk">c</a>)</small></tt> 01:29, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you Hagiographer? i believe you are and urge the arbcom to investigate and do a check user test as if he is Hagiographer he clearly is breaking the arbcom final decision. I am not editing the Zapatero articles and nor should he be. Calling my post insulting is breaking his no attack parole.

<p>Well, I hace confessed to vandalizing for the past several months, and for permanently scarring my reputation. I want to state now that Tex's contention that I haven't left is entirely false, I only came back on the 23rd to voice my opinion against RobChurch, and his RfA. Well, my attack: I am sorry for being the CIyde vandal and for my attacks on John Reid. I am sorry that I came here, stressing myself, and others out. To further emphasize this, I did create an account with the intention of it being constructive after a three month long meltdown. Hopefully, I will be able to edit constructively, and I am sorry for all the trouble I cause. Yes, people reform, and to be honest, the point of the vandalism was to attract attention to what I see as incivility, and the reasons several of my friends have left here. But vandalism is vandalism, so I better quit before I get in trouble. I am sorry I was ever apart of the project. I DONT want to be a Brian Chase. But, at least I did edit here constructively for a year and three months before I went haywire.<a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#000000"><i><b>ε</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopedist_b147.html" title="User:Encyclopedist"><font color="#000000"><b>γκυκλοπ</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncyclopedist_baa9.html" title="User talk:Encyclopedist"><font color="#808080"><b>αίδεια</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia"><font color="#808080"><b>*</b></font></a>14:34, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am the one who originally gave Encyclopedist the indefinite block, and I did so only because, at the time, he asked for that. He has now been blocked for almost two months. On the talk page of the MyApology account I have just asked him to apologize for his past vandalisms and commit to not doing any more vandalisms in the future. If he does these, I am willing to remove my block. He would be under close scrutiny, and would be known to admins as an previous vandal. But in his non-vandal time he was a valuable contributer, and I think it would be worthwile to have him back. However, when this possibility was mentioned before, there were some strong opinions made against his return, so I wanted to give a chance here for someone to again argue against this action before I took it. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 16:56, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, you should have posted this <i>at the bottom</i> instead of placing it on the middle of the page. Second, KillerChihuahua has not blocked you at any time, from what can be observed on your block log; you have been blocked for disruption and 3RR by other admins. Checking your contributions and your talk page, it is easy to see that you have been repeatedly warned not to include commercial links at a number of pages, <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prayer.html" title="Prayer">Prayer</a> being one of them. Considering these circumstances, reversion of changes made by you both under this account and several IP addresses to "avoid" breach of 3RR after being warned in several occasions, consitutes no vandalism whatsoever. I sincerely suggest you to engage in discussion and listen to reasons expressed to you both at your Talk page and those of the articles where you have posted the afforementioned commercial links.

<p>Hello, as you can see, I’ve just registered here in Wikipedia. I would like to get approval for an idea I would like to carry out. I see there are a lot of conflicts here on Wikipedia (editwaring, vandals, reverts, etc.). I would like to act as sort of a lawyer for users involved in conflicts, and speak on their behalf, so they can contribute more without getting bogged down by “small things.” I wouldn’t contribute to content myself, in order to avoid conflicts, and I would try to stay neutral on issues until someone asks me for consultation or representation. What do you think? Wiki Laywer 17:48, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur with Netscott, there are avenues, such as the mediation committee, the mediation cabal, esperanza, etc. where advocacy and/or mediation would be welcome. People will be more open to your help after you have established an account in good standing with good edits to a variety of areas (articles, user talk, village pump, articles for deletion, etc) and no problems (such as uncivil behavior). <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:57, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>About a month ago, there was an IP who committed vandalism for about a week on and off, then came out and said he was really an admin on an alternate account, and did the vandalism as part of an experiment. It turned out he was really a troll starting trouble with the Admin elections. It ended up a big issue.

<p>New user <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWordBomb_879f.html" title="User:WordBomb">WordBomb</a>, in his very first edits on Wikipedia, inserted a libelous attack on the subject of the article and myself in <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Weiss_cdd6.html" title="Gary Weiss">Gary Weiss</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gary_Weiss&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62519022" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gary_Weiss&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62519022" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>).

WordBomb also inserted a lengthy section making unsubstantiated, unsourced claims against Weiss concerning a libel suit. WordBomb repeatedly reverted this unsourced derogatory information, after it was pointed out by myself and another editor that unsourced derogatory information cannot be inserted into articles about living persons.</p>
<p>Wordbomb also placed an improper vandalism warning on another user who properly removed unsourced derogatory materials from Weiss article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lastexit&amp;diff=62610463&amp;oldid=62599660" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lastexit&amp;diff=62610463&amp;oldid=62599660" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>.

<dd>Thanks for the quick response.

<p>I'm sure Harro5 is a good and competent administrator but he's suddenly been monitoring the Oprah board and has been deleting many of the nice Oprah pics Cardriver and I have uploaded. Instead of explaining why the photos I uploaded are unacceptable, he prefers to just call me a sockpuppet, a troll, a vandal, and tell me I'll be blocked. The current intro photo of Oprah is not very good and kind of undignified to her more elderly fans. In addition it has no source information. I uploaded a colorful dignified intro photo of Oprah with her dogs and Harro5 removed it, calling it junk in his edit summary. He sent me a message warning me not to upload unsourced photos, but the photo he prefers his unsourced as are most of these promotional celebrity photos in wikipedia articles. I'm trying really hard to improve the look of the article and learn the standards of wikipedia so I don't understand why Harro5 feels one unsourced image is valid, while a more clear colorful and dignified one is not.<a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZorklift_d1d4.html" title="User:Zorklift">Zorklift</a> 23:35, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just to be clear, the image I wish to use in the intro is this one: Image:Oprah with dogs.jpg But administrator Harro5 tells me its unsourced keeps reinserting this one Image:Oprah.PNG which is also unsourced and much less dignified. It doesn't make any sense and it's very confusing for us new users who are trying desperately to learn the standards of wikipedia.<a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZorklift_d1d4.html" title="User:Zorklift">Zorklift</a> 23:45, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The image you want to use looks like it was cut from a magazine (since there are remains of some words on it that look like a magazine cover). If this is the case, it's a copyrighted work and can't be used under fair use to illustrate the Oprah article, but only an article about the magazine it is the cover for. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:50, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for the reply. But the image Harro5 is using is from Oprah's 20 year DVD collection which is not only not the subject of the article, but mentioned nowhere in the article. We're also having a dispute over images from Letterman. As usual mine is considered unsourced, but the existing image is equally unsourced. I would very much like to expirement with more images but he has threatened to block me if I do so. I feel a neutral administrator should do blockings, not one who is embroiled in an edit war.

<dd>My feeling on the matter is just get rid of ALL of the photos from this article and start anew. We got the image undeletion, we got Oprah's website. Except for the first pic, which is used in the infobox, none have sources. But the first pic was altered and cropped, and going by Zoe's response, that infobox pic should go. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 02:00, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

This is an abuse of the function of the template, in my opinion, and I removed them accordingly. When I remove it, he adds it back on, and in addition warns that the removal of his judgement amounts to 'vandalism. I have a long standing dispute with him on several articles, and I know that he has been consulting other users on getting me blocked permenantly on Wikipedia.I personally find his work on Islam-related pages to be POV-motivated, and I believe his actions in regards to myself is a result of his desire to promote a POV. On his talk page, it is apparent that he's issued similar warnings, followed with accusations of vandalism for removing his warnings. He has also dismissed other good-faith edits as 'vandalism' in edit summaries. I believe his intention is to intimidate editors with views different than his own. I request an admin to take a look at this and suggest a course of action. He has repeatedly spoken in favor of blocking me on previous occasions. The fact that he is exploiting WP rules as a means of intimidating users, with the probable intention of using such unfounded claims of violation to appeal to an admin who would affect a block (this has been done before) itself suggests some measure should be taken against such a motivated attack. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 00:24, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>H.E. has just come back from a week-long block (reduced to indefinite) for numerous personal attacks, which was the latest in a long string of blocks under that username and his previous username for the same thing.

<dd>Actually a careful look at past blocks would reveal ALOT of debate on the credibility of the blocks. Personal attacks that weren't personal attacks, 3RRs that werent 3RRs. Merzbow's contributions to the Islam-related pages have been extremely POV-biased, and he's suggested already a desire to 'nuke' sections that I have newly added. Needless to say, there's an obvious content dispute that spans across several pages, most notably <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_Islam_ca75.html" title="Criticisms of Islam">Criticisms of Islam</a>. In the past, blocks have been placed that have later been debated, where the majority felt the accusations were unfounded. Sometimes, as a result, blocks were reduced, and sometimes removed. Merzbow is clearly settings things up to appeal for another block, and almost certainly some trigger-happy admin would respond by affecting such a block. That is why I am bringing this here now. I am critical of Merzbow's contributions here, and I am vocal in that criticism. Criticism of a user's contribution is not in of itself a 'personal attack'. The use of templates and talk page warnings to intimidate a user IS however an attack, and I would like to see this matter addressed. This is lawyering, baiting, and malevolent opportunism. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 00:47, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

I've been familiar with your work long enough to know not to bother directing the same suggestion to you." Guys, this is not a newbie we're talking about here.

<dd>I've had discussions with you on your interpretation of the phrase 'personal attack'. I honestly do not believe you know what a personal attack is. You've blocked me before and warned me before, and you've been quick to issue warnings, even with others failed to see what you considered 'personal attacks'. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html#His_Excellency" title="User talk:Bishonen">This</a> is suggestive that in the case of at least one of your warnings, your warning wasn't a product of an action on my part, but that you desired to issue a 'final warning' and that you went about fishing for a justification for it.

<p>I have reviewed the comments. The comments are not explicit personal attacks, but tend to be understood as personal attacks. They don't "establish" the personal attacks on the part of H.E. But anyhow, they are not constructive of course and harm the community and should be refained. I also agree with H.E. that Merzbow's use of those "harsh" warning templates was very inappropriate. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 01:05, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You'd think it didn't need saying that opinions don't acquire any miraculous virtue or special immunity against removal by being expressed in the form of a template, and yet I seem to spend a lot of my time lately saying it. Too many people have got the idea that if only they use a template, they're free to harass users by endlessly reverting their talkpages and threatening them. Planting warning templates frivolously and then triumpantly accusing the person who removes them of "vandalism" is misuse of process. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:02, 8 July 2006 (UTC).</dd>

I believe that <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> should be warned and other administrators should learn a lesson from <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a>’s case.

I don't understand why administrators block wikipedians from editing at wikipedia for 24hrs and during that time they say things about him that are not true, and the wikipedians who is accused can not even defend himself since he can not reply to those accusations. Administrators power should be limited they should tell someone who is above them before they can block someone from editing. And even if they block someone from editing then they should not post those comments until the 24 hrs ban goes by.--<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalman01_ae51.html" title="User:Salman01">Salman</a> 01:33, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank You for correcting me brother <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a>. Well I thought he was one, but if he isn’t an administrator then he should be posting those unnecessary tags on my talk page and he should tell an administrator about the problem he has with my edits. Then the administrator should come to me to hear my side of the story. He can not put unnecessary tags on my page if he is not an administrator. Wikipedians shouldn’t be allowed to go around and put tags on other wikipedians talk pages if they don’t like their edits. I mean I am a wikipedian I shouldn’t be going around to others wikipedians talk pages and placing tags if I disagree with their edits and/or their performance at wikipedia. I just don’t understand why isn’t its okay if I want to make my talk page shorter by deleting unnecessary and old comments. I only like to keep comments about current article that I am working on, I feel comfortable that way. But according to <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> is cannot delete any comments from my talk page because it helps other wikipedians decide how am I as an editor. Let me tell <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> that if other wikipedians want to find out how I am as an editor then they can always go to the history page of my talk page and find out from there. I just want those tags removed from my talk page and wikipedia should have some strict policies regarding administrators as well as other wikipedians.

<dd>Timothy Usher, should we also note you have been stalking Bishonen and harassing her on her talk page? That your edits have been deleted by other admins and that you have been threatened with blocks for continuing this behavior? If you take issue with Bishonen's actions, address the actions, not her. So far you have failed to do that. Same goes for you, Merzbow. This ANI is about you, you should probably defend yourself instead of taking pot shots at others. You are obliged to assume that her descisions are founded in her evaluation of the circumstances, evaluations and conclusions which she has an obligation as an admin to make for herself. It's amazing how people who've made a sport out of reporting 'personal attacks', seem so unaware of they're committing them. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 17:54, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did I necessarily agree with the shortening? Not really. But I don't feel that it showed "bias" on Bishonen's part. I think that's the main thing that irks me about how people treat admins here. There's an assumption out there that when we make a decision, that we're "taking sides". Because Bishonen shortened the block, then somehow Bishonen has taken his excellency's "side". It's like when I've blocked one party in an edit war and not other parties. I've been told that I'm taking their "side". "Side" has nothing to do with it. Upholding policy is. I've had differences with Bishonen recently. But she is a good admin. I would much rather see an admin be too lenient than too harsh. And as I said, she isn't showing bias here. She just felt like the block was too harsh. Period. Reading more into that action shows the bias of the person making the comment more than any perceived bias that the admin might have. She's just doing her job as an admin. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 14:00, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I didn't allege "bias" - what would be the point? But Bishonen undid both his indef blocks, not just this one, and has consistently popped up to defend him whatever the issue at hand. She did not just stumble across it - her association with H.E. stems from the FairNBalanced dispute, where she argued for a summary permanent ban, with no warning, of a user with no block log - for uploading a photo of a farm animal labelled "God" into his user space. I opposed this proposed permaban, at which point H.E. jumped in under his new username and starting attacking me. When H.E. was subsequently indef blocked for the first time, Bishonen sprung to his defense and suggested his conduct ought be viewed in light of the FairNBalanced discussion - the logical connection between which was never quite explained, beyond saying that H.E. might feel "besieged as a Muslim editor." Since then, she's acted as his patron on Wikipedia. Now she and H.E. are accusing me of "stalking" her - never mind that I've never even seen her username beyond this specific series of incidents.Timothy Usher 00:02, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I can tell -- and it's difficult to tell, since as always you are levelling accusations without bothering with niceties like diffs -- this description of things is almost entirely wrong. You didn't allege "bias" but Merzbow did and your response to that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=62697195&amp;oldid=62693910" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=62697195&amp;oldid=62693910" rel="nofollow">[74]</a> clearly was intended to support the allegation. You claim Bishonen undid both his indef blocks but a simple look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:His_excellency" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:His_excellency" rel="nofollow">block log</a> disproves that.

<dd>Am I always? I used to be pretty handy with diffs when I had the time to sink into it. When it becomes clear that nothing comes of it anyhow, it's a less appealing use of one's time. Suppose I produce diffs supporting every word of every sentence I'd written: what then? What difference would it make?

<p>What! "take appropriate measures against Merzbow"! I thought H.E. is the one who is accused. H.E.'s comments were definitely harming the community and discouraging good editors like Merzbow, but Merzbow just lost his cool a bit and posted "harsh" warning templates that was very inappropriate. But just a reminder solves the whole issue. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 01:12, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aminz, look at the title of this entry. I filed it. My accusation is that Merzbow is using the NPA warning template and subsequent Vandalism warning templates as measures of threat and intimidation. I do not know what the policy is on actions such as these, but the evidence of bad faith in these actions are clear. The accusation was a false one, and the warnings were acts of vandalism on my talk page, entered in bad faith. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 01:17, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe your comment is a little too little. Clearly what's being discussed here is more than just a warning. It's the use of a warning, based on obviously bad-faith mischaracterizations, and subsequent threats of blocks with the intent to threaten and intimidate, and then affect a block by appealing to a trigger-happy admin (of which we have an abundance of). It's a trick that's been used before. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 04:48, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Someone tell me how a description of a fellow editor as 'intellectually dishonest' doesn't count as a personal attack or at LEAST a good-faith interpretation as one and I'll admit the warning was unjustified.

<dd>Seems that half of the effort around here goes towards a handful of persistent problem users - in this case, one that had already been indef blocked twice. What a waste of time.Timothy Usher 00:06, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Let me explain something to you for the fifth time or so. It is ArbCom's job around here to deliberate upon how best to deal with those some allege to be "persistent problem users". It is only when there is complete and unambiguous agreement that community-based bans should be made. It is obvious that such agreement does not exist here. Those who would have HE banned are wasting our time by not opening an ArbCom request. I am not giving you this advice to try to get you to go away or to brush you off. I have participated in the ArbCom process several times and have found it to be effective at identifying and sanctioning disruptive or problematic editors. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 00:23, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, my User page is under attack by an AOL vandal. The vandal wants to insert a claim that <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Tech_University_5feb.html" title="Texas Tech University">Texas Tech University</a> is a "flagship" university, which has a defined meaning in Texas and is not a matter of opinion.

<li>I don't understand what Spahbod did to be blocked, but it is clear he is a sockpuppet of some user.

<p>Something related to note here: I've recently been checkusering WOW accounts to discover sleeper accounts used by the same user, and I've noticed that many of them make what seem to be legit contributions (some even report their own previous WOW actions) and then go on a WOW spree. Not much that can be done in most cases, but if you notice anyone who has a borderline WOW username asking for an unblock, have that in mind. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 06:39, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Just a heads up for anyone who checks the category; there are a lot that you might not recognize. Most of the original Sunholm blocks were done by Theresa Knott with WOW in the reason. Additionally, I've done several checkuser blocks of suspected socks; if you have any reason to suspect they may have been errors, see me and I can offer more information. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 15:28, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While it serves a valid purpose I'm not a big fan of this template and protecting talk pages of blocked users because I've seen it used to enforce questionable blocks without impartial review in the past. Maybe we can come up with an alternate process to discourage both that and the continuing use of 'unblock' in obvious cases. Perhaps requiring that any protecting of a blocked user's talk page needs to be listed in a central location until the block/protection expires - for review that the block and protection are legitimate. In theory this <i>should</i> be happening on the list of protected pages already, but it generally doesn't. Perhaps just a matter of firming up the instructions? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 19:00, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll note that until as recently as about a year ago, blocked users couldn't edit anywhere on Wikipedia, period. Blocked editors had to use the mailing list, IRC, or email to the blocking (or another) admin. The sky didn't fall, and blocks still got discussed. In other words, in our worst-case scenario here (protecting the talk page of a blocked editor) all those other avenues are still open, and those options represented the <i>only</i> choices for blocked editors until quite recently.</dd>
<dd>I'd say that in general we should discourage (but not bar) admins from protecting the talk pages of editors that they have blocked. I'm also curious to know if anyone has examined the use of {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblockabuse_4969.html" title="Template:Unblockabuse">unblockabuse</a>}} in a systematic way, to determine if there really is a problem here. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 19:42, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm looking for advice as to how to proceed here, since no amount of discussion with JzG will convince him that we don't have ulterior motives.

<dd>I rather doubt anybody is going to block an obviously good-faith user who made a mistake and then got riled-up by a formalistic use of vandalism templates. Please try to approach users more diplomatically. I suggest you move on now. If you must have a policy basis for it, see <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>: please focus on editing articles rather than "triumphing" over the "enemy". <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:40, 8 July 2006 (UTC).

<dd>You are correct, I made a mistake. I don't appreciate the way that the mistake was pointed out to me. William didn't <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> and responded to me with vandalism templates rather than informing me of the proper way to handle the situation. I've been around for 2 years and 3,000+ edits and would have appreciated civility instead of threatening to block me due to my mistaken understanding of categorization changes. It is time to get over it and focus our energy on improving Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacophony_1b6a.html" title="User:Cacophony">Cacophony</a> 00:15, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find it very disturbing that the user bars any messages that hurt his reputation from his talk page. Your behaviour and beliefs are childish. Hating someone for the rest of your life?

<dd>Maybe he just doesn't understand the spirit of the wiki (trying to be AGF as much as I can). I hope he will respond here. If he wants to continue to work with everyone I think we would all like that, just with a different attitude.
