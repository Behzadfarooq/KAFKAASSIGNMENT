<dd>It would certainly be better in terms of promoting the posting of content which is illegal. Whether than would improve Wikipedia is another question entirely. Often illegal material is an improvement, I admit, but more often it is a disimprovement. Moreover, the majority of uses of anonymity have more to do with offensive behaviour than with unlawful behaviour. A wiki version of rotten.com might have a use, but I would prefer not to go there myself.<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminorex_1d55.html" title="User:Aminorex">Aminorex</a> 14:55, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Genuine_Advantage_3179.html" title="Windows Genuine Advantage">Windows Genuine Advantage</a> has been brought to my attention by another wikipedian of bringing not only illegal cracks about windows to wikipedia for no reason, but it gives explicit instructions about how to carry the hack out. I have no problem bringing the cracks to public attention in the article but I think that it is a little overboard to give intructions on how to carry them out.

<p>I'd like an uninvolved administrator to have a look at EffK's account. He came to Wikipedia about a year ago, I think, and had the name <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamekeeper_f5a0.html" title="User:Flamekeeper">User:Flamekeeper</a>. He did not feel comfortable giving an e-mail address to Wikipedia, so when his computer rebooted, and he couldn't remember his password, he had to register a new account - <a href="../../../f/i/a/User%7EFiamekeeper_763f.html" title="User:Fiamekeeper">User:Fiamekeeper</a>. He lost computer cookies again, so he registered <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorecticus_3427.html" title="User:Corecticus">User:Corecticus</a>. Then he registered as <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamekeeper_69ec.html" title="User:Famekeeper">User:Famekeeper</a>. Then he registered as <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPureSoupS_5561.html" title="User:PureSoupS">User:PureSoupS</a>, and finally as <a href="../../../e/f/f/User%7EEffK_b5e6.html" title="User:EffK">User:EffK</a>. It was not at all a case of decitful sockpuppetry. He never tried to use multiple accounts to violate 3RR or to vote twice; nor did he attempt to hide his old identities. Each account was abandoned as he moved on to the next.</p>
<p>He had a theory that Pope Pius XII had actively collaborated with Hitler (not just that he hadn't done enough to condemn him), and kept making really long, incoherent posts about how Pope Benedict should order Pope Pius's body to be exhumed so that Pius could face trial and be excommunicated. He antogonized not only the "loyal Catholic" editors, but also those who felt that Pius had been negligent, and those who were not Catholic at all. He also engaged in numerous personal attacks, particularly on the editor <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">User:Str1977</a> - "the brother of the murderer . . . a deep despair hiding in your Catholic soul . . . your morality is highly objectionable . . . you read Hitler's mind and reveal his thoughts, and they are yours . . . shocking . . . sinister . . . a source of moral pollution . . . you will have to be controlled . . . a lost sheep . . . on the point of mental sickness", etc. The talk pages of <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_XII_dc66.html" title="Pope Pius XII">Pope Pius XII</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler%27s_Pope_311e.html" title="Hitler's Pope">Hitler's Pope</a>, etc. were flooded with thousands of words, which were often so incoherent as to be almost impossible to understand. He also attacked <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">User:Robert McClenon</a>, telling him something like "Go wash out your mouth with soap and say a hundred rosaries for your lie to Wikipedia." In fact, SlimVirgin gave him a warning for that post.</p>
<p>He began to post things on Jimbo's page, about how the Vatican was trying to take over Wikipedia and the world. Jimbo quite kindly advised him to leave Wikipedia while he still could, with his head held high, and his dignity intact, as he seemed to be the kind of editor who would be banned eventually. He left then, for a few weeks, but came back, calling on Wikipedia to ban Str1977 as a Vatican agent. (He thinks that Str has been commissioned by the Vatican to join Wikipedia specifically for the purpose of opposing him.) He would also post things about how his own life would be in danger if anyone on Wikipedia discovered his identity, as the Vatican agents might have him pushed out of a train.</p>
<p>I think that Str1977 generally treated him quite kindly and patiently. I couldn't help liking him, in spite of my (wiki-)friendship with Str1977, who was the main target of his attacks, and in spite of the fact that he attacked me a few times. Eventually Robert McClenon filed a request for Arbitration. Str1977 gave evidence, and I did as well. The result was that EffK was banned from Wikipedia for one year, for his personal attacks. He was banned indefinitely from any articles dealing with the Catholic Church. And he could also be blocked by any administrator for causing disruption to any article.</p>
<p>He then joined Wikinfo, and began to make long posts there.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=User_talk:EffK" class="external free" title="http://www.wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=User_talk:EffK" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=User_talk:EffK</a></p>
<p>After a while, an administrator decided enough was enough, and banned him indefinitely from there.</p>
<p>The next thing I noticed was that he had joined the French Wikipedia</p>
<p><a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:EffK" class="external free" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:EffK" rel="nofollow">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:EffK</a></p>
<p>I don't think he is interested in editing. He just wants to use it to promote his theories.</p>
<p>While the ArbCom case was going on, he kept making long posts. Sometimes he would copy an entire section of several thousand words to a different and unrelated talk page; sometimes he would just post a short sentence like "I am excessively offended by this arbitration". He frequently referred to Str1977 as a Vatican agent (commenting on the fact that Str started editing Wikipedia just after the election of Benedict XVI), and to Robert McClenon as his side-kick. Eventually one of the arbitrators got impatient and reverted one of his long posts.</p>
<p>After he was banned, he was still technically able to edit his talk page, and continued to do so. Sam Korn said that it could be protected if he continued to use it as a soap box, so after he had engaged in a few more attacks against Str1977, Str applied for protection, and Woohookitty protected. I felt a bit sorry for EffK, as I knew this would cut off all means of communication (as he refuses to give Wikipedia his e-mail address), so after a few days, I asked Str if he'd mind if I unprotected, after giving EffK a warning that it would be reprotected again if he continued to use it that way, and that it would remain protected. Str said he was more than happy to give him another chance, and he had never intended to cut off communication completely, so I warned EffK, and unprotected. I also sent a note to Woohookitty.</p>
<p>After the unprotection, EffK behaved himself for a while. Str welcomed him back, and answered some of his questions. But then, he began to indulge in the long soapbox posts again. For most of the time while he was on Wikipedia, nobody at all sided with him, because his behaviour was so extreme. Even those who thought that Pius XII was negligent would have nothing to do with him. However, just approaching the end of the arbitration case, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">User:Bengalski</a> joined forces with him, and began to complain about the way he had been treated. Bengalski made no mention of any of the personal attacks EffK had made, but criticized those who had brushed him aside. Sean Black replaced the lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ong contents on EffK's user page with a notice saying that EffK had been banned, and Bengalski reverted it as vandalism. Sean reverted it again, and Bengalski complained at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_alerts_4982.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts">Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts</a> and at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_945d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration</a>. He then copied EffK's version of the EffK user page to his own user page, presumably as an act of solidarity, and edited EffK's page to say that the contents could now be found at <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">User:Bengalski</a>. More recently, Bengalski edited EffK's page to make it look as if EffK had been banned simply for trying to include information that was critical of Pius XII, when in fact he was banned for greatly disrupting the talk page of almost every article he ever went near, and for engaging in numerous personal attacks.</p>
<p>If anyone looks though the history of his talk page since I unprotected (with warning) on 16 February, he/she will see that he's just been clogging it up, and using it as a soapbox. I have given him a few more warnings, and told him that I really didn't <i>want</i> the page to be protected again, but that I could see that it was going in that direction. Bengalski archived it for him (which I'd have been happy to do), but it's still a massive clutter. He got very offended recently because of a remark I made at the talk page of <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler%27s_Pope_311e.html" title="Hitler's Pope">Hitler's Pope</a>. Someone was accusing the Catholic editors of POV pushing, and I pointed out that a high average of edits per article indicated an agenda, and Pius's defenders had a lower average than his critics. That drew the following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EffK&amp;diff=46642804&amp;oldid=46435990" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EffK&amp;diff=46642804&amp;oldid=46435990" rel="nofollow">outraged comment</a>. He threatened me that I wouldn't get away with blanking his page, because Bengalski was watching me, and made eight demands of me(scroll to the bottom of the diff section). I tried, reasonably successfully, to calm him down, but now he's making more attacks on Str1977, and is asking Bengalski to copy more of his material onto Bengalski subpages.</p>
<p>Would a neutral admin be so kind as to look into the history of the page, and if you think you need to blank and protect it, please do so as gently as you can. I think the poor guy is completely sincere in his belief that Wikipedia is full of Vatican agents who are planning to take over the world, and his extremely eccentric and obsessional behaviour can be partly excused on those grounds. Nevertheless, his behaviour, at least on the English Wikipedia, has been highly disruptive, and I can understand that the arbitrators couldn't allow it to continue. Also, I'd like feedback about Bengalski putting the contents of a banned user's page onto his own page. Thanks. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 10:48, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Poor guy. I feel sorry for him as well. I'd say just ignore him and leave him in his sandbox. But if people are actually reading and cares enough to take offense of what he writes and want it locked down, I can't see we have any choice as it clearly is against policy. But if leaving him alone on his talk page for now is fine for those involved I don't see much harm in it, despite soapboxing rules etc. Silently ignoring someone is often most effective. But he should really just get a blog somewhere. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 13:48, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This is a rather one-sided account, and as I'm mentioned a few times here I feel I need to make a few comments. First: personally I don't understand why Ann has such a problem with EffK continuing to post his views on his talk page - what harm is it doing? Ann has said before that she is concerned he is wasting server space, but I disagree that this really an issue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second, it's not the case that EffK is using his talk page just as a soapbox. If you look at it you will see that most of what he's been doing there falls under two categories. Mainly, he is using it to communicate with me about my edits to pages he is interested in. As an active editor on those pages, I find his notes useful. The other thing he's doing is protesting what he sees as the injustice of his ban. I don't see why this is a problem for WP, and nor I think did the one arbitrator who answered my request for a comment on that at the arbcom discussion page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Third, Ann is quite right that EffK was banned for, amongst other things, personal abuse. I don't dispute that. What she doesn't mention is that EffK also had a positive contribution to make to wikipedia. The dispute between him and a number of Catholic editors began over his trying to include information critical to the catholic church in the period of the rise of Nazism. In particular, he had found writers who argued that there was a 'deal' cut between the Vatican and the Nazis in which the German catholic political party voted for Hitler's dictatorship (the <a href="../../../e/n/a/Enabling_Act_39b1.html" title="Enabling Act">Enabling Act</a>) in return for Hitler's agreement to a treaty (the <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichskonkordat.html" title="Reichskonkordat">Reichskonkordat</a> giving an official concessions to the Church. EffK's claims were treated unfairly, labelled as conspiracy theory by biased editors, and the dispute degenerated from there. Now I am not defending all of EffK's conduct after that (maybe it's true I'm not attacking him for it either, but then he's got enough opponents doing that). But for me it is important that he was trying to include verifiable information and being blocked from doing so by a group of editors pushing a strong pro-Church POV. I note that most of EffK's 'conspiracy theory' claims are now included in the relevant article (<a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_XII_dc66.html" title="Pope Pius XII">Pope Pius XII</a>), after other editors got involved and I found further very respectable sourcing for them.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To sum that up: EffK was making substantive, verifiable claims which are not at all lunatic conspiracy theory; they are points which I, and other editors, are still working on - and I still find it valuable to communicate with EffK about them; the conduct of the editors who deleted and dismissed EffK's points also should be considered. I haven't been acting out of 'solidarity' alone: I genuinely believe EffK has a contribution to make, and yes I have used my own userpage to help him do that. I think I am entitled to that choice.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Fourth: I am all for neutral editors taking a look at this. Though I don't think it should be just admins: if, as it looks from Ann's post here, there is going to be an ongoing dispute between us on this issue, perhaps we should take it to an RfC or even mediation. If that happens though neutral parties need to bear in mind that Ann also has a clear bias here. She has as strong an agenda as anyone else concerned with these pages, and has actively engaged in edit warring to support her POV. I don't think it's a bad thing to have opinions - I certainly have some. I do believe a first step towards overcoming that in our work here is to be honest about it.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 21:41, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really enjoy hunting down copyright violations on Wikipedia but one thing that neither I, nor any other admin, likes doing is dealing with the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright_problems</a> backlog. The reason I know that no other admins like working this page is because the work is incredibly tedious, resulting in a two-week backlog. Very few of the copyright problems on the page require any insight--they are blatant violations with the original url in the copyright violation template. Because of this, I'd like the challenge the very industrious programmers who make all the great Wikipedia bots to see if someone can create a bot that would examine pages with the {{subst:article-cv|Article Title Here}}, compare the copy on the page with the link to the supposed original page, and then either delete the article if there is a match or remove the copyright violation template if there isn't. Any articles that are not a close match could be left for a human admins to examine. However, if the bot could catch most of the 80-90% of copyright violations that are extremely blatent, we admins would be able to get a handle on this extremely important issue. As an incentive, I will publically award a "Grand Poo-Bah of Bot Designers" award to the first person who creates a workable copyright violation bot. Any thoughts from other people?--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 00:10, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My immediate thought is that I feel very uneasy, to the point of objection almost, at handing a bot deletion powers on <i>any</i> of our deletion processes. Indeed, I feel uneasy at handing a bot any kind of admin powers. (Yes, I know Curps has just such a bot, but I don't feel completely at ease with that, either.) A better challenge by far would be for admins to go to <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> and so some of the (easy) work that is available over there. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:13, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it would be somewhat easy to create a bot to do it, its the accuracy / potential for error that is the problem as is giving a bot sysop access. Splash has expressed concerns about any bot having admin access and I'm leaning to agree. We do have an idea on how to execute it and it would likely be possible but I don't think speedy by bot is a good idea. I'd be in favour of a db tag which would be a quick look / hit delete by a human but I don't think the community at large will support an 100% automatic bot. Most of the problem is all of the Wikipedia mirrors and forks, some are (illegally) not showing gfdl / source notices and we wouldn't want it deleting based on those sites -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 00:20, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Then perhaps there is some solution that would have sufficient parameters to aid in the backlog but not worry people. The problem is that as the number of Wikipedia users rise, the number of blatent copyright violations are also rising. At one point not too long ago the copyright problems backlog was one month. As I said, a bot could easily (depending upon how difficult the programming is) compare the source url with the article and see how closely they resemble each other. Perhaps the bot could then give a percent grade on how similar the article and source material are. A human admin could then look at that data and delete using another mechanism (preferably one in which large numbers of articles and their percent similarities can be evaluated quickly and deleted as needed). Personally, I think we have to do something drastic like this because under copyright law we can be found liable if our backlog keeps growing and results in a months-long wait for deletion.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 00:30, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Defensive registration of the username only, Tawkerbot's have had a "fan club" of sorts that like to make impostors, I'd figure I'd grab it when I can. I'm not planning on making any fast requests, this bot is still (literally) on paper, no code has been written. Besides, even if I want to work on a "flag bot" it really doesn't fit under either Tawkerbot (1, flagged bot) or Tawkerbot2 (vandal revert-o-bot) so a unique username is necessary -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 03:12, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Excellent news. Any help I can give, such as testing or feedback or dealing with combative editors, let me know. In fact, I'd be happy to handle the debate and vote aspects of this when we're ready (I assume that before we go that far people would want to know exactly how the bot will work). Anyway, thanks again. Anything that would speed up this tiresome process is greatly appreciated.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 00:38, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there is a large window for missuse. Anyone could potentially create a website, copy and paste the article to it, and wait for the bot to look at it, and delete since it's a 100% match. There is no way for the bot to recognize when the website was created, to know if it was created for the soul intention of deleteing the wikipedia page. --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 00:49, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Deletion by bot is <i>not</i> a good idea. Most cases are easy, but some are not. Some are copy-pastes of public domain websites, some are GFDL'd (rarely), many are forks and so on and so on. There are two good solutions: fix CSD A8 to actually be more than the worthless piece of verbiage it is at the moment, and to educate and encourage admins to clear <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a>. Doing it by bot is to do it by laziness, and that's really not good. We have never, to my knowledge, handed a piece of code the right to nuke articles. Just because it <i>can</i> be done, does not mean it <i>should</i> be done. In the area of copyright problems, a human's common-sense is needed more than a senseless bot. We have so many bots crawling around this place doing useless things that there is a tendency to bot-ify every tedious task. Some tasks are tedious, but still need the tedium to be gone through. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:59, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What about, instead of a bot to try and sort out the current backlog of copyvios, a bot that looks at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENew_pages_7e35.html" title="Special:New pages">new pages</a>, picks out a few sentences from each (relatively large) new article, and uses a search engine to see if these have been copied from somewhere. If it matches, then the article could be flagged for quick deletion (or even automatically deleted by the bot, if it were to have that ability). This won't help clear the backlog, but it would reduce the amount of additions in the future, hopefully. <a href="../../../m/d/8/User%7EMD87_8476.html" title="User:MD87">MD87</a> 02:02, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The part of this that amounts to "any article which has a few words in common with something on the web" is the germ of a good idea insofar as it would expand A8. Obviously it would need to be much better than this. The bot doesn't need deletion powers if we do it by improving the speedy criterion, since admins are easily on top of <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a> at most times. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:07, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I meant to say that the bot would use a few sentences as the search terms, then retrieve matching webpage(s) and compare the text properly (either by just comparing the two texts, or by calculating the <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levenshtein_distance.html" title="Levenshtein distance">Levenshtein distance</a> or something similar). When it determines a match, it can mark it for speedy deletion as you suggested. <a href="../../../m/d/8/User%7EMD87_8476.html" title="User:MD87">MD87</a> 02:18, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Suggestion - first write a bot to identify copyright violations from <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a> (and tag and list the pages at <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a>). Do the QA there. When the bot's accuracy reaches 100% then consider letting it check and delete articles after their listing period. --<a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuk_82a4.html" title="User talk:Duk">Duk</a> 02:12, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with doing it after the page has been created, though, is that there are likely to be mirrors/other sites using wikipedia content. If the bot is patrolling <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a> then we can be sure that anything it finds was around before the WP article. Checking articles after they've been created means it would have to deal with possible mirrors/other sites using WP content. <a href="../../../m/d/8/User%7EMD87_8476.html" title="User:MD87">MD87</a> 02:18, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Good point. It depends how the algorithm was written, I guess. If the article contents are a subset of another page, then someone would have to check; but if the article contains all of the content from another page, then it's probably copyvio. It's something that would have to be played with if/when the bot's developed <a href="../../../m/d/8/User%7EMD87_8476.html" title="User:MD87">MD87</a> 02:39, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't either. When I very first started editing here, one of the first things I did was bring over some information on the Irish language that had been on an old webpage of mine that I no longer had access to. Someone presumably on new page patrol found my original page and left a note on the talk page of the article pointing out the similarities and asking whether the information I was adding belonged to me. I said that yes, it did, and because I was dealing with a human being I could explain the situation. If a bot had just come along and replaced the text with a {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopyvio_c034.html" title="Template:Copyvio">copyvio</a>}} tag I would have been annoyed, frustrated, and as a then-newbie frankly <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bitten</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 07:23, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Add me, I don't think this is a good idea. The current speedy deletion criteria is for commercial content providers only, i.e. those we don't believe will contribute to wikipedia. Beyond that there are lots of possibilities, websites where the content is licensed in a compatible way, just without such a notice listed on every page, sites whose owners decide to contribute it to wikipedia, upon seeing the copyvio message add details to the article talk page etc. etc. To my mind there are too many conflicting possibilities for any simple algorithm to compute, start building more complex alogorithm and the risk of error rises. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 07:50, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We aren't talking about this bot working under speedy deletion copyright violation rules. We're talking about the bot dealing with the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright_problems</a> backlog. These articles go through the process of a human editor flagging the article, providing a url to source material, and then listing the article on the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright_problems</a> page. If a bot could make it easier for an admin to go through the large number of possible violations listed on this page and let the human admin more easily determine if a violation exists, then I don't see a problem--especially if the human admin remains the one to delete the article.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 13:30, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>How about instead of flagging article using the normal copyvio template, the bot just adds a template to the article or its talk page? Something that signals to a human editor, 'Hey, there's a strong similarity between <i>this</i> new article and <i>that</i> web site. Can someone have a look, please?' Explain in the template that the message was generated automatically, that the matter will be reviewed by a human being, and that the editor should add an explanation – if any – on the talk page.</dd>
<dd>I think such a compromise would resolve most of the concerns about newbie biting and inadvertant deletion of non-copyvios. The major cost of such a change, of course, is that it would slow down the process—we all know that the vast majority of apparent copyvios turn out to be genuine copyvios. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 12:56, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see this bot working in conjunction with human editors dealing with the copyright backlog (while I originally raised the issue of a bot deleting some articles, since there is strong opposition to this I would say this is not a feasible option). A human editor would still have to identify an article as a copyright violation and tag the article and provide a url to the original text (which is the current copyright violation process). Then if the bot could analyze the article text and the original text and give a percent similarity (50%, 90%, 100%) a human admin could come in and look at a large numbers of these articles and their percents and urls and delete those that rise to a certain level. If an article didn't rise to a certain level, or if the url was to a mirror site or something, the admin wouldn't delete without first examining the situation. As I see it, the bot would not be deleting the articles but merely aiding in examining the copyright problem. As it is now, the huge backlog is a problem that must be dealt with before it grows even bigger as Wikipedia grows. After all, we don't want to be found libel under copyright law for allowing copyrighted text to stay up on Wikipedia for long periods of time.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 13:23, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see hot the bot giving a percentage really helps. Even if it is a 100% copy you still have to go to the source and determine if it is a possible copyright violation. So what time is saved? Kotepho 16:51, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, if the bot gave a 100 or 90% rating and the url wasn't to a mirror site, I'd say the admin could safely delete the article. That's where the time saving would come in.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 18:53, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That seems like an over simplification to me, if you go to the site and it says licensed under the GFDL? or that the author release it into public domain? It might be a 100% copy but certainly not eligble for instant deletion. Similarly I'm sure how you would recognise for sure it was/wasn't a mirror without visiting the site itself. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 19:15, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think where a bot would be useful is in finding probable locations of copyrighted material, and tagging the article with the apporpriate URL. I don't think this would be a terribly difficult task, and once my work settles down a bit, a task I look forward to taking a shot at. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshbuddy_ab10.html" title="User:Joshbuddy"><span style="font-size:150%;">j</span><span style="font-size:140%;">o</span><span style="font-size:130%;">s</span><span style="font-size:120%;">h</span></a><span style="font-size:110%;">b</span><span style="font-size:100%;">u</span><span style="font-size:90%;">d</span><span style="font-size:80%;">d</span><span style="font-size:70%;">y</span><sup><span style="font-size:90%"><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJoshbuddy_bd2b.html" title="User talk:Joshbuddy">talk</a></span></sup> 00:08, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That would be sweet. I've been finding a lot of copyvios as we get to the dregs of each month at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArticles_that_need_to_be_wikified_f3f9.html" title="Category:Articles that need to be wikified">Category:Articles that need to be wikified</a>. There is usually a very large percentage of copyvios in the category, but when you get down to the last few for that month, it's even worse. They also tend to be harder to find, since the easy ones are picked off first.</dd>
<dd>If you want to find possible copyvios, you could get a bot to look for articles with extra spacing between paragraphs, indented paragraphs, huge sections of text with no paragraphs, three or more spaces between words or after periods, no spaces between parentheses and text, articles that start a new line of text without a &lt;br&gt;, colon, asterisk or pound sign, and articles that don't start new lines before asterisks. Obviously, an article would have to have several instances of one of these or a combination of them to avoid marking a lot of non-copyvios for human review. The articles would be added to a possible copyvio category and people who like finding them could identify the source, or mark it for cleanup or wikification for non-copyvios. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 02:02, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This will help you guys to handle future problems. You create what is known as a Admin reserve. These will be "acting Admins" who are users who will be Admins for one month at the time, can be decommissioned AS admins by the <i>real</i> Admins for just cause. These reserve Admins are to come from long standing Wikipedia citizens. It'll take <b>2</b> real Admins to decommission a Acting Admin for just cause, teach the citizens about what being a Admin is all about, and if they do a good job,for one year, these will become regular Admins. The "Acting Admin" is to have a timer placed on the User page, have no means of resetting it, except by the real Admins. These "acting Admins are to be appointed, not nominated, elected.

<dd>If those acting admins are to be recruited from long-standing Wikipedians (with good reputation, I presume), what would prevent them from running for an actual admin post and get elected instead?

<dd>This is a emergency reserve, just like the reserves in the US Military and some US police forces, usually not entitled to run for political office while in the reserves,( while the citizens can run for office), because they can be called to active duty if the need arose, just like serving in the military or the police force. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 20:57, 13 April 2006 (UTC) <b>:)</b>

<p>I looked at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_FreddySmith_d3b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/FreddySmith">FreddySmith's contributions</a>, and came to the conclusion that FreddySmith's account was created not for creating an encyclopedia, but instead for attacking other users (probably his real life friends), and adding nonsense on their userpages, and so blocked him indefinitely.

<dd>Wait a little bit. I recall something about contributions from <i>before</i> Phase III sometimes appearing without any user account (because the conversion from Phase III wiped the accounts, or something like that). This means that there's nothing unusual about a username with contributions from 2001 (which AFAIK means before phase3) not existing as a user account. And the unicode one might be a mistake by Curps; perhaps some software of his got confused by some unusual use of Unicode. Unless someone can find a username with a <i>normal</i> name (no Unicode abuse), with <i>recent</i> contributions (after phase3 was installed), and with no account (no Special:Contributions link from the user page), there's no need to worry. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 01:04, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And, by the way, if someone wants to check with the toolserver replica, the contributions would IIRC have a user ID of zero in these pre-phase3 cases. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 01:06, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, thanks for clarifying that, CesarB. I haven't really been able to find any recent users with contribs who don't exist. Perhaps MediaWiki used to allow you to block non-existing users (hence the confusion with User:Ķûŕṕś). I found a user that contributed in December 2005 and no longer exists, but that's probably a special case.</dd>

<dd>Sorry if I went past the 3 reversions, but I thought I only did do 3.

<li>That's great! Just to keep in mind; WP:3RR doesn't mean you're allowed to revert 3 times in 24 hours. It's just a metric for showing when a revert war is getting out of hand. Many people ascribe to a one revert rule. If you get reverted, start working with people on the respective talk pages. The revert wars just tend to inflame angers, even if you're strictly speaking within the bounds of WP:3RR. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 21:36, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi everybody. Just a note to ask people to watch out when reverting part-blanking of articles: there may be a bug (affecting me and at least 2 other editors) that means the full article is not loading into the edit window.</p>
<p>If you see an edit that cuts the bottom off an article, of course revert it. But revert it manually - it's not vandalism - and above all <i>don't warn the editor with a template</i>. Write to them personally, perhaps to point them at <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5643" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5643" rel="nofollow">Bugzilla #5643</a>, but don't warn or block for it without good reason!

<p>User:Kherli has carried on a campaign of advocacy starting at an article titled m/z misconception, that is now deleted and then at <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass-to-charge_ratio.html" title="Mass-to-charge ratio">mass-to-charge ratio</a>. Mediation has failed. Currently the article only has factual inaccuracies, misleading information and disproportionate representation but that is after an extended period of being corrected by myself and other users, incl. moderators about advocacy. He has learned that to push his POV he must appear legit. Also not his user page which is a diatribe against m/z.</p>

<p>A group of rogue administrators have been conspiring to prevent the creation of the Fred Moss article. The page survived votes for deletion, but since then this small band of vandals has deleted the article and has been using terror tactics to prevent its re-creation. Those who edit the page or even so much as argue for its existence are tagged as sockpuppets of a vandal, <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamish_Ross_1b27.html" title="User:Hamish Ross">Hamish Ross</a> and are then blocked unfairly. All their edits are removed and messages are deleted so no-one can read the valid arguments. They also claimed that an uploaded .ogg file version of the Fred Moss page contained vandalism, even though they offered no proof. Something has got to be done about this, it simply isn't fair, they are abusing their admin priviliges.</p>

Thank you very much for your help recently (see "Vandalisms and insult" above). And now I can see that my suspicion was true – it is my "special friend" from Germany. Because, you know, he deleted so many new paragraphs before only for the purpose to get exactly that one paragraph back, he had "re-reinstalled" again. I deleted it giving my reasons. The paragraph in question had been integrated in most part into the first one in the new section "UFO origin hypothesis" written by me, but he does not care. Now the paragraph is in the article twice. He doesn't care. And he placed it in section "Project Blue Book", where it does not belong. It's all the same to him.

Indeed, I pointed out an observation about your haste to label opposing edits as vandalism, which has occurred with an anon and now over the Multiverse thing, which I don't particularly care about; that's a observation, not a personal attack.

<p>On 14 April 2006, I removed a fair use image from <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingsean1_f598.html" title="User:Kingsean1">User:Kingsean1</a>'s userpage (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Kingsean1&amp;diff=48455442&amp;oldid=43326476" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Kingsean1&amp;diff=48455442&amp;oldid=43326476" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). My grounds for the removal of these images is <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair_use#Policy</a> item #9. On 16 April 2006, Kingsean1 reverted the removal without comment or edit summary (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Kingsean1&amp;diff=48640644&amp;oldid=48455442" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Kingsean1&amp;diff=48640644&amp;oldid=48455442" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). On 16 April 2006, I left a note on his talk page requesting that he remove the image in question as it was a fair use image (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kingsean1&amp;diff=48740592&amp;oldid=43185139" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kingsean1&amp;diff=48740592&amp;oldid=43185139" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>). Since then, Kingsean1 deleted my comment from his talk page, ignoring my request for him to remove the image. I've no wish to engage in an edit/revert war with this individual, and am thus posting this here for other admins to comment and/or take corrective action. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 12:27, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

He used the edit summary "do not revert this" when removing the comments I left from his talk page but I just left it as the images had been removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Max_rspct&amp;diff=48750346&amp;oldid=48750049" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Max_rspct&amp;diff=48750346&amp;oldid=48750049" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>.

<dd>My opinion would be that speculation is allowed, if it can be sourced, and if it's not just one fan's rumor (i.e. semi-reliable). I would say that if a news source (not a message board) reports on a rumor, or at least the existence of a rumor, it doesn't violate the "Crystal Ball" principle. Anything else violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 00:05, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, current policy on Lost pages is to only allow speculation from "the ABC website, official LOST websites, official episode descriptions, and interviews with cast/producers/writers/directors." I guess that covers all the sources you said - a news source would be the ABC website or an interview, and none of the above contain message boards. So, do you think the policy is adequate? If so, should <a href="../../../3F/_/%28/__%28Lost%29_1b68.html" title="? (Lost)">? (Lost)</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Minutes_%28Lost%29_7db6.html" title="Three Minutes (Lost)">Three Minutes (Lost)</a> be deleted as they are both articles about future episodes contain purely speculation from message boards, spoiler sites, etc. and no official sources?

Mostly because it's not benign enough to do by bot and secondly I don't entirely trust a find and replace mechanism to do this correctly. For the record there were 94 instances of this template transcluded on other pages at the time it was speedied as per my request as a [[WP:NOT}] violation. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 07:13, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not convinced that this template was in fact a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. The relevant section says, "Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place." I don't know about all of the articles which used this template, but I'm sure that there are many individual television episodes which could be described as "almost certain to take place". Whether they are notable is another question, but since the larger issue of whether individual television episodes should have pages is still open, I don't see why an individual episode scheduled to air in two weeks is intrinsically less notable than an individual television episode which aired last month.</p>
<p>It is true that <i>pages</i> which use this template may be chronic violators of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, but that's not the fault of the template. If anything, that's a reason for the template's existence: editors could use it to patrol such pages and make sure that everything in them is factual and appropriately cited (as Ral315 suggests above).</p>
<p>I also don't see a substantial difference between this template and <a href="../../../f/u/t/Template%7EFuture_election_04a8.html" title="Template:Future election">Template:Future election</a>, <a href="../../../f/u/t/Template%7EFuture_film_c6a4.html" title="Template:Future film">Template:Future film</a> or most of the rest of <a href="../../../t/e/m/Category%7ETemporal_templates_a446.html" title="Category:Temporal templates">Category:Temporal templates</a>.

<dd>Having just had my watchlist flooded with incidents of this template being removed, I've had to look on the template talk page and through the <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETfD_0497.html" title="WP:TfD">TfD</a> logs before, via <a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a>'s contribution history, discovering that the discussion, which seems to show a lack of consensus to delete, was here. Given that the template was very widely used, speedying it seems all the more inappropriate. The only <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criterion for speedy deletion</a> of templates is "Templates that are divisive and inflammatory", and that clearly doesn't apply here - nor does it come under any of the "General" criteria.

<p>I'm afraid that I consider the manner of deletion of this template to be 100% incorrect. You don't just slap a speedy on a challenged PROD, particularly not when it requires you to invent a brand new speedy criterion on-the-fly, <i>and</i> respectable editors are telling you not to do it. <span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam_Bishop</a> (<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Bishop_0173.html" title="User talk:Adam Bishop">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adam_Bishop_a6c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adam Bishop">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">blocks</font></a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_protect_c66b.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_protect_c66b.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">protects</font></a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_delete_f5f8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_delete_f5f8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">deletions</font></a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_move_02c8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_move_02c8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">moves</font></a>)</span> should not have deleted the template with such a ficticious speedy tag on it. I have, therefore, per the obviousness of the situation and the debate at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> reversed the deletion and Pegasus1138 mass-removal of the template from articles. Had I seen him removing them at the time, I would certainly have blocked him. Also, I should say that I used administrative rollback with &amp;bot=1 to accomplish this to save both my time and RC-flood (the new option on watchlists also helps here). I dropped a note on Pegasus1138's talk page that I was going to proceed in this manner and made clear that I was not treating him as a vandal. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 17:21, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've lately seen a vandalism which has seriously messed up two literary articles (the most recent <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>), in which an anon vandal made a series of changes, some valid, some not; but since the vandalisms were spread out (and sometimes another person would make a valid edit in between them), an admin would come along, revert the latest vandalism or the latest few vandalisms, but not all the vandalism the anon had done. After awhile, the vandalism would tend to stand because a casual admin wouldn't even realize it has been done.</p>
<p>The most recent case I saw, on Hamlet, had the same vandal make a sprinkle of short valid edits, but removed two <i>entire sections</i> at two different times, without explanation. An admin caught the most recent and reverted two edits, but missed the earlier vandalism, which removed the section "Hamlet as a character." It was a very extensive section, and had a dead internal link to it, so I explored to see why it was removed, and then discovered the vandalisms.</p>
<p>So my point is: <i>When you see a vandalism, especially on an article that's not watched closely (like literary vs. political) see what other edits the same editor has made.</i> Otherwise we may lose valuable material for a period of time (with Hamlet it was a month) or for good. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 19:49, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excellent reminder; in general, one person who's vandalised will tend to vandalise more. Checking the contributions of the user is an excellent way of catching more vandalism. Always be vigilent.

<p>This is part of a broader problem for prominent articles: there are so many edits nowadays that if a bit of vandalism slips under the radar it is quickly buried under a mountain of new edits. And then one day you read a particular article and notice a nonsequitur or bit of nonsense or a truncated sentence, it is a major time-consuming archaeological expedition to try to recover the original valid text out of the last few thousand edits (far easier just to remove the damaged text than to fix it). I have seen such damage in major articles like <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah_Winfrey_92a2.html" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> and <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> that persisted for weeks or months.</p>
<p>You'd think this would be less of a problem for prominent articles that so many people have on their watchlists, but in fact it's often worse precisely because of the very high editing rate, and the fact that what people are watching is usually only the latest diff and nothing more. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 22:40, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks, while I was <i>supposed</i> to be on break&#160;:) , I have been receiving multiple e-mails from Squidward. After many messages back and forth (the current total is 50), we have come to some terms (I have not promised him anything, before you think I've been pretending to act on wikipedia's behalf.) He has stated that if his name was removed from the vandalism in progress page, as well as the links to other sites (he claims that we have implicated other people, "The Indianna Chess Club" for example) that all the attacks will cease. We could, alternately, delete the whole page, this is something he has been asking for which I thought a bit much, what do you think? I've also been receiving some angry e-mails from other parties whose sites have been implicated here. Apparently the names on this page, have particularly incited him, and I have his word (a vandals word yes, but I am inclined to believe him) that the attacks will stop.</p>
<p>From the e-mail exchange I've come to understand a bit about the background of his vandalist contributions. He started out as a 'normal' editor, but was branded as a vandal from the start. He saw himself as mistreated, and over-reacted to this by becoming what we know as the Squidward vandal.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, those terms are reasonable and we have little to lose, however, it may be viewed as "giving in".

<dd>(4-time edit conflicted) Wikipedia should not "give in" to anybody, espically a vandal. Perhaps after six months of non-activity it could be archived. But for now, if the vandalism continues, there is no reason to remove the entry. The more open proxies that we get, the better. These attacks, while a nuisance, are easy to clean up and give us many IP addresses to block that could have been used for other types of vandalism. <a href="../../../n/a/c/User%7ENaconkantari_d810.html" title="User:Naconkantari"><font color="red">Nacon</font><font color="gray"><b>kantari</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a>|<a href="../../../n/a/c/User_talk%7ENaconkantari_6fb8.html" title="User talk:Naconkantari">t</a>||<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Naconkantari_d2a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Naconkantari">c</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Naconkantari_cf78.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Naconkantari">m</a> 23:15, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a simple answer to that - send em and email stating that any further emails from em will be considered public, and you will forward them(without reading them) to wikien-l. Wait a bit for the wikien-l admins to request that you stop forwarding them, and then simply delete the emails.

<dd>I'm not an admin, but I have a question regarding this topic. I have reverted tons of squidward vandalism from multiple users. And, when checking the pages for those users, many have been said to be computer programs designed to vandalize. Do you guys think that this is one person? There is so much squidward junk. I don't see how it can possibly be one person. Also, if it were one person how could he have so many IP adreses? I don't understand how stopping one squidward vandal will stop them all. Can someone please explain this to me. Thnaks. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 22:26, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A minor problem over there, Davebrooky (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavebrooky_8017.html" title="User talk:Davebrooky">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Davebrooky_3157.html" title="Special:Contributions/Davebrooky">contribs</a>) is pretty insistent on external links to large numbers of minor software products. I've reverted it a few times in the past, but they keep coming back. Davebrooky has now added the following to the start of the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quote from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> 'There is nothing wrong with adding a list of content-relevant links to an article; however, excessive lists can dwarf articles and detract from the purpose of Wikipedia'. Therefore please link to internal articles where they exist, and only to external articles where there are not internal ones (e.g. because the application is in alpha). Administrators have raised concern about this page, so please leave this note here for the moment. Please also expand the article, so that it does not fall foul of any 'merely a list' criteria.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite aside fromt he problem of self-reference in main space, I think most of us would recognise that linking to external sites for software which is in <i>alpha</i> is certainly not good. I have recommended that internal links are included where they exist, and other software is discussed in prose in the article body if it has some unique or particularly innovative features which need to be discussed. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 21:43, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I recomend leaving the block in effect. His history is clear edvidence of intolerable behavior for the wikipedian community, and he's been given many chances. Given his circumstances, there's little reasoning to unblock. I'm making the assumption of good faith, but it seems he would rather be unblocked merely because he doesn't want to be blocked. And he also games the system. When he is blocked and his page protected from trolling, he sends massive amounts of e-mails to subvert concensus. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaman_Zero_2b31.html" title="User:Megaman Zero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegaman_Zero_f80e.html" title="User talk:Megaman Zero">Talk</a></sup> 06:13, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As the admin most aware of this editors history, I have to sadly conclude that at this time, I see little evidence that he/she has any intention of contributing in a positive manner to this forum.

<dd>Well, his IP is blocked so he can't currently create sock accounts. I can see no justification for bothering to offer mentorship just because he was forced by others to demonstrate his planned contributions. It's a smokescreen in my opinion and there have been numerous other editors that have produced far superior work and then still were banned due to violating policies. With the hundreds of new accounts that open everyday, I think our tie is better spent nuturing these newbies than wasting time trying to help a prolific vandal become a useful contributor, especially based on the severity of the disruption this editor has caused. Prasi90's block seems like a no-brainer to me.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 13:05, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is what I wrote on April 6 on this page:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I've never encountered Prasi90 before, but his clear pattern of abuse, apology and recidivism, and the rather low quality and quantity of his article contributions in the time he has edited Wikipedia, suggest to me that he's a permanent block candidate. I've no idea why Hamster Sandwich thinks that mentorship will turn this editor into a useful contributor, but as long as it's understood that we'll stand for absolutely no more nonsense, I don't see any great harm that can be done by letting him give Prasi90 one last chance.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>If Hamster is on a wikibreak and nobody else is willing to undertake mentorship, this editor should definitely not be unblocked. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 13:38, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The user has already been given a number of second chances, from what I've seen merely from having MONGO's talkpage watchlisted. Prasi will promise reform anytime, and so far it has meant nothing. He mounted a big campaign on IRC the other day for getting unblocked, and was told by me and others that his only option was to get MONGO himself to unblock him, we wouldn't touch it. We should stick with this. MONGO knows the case in detail, and AFAIC he had very good reasons for the block. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:02, 21 April 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I've favoured deleting this article for a while, and I might as well repeat my reasoning here:</p>
<ol>
<li>The last <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Game_%28game%29_%282_nomination%29_a8a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Game (game) (2 nomination)">in-process AfD</a> closed as 'delete'.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_The_Game_%28game%29_cbd0.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/The Game (game)">Deletion review</a> endorsed the closure despite the lack of numerical consensus, based on the lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>.</li>
<li>The argument for overturning the results of these discussions was an article in a Belgian newspaper. Very few people who 'voted' for deletion beforehand were convinced by the article into supporting its retention (for reasons discussed elsewhere). Most of the people who claimed to be convinced by the article appeared to be the same people who were happy not to have any sources at all.</li>
<li>Therefore, with little sign of significant numbers of people changing their minds, the discussion should have been closed the same as the last one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck in finding two or three uninvolved admins.

<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> has a flaw. Wikipedia is not allowed to be the first source to report on a fact; we have to wait until some other source that is deemed a verification source has already reported on it. We should not have to wait until there is a single "good enough" source. Having some number of Google hits should be good enough to say "yes, this is verifiable", even if none of those hits are good enough on their own to merit verifiability. What that "some number of hits" should be may need to be left up to interpretation. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 13:41, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you are saying all that a small but determined group of trolls needs to do to place Wikipedia's good name on a hoax is to create enough blog and chat page mentions to the hoax? A large number of Google hits is reason for a journalist or academic to begin an investigation of the subject, not verification that the subject exists as reported. News agencies and university departments are in a position to perform independent fact checking required to determine if the hits represent a true cross section of society or are just a smoke screen created by a handful of pranksters that know how to automate the process of spamming bulletin boards and usenet newsgroups. --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 14:38, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's why I'm saying that the "some number of hits" may need to be left up to interpretation. If there's X number of Google hits, but they can all be traced down to a handful of blogs, then it ain't good. However, if there's X number of legitimate hits, a large number of which are truely unique, shouldn't that be good enough verification? Perhaps something never becomes notable enough for a journalist or academic to begin investigation of a subject. Does that mean that the phenomena is not at all verifiable? Certainly not. Must Wikipedia wait until a journalist or academic has published something before we have an article about it? Certainly not, if there is some other reasonable level of verifiability. The Game (game) is a perfect case in point for this. I played it about two years ago, then wondered if Wikipedia had any information on it. Sure enough, the basic rules were here. Will The Game ever merit a journalist or academic write up? As just one of many social games, it may never get enough attention from the "standard" verification sources. This doesn't mean we can't verify it. Perhaps we can have a multi-tiered verification scheme: verified by journalistic/academic sources, verified by preponderance of data, and unverified (therefore deletable). - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 14:55, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That is only a "flaw" if you don't understand what Wikipedia is supposed to be for.

<ul>
<li>No, I do understand that. That doesn't mean the definition of "verifiable" isn't flawed. There are many ways to verify something's existence. Wikipedia's definition is designed to weed out self-promotion and self-publication, but in the process it also weeds out legitimate phenomena that may take years before our current allowable verification sources to notice. We have the power and responsibility as a collaborative effort to examine all possible sources and determine verifiability. Strictly following the existing "legitimate" sources doesn't allow us to react to data from other sources that, en masse, are legitimate even if individually those sources are not sufficient for verification. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 15:03, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In an encycloaedia, nothign is included unless it can be verified from secondary sources. The fact that a worldwide trawl for sources by a website set up specifically ot save this article could only find one mention in one Dutch language newspaper speaks volumes. We don't allow "teh Intarwebs" as a source fo good reasons; there are to many blogs of no provable authority. All people have to do is to cite <i>one</i> book on games which mentions this game.

See <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, google hits are more an indication of notability than verifiability. Furthermore, AfDs are not the location to create new policy. (And as someone who spent a lot of time in the AfD arguing for it being kept based on the belgian newspaper, it is highly annoying to have all these bad arguments for keeping being brought up, since it contributes to a deletionary reaction. If one doesn't have a policy/guidelines based reason for keeping something, you should probably not say it). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:00, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Because until we have <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> discussing it we can't be sure that it's covered <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrally</a>. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:12, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let me put this another way. What is the purpose of verifiability? Is it to say "this data is verified, you can trust us, don't bother with the man behind the curtain", or is it to say "this data is verifiable, you can prove it yourself". I posit that it's the latter; we don't verify, we provide access to verification. Journalistic and academic write ups are certainly and will remain the dominant vehicle for verification, but any legitimate level of multi-source data should be a sufficient vehicle for the reader to judge whether the article provides the right information, of if the article needs to be editted or removed. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 15:15, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>While it may have been justifiable before to delete the article over a lack of consensus by invoking WP:V, the source makes it not at all clear now that WP:V can be invoked. This is more verified than most articles we have. Why not go with the result of the AfD this time, which is (as it's always been on this issue) "no consensus, so keep"? Trying to overrule the AfD again will simply create more hostility and another deletion review, and won't solve anything. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">ɹəəds</span><span style="color: #63f;">ɹ</span></a> 15:25, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

The language of a source doesn't matter, but is it a notable source, a trustworthy source? Ultimately, I think 'The Game' needs better sources, and should have an {{Unreferenced}} tag added. Give it a week, and if there are still no sources then, delete it. However that is a rather odd way to close an AFD, and since the article has been around for some time and still no source, I lean towards <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 17:51, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think he wants more action verbs in your description of your decision process. "looked"..."inclined"...closed"...they don't tell a very interesting story.

<dd>If we are deleting articles that have been kept via AfD because of policy, there is something wrong with the policy.

<dd>Its slightly more complicated than that. The issue at hand is how to interpret policy. Zoe who interprets <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as not being satisfied by this source insists that since she has policy on her side (or so she thinks) the AfD result is irrelevant.

<dl>
<dd>I agree, however, I feel that even if one does think that this page violates policy, it still shouldn't be deleted since it passed AfD. I think that something in the system is wrong if we are deleting a page that was voted to be kept in the eyes of the contributors because of a policy. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 05:50, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I very much disagree (though I also disagree with Zoe's deletion). Sometimes, AFD is wrong. Sometimes consensus is wrong. It is of the utmost importance that everything in the encyclopedia be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, and no matter how many people vote <b>keep</b> on something that isn't verifiable, I believe that deleting it is the right decision. We're writing an encyclopedia here, and while process should be respected and generally followed, product is always ultimately the more important of the two.-<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolotet_39d2.html" title="User:Polotet"><font color="blue">Polo</font></a><a href="../../../p/o/l/User_talk%7EPolotet_bad8.html" title="User talk:Polotet"><b><font color="black">te</font></b></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Polotet_728d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Polotet"><font color="orange">t</font></a> 06:00, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My comment is taking into account the assumption that the vast majority of users will vote in accordance with their own interpretation of policy, which in this case says that the page was in accordance with WP:V and the page should stay. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 06:06, 22 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While I'd like that to be true, many of the keep and delete votes were for pretty inane reasons, and a significant segment of both looked like they were just staying the course as their main reason for their votes and comments rathers than for any policy based decision. The policy matters almost got lost in the shuffle. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:10, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm actually not sure at this point if we're really arguing or if we're just misunderstanding each other a bit, but I'll clarify what my opinion is. My experience is that AFDs and their voters will not always fully consider important policies like <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. For example, see all the fuss about <a href="../../../h/a/i/HAI2U_5bbe.html" title="HAI2U">HAI2U</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_shock_sites.html" title="List of shock sites">List of shock sites</a>, as well as many other examples. My suspicion is that at least some of the people voting keep in the The Game AFD would have voted exactly the same way without a verifiable source. While I'll certainly agree that the deletion of the article was wrong in this case, as there is an article which clearly backs up the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> claims, I won't agree that AFD always correctly interprets <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> needs to change if it's leading to the deletion of articles kept by AFD.-<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolotet_39d2.html" title="User:Polotet"><font color="blue">Polo</font></a><a href="../../../p/o/l/User_talk%7EPolotet_bad8.html" title="User talk:Polotet"><b><font color="black">te</font></b></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Polotet_728d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Polotet"><font color="orange">t</font></a> 06:22, 22 April 2006 (UTC) (edit conflict with <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">User:JoshuaZ</a> and he says most of what I'm saying except he says it better)</dd>

<p>Would someone explain to me how this is unverifiable? I can find LJ communities devoted to it, websites devoted to it, multiple posts to LJs over the course of months to the effect of "I lost the game." I am aware of people who play the game. There is clearly a game.

<dd>While I'm inclined to agree with you that verifiability even without the Belgian article should be clear in this particular case, allowing stuff on LJ to push an article past <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> seems to me to set a rather dangerous precedent.-<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolotet_39d2.html" title="User:Polotet"><font color="blue">Polo</font></a><a href="../../../p/o/l/User_talk%7EPolotet_bad8.html" title="User talk:Polotet"><b><font color="black">te</font></b></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Polotet_728d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Polotet"><font color="orange">t</font></a> 06:26, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whoa. That's a novel interpretation of verifiability. It is transparently verifiable that the game exists and is played, and that this is not a hoax being perpetuated on Wikipedia. The existence of a LJ community, among other things, is very obviously sufficient for this claim.

<dd>Novel? I thought it was standard. Read the first paragraph of our policy, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. This means that we only publish material that is verifiable with reference to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable, published sources</a>.</i> So... I really don't think I'm going out on a limb here. I'm not disputing that The Game exists (heck, I'm playing it - and losing as long as this keeps popping up on my watchlist), I just dispute that information about it is verifiable with reference to reliable, published sources. <a href="../../../l/i/v/LiveJournal_40d6.html" title="LiveJournal">LJ</a> <a href="../../../%21/3D/_/%21%3D.html" title="!=">!=</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 17:59, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, whether it's "publication-obsessed" or not, it's pretty explicitly clear that "Posts to bulletin boards and Usenet, or messages left on blogs, are never acceptable as primary or secondary sources," and, "Personal websites and blogs may never be used as secondary sources."

<dd>To note I unblocked the user not based on if the block would have been a valid <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a> block but on the basis that the block came some 24 hours after the last activity in the 3RR, the <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">blocking policy</a> is quite clear that blocking is prevantative not punative, so given that the disruptive activity had long since ceased, and the issue was being perused through other means (mediation) such a block could only be seen as punative. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 16:01, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
