<h2><span class="mw-headline">"RfA is not a vote" "ArbCom is not a vote"</span></h2>
<p>ArbCom results are based on the amount of support each principle gets: 8-1, 9-0, etc. That's a vote according to the dictionary. The debate leading up may not be, but the end result... its number <i>for</i>, number <i>against</i>. Where/how is this not a vote? Please illuminate it for me.</p>
<p>RfA results are based on a concensus based on the number of responses for, against, or abstain. Comments and commentary from reading them seem to indicate that the purpose of said commentary is to sway votes. Where/how is this not a vote? Please illuminate it for me. Also, please give me an example of an <i>actual already run RfA</i> that is not a vote, and why it's not a vote.</p>
<p>I am suspecting that the whole "They are not votes" comments here are simply because people don't/won't acknowledge that in ultimate function they <i>are</i> votes, but I will be happy to be proven wrong with examples and a good explanation of my apparent wrong-headedness. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 20:38, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>RfA isn't supposed to be a vote, but a discussion with Beauracrats having leeway to evaluate consensus amongst respondants. Like deletion debates, individual "votes" are evaluated on their contribution. Someone with few edits, who merely posts "*Confirm" or "*Oppose" would not carry the weight of a more established editor willing to explain their reasoning. The current reality of RfA may or may not approach this idea.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>ArbCom is "not a vote" for similar reasons. The arbcom is presumed to deliberate each point, in private, before casting a ballot. It's sort of like the Supreme Court, I supose. I think the ArbCom currently lives up to their idea more closely than RfA, simply because it's such a small (fixed) group that does have private avenues to discuss cases without getting lost in massive discussion pages on Wiki. Again, it's open to interpretation. --<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkSplotch_5c7c.html" title="User:InkSplotch">InkSplotch</a> 20:50, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While there is of necessity a resulting, binding decision that is a vote and is functionally similar, nevertheless discussion precedes that conclusion, and "votes" can be changed and are supported by reasoning. RfA is not simply placing a "Yay" or "Nay" in an unchangeable ballot box. In the case of RfA, a better analogy would be an entire political campaign, <i>including</i> the conversations and considerations that lead up to the election; regardless of the "vote", the non-citizen is not elected and the incompetent is vetted out. In the case of ArbCom, a better analogy would be an entire legal trial, <i>including</i> the courtroom evidence and procedures that lead up to the jury decision; the jury is carefully selected and the result of the decision is based on sufficient evidence and reasoning that proceeds from policy.</dd>
<dd>Neither of these processes are anything like a CNN online poll or whatever else you may think of as an example of bad voting. These processes admit the specific expression of an opinion, but that opinion is informed by reasonable consideration. It may be erroneous, it may not meet the ideal, but that does not mean labelling it a "vote" is a meaningful explanation of flaws.</dd>
<dd>Note also that nearly all ArbCom decisions are unanimous: they are applying a clear standard to specific actions in full agreement; in such cases, naming it a "vote" is absolutely meaningless. Similarly, RfAs require a strong supermajority—for every 1 person who opposes, there must be at least 3 who support—and most are nearly unanimous, above 95%. The greater the majority, the less like a typical vote it is; one person has less and less power as a supporting voter whereas an opposing voter has 3 times more power in preventing the conferment. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 21:20, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thank you. How then is a reverse RfA, in which people can change their points/opinions/"votes", inherently flawed compared to a standard RfA? The only numbers based thing for the Recall RfA itself was that consensus should be at least 80%. Is the only disagreement with that side of it then the "binding" wording? If so, easily amenable to be closed by beurocrat review as a normal RfA is, with the extra emphasis that a desysop should not happen UNLESS the support to do so is at LEAST 80%. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 21:28, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, right now many feel RfA is flawed because even with the 3-1 supermajority, it can still be flooded with popular votes. If true (and I'd agree that it is), than a reverse RfA would be vulnerable to the same thing. And on that basis, the more wide-reaching an admin's action might be, the more likely an unpopular vote might remove them for it, even if the action was right. The pedophilia crises would be an excellent example of how many admins on both sides of the issue might have been desyssoped in the heat of things. Even Jimbo probably would not have been safe. --<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkSplotch_5c7c.html" title="User:InkSplotch">InkSplotch</a> 21:41, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can absolutely guarantee that ArbCom deliberations are not mere "votes". Certainly, I think I'm in more of a position to know than anyone.&#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>So decisions are not made based on the number of support/agree votes each proposed decision gets? A proposed decision could have less than majority support and still be implemented?

<dd>90% of the ArbCom work is done in private where it is only seen by current and former ArbCom members. The "voting" on the on-wiki pages is basically just a formality that informs us of their decision. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;"><b>Cyde Weys</b></span></a> 02:06, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You can get a feel for the negotiation that goes on if you look at edits to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Irishpunktom_Proposed_decision_3aca.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Irishpunktom/Proposed decision">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Irishpunktom/Proposed decision</a>. The case could not be closed for days because some arbitrators dug in their heels about the remedy directed against an administrator. With the help of more evidence, they eventually won a rethink from one of the other arbitrators, who changed his vote on the desysopping proposal. As a result, that administrator will lose his sysop bit if the case is now closed in its current state (which seems likely).</dd>

<dd>Perhaps the solution is to turn <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdmin_recall_6cce.html" title="Wikipedia:Admin recall">Wikipedia:Admin recall</a> into a simply explained layman's guide to filing an arbitration case against an admin which one feels has violated policies and deserves to be desysopped, and allow direct consideration of such cases by the Arbitration Committee. Yes, it is rare that admins lose their bit but it is commensurately rare that admins commit egregious abuses of their buttons. Should there come a case in which the ArbCom refuses to desysop a truly abusive admin, then perhaps community consensus will support some form of more direct oversight. But until that time, I feel that this is a solution looking for a problem. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 02:39, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>*sound of crickets*</i> Hmm... it's quiet. <i>*wind blows, tin can rolls down empty street*</i> Too quiet. Why do I feel sometimes like people prefer to argue, and when a proposal is semi-sound they clam up? ^_^ One reason for <i>not</i> creating a new proposal is that "proposal fatigue" sets in. People say things like "Well, the last one failed after two days, so junk this one as well."

<dd>Tony, I think the problem most objectors have with ArbCom being the primary de-admin process is that it indirectly encourages cabalism and a disregard for the community. Admins well-liked by the ArbCom stand very little chance of ever being removed - even if they have lost the trust of nearly the entire community. This is not meant to suggest 'corruption', but merely human nature - complaints against our friends always seem less valid than those agaisnt people we do not know or dislike. That creates an imbalance which leads some admins to be more hostile to the community than they would be if they were still answerable to/part of it. Clearly it is inherently damaging to Wikipedia to have the community at war with administrators, and thus I believe we should work to restore a closer connection between the two. See my suggestion below, which (in parallel to the above) you might term 'basically request for adminship with an intermediate step' (intermediate step to weed out the frivolous). --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:07, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think 'DocMkII' is better, but still too 'processy' for my taste. I'd prefer something like;
<ol>
<li>One or more users submit a 'request for admin review' ('RfR') with diffs explaining why. Basically similar to the initial presentation of an RfC or RfAr. No rebuttals, statements of support/opposition, et cetera. Just the reasons for requesting review stated as briefly as possible and primarily with diffs.</li>
<li>A Bureaucrat reviews this request one week after it was first posted and judges whether the grounds for reviewing the admin seem sufficient that there is some reasonable chance of the admin being removed. There is no numeric basis for this... one diff from Danny or Jimbo where the admin does something possibly very damaging to the encyclopedia might be found sufficient while a hundred diffs of content disagreement reverts mis-labelled as 'vandalism' by a dozen recently created accounts might be dismissed. Determinant is whether the bureaucrat thinks the listed issues constitute something the community <i>might</i> de-admin over. This step exists solely to weed out/discourage frivolous requests. Obviously bureaucrats connected with incidents in the request and/or the admin should recuse themselves, but we choose bureaucrats precisely to make these kinds of decisions impartially.</li>
<li>If review is called for then the admin has a month to prepare a normal 'request for adminship' form with nominators, acceptance, and answers to a standard set of questions which would differ slightly from the current ones ('What admin tasks <i>do</i> you perform' instead of 'would', 'Please explain your views of the conflict(s) leading to this review', et cetera). If no RfA is prepared after a month it is the equivalent of the candidate not accepting the nomination and the user is de-adminned.</li>
<li>The RfA runs the normal course in the normal way and is then evaluated by a bureaucrat (preferably a different one than approved the review). I'd prefer to see the same standard of approval required, but given views about 'adminship inherently creating enemies' I suppose it might go as low as 'roughly 50% approval' required to remain an admin. If it did start out at a lower percentage I'd like to see it slowly raised over time so that admins are people who continue to enjoy high community support rather than just those who had it at one point.</li>
<li>If the reviewing bureaucrat does not find consensus support for the admin they remove the person's admin status (which became theoretically possible for bureaucrats a few days ago). The person is then free to re-apply at any time - though like other repeat RfA's a waiting period would be recommended.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Throw in some structure where no reviews can be filed until six months after the policy is adopted, that admins can't be reviewed until at least six months after they were promoted/last reviewed (not just review requested, but actually reviewed), and all current admins are notified on their talk page when the policy is adopted and I think that's it. Somewhat similar to DocMkII, but doesn't involve a full RfC, a 'vote' to initiate the review, or the ArbCom. Obviously, in most cases an RfC should be attempted before a 'RfR' is filed and Bureaucrats might take the lack of any effort to resolve the issue into account in evaluating whether to approve the review, but I don't think RfC should be directly tied in. The above is very close to the existing RfA process with the same decision makers (bureaucrats) and a minimum of extra procedure around it due to the special circumstances. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 10:45, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking over this latest suggestion actually helped point out the same problem I see in Aaron's Grey Box proposal that had been niggling at my brain. Your suggestion hinges on a Bureaucrat's approval to move forward. The Grey Box proposal rests on Arbcom's shoulders. I think in either case it's going to make these parties unpopular. What becomes of the Bureaucrat who decides not to forward on an unpopular admin? What happens when Arbcom declines to hear a removal case just based on community vote?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Temporary desysopping</span></h2>
<p>The German Wikipedia has a recall procedure where an admin's sysop flag is first removed temporarily (it is removed by a stweard and automatically restored by a local bureaucrat) after a recall vote with 2/3 consensus (AFAIK) of editors with more than 200 mainspace edits. This acts as a warning (analog of a short block), and only after this has been done and problems persist, a new RfA can be initiated. Maybe we should also have a method for temporary desysopping. That both sysopping and desysopping are currently quasi-permanent is perhaps not optimal. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 14:12, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Several points</span></h2>
<p>This proposal seems to treat checkuser and oversight rights as being "admin plus"; they're not. Checkuser and oversight are entirely independent of being an admin (one can actually have checkuser without being an admin, although the odds of that are rather remote). Secondly, checkuser authority is granted by the Foundation, not by the community. The Foundation policy on granting and rescinding checkuser rights does not give the community the power to grant or rescind them in a wiki which has an Arbitration Committee. Therefore, to the extent that this proposal purports to be able to revoke checkuser rights, it conflicts with Foundation policy. A similar argument applies to oversight.</p>
<p>In general, the entire "exceptions" section is grossly misfounded and should be scrapped. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 15:08, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I view this entire proposal as misfounded, and as such am not inclined to participate much in its refinement. In my opinion, the current policy (let the ArbCom decide when it is appropriate to revoke adminship) is sufficient; the only alternative I would contemplate is an administrator's council which both grants and revokes adminship based on a deliberative process, taking input from the community but not obliged to even entertain, let alone count, votes. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 16:51, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why would bureaucrats and arbitrators be excluded? I don't like the idea of "normal" admins versus "higher than admin" (the proposal also mentions "basic" admins). For example, arbitrators are not technically required to be admins. Desysoping an arbitrator would not remove them from the ArbCom. I mention this because one of the major problems I have with this proposal is that it's been built in a Frankenstein manner, grafting on arbitrary rules, exclusions and limitations whenever there's complaints. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAren%27t_I_Obscure__6bd1.html" title="User:Aren't I Obscure?">Aren't I Obscure?</a> 17:28, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no logical reason why you should exclude bureaucrats and arbitrators, but not checkusers. As I stated above, the community has no authority to revoke checkuser authority anyway, so all you can do is strip the admin flag without stripping the checkuser flag. Arbitrators can be recalled as admins without affecting their authority as Arbitrators. There is no process to remove an Arbitrator, other than the Will of Jimbo (all Arbitrators serve at Jimbo's pleasure). I see no logic to exempting bureaucrats, either, since a b'crat is just someone who has been trusted to make judgment calls on RfA and to handle a couple of relatively uninteresting ministerial functions related to usernames and bot flags. The checkuser right embodies the highest trust level available on any single project (since the disclosure of information discovered by checkuser is just about the only truly irrevocable act on Wikipedia); for you to suggest that it should be nonexempt when these others are exempt merely indicates that you are really quite clueless as to the manner of governance of Wikipedia and the other projects within the Wikimedia Foundation umbrella. As to <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a>, formally that process does not involve anyone other than Foundation staff (which you have failed to exclude); Arbitrators, bureaucrats, checkusers, or have no direct input, and if your goal is to "avoid interference with WP:OFFICE" then you have no reason to exclude anyone other than Foundation Board or staff.

<dd>As do I, which is my problem with the current proposal. I do think there is a role for some sort of community reaffirmation of existing administrators, to ensure that they still carry the trust of the project-at-large, but structuring any proposal in such a way that a) it's going to deal exclusively with issues not really appropriate for the arbitration committee, and b) it's not going to run rampant with abuse, is no small order. I'm always receptive to proposals to address these problems, but while I do think a problem exists, on some level, I think most of the solutions I've seen proposed so far are as bad (or worse) in various ways. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Sean Daugherty</a> <small><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeancdaug_ad69.html" title="User talk:Seancdaug">(talk)</a></small> 19:24, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One of the interesting things about the perennial proposal for a de-adminship/adminship renewal/adminship recall process is that the handful of bad admins in the back of everyone's minds during these discussions invariably end up leaving the project after a period of some months anyway. They usually flame out when they realize they don't have much support in the community for what they're doing, and then they leave. In a couple of cases such individuals have been stripped of their adminship through existing means, e.g. arbcom, or have voluntarily given up their adminship.

<dd>Could work. As long we insist that the filer must show that other admins have attempted discussion/correction of the 'offender' first. Discussion, not discipline, should always be the starting point. Further, arbcom should have the option of repremanding the admin, if there have been breaches, but a full RfA would be excessive. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 22:58, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's sensible. Individual arbitrators are habitually unstinting in their expression of opinion about cases. They can reject a case while suggesting that there's a problem. They can also politely hint that the complainant should try to discuss things with the administrator <i>first</i>. From my experience as an arbitration committee clerk, I think this latter is likely to happen quite often. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 23:34, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, Arbcom approves the reverse RfA instead of a single Beauracrat? Well, a load off the Beauracrat's minds, I'll bet. Well, I hate to sound negative yet again (because I feel I have been this whole page), so I'll say: it's the best proposal yet. It won't stop cries of favoratism or cabalism, but I expect most spurious requests could be quashed by arbcom fairly easily and quickly. I just wish I could be convinced it's <i>necessary.</i> I mean, I understand <i>what</i> the folks who've worked so hard on this want, but I just don't know if this will really fulfill their wishes. I fear many will embrace it now, to feel disappointed later when they realize it really doesn't make removing an admin <i>that much</i> easier. I'll stop the doom, gloom, and italics now. --<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkSplotch_5c7c.html" title="User:InkSplotch">InkSplotch</a> 23:28, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It has its own way of working but the acceptance procedure is very flexible. Once a request for arbitration is started people can add their comments to it, including evidence. Typically it won't be rejected until four arbitrators have voted "reject" and at least seven days have passed since it was first filed. In short, the arbitration system is already well organised and it works well and the fit, it seems to me, is good for this purpose. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 02:15, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would take a few seconds to run up a template for requests for community input on an admin (or some other wording). If we could arrive at the agreement that this would be a good way to proceed, the only thing that needs to be done is to select parameters (the quota the period, and so on). This would be subject to agreement of the Arbitration Committee.

<dd>I think "support" should be to support the recall/removal of the admin. And on another note (sorry to branch off), I think we should notify all arbitrators of this to get their input. I really like this proposal, but it depends too much on the ArbCOm for them not to be notified. For one thing, if arbitrators simply won't desysop anyone based on lack of community confidence, this whole proposal is worthless.

<dd>There are no filing criteria on RFAR. If an application is crap, the arbitrators toss it out.

Getting consensus that someone <i>must</i> be removed is a much different (and more difficult) than than determining if they will be <i>allowed</i> to continue.

<dd>The Arbitration Committee has historically used RFA affirmation votes only in situations where they have found administrators guilty of actual abuse unworthy of an administrator. It follows that a desysopping vote, which is only based on <i>prima facie</i> allegations of abuse which the committee declines to arbitrate (signalling that they don't see a major conduct issue) should require strong community consensus. The Committee always has the power to summarily order the removal of a sysop bit if there is a major problem. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 18:52, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I didn't mean it to be "harsh" and if it came out that way I apologise without reservation. Tony and I have quite different expectations regarding the nature of the community, and (without casting aspersions) as he's on the receiveing end of a great deal more heat than I am regarding conduct it might not be unreasonable for him to feel that way. For example, Tony and I have both had the same number of <b>Arbitration</b> rulings handed out, but he's had four (six?) requests for <b>comment.</b> Is there some way for me to say that without it sounding like a dig?

<dd>I don't think so. Don't worry too much, you certainly won't be the last to say something along these lines. Any policy or process to de-sysop someone will be meet with resistance, and criticisim of the process by an admin will invariably lead to comments like this. Whether meant as an insult or not, I don't think it'll ever help matters along. Any admin discussing this issue <i>will</i> have a different viewpoint from a standard editor. Whether they have good reason (or we just expect them) to be concerned, everyone's motives are ultimatly their own. I have faith that every admin, experienced or not, contentious or quiet, will put the encyclopedia before themselves in this.

<dd>Aaron, whether or not 25 percent of the Wikipedian community is trolls and miscreants is not relevant. What is relevant is the fact that nowhere near 1 percent of the Wikipedia community ever votes on anything - and with a little concerted talk-page and off-wiki campaigning, it would be ridiculously easy for an organized group to generate enough votes to derail just about any such renomination campaign for admins who have done anything remotely controversial. Especially given that to begin with, the people motivated to vote on these proposals will be the people who want the administrator gone. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 06:14, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Voting to remain would set a higher bar than voting to remove, but one with the potential for abuse.

<dd>I will not support any proposal in which an admin being recalled must garner a 75-percent supermajority to retain their bit. It is far, far too easy to votestack against anyone who is at all controversial - and furthermore, it presumes that the administrator is guilty and should have it removed unless he can prove otherwise. The burden of proof <b>must</b> be on those who seek to remove the sysop bit, to demonstrate that the administrator has committed actions which merit desysopping. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 06:02, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>75% means you only need 25% to de-admin. That's ridiculous. Most active bold admins have stepped on a few toes, combine that with the small amount of people who think there's a whole lot of admin abuse and would like to see admins desysopped on principle, it would be ridiculously easy for a very small percentage of the community (given how few vote) to block a re-comfirmation. We've also some admins who specialise in things like copyviolating image deletions - and they'd get voted down by people whoose beef is really with policy not the person. Sure, an admin who'd genuinely lost the support of a quarter of the community probably should loose their bit, but not an admin who'd been opposed by only one in four of those motivated enough to vote. It should take at least half of those motivated enough to vote expressing opposition before we consider de-admining. But personally, I'd rather leavve it to our elected arbs - their decision is far more likely to represent the will of the community than any straw poll. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 08:47, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually when someone gives up the sysop bit voluntarily (in the absence of coercion by arbitrators and whatnot), I don't see a problem with a 25% requirement to get the bit back. Why not?

<dd>Here's the deal. If an admin has to garner a 75 percent supermajority to retain his bit, that essentially means that the process has already deemed him guilty of whatever he's been accused of. If that's the case, then I will vehemently object to this proposal, because that changes the entire meaning of the B'cat and four-arb approval. Until now, my understanding has been that the Arb review is to prevent any clearly outrageous recall proposals from going through, but not making a full-blown investigative ArbCom case out of the question. They are like the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_jury.html" title="Grand jury">grand jury</a>, and should there be a reasonable amount of evidence suggesting that the community needs to look at the facts and examine this administrator's actions, they will approve the question and put it to a vote. But if the admin has to garner a supermajority to retain his bit, that means that the four-arbcom vetting process has become a finder of fact, and their approval of the proposal means that the admin WILL be desysopped unless the admin can prove otherwise to 75 percent of those who bother to vote. That completely reverses the burden of proof and is completely unacceptable. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 16:16, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, FCYTravis, but with some reservation based on the fact that this isn't a trial, it's a process to decide what's best for Wikipedia, and that may not necessarily be what's "fair".

<dd>Then if you believe it's about deciding what's best for Wikipedia, you will agree with me that a mere "vote" does not always take into account what is best for Wikipedia. We have some policies that had to be instituted by fiat, such as <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> - because what is popular is not always right, and doing what is right is not always popular. See the battles over fair use images for an example. Wikipedia has essentially asked its administrators to perform some of the duties of a traffic cop, and nobody would call traffic cops popular. Until, that is, you've had a major pile up and you need someone to sort everything out and get the freeway running again. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 18:10, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I definitely agree that there needs to be a 'gatekeeper' up front to weed out frivolous requests - though I had previously suggested giving that role to the bureaucrats rather than the ArbCom. I think ArbCom could work <i>if</i> it was on the basis of 'is there any reasonable likelihood of the <b>community</b> de-sysoping this person' rather than 'do <b>we</b> feel this person should be de-sysoped'. I'd object if ArbCom routinely denied requests where it was clear that a sizable portion of the community wanted the person out because <i>to me</i> the only point of this is to restore admin accountability to the community instead of admin accountability to the ArbCom. Other than this ArbCom vs bureaucrats issue Tony's concept seems largely the same as what I proposed (normal RFA with slightly different questions and possibly lower acceptance thresh-hold - though I would like to see that raised over time) and thus is fine with me. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 14:28, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Have it be able to step in either time. How about, the filing can be reviewed to see if it's pure trollery or if it has some possible merit.

<dd>Good job! As to archiving active threads, it helps to understand this if you get the idea that signed comments are "owned" out of the way. The value in an active discussion is not usually whomever said whatever, but the the ideas that are exchanged. Also, "archive" doesn't just mean "dump in the obliette," it should also incude a careful and sensitive summary of what's gone before. If an active thread (meaning one that people are editing) is not adding any extra ideas that it's not such a bad thing to roll it up into a little ball under "FAQ." That would still be an excellent idea to have in a big box at the top of this page, by the way. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 02:43, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A - 75% to 80% - Same as getting adminship in the first place.</dd>

<dd>D - Other</dd>
</dl>
<p>Are there any other major disputes? I think most people agree that the primary format should be very similar to a current 'request for adminship'. My current preference would be to try it with 'no gatekeeper' (E) and then either have bureaucrats (C) or ArbCom (B) become the gatekeeper if we find that alot of frivolous requests are being filed. On percentage I'd prefer 75%+ (A), but could live with something as low as 50% (B). If we did start out at 50% I'd like to see it periodically reviewed to slowly raise the standards of admin approval. I suspect that the only people who wouldn't get at least 50% approval are those who are routinely de-adminned by the ArbCom anyway. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 17:03, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My preference is <b>Gatekeeper E</b> (with an oversight in the form of certification thresholds), and <b>Approval C</b>. I am set on Approval C, but will not object to a B. A is too much. For the gatekeeper, while I support E, I will have no objection to an implementation that has either Gatekeeper A or Gatekeeper B. Gatekeeper D is not acceptable to me. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 17:28, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My <b>ideals</b>: Gatekeeper E, Approval A (at about 70%, not 80). This is not a fair trial, it's a vote of confidence and should have the same standards as the original RfA. Benefit of the doubt does not always help Wikipedia. Additionally, the community can and should be trusted to weed out trolling, not with admin tools, but by ignoring them as <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">WP:TROLL</a> says anyhow.</dd>
<dd>My "real world" support: Gatekeeper B, with ArbCom only stepping in in cases of "votes" compromised by trolling, socking or frankly, idiocy; Approval C. Approval B doesn't really make sense - either they need a consensus to be desysopped, or a consensus to be re-sysopped.</dd>
<dd>The reason my real world supports are different is that I don't think my ideals will get this supported by the community anyhow. People who are interested in shutting this down don't trust the community to weed out trolling, so ArbCom stepping in will be required, if nothing else, to get this to be real policy. Like I said, it may even weed out all the name-calling done by certain editors willing to disrupt these and other dispute resolution methods. My approval support is also based on getting this passed. I regret that this may make it ineffective though, I'd prefer something along the lines of 30 or 33 percent.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I am willing to support a policy consisting of Gatekeeper B and Approval C, which I believe is a reasonable and workable compromise. I still don't think it's absolutely necessary, but if it will serve to increase community trust in the administrator oversight process and provide a backstop in cases of egregious misconduct (I am no Pollyanna, clearly there are cases of admins abusing their powers) then I believe that on balance, it will benefit the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 07:14, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Terminology: or, WTF is a "recall"?</span></h2>
<p>A simple observation: the term "recall" should preferably be avoided in any policy that is enacted; this term is by no means universal (it is essentially unknown in Britain, for example), and as such it is likely to be incomprehensible or even misleading to many Wikipedians. If no alternative term can be decided upon, then at the very least the term "recall" <b>must</b> be explicitly defined before its first use. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 17:07, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My use of Recall RfA was based on the dictionary, and the general idea/theme of a recall election, that is:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. To ask or order to return: recalled all workers who had been laid off.</dd>
<dd>2. To summon back to awareness of or concern with the subject or situation at hand.</dd>
<dd>3. To remember; recollect. See Synonyms at remember.</dd>
<dd>4. To cancel, take back, or revoke.</dd>
<dd>5. To bring back; restore.</dd>
<dd>6. To request return (of a product) to the manufacturer, as for necessary repairs or adjustments.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So that, in essence, the admin in question is being "recalled" to the RfA process for community reevaluation. Plus, using <a href="../../../r/e/c/WP%7ERECALL_844a.html" title="WP:RECALL">WP:RECALL</a> is a bit bold, to imply the importance/severity of the matter at hand, and my calling it a "Recall RfA" was literally to differentiate it from regular RfA. I've tried to be very consistent in referring to "Recall/recall" as the overall process--based on various versions and drafts, from notification, filing, approval/certification, the RfA itself, to a b'cat either hitting the desysop button of simply archiving the whole unsuccessful operation. "Recall RfA" itself I've always tried to refer to as the 'final phase', the literal inverse RfA where the community makes it's opinions heard.</dd>
<dd>So! "Recall" = the whoe process, end-to-end; "Recall RfA" = the literal inverse RfA/final phase. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 17:17, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Active vs. Inactive admins</span></h2>
<p>I think this should take into account the amount of activity an admin did in the last X period of time. An admin that was close to inactive should have a lot less leeway than an admin who is very active. If an admin is on wikipedia working 16 hours a day then they're going to make more mistakes than someone who has just watches 10 or so of their favorite articles. I also think this proceedure should be able to de-sysop someone for purely being inactive. I mean really inactive. You should see <a href="../../../p/r/i/WP%7EPRIMO_6d83.html" title="WP:PRIMO">WP:PRIMO</a>. If an admin goes inactive for a long time, then either one of their kids finds the password and goes "oh joy what fun!" or the account gets hacked into by someone. Also we can relate to what FCYTravis said about some admin work will cause more criticism. I think if an admin does tons of this they need leeway. But if an admin does nothing but control their favorite articles, then they need some real scrutiny. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 19:01, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In any given month, perhaps only 10% of all Wikipedia admins are active. To claim that <i>if an admin goes inactive for a long time, then either one of their kids finds the password and goes "oh joy what fun!" or the account gets hacked into by someone."</i> is to misrepresent the facts. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 19:12, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The second part of this is a non-starter. If you've got evidence that a particular account has been compromised, then bring it up and the situation will be dealt with VERY quickly. Until then, admin bits on inactive accounts aren't likely to be cause for de-sysoping, although any process that is developed could potentially take that into account (which seems to be your first point). Hacking generally requires an emergency response in any case; you don't want to be waiting days or weeks for a result. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 19:32, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Actually the percentage is closer to 80% if you include admins who make an edit. If you only include admins that do at least one admin-specific thing, the percentage is closer to 60%. The data don't tell much more of a story than that. There are usually a dozen or so admins that numerically have done most of the blocks, deletes, and protects, but that's in part because they're making a twitch game out of RC instead of taking on tasks that require a good deal more investigation and other legwork. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 20:39, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's not one month, it's one year and I think after six months someone should look into it. I haven't seen any compromised, but the possibility is a reason not to let inactive admin accounts go on forever. I also said my reason for scrutiny of ones barely active is someone really active is likely to make a mistake somewhere and get a complaint so small things build up and the admin gets lots of criticism whereas someone who is almost inactive can do bad things and not get noticed because basically nobody sees it. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 20:56, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Another proposal</span></h2>
<p>- Have admins apply each year to have their admin status renewed. - If they still have consensus among <b>other admins</b> that they should continue to be an admin, then their status in renewed for another year. - If they fail to get consensus, they go through another RFA.</p>
<p>Some points:</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe this avoids the situation where "trolls" or "POV pushers" could go after an admin for their actions.</li>
<li>While there is no support for automatically desysopping inactive admins, I think we can agree that all admins should still want to be admins. By having them reapply it makes their intention to remain an admin clear, while not reapplying would be a sign that they do not want to remain as an admin.</li>
<li>I envision that the vast majority of admins will basically have their status renewed without the need for votes or comment, it will only be the rare few where another admin feels the need to oppose renewal that will go through a more rigorous process. 12.75.3.141 21:03, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think this is a case for arbitrator discretion. Arbitrators are intelligent and can make up their own minds. The administrator must be notified (as all parties must be notified in any application for arbitration) and is able to respond by writing on the arbitration page, his talk page (if blocked) or in email to an active arbitrator or clerk. The recall vote would of course afford the administrator a further chance to defend his actions as an admin. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 00:24, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was paraphrasing. The policy says, "Admins should not protect pages in which they are involved," and "Administrators should be cautious about editing protected pages and do so in accordance with consensus and any specific guidelines on the subject. In most cases, administrators should first raise the issue on the relevant talk page, unless a case of obvious trolling and/or revert warring, or blatantly unsuitable content." I was oversimplifying. They should (based on this) get someone else to protect if they are involved in a dispute or involved with the page, inlcluding "making substantive edits to the page (fixing vandalism does not count), or expressing opinions about the article on the talk page before the protection." <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 17:49, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Administrators are frequently called upon to perform actions concerning users, articles and other pages, and some editors may disagree with their actions. Thus they become drawn into disputes.

<dd>Because they don't know how to <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Ignore all rules</a> and they mistake their disruptive actions for improvement of the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 16:15, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And there's the rub! As the "policy" doesn't really state 'how," as much as giving a subjective rationale. One person's improvement is another disruption, after all.

<dd>That might be the most circular logic I've read about it yet.

<dd>So everything that has a policy page is a policy. Then the "rules" are...? Essay pages? Then there's <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> that says it's both policy and a rule????? Wikipedia has "policies" and "guidelines." Maybe guidelines are the rules. <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_guidelines_2dea.html" title="Wikipedia:List of guidelines">Wikipedia:List_of_guidelines</a> and included in them are <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, and <a href="../../../u/p/_/WP%7EUP_7462.html" title="WP:UP">WP:UP</a> -- all of these are treated as policy. So WP:IAR means WP:POINT, WP:BITE, and WP:UP can be ignored if it's to make the encyclopedia better? There are also processes, which I do see the IAR applied to with <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 04:25, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good thing wikilawyering is a no-no, because this whole discussion would be reduced via reductio ad absurdum to something akin to Captain Queeg's falling apart on the stand under cross-examination. On the other hand, I suppose that following the line of illogical above it's not really a no-no, it's just a rule so apparently it can be ignored. Unless it's a policy. Which even though written is also <i>de facto</i> which is, of course, a contradiction in terms. And this, <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>, is a beauty, <i>"If an issue doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of getting an unexpected outcome from a certain process, then there is no need to run it through that process."</i> If the outcome is unexpected, i.e., outside the parameters for establishing a probability function then can we really say it doesn't have a chance? I'd love to see the odds worked up for that one. Ooh, wait, I know, we can invoke Heisenberg here, as the uncertainty principle takes into account unncertainty as a factor, so no outcome is unexpected as it's within the probability bound. Well, except that since uncertainty is expected, it's included in the probability bound, so that can't be it. I guess Wiki ain't quantum merchanics, after all.</dd>
<dd>Of course, if "unexpected" were changed to "desired" there might be a point to the rule/policy, de facto and yet written -- which of course, even though it must be followed can also be ignored upon the application of a subjective analysis of benefit. Or something like that. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim62sch_7388.html" title="User talk:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 12:00, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tyranny of the masses</span></h2>
<p>All the recall proposals I've seen have the flaw that thery are subject to tyranny of the masses where an admin is unpopular, but has done nothing that is actually wrong.</p>
<p>Removing an administrator should require actual abuse by that administrator, either long term or short term. We do need to look at what constitutes enough abuse to desysop, and probably at guidelines for emergency desysopping at some point, but any recall process that takes opinion into the slightest of consideration is a problem. - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriona_934d.html" title="User:Triona">Stephanie Daugherty (Triona)</a> - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETriona_5b3e.html" title="User talk:Triona">Talk</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Comment</a> - 01:46, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>, <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> and unilateral actions by Jimbo and the arbcom already provide methods for dealing with out-of-line admins. Notable offenders are constantly dealt with through these processes. Is there such a backlog at these existing processes of surly, reprobate admins awaiting community censure that a new process and policy, fraught with yet to unidentified risks and uncertainties, is required? No.</p>
<p>Despite the single proposed safeguard of a "gatekeeper function" and the mentioned but not elucidated prohibitions on "repeated recalls," grudge holders will still find ways to game this system to settle old scores, just as they have every other system here; and a system for which no real and clear need has been established.
