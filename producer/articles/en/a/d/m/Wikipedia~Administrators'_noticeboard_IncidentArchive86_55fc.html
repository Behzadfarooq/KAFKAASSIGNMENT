I have already communicated with the editor on this issue, but it doesn't seem to have had much of an effect on him. There are other issues with the article (a large amount of text has been added from the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee.html" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> article); in the course of reverting Johnc1 I removed it, but that's a content issue to be sorted out by involved editors.

<p>Hi, I edit on several Native American Wiki's and while editing this site at <a href="http://www.wikigadugi.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikigadugi.org" rel="nofollow">| WikiGadugi</a> I noticed that while I am logged in as "Hotch" on the website, I am able at the same time to create articles without the normal warnings and blocking for a user who is not logged into the Wikipedia site while I was logged into both sites at the same time. I also noticed that I can edit articles with Sysop privileges on Wikipedia and Admin due to some issue with the cookies since I have a Sysop/Bearucrat status on the other Wiki. I don't know if this website has some code doing this, but it looks like a bug in Wikimedia rather than something malicious. I did not perform any admin actions on this site (Wikipedia), but the extra tabs for protect and other areas seemed to appear. It happens when I am logged into both sites, so it looks like a bug in the MediaWiki Software. PeyoteMan 07:08, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>They may appear but do they work is the key point. There are a number of ways to get the tabs to appear. Try protecting your userpage.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 07:14, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about, but this kind of suggests that it might be possible to reverse-engineer cookies (ie, decipher the cookie encoding) used by Wikipedia, potentially allowing logging in as any arbitrary user, which if some troll organization like Bantown managed to pull off would result in all manner of hilarity ensuing.

User Molobo has been blocked for 3RR for a week.

<dd>Given that this user has violated 3RR many many many times, I don't have a problem with the long block. (I am, indeed, concerned by your overly-broad definition of vandalism. "Removing tags" is only vandalism if it is vandalism. Do you really justifiably think that the other editors reverts were a deliberate bad faith attempt to harm the integrity of the encyclopedia? If so, try it again with <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> in mind.) In any case, someone who has had that many blocks for 3RR clearly is not getting it, so it may be time to think about a more substantial block (<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive83_fcc0.html#User:Deathrocker" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive83">along these lines</a>). <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 04:42, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ahem...sorry for intruding (I'm not an admin). But, what I see here is a classic example of a behavior I've been witnessing for some time. Example: you write a text on a subject. Someone incessantly vandalizes it. So, there is a problem. A mess goes to the public wiki "courtroom". But-if frequently ends in condemning, one way or another, those who tried to save the text from vandalization by reverting it. So, vandals get a tacit approval for vandalisation. A <a href="../../../k/a/f/Kafkaesque.html" title="Kafkaesque">kafkaesque</a> ending.

Given his previous record of 3RR violations, each time the revert warrior broke 3RR, his block was increased: from 24 hours on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">3 March</a> to 3 days on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_8.html" title="March 8">8 March</a> to 4 days on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_17.html" title="March 17">17 March</a> to 7 days on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_30.html" title="March 30">30 March</a>.

<p>Dear pan Molobo, the things you do may be classified as tag vandalism. I believe we need a separate policy on those who, without contributing anything helpful, add tons of tags on any article they cast their eyes on. Please stop vandalizing existing articles and write some new ones at last. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">-трёп-</a></sup> 14:23, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I always thought that removing a dispute (or similar) tag without providing an explanation for one's action, or when the issue is actively disputed at the article's talk page, is vandalism and can be reverted as many times as necessary. Those tags serve an important purpose, and those who remove them before the issues are resolved are simply pushing their POV and censoring all critique of it (no matter if deserved or not). I believe that in this particluar case Molobo is innocent, and it is his opponents, who removed the tag, who should be punnished. I most vehemntly oppose this block.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 17:37, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm surprized that your previous wheel warring - when you repeatedly unblocked Molobo after he violated 3RR - did not learn you anything. Actually, such disruptive editors as Molobo who are permanently one revert away from violating 3RR on scores of articles should be blocked for three reverts only. That their trolling is particularly nasty is no excuse for looking down on them. Unfortunately, Molobo has become such a problem and threat to the Wikicommunity only because he is encouraged by such Polish editors as Piotrus who joins his rabid reverting more often then not. Just a few days ago, Molobo was unblocked on Piotr's petition and instantly proceeded to turn dozens articles into a mess. Enough is enough. --Ghirla -трёп- 14:30, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, inappropriately adding "disputed tags" is also vandalism and users are required to explain why they added it - marking the articles that one just doesn't agree with is not enough. I do think that this block is excessive though - I thought the maximum bar is 24 hours (<a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>: <i>sysops may block for <b>up to</b> 24 hours</i>) and while sysops are entitled to exercise their discretion in imposing longer blocks, in my opinion they should be reported to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>. While a longer block may have been deserved in Molobo's case, purely due to the fact that he's been revert warring on so many articles and evidently causing much disruption (and having been blocked so many times before), this is also taking into account the fact that it takes two or more to revert war. We could have reasonably expected Molobo to realise that more users are reverting against him than for him, IMO that is a sufficient reason for him to <b>give up</b> and discuss on the article's talk page or on the talk page of the user in question. I think the block should be shortened but not to something less than 24 hours. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatinus_7925.html" title="User:Latinus">Latinus</a> 17:54, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Latinus, I'm afraid you are deluded here. You have not enough experience with Molobo if you expect him to give up reverting by his own volition. What will he do then? Is there any other purpose for his edits other than revert warring? He is always one revert away from 3RR on scores of articles. To a disinterested observer, he seems like a reverting bot run by Piotrus and Halibutt in order to spread their nationalist propaganda. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">-трёп-</a></sup> 18:08, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's just like in real life: if you break the law, you're punished. If you do it again, the punishment increases. It worked somehow in Space Cadet's case (if Space Cadet really is not a number of other accounts). Molobo is not an autist but a university student so his being a "vigilante" as he puts it can become a matter of the past if he realises it is not the way he'd better be walking. I think it becomes more and more obvious that the only solution is the ArbCom. Until then conventional methods will solve it. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESciurin%C3%A6_d3c6.html" title="User:Sciurinæ">Sciurinæ</a> 18:16, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since I blocked I'd better defend my action. I don't think removing tags can be called reverting vandalism (note: it currently says so explicitly in the 3RR header, but only cos I just inserted it; if you consider that disputable, remove it and we'll talk it over). The 1 week was what Inshaneee (sp?) gave then removed; it appeared to me to be the natural progression. I would consider a shorter block; especially if you consider this a bit doubtful. The 24h limit is long dead, though - check the logs. Also note that I removed another Molobo report from this page as now-irrelevant - if anyone is thinking of unblocking, best to check that out. And finally - he current state of his talk page doesn't exactly inspire confidence in his NPOV state <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 18:04, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. Furthermore, if Molobo breaks 3RR again, the block should be extended to one month. Currently, half a dozen editors have to stop adding new stuff to Wikipedia in order to revert Molobo's pointless reverts, usually encouraged by Piotrus. All things considered, he is the worst troll to haunt Eastern Europe-related topics since Bonaparte was permabanned earlier this year. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">-трёп-</a></sup> 18:15, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Blocks which are solely for 3RR violations are barred by policy from exceeding 24 hours. However, I would argue (and others appear to be practicing as well) that editors who violate 3RR repeatedly can be blocked longer for general disruption, rather than requiring that the ArbCom be called in every time we have a highly problematic revert-warrior.

<dd>I am really disappointed to see so much vehemence and ill will directed towards Molobo. Through he has been known for breaking the 3RR occcasionally, so are his opponents. Ghirla, who seems to be enjoying this incident so much (and labels Molobo as a troll in every second post), should be reminded of his recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Ghirlandajo_3146.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Ghirlandajo">RfC</a> (and yes, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Molobo_9165.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Molobo">Molobo also had an RfC</a>, although IMHO he came out of it much better (that being a purely personal opinion, of course). Now, back to the case at hand: as the talk page shows Molobo did engage in discussion with his opponents, and although using a smaller tag like {{<a href="../../../d/u/b/Template%7EDubious_a2d6.html" title="Template:Dubious">dubious</a>}} might have been more appopriate than using {{<a href="../../../t/o/t/Template%7ETotallydisputed_3989.html" title="Template:Totallydisputed">totallydisputed</a>}}, I think his opponents (which in that particular case number two - not a 'very large number') are as guilty of failure to talk as he is. A case can be made that removal of tags is breaking the 3RR (although I would not support it) - but let it rest. There is, however, no justification for blocking a creative (if sometimes to wild) user like Molobo for a week. I certainly don't see that Molobo is a 'general disruption' any more than Girlandajo is (please comapare their RfC if you need proof) and I will not support support such a ban on such flimsy ground. If one wants to bring this to an RfArb, then please do - hopefully this will finally put an end to anti-Molobo crusade by certain users (or prove me wrong - I am not saying I am perfect and unbiased here - but I am really fed up with some people 'throwing proverbial rocks' when they are no better).--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 20:23, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I too deplore the ill-will. Back to your case: Molobo is not being blocked for failure to talk, but for (repeatedly) breaking 3RR. If anyone else has, report them and they will get the same treatment. The 24h limit is, effectively, a dead duck. There has been no real discussion of this (as far as I can see) but thats how it is: policy has evolved. I've considered raising it explicitly, but always decided to let well enough alone. Now: please address my point re Molobos talk page: it appears to be deliberately imflammatory and does not show good faith (I mean: the pictures, and the multiple to-remembers that are clearly there as messages to others, not to Molobo). Also note his response to the block: <i>I shall return in one week and restore all information about Nazi and Soviet atrocities...</i> which practically promises a return to edit-warring. If you can persuade him to calm down, great, then his block can be reduced. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M.

<dd>That's your personal interpretation of facts, to which you are of course entirely entitled, but which cannot be used to overrule our policies if it is disputed (and I am afraid I have to dispute it). I see nothing that goes against our policies in his talk, and as for his reply, it is a well known fact that Molobo contributes to the controversial areas of G/P/R history. This is not the place for content dispute or the analysis of his additions, but he is obviously a content editor, and I see nothing strange in him saying that he will be back to edit the articles he likes. If people think he is not a good content creator, then ArbCom is that way. But using arbitrary blocks without any official policy to support them, just one's view of how the policy has evolved, is not the best way to solve it, not when it is - as you can see from my reply - disputed. I know you are acting in good faith. So am I, and I think - putting all my wiki-experience and reputation in those words - that it is unfair and counterproductive to block Molobo for a week. I have talked to him recently and he told me he will watch his edits more carefully. Therefore I'd like to ask you to change the block on Molobo to 24h - the period clearly supported by the rules.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 22:25, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Piotrus, I can understand that some Polish wikipedians - definitely not all (learn from Alx-pl rather than protect the black sheep) - feel the need to defend him because the anti-German, anti-Russian and Pro-Polish POV pushing coming from him may be the wrong attitude towards Wikipedia but at least he has the right POV. If there's a war crime by Germans against Poles, he's there for you. Whether Germans would die too (example Potulice camp) does not only not matter to him but he is quick to dismiss any source, accusing his opponents of denial. If there's ongoing discussion over Copernicus' nationality, Molobo is there to revert and disturb the discussion. You certainly know of Molobo's forum presence less than a year ago. Has he changed? Has he improved since his RfC? And what do you think: is he going to change? Sure, he will promise anything. It is not an arbitrary interpretation of the rules but one considering the sense of 3RR. It is the same thing with simple vandalism except that vandalism (like adding nonsense words) is often less hurtful to Wikipedia than POV pushing. If the offenders of either keep it this way, their punishments will increase until they've smarted from it till they're smart enough not to do it anymore. That's the way dealt with offenders both in the real world and in Wikipedia. There is nothing constructive in the way Molobo contributes like this and if Molobo starts discussing first before shooting, this will be the last block. Four violations within the month March - the block could have lasted longer. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESciurin%C3%A6_d3c6.html" title="User:Sciurinæ">Sciurinæ</a> 22:53, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with some of your points. If we vote on a policy to make blocking more severe, for example by adding an additional day for each 3RR block in a given month to a consecutive block, I'll support it. But until such a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_ffe0.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies">official policy</a> is voted through by the community, I oppose arbitrary reinterpretation of existing policies. Second, I never said Molobo is perfect: he has a strong POV (as you noted), and as was pointed here, his 3RR record is a proof that he could talk more. I don't follow his edits closely and I don't know if his behaviour is getting better or worse (if this is the case, please present the evidence in a new RfC or a RfArb). But I have seen in many cases that he provides references for his edits and that he creats new content (like <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potulice_concentration_camp.html" title="Potulice concentration camp">Potulice concentration camp</a> or <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Kr%C3%BCger_cc37.html" title="Hans Krüger">Hans Krüger</a>). He is also much more civil than many of his 'sparring partner' - I have yet to see where he calls editors who revert him 'a pet troll' or make other <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_attacks.html" title="Personal attacks">personal attacks</a>, even through his opponents feel that the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a> rules does not apply to them (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moscow_Victory_Parade_of_1945&amp;diff=44051332&amp;oldid=43963111" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moscow_Victory_Parade_of_1945&amp;diff=44051332&amp;oldid=43963111" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moscow_Victory_Parade_of_1945&amp;diff=45984228&amp;oldid=45592620" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moscow_Victory_Parade_of_1945&amp;diff=45984228&amp;oldid=45592620" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). That convinces me that he is clearly not a vandal or a troll, but a content creator with strong POV - like thousands of other wiki editors. If his POV is too strong and he is a liability for this project, than I again would ask those who think so to use the appopriate venues to prove their case (RfArb). Otherwise, I'll follow the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innocent_until_proven_guilty.html" title="Innocent until proven guilty">innocent until proven guilty</a> assumption in that (and other) cases.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 23:38, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course he doesn't call other people names - these are easy mistakes. He implies they're vandals or would try to cover up war crimes. I fail to see the arbitrariness in the block: why should it be any different than with normal vandals? Or with other people breaking the 3RR? If the user is new and probably unaware of the rules, the block should last for a short time. Same with teenagers committing a crime. If that user should know better, the usual punishment is 24h. If it is a repeated offender, the verdict will be more severe. I can see it isn't formulated in the rules. But it isn't forbidden in the rules, either, maybe even taken for granted as decision in line with other blocks. If Molobo needs to edit pages urgently, he won't be ignored on the talk page. I made an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Molobo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46050946" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Molobo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46050946" rel="nofollow">unsuccessful attempt</a> to discuss with him on the subject of the Kulturkampf. Let him be forced to limit his influence to discussion for once, even though I doubt his discussions had a positive effect on Groeck, Wiglaf or Shauri.

<dd>So easy mistakes (offences against PA and CIVIL) are ok and we don't mind them, but more elaborate and disputable 'mind games' are the reason for calling one a troll? His deletion of your post on his talk is dissapointing, although it's a tactic I have seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGhirlandajo&amp;diff=44982552&amp;oldid=44982245" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGhirlandajo&amp;diff=44982552&amp;oldid=44982245" rel="nofollow">his opponents use</a>, too. Of course two wrongs do not make one right, and I have sent him a message that he shouldnt' be doing that. But you ignore my point above: if our rules don't allow blocking for a week in this period, then it shouldn't be done. Of course if everybody would agree that such an exceptionto the rules is beneficial, than that's not a problem, wiki-lawyering should be avoided. However here I disagree with a 7-day ban on a contributor I view as mostly positive, and therefore there is no consensus for an extraordinary ban. You say it's possible that the 7 week vacation will 'cool him down'. First, predicting the future is hard: it may or may not. Second, I know that his forced absence from wiki will make the life that much easier for various other POV-pushers and force many of us to waste our time dealing with them. I have conceded above that a 24h block serves as a valid punishment, but a 7 day ban is not fair, not legal, and is also disruptive for content creation (our primary purpose). Please don't make me repeat myself.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 00:33, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't call him a troll. To me, Molobo is an efficient contributor but who works into the wrong direction, which makes him - in my eyes - more negative than a poor editor. Ghost in a machine's summary of Molobo's user conduct in the RfC describes it the best IMO. However, there is only one way to discourage someone from doing sth negative and that's what your and my state and probably most states recognised. An increase in the severity of verdicts. It's not wiki-lawyering but common sense. The time span between his blocks this month has widened after each and Space Cadet doesn't seem likely to me to be reported here in the near future. The block isn't hard but too weak. Look what happened to Bonaparte or bigoted and radical people in forums. Molobo prepares and can save content he wants to create in future so his his contents creations aren't at stake. He hasn't had a one-week break (if I remember correctly) since I met him in August. I know I can't predict the future at all, yet I'm positive his restriction to discussion space can only have a good effect unless one week is too short. He's a student of journalism and Social communication, not reverting. If this attempt should prove futile, then I agree with referring the issue to ArbCom. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESciurin%C3%A6_d3c6.html" title="User:Sciurinæ">Sciurinæ</a> 01:00, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes. But. The rules don't allow blocking for 3RR for over 24h. I agree they should. There are procedures we can follow to change the rules. I'll be happy to help with that. I don't agree Molobo deserves a 7-day block under current rules, and even in my variant of tough rules he wouldn't get a 7-day block (unless he got blocked 6 times this month already). If the rules are bended here, they are more likely to be bended more and more until they break. Molobo should be unblocked after 24h elapse on his block.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 02:04, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Being a 1 step under 3RR in dozens of article in a single day is a general disruption. In disruption blocks the admin's discretion is allowed. This whole thing started off the wrong foot. This behavior discussion belongs to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> (or indeed RfC or an ArbCom). If the latter is ever compiled, it should bring the verdict that limits his right to <i>revert, paste</i> and <i>delete</i> rather than a general ban. Then he may still create content, which he occasionally does, and be stripped of the tools he uses to disrupt.</p>
<p>Anyway, he was running amok lately and a week cool-off he can use to write articles is a good idea. Repeated general dispurtions warrant an admin block within reasonable discretion. The extent of this disruption, encouragement in trolling instead of mentorship from his wikifriends and his past history certainly make the extent of the block reasonable. You may call it a disruption block if more than 24h 3RR is not allowed for what I care. The time span is appropriate. If he wants to post something to talk pages, he is free to email me the text and/or post it at his talk. I will post it for him. Again, I am not for censoring the info of atrocities others committed against the Poles. I am for the <i>proper</i> coverage of them rather than making a mess out of such broad articles as <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Poland_f479.html" title="History of Poland">History of Poland</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Army_ccba.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_the_Great_1532.html" title="Catherine the Great">Catherine the Great</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Suvorov_9a45.html" title="Alexander Suvorov">Alexander Suvorov</a> and even <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_partisan.html" title="Soviet partisan">Soviet partisan</a>, <a href="../../../t/y/u/Tyutchev.html" title="Tyutchev">Tyutchev</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/d/Ded_Moroz_079e.html" title="Ded Moroz">Ded Moroz</a> (!) . Most of the latter are not polonocentric topics and should not be made as such. These articles have turned into a mess mostly thanks to Molobo's hysterical participation in them. I'd like him back cooled off a little and talked to by other Polish contributors into a more constructive behavior.

<dd>For one, I am an administrator too and I don't support this block (for longer than 24h). Second, I don't see that <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Disruption" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking_policy#Disruption</a> fits Molobo actions. The disruption lists: <i>changing other users' signed comments, making deliberately misleading edits, harassment, and excessive personal attacks</i>, none of which fits Molobo's actions.

<dd>Ghirla: you are not helping much. The fact that you are a much more productive contributor than Molobo does not give you the right to call him troll, and me his 'troll master'. Molobo has contributed valuable content, like in the creation of <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potulice_concentration_camp.html" title="Potulice concentration camp">Potulice concentration camp</a>. It would be also nice if you were to provide evidence that would support your personal attacks against him or me - like that 'our team' was resonspible for Shauri's or Wilgalf Wikiholidays (<a href="../../../c/a/b/WP%7ECABAL_ad8b.html" title="WP:CABAL">WP:CABAL</a>, anyone?). And while you have not broken the 3RR, I'd like to point out that the reason for prolonged block Molobo received here was the disruption caused by his many near 3RR violations - something you are just as guilty of (see history of articles I listed above). The fact that you have not added content to the above article does not change the fact that you were engaged in the revert wars there, and did not provide any justification for your reverts other than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Congress_Poland&amp;diff=45146978&amp;oldid=45134254" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Congress_Poland&amp;diff=45146978&amp;oldid=45134254" rel="nofollow">revert trolling (read: revert of relevant see also link)</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Poland_%281939%E2%80%931945%29&amp;diff=45973625&amp;oldid=45970980" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Poland_%281939%E2%80%931945%29&amp;diff=45973625&amp;oldid=45970980" rel="nofollow">giving no explanation for reverting of sourced additions</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polish_contribution_to_World_War_II&amp;diff=45823660&amp;oldid=45823414" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polish_contribution_to_World_War_II&amp;diff=45823660&amp;oldid=45823414" rel="nofollow">same here</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Renaissance_in_Poland&amp;diff=44978069&amp;oldid=44964909" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Renaissance_in_Poland&amp;diff=44978069&amp;oldid=44964909" rel="nofollow">simple and clear WP:POINT vandalism</a>. It is obvious to me that when it comes to content creation, you are a valuable contributor, but when it comes to any content dispute, your actions are no better then that of Molobo's - they are even worse, because he at least uses talk and provides some references, while you just revert. Of course there are exceptions: I love your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKaty%C5%84_massacre&amp;diff=30481631&amp;oldid=30479723" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKaty%C5%84_massacre&amp;diff=30481631&amp;oldid=30479723" rel="nofollow">argument</a> that <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katyn_massacre.html" title="Katyn massacre">Katyn massacre</a> was a CIA forgery&#160;:) I can see that arguments brought by others against Molobo have some value, but honestly I can't see what you are trying to prove other than that you are just as disruptive as him.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 21:23, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Shauri and Wiglaf</b> were two of my dearest friends on here. We've remained in touch outside of WP as well. I know for a FACT that <b>their departures had nothing to do with Molobo</b>. In fact, one of the last things Wiglaf did on here was engage in a spat with Ghirla over <a href="../../../v/a/r/Talk%7EVarangians_249a.html#Ghirlandajo.27s_theories" title="Talk:Varangians">the origins of the Varangians</a>. So on the basis of that, one could argue, YOU, Ghirla, had more to do with his leaving than Molobo. It would be just as much a distortion too. Out of respect for them both, I ask that their good names not be dragged into this matter any further. Mine has been mentioned, but I don't mind. I'm still around to defend my comments and elaborate upon them. Unfortunately, what I wrote on Mobo's RFC, has been proven correct over the last several months. The 3RR rule is one of the most abused policies in the Wikiverse. It is too often misused as a blunt weapon or a trap against those with whom you're having editorial/personal differences. But if there is anyone worthy of a long-term ban for violating it, tis Molobo. Sorry, Piotrus, but it will come down to an RFAr I fear. People have been dragged before Arbcomm for far less than Molobo. I only hope, for the sake of fairness, that if they should come to any serious, punative decision against him, it will not be primarily for being a serial 3RR violator.--<a href="../../../r/2E/d/User%7ER.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29_1bea.html" title="User:R.D.H.

<p>Should it be moved to WP:ANI? I don't mind. Piotrus, by your proposal of no more than 24h block without an ArbCom, Bonaparte should be immediately unblocked. Amount of aggravtion brought my Molobo to a whole bunch of articles is huge. This was a huge disruption. If he wants to write articles, he can write many now and post them all at once in a week. Everything else he was doing is harmful for Wikipedia. And don't try to compare him to your favorite Nemesis. This simply doesn't fly.

<p>I'm also involved in an edit war at a different article which is over a tag being added. And yes, tags are subject to 3RR like anything else. If there's not enough support for them that an editor has to break 3RR to keep them on, then they shouldn't be on. That's the entire point of 3RR. I also support progressively longer blocks for persistent violators - as far as I'm concerned such blocks are still preventative rather than punitive, as they should be, because of the valid deterrence effect.

<dd>I looked at this IP's edits. They were not vandalism; the edits mention some issue with the name of the subject of the article.

<dd>Yes, I know, but this case is specific. You see, there was a compromise from few months ago when it was decided the name dispute to be described in a proper section (as it is now). A footnote leads to that section. Unfortunatelly, no matter of the footnote, this user (and the others mentioned before) try to put redundant edit in the beggining of the article.

<dd>Hi <a href="../../../b/o/m/User%7EBomac_e7d7.html" title="User:Bomac">Bomac</a>.

That said, if the IP keeps reverting, report that at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>. If it is an editor logging out to avoid breaking <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, they will get caught in the auto-block as well. But, really, both of the users that you mention above are reasonable editors who are willing to discuss solutions to content disputes.

<dd>Dear Geni: Yes, of course I do; but I can't see what relationship that has to the issue at play here other than that it involved userboxes. Note after the userboxes were undeleted I did not only not delete them, I accepted the undeletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sjakkalle&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46345261" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sjakkalle&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46345261" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and again, I reiterate, I haven't been involved in the userbox DRV page so far other than to note that I <i>restored</i> a set of userboxes that I formerly deleted. I hope you can determine by viewing <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NicholasTurnbull_6df3.html" title="Special:Contributions/NicholasTurnbull">my contributions</a> for yourself that I have made sure to discuss with others as a consequence of them raising issue with my decisions as an administrator; I consider it a personal maxim to remain open to civil discussion on all matters relating to Wikipedia. I haven't had any other interactions with Grue, nor any other editor, on the userbox subpage - I thus cannot see how my neutrality could be compromised. If I may say so, your attempts to impugn my ethics are somewhat of an assumption of bad faith, and not really reasonable.

Seems that very few people understand what DR is for and how it is processed, and the discussion in question demonstrates it very well. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 12:07, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't have strong objections to the block, but I think 48 hours crosses the line from preventative to punitive. 24 hours is more than enough for someone to cool down (if they're going to).

<p>While I personally agree that ignoring an ongoing DRV or TFD discussion is disruptive, a block is way out of order here. Where were the admins blocking Tony Sidaway and MarkSweep when they were taking the iniatiative to speedy delete templates with strong consensus to keep that were undergoing discussion on TFD? --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 21:33, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(Non-admin view) I think Samuel is entirely correct; the function, as I see it, of guidelines such as <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> is not to ensure that untoward behavior does not occur, but, rather, only to ensure that such behavior (gauche though it may be) doesn't interfere substantially with our project. Grue's blanking a discussion page, for example, surely is disruptive, and, in view of a recent pattern, a cooling-off period is perhaps appropriate, lest further disruption should occur. A 48-hour block, IMHO, is excessive though; inasmuch as it prevents Grue from contributing to the project in the (good) sundry ways he does, it seems likely to do the project more harm than good. I readily concede that my view apropos of the purpose of behavior guidelines and the reasons for which to issue blocks/bans (viz., that the only relevant criterion in whether a given admin action, on the whole, is likely to help or harm the overall project, notwithstanding the rather nebulous "help or harm" formulation, toward the improvement of which I have made efforts elsewhere) is likely a minority one (toward which proposition I adduce, for example, the pedophilia wheel warring discussion, in which many concluded that, the procedural issues aside, and even if other users aren't dissuaded from editing because of a user's self-ID as a pedophile, self-ID'd pedophiles oughtn't to be here, irrespective of what they might bring the encyclopedia), but I think here that 24 hours would be a more appropriate timeframe. I should say that I know this isn't the place to begin a new discussion of blocks/bans, but I am so often troubled by certain blocks issued here that I want simply to express that everyone ought to remember that the project must come first (Grue's actions, unlike those of other users who are blocked simply for hate speech which, though it may engender anger in others, is unlikely to dissuade prospective editors from working on or using the encyclopedia, so some timeout is in order). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 21:41, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A good long wikibreak will be good for Blu. When he returns, he can explain why he psrted with such a virulent personal attack. We cannot block for personal attacks? Oh, but we can. Blue is welcome back next time he turns up, but when he does want to come back, he should be first asked to apologise for parting in such a way.

<p>I'd concur that the block, and Doc glasgow's extension are correct given Blu Aardvark's recent contrib history and his current making of personal attacks against valued contributors. I'd have said 24-48 hrs block for the user page personal attacks alone, but coupled with a prior history of disruption in terms of incremental blocking a month would not be unreasonable. I'm not sure I'd have likely made it that long had I blocked him myself but, well, I couldn't have said there was any reason why that was inappropriate, if he has indeed become disaffected with Wikipedia and is no longer editing as a productive member of our community. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 22:39, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Cyde's link is to one diff of Blu's, perhaps if someone concuring with this block could contribute more links to establish a pattern of disruption, we could get past the NPA issue? I would agree that my <i>impressions</i> are that Blu's contributions of late are largely critical commentary, but I don't feel it's always been in bad faith or intentionally disruptive. So to me, this seems an excessive reaction. Still, I haven't <i>researched</i> the issue, so (like many, I'd assume), I'm comparing it to things with Grue up above...who restored a deletion and blanked a DRV discussion in the midst of a quite busy discussion. Before blocks against either user extend past a week, could we discuss things more calmly, here or at RfC/RfAr?</p>

<dd>Well, guess it's not my day to play the voice of reason. Still, one last try. Blu, the "if you insist on calling me the bad guy, I'll give you a bad guy" tactic has <i>never</i> worked. It will not reverse any blocks, it will not win any admins to your side, and it will not call down retribution against anyone you consider a troll. If it makes you feel better, well, not much else to say except <i>Wikipedia was never here to make you feel better.</i> Please reconsider your sock attacks, it helps no one to go out in a blaze.</dd>

<dd>I understand you're upset, but I've just looked at the debate over on DRV again, and Blu, it's you you starts slinging the profanity first (among you, Slimvirgin and JayJG). You probably could have continued to clarify your position on those issues if you hadn't let go of your language.

<dd>As for the blocks, if Blu agrees to stop posting through socks and seek resolution of his differences with Slimvirgin and JayJG through the official dispute process, would admins here agree to reduce his block down to 48 hours? I think we can all see he's angry, but that he's not out cause real damage.</dd>

<dd>There is no dispute with Jay or myself. We've had almost nothing to do with him, and in fact the first I heard of him was when he started the personal attacks on me. He's also launched attacks on others, including Raul654, Kelly Martin, Grace Note, and Malber.

<dd><i>The sockpuppetry is simply him showing his true colors.</i> is a pretty determanistic phrase for someone you've had little contact with.

But if it colors perceptions of <i>him</i>, I feel he has the right to clarify things. I just think he went about it entirely the wrong way tonight.</dd>

<p>I have no problem with this block. In fact, he says he's leaving, and due to the fact that he's contributed nothing to the encyclopedia and has continued to make vile personal attacks, with sockpuppets, I see no reason he shouldn't be blocked indefinitely.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black"><font color="#FC0FC0">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:52, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Honestly if people are going to come here and act all nice, and ten leave with attacks, and when blocked for attacks say "okay I'll come back and be nasty", you have to wonder whether they ever had any really good intentions in the first place.

<p>Allow me to make an apology to those whom I have offended by my actions. Sometimes what I need most in cases like this is a little time away from the computer. There was no excuse for my personal attacks, or the sockpuppets I used to launch more personal attacks. I know that technically, I am blocked, so I shouldn't be leaving this message, but I do ask whoever is watching this page to consider leaving the message here rather than reverting it. I will from this point on respect the block, although I do want to make clear that I disagree with it vehemently. What Cyde should have done was to talk to me and ask me to change my userpage; instead, he changed it for me and blocked me for a week. At the same time, I was trying to clarify accusations that I am an anti-Semite, Nazi sympathyzer [<i>sic</i>], or a even a Nazi myself. Those accusations <i>hurt</i>, regardless of what you think of me or of Wikipedia Review.</p>
<p>Again, I do apologize for my actions, because whether I was right or wrong, I went about things in the wrong way. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">User:Blu Aardvark</a>, at <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.160.85.198.html" title="User:72.160.85.198">72.160.85.198</a> 04:52, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm afraid that we aren't seeing eye-to-eye. I don't see stating that I feel that such an edit consists of censorship is a personal attack. I don't think that you should be delinking sites because you don't agree with them. First of all, the whole idea of doing that doesn't seem to make much sense to me - basically, you don't want a search engine to follow it, for whatever reason - maybe it's full of hate speech, or whatever - but when a person copy+pastes the URL in their browser, it's stored in the autocomplete. How is that better? It's less convienent for all parties, and if the site really is THAT bad, it's stored in a person's browser autocomplete until they clear it - if indeed they know how. As for search engine caching, I don't think that's a serious issue. Maybe it would raise the site in search results by one hit, bringing it to, say, page 36 on a relevant internet search. (Seriously, the site isn't that relevant or notable - even a search for "Wikipedia Review" in quotes only turns the site up on the seventh or eight result.) As for the sockpuppet, yes, I do have an additional one, but I do not intend to use that sockpuppet to violate policy (Well, maybe to perform constructive edits if a ridulous ban is kept, but I honestly don't feel that to be abuse). I'd rather not identify it, because, well, that would defeat the purpose of having it around. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">User:Blu Aardvark</a>, at <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.160.85.198.html" title="User:72.160.85.198">72.160.85.198</a> 09:06, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wonder, what if everbody had just cooled down a bit? Blu called some respected people 'trolls'. He was banned for what, a week? Vandals get treated better that <i>that</i>. It seems to happen quite a few times that the notion of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proportionality_%28law%29.html" title="Proportionality (law)">proportionality (law)</a> is abandoned. People on the receiving end of the block perceive this as unjust and then start to fight back. And strangely, we are surprised and blame 'em for it. What if, instead of blocking him, people would just have practiced some Tact<sup>tm</sup> and gone to his page to say 'this is uncalled for, maybe you should take some time away from the comp'. Would that have spurred him to an uncontrollable sockpuppet frenzy as well? I wonder.

<li>OK, this situation is probbly beyond repair. And Blu and wikipedia are most likely on the road to parting company for good. But since his above posts indicate a slightly cooler tone, it is probably worth an attempt at going the extra mile. Socks stink, but talk is normally good, so I'm going to unprotect his talk page for now so a conversation becomes possible. Any further socks, or anything that even smells of a personal attack and it should be protected again (and I'll be watching offsite too).

<blockquote>
<p>Subject: unfair block<br />
<br />
it seems like user SlimVirgin is abusing his privilages in the midst of a discussion.<br />
please, note my follwoing complaints:<br />
1)the above user has blocked me for no apparent valid reason.<br />
2)He has used the block in the midst of a dicussion, and then took the freedom to revert my edit.<br />
3)He has nominiate a new article by me for "speedy deletion" and indeed deleted it without any discussion. I'ts indeed a shame that I can not provide you any link to that article, but it was -in my humble opinion- a very useful article.<br />
4)He has used threats against me and still use in the midst of discussion, a fact I’ve already complaint and was assured by Benon that they better should be ignored. (see my user page)&lt;br 5)He has took to privilage of my block to "vandalise" my user page", a fact which is the most disturbing.<br />
<br />
Please, if you can, take the trouble to look my relevant edits and ublock me. It is really unfair to have such<br />
"discussion" on wikipedia. And may I suggest, that an administrator who constantly uses threants and indeed blocks other users in the midst of discussion, should be deprived from such privileges.<br /></p>

The same anon seems to now be claiming that a) the Joshuaz account was not that user (I am strongly skeptical of this) and has furthermore produced screen shots claiming to show someone using this user name at zerohorizon forum to engage in attacks and inflammatory rhetoric. The screen shots also show the individual having a link to my Wikipedia user page in their sig. This is ridiculous for among other reasons, 1) I don't use my user page as a personal webpage by any stretch of the imagination and explicitly frown upon extra material on user pages (and say so <i>on</i> my user page). 2) The user that this individual claims is me also uses vulgar vocab that I think everyone who knows me on Wikipedia would know that I don't use in disputes. Can some impartial admin please get to the bottom of this? My current guess is that <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">User:Benapgar</a>(who i was involved in getting indefinitely banned from Wikipedia) is behind this.

<dd>First, you don't unilaterally expand the <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">blocking policy</a> (in your <b>own favor</b>, I might add) here on AN/I. Second, you don't enforce this not-policy on editors you're involved in the dispute with (namely, <b>me</b>) as you've done. Third, you don't abuse your sysop powers by demanding people you're in conflict with stop doing the actions you dispute to get unblocked (as you did with me). It is highly inappropriate and wrong. It also violates <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> (specifically, the section titled "When not to block"). —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 00:37, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<p><i>This is all from yesterday and today.</i> And this user has a very long history of such edit warring, attacks, and frankly, inability to work within the collaborative system we have here.

<p>There's a revert war going on on the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> article, in which Rhobite (an admin) has participated in up to the maximum '3 per day'. I understand how heated opinions can get on a prominent article like that, but I believe he has acted inappropriately.</p>
<p>He deleted a section of text from the article, which I didn't revert - but questioned on talk. He did not answer my request for his rationale and participation before revert warring, but instead waited a few days and then this evening proceeded to game 3RR (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&amp;diff=45971041&amp;oldid=45967296" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&amp;diff=45971041&amp;oldid=45967296" rel="nofollow">00:54, 29 March 2006</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&amp;diff=46560333&amp;oldid=46558665" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&amp;diff=46560333&amp;oldid=46558665" rel="nofollow">01:24, 2 April 2006</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&amp;diff=46561118&amp;oldid=46560558" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&amp;diff=46561118&amp;oldid=46560558" rel="nofollow">01:35, 2 April 2006</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&amp;diff=46561766&amp;oldid=46561586" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&amp;diff=46561766&amp;oldid=46561586" rel="nofollow">01:43, 2 April 2006</a>) and level an unwarranted and unseemly personal attack at me on his talk page:</p>

<p>I don't think that's appropriate. While I am active on a number of political articles, it's not the sole focus of my work here and such revert warring and personal attacks are unbecoming of an administrator. I've not accused him of such bias despite our political differences and don't deserve this kind of personal attack, which is certainly against the assumption of Good Faith that is at the very heart of Wikipedia. I'm also glad to move this to an RfC if that's more appropriate. Can other admins provide some insight and comments?

<dd>Rhobite does seen a bit incivil here, I am not sure about NPA yet, at least not seriously. Though it takes 2+ to edit war. I don't see Rhobite as a reverting warring. If he is, then so are the others...He also does not seem to just be reverting without explanation. Betweeen the summaries and the talk page, I see no major wrong doing. I would say that some of Ryan's reasoning for including the text is against WP:OR; the exact ramifications of FISA and domestic spying still seem to be debated. I will explain on talk more, but I don't want to get into content here.

<dd>Rhobite specifically said he reverted without reading the discussion surrounding the text. I reverted his deletions when it was clear he made them without participating or reading the discussion. While I participated in the discussion and he did not, we are both guilty of revert warring, for sure. However, the personal attacks are what prompted this AN/I.

<dd>While Rhobite could have behaved slightly better, there's clearly no abuse of his admin powers here, and you could have behaved slightly better as well. People bumping back and forth somewhat incivilly is to be discouraged, but this doesn't rise to the level of an abuse incident IMHO. Nor a revert war; bouncing something back and forth a few times a week isn't a war. A few times a day, between two parties, is the beginnings of a war. A dozen or so times a day, that's a war. You both can calm down and behave a little better, but no reason for anyone else to get involved from outside (so far). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 08:28, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>By saying Rhobite 'could have behaved slightly better', does that mean 'Rhobite shouldn't have called RyanFreisling a 'single-issue editor, whose goal is to malign GWB'? Because that was pretty blatant and that's why I'm here. I was happy to walk away from the revert war when 3RR was reached (and did), but the personal attack on Kevin Baas and me <b>on the basis of our political views</b> was and is unwarranted in my eyes. I'm a well-intentioned WIkipedia editor and have made many valuable contributions to many articles. I'm not here to malign (speak evil of) anyone.

<dd>Most telling, while co-opting this incident to level attacks at me, Mr J galt didn't post links alleging abusive behavior on my part, he just posted a link to attempt to define my POV with a single representative edit - and an editor's political views (or someone's opinion of their views) should not be used to attack or diminish that editor. Please, Mr J galt, observe <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, and open an RfC or a different incident here, if you feel this strongly about my conduct. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 04:22, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have to side with Ryan on this. I don't think that Rhobite, an editor I have a lot of respect for, was fair or civil with his comment about Ryan and Kevin Baas. It's the kind of comment that should be reserved for trolls or those that have nothing to add but POV...and though I don't necessarily agree with the Ryan's or Kevin's edit on the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W_Bush_83e6.html" title="George W Bush">George W Bush</a> article, I do consider that both of these editors are pretty bright and deserve a little more consideration. I don't think an Rfc is in order, but it would be nice to remember who is a an editor of standing and who isn't. I don't agree with ryan or Kevin that the information they supported should be in the first couple of paragraphs, but I can see no reason why it shouldn't be covered in the article, under it's own subheading even.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 04:49, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is more of an inquiry. I am wondering what is the take of wikipedia on edits that very much look like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Macedonia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46412180" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Macedonia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46412180" rel="nofollow">google bombing</a>? (what <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_bombing.html" title="Google bombing">google bombing</a> is). Is that legal, and if so upto how many repetitions are allowed? It looks to me like the user is trying to manipulate search engine results, but I might be wrong. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunkyFly_03f0.html" title="User:FunkyFly">FunkyFly</a> 19:27, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, let me get this right, because of him placing the word Macedonia on his userpage nearly 100 times, he will alter the Google search engine so that Macedonia will have a higher page count than the other names of this country, like Republic of Macedonia and FYROM? <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 20:44, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not guessing what he intends to do, just basically to what extend is such a repetition allowed. Is it OK to enter a word 1 million times for example? <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunkyFly_03f0.html" title="User:FunkyFly">FunkyFly</a> 22:08, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Another inquiry. What should be done in case a given website is not accessible outside its country of origin, its availability is somehow restricted - maybe the server does not have international connectivity or it deliberately rejects international accesses. What if someone in the country uses that page as a source? That might be the case for <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Serbia_4d8c.html" title="Economy of Serbia">Economy of Serbia</a>. Look at the history for more details. I'm trying to give the anonymous user who inserted the source credit, and not just reject the website as a bad link, because at least the domain is correct. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunkyFly_03f0.html" title="User:FunkyFly">FunkyFly</a> 19:47, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

I believe <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorbertArthur_ab3b.html" title="User:NorbertArthur">NorbertArthur</a> should be blocked (heck, I think he should be banned, but that's another matter), but since he has chosen to turn his venom on me for what I at least <i>believe</i> was a totally appropriate remark, it would be unseemly for me to make that decision. I would very much welcome an uninvolved administrator blocking him. If anyone thinks that anything is wrong with my conduct in this matter, please let me know where they think I was out of line.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I came over to the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanians.html" title="Romanians">Romanians</a> page (which I believe I had not looked at since December 2005) at <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a>'s request (via email). He asked me to look at it because I know more about Romania than he does. However, as I think my edits and remarks over the last 45 minutes will readily confirm, I did not come over there as a partisan for Jayjg's views. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 20:17, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

However, this template suggests that only backslash/prime-inserting IP accounts <i>that vandalize</i> WP are to be blocked, whereas my understanding is that any account inserting the backslash-prime sequence, regardless of whether the edits are in fact malicious, are considered undesirable. Could you clarify, please? We should probably edit the template if indeed every one of these IPs is to be blocked. —<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;cursor:crosshair;"><b>Encephalon</b></span></a> 21:48, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Any proxy which introduces backslashes is going to be harmful to Wikipedia just from polluting article contents.

<dd>I'm also a bit concerned that some at least of these "meatpuppets" might be potential contributors. There seems a bit of a witch hunt on for Jason, which may be playing into his hands. I don't, for example, see what deleting a recent edit from my talk page achieved. It's still there in the history, and I still get a heads-up about it, and I don't see what damage it did anyway. Similarly, I'm not convinced it's good to speedy delete everything that <i>suspected</i> meat puppets, even of banned users, create.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, I'm not even too comfortable about the term <i>meat puppet</i>. It at least goes close to violating <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTACK_3b8e.html" title="WP:ATTACK">WP:ATTACK</a> IMO.</dd>

<dd>If it's a sock of Jason, then certainly the revert of my talk page was justified in terms of policy, and a block in order. But even in that case I still can't see what the revert achieved. It seems like a waste of everyone's time to me.

<dd>Since this are socks of Jason, we should monitor the edits on the pages he usually edits. If any of you received the email or like to see it, I can forward it to you. He is banned from editing for a year and is placed on a probation. He's violating his probation and I will monitor the current situation (by checking the new user log). --<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">Ter</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">nc</a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerence_Ong_215c.html" title="User talk:Terence Ong">e Ong</a> 11:09, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user has been repeatedly writing about Guy Peters a/k/a Vít Zvánovec, a Czech Wikipedian, in articles such as Guy Peters, Vít Zvánovec, and Vit Zvanovec (the last now has {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeletedpage_0567.html" title="Template:Deletedpage">deletedpage</a>}} on it) using a strong Pro-VZ, anti-Czech Wikipedia, POV. He has repeatedly reposted almost the same exact content multiple times and has refused to back down. I think a block is in order here. --<a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETML1988_e998.html" title="User:TML1988">TML1988</a> 03:00, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
