<dd>I'd oppose that. Category order should be flexible; see the discussion at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ECategorization_of_people_a8ff.html#What_is_the_issue_here.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Categorization of people">Wikipedia talk:Categorization of people#What is the issue here?</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 22:06, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd also oppose it for similar reasoning. While sorting by relevance may be subjective, the same can be said for any authorial decisions regarding structure or content of an article. The times when sorting alphabetically makes sense is when no reasonable order of relevance exists or when an item in the list is likely to be searched for. In the case of categories, I'd argue that they are more likely to be looked at to find related categories of articles, and for this purpose it would be more useful to put the most "relevant" categories first. If need be, an editor comment explaining the rationale behind the ordering should help when consensus on relevance is desired or to assist editors in maintaining the ordering. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a><b>•</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doug_Bell_cc6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doug Bell">contrib</a></sup> 21:32, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Relevance" is POV based on the person editing or reading the article, nothing more. The very next person will most likely disagree with the ordering, and change it. If it's alphabetical, you won't have anyone saying "but B should come before A". --<a href="../../../k/b/d/User%7EKbdank71_f952.html" title="User:Kbdank71">Kbdank71</a> 21:56, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>"Relevance" is POV</i> — pretty much total disagreement here, at least if this was intended as a sideways reference to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, unless we want to say the entire encyclopedia is POV. We constantly have to make subjective authorial and editorial judgements regarding relevance in order to create the encyclodedia. If we're not making these judgements, then how do we decide what articles to include and not to include; what to include in the article and what not to include; and what order to discuss items in an article (or maybe we should just sort the subtopics in an article alphabetically?) The fact is, we can't create an encyclopedia without continuously making judgements regarding relevance. Now what I do agree with is that the next person to come along might have a different idea regarding relevance and change it—gee, that sounds kind of like how the whole editing and article creation process here works. Using order of relevance is not only acceptable, but I would say it is often preferred. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a><b>•</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doug_Bell_cc6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doug Bell">contrib</a></sup> 22:09, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I just unprotected <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Apologetics_and_Research_Ministry_7a58.html" title="Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry">Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry</a>. This page has been the scene of a rather nasty edit war. Particularly, a member of CARM claims to have initiated legal action and then subsequently used sockpuppets and/or meatpuppets (the meatpuppets at least are confirmed) to continue editing the page while banned. I have unprotected the page because it has been protected for more than two weeks. However, I fear that people will resume the edit warring and perhaps try to bias the article as a result of the unprotection. If some other admins could monitor the page, I'd much appreciate it. I have no opinion as to the current level of bias in the page and frankly, I wish I had never heard of the page. But what I'm saying is that I'm not claiming the current page is unbiased, only that it is guaranteed to swing one way or another if the edit warring resumes. Particularly watch for people removing criticism from the article, or for other people inserting additional duplicated criticism. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 04:48, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, for one thing the article is generally deficient. I learned more from the opening paragraphs of <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2006/Jan/20-127177.html" class="external text" title="http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2006/Jan/20-127177.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> than I did from the article. Since the stay behind networks were real, a hoax tag over the whole article seems dishonest. The question seems to be whether or not these stay-behind groups committed acts of domestic terrorism. There should be a way of covering all of this in the article, i.e. a) what is known and not disputed about the stay at home networks; b) what is alleged, noting the sources on both sides of the forgery question. If there is any violation in protecting the version without the hoax tag it is minor; an uninvolved admin would have a 50/50 chance of picking that version anyway. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 00:58, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think we would do well to define preferred usage for select terms and phrases to promote consistency, create a central place to debate/discuss preferences, and have a style guide that can be referenced to settle these style disputes. The Web vs. web vs. Web site vs. web site vs. website is a perfect example. In 1996, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Berners-Lee_4c85.html" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> said <i>the Web</i> should be capitalised to distinguish it from a spider’s web. Common practice and style guides have diverged from the initial practice of capitalisation of <i>World Wide Web</i>, <i>the Web</i>, <i>the Internet</i> and <i>the Net</i> and use of <i>Web site</i>, <i>on-line</i> and <i>e-mail</i>.

<dd>Feel free to check the contributions of all of these "banned sockpuppets" and take note that they are not vandalizing any pages in ANY way outlined <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL</a> (civil TALK page-oriented "edit warring" is not a form of vandalism), are responding in talk page with valid arguments, have sources to back up all their arguments for removal of references to Jewishness, and are generally being ignored and even sometimes harassed by Runcorn. Every single name deleted from a list of Jews AND every single mention of Jewishness deleted from an article, has a valid reference or source backing it up. If it does not, then it is because no references exist to suspect any of these people are Jewish. Runcorn fails to provide an pretext for his bans. His reason for each ban is "sockpuppet of whoever" yet, interestingly, it states nothing of the need to ban non-abusive "sockpuppets" in WP:Sockpuppetry solely on the basis that they are sockpuppets. Users being banned for persistently vandalizing pages may be a different story. Furthermore, Runcorn actually SUPPORTS the edits of sockpuppets of other banned users. Specifically ones who are prone to add reference-less mentions of Judaism to people's articles. Finally, for those of you wondering why I'm editing as an anon, if a choose to make an account, Runcorn will simply ban the account as a "sockpuppet," so I can't see a reason for even trying.</dd>

<p>I came on here and created a new account. I then started a Wiki on the band, Hundredfold. It was instantly deleted and protected. Why did this happen? Can we undo this so that I can post information about this band? This is a band that tours all over the world and I think people would want to talk about them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Hundredfold (<a href="../../../h/u/n/User_talk%7EHundredfold_4d0b.html" title="User talk:Hundredfold">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hundredfold_4021.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hundredfold">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>In the first place, what you created was an article, not a wiki. Wikipedia as a whole is a wiki. Secondly, you created the article under the user name User:Hundredfold, which indicates that you have a vested interest in the band which would tend to violate our <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> guideline. Thirdly, the article had previously been deleted twice before due to lack of notability as outlined in our guideline at <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. Fourthly, such sentences as <i>Take one listen to Hundredfold..s VIA SIRENS (Listen Well) and you will understand the industry buzz that has been generated over this talented foursome.</i> does not an encyclopedia make.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I didn't see another category for my concern, so I'm posting it here.</p>
<p>Mitsos' user page really disturbs me - I'm not entirely sure how I found it, but I did.</p>
<p>He has a long article on his user page that's a racist polemic. He also has a userbox that declares him to be a white nationalist. Is this allowed?</p>
<p>I know there was a lengthy and controversial discussion on the use of a pedophile userbox, but I never saw the final judgement.</p>
<p>I'm....uncomfortable....</p>

<dd>Deleting a db-group tag from a page you created yourself is vandalism - perhaps you should explain this to this single editor, telling him to: add {{hangon}} to the top of the page, and explain why the page should not be deleted on the talk page.

The request was made in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Steve_block&amp;diff=87585300&amp;oldid=87512588" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Steve_block&amp;diff=87585300&amp;oldid=87512588" rel="nofollow">these diffs</a>, and I found it hard to refuse. I don't think anyone's work or home life should suffer because of Wikipedia, and I don't think Wikipedia needs the bad publicity if someone loses their job or home through such an addiction and Wikipedia did nothing to act. I also think it's best to assume such requests are made in good faith. Hence I'm ignoring all rules because I believe that not doing so may be harmful to Wikipedia. Now I'm bringing it here because I may be too close to the user to make an objective opinion on the situation, because I've worked with the user on a number of articles, and also because I may be wrong, there may be consequences I've missed or I may be being gamed. If people want to unblock, I am willing to accept that, and any other censure. Okay, that's what I did and why, so what's the score? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:25, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Homey has e-mailed an editor asking him to edit for Homey by proxy. An editor on <a href="../../../a/n/i/Talk%7EAnimal_liberation_movement_2a53.html" title="Talk:Animal liberation movement">Talk:Animal liberation movement</a> received an e-mail on November 11 from someone calling himself Roncey Valley/Nick Cockburn. The e-mailer told the editor that I had removed Homey's "the animal rights movement is fascist and anti-Semitic" edits (which Homey had added to various articles as <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J_07bd.html" title="User:Farnsworth J">User:Farnsworth J</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J._4c1d.html" title="User:Farnsworth J.">User:Farnsworth J.</a>), and asked the user to restore them, saying "I can't get involved publicly (so please do not respond on my talk page) but could you look at the page and see about either restoring the stuff she removed or moving it to another article like Animal welfare?" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Animal_liberation_movement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87448487" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Animal_liberation_movement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87448487" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>"Nick Cockburn" is Homey. I know this because I've received e-mails from Nick Cockburn before, repeating very unpleasant, supposedly personal, material that was being published about me on Wikipedia Review and on an attack site run by WordBomb. There's no question that the e-mails came from Homey. I won't repeat the evidence here for obvious reasons, but I've forwarded it to a number of admins who've been dealing with this situation.</p>
<p>The person set up an account on November 11 as <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoncey_Valley_5a63.html" title="User:Roncey Valley">User:Roncey Valley</a> in order to be able to use the Wikipedia e-mail system. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=newusers&amp;user=Roncey+Valley&amp;page=" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=newusers&amp;user=Roncey+Valley&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>I observed that <a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">User:Ghirlandajo</a> has at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fief_of_Viipuri&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fief_of_Viipuri&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> created an edit history in order to prevent reverse move, as these Viipuri names seem to be his battleground. After his movement, he made reverting impossible without using admin tools by adding history to the redirect. According to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_AndriyK_ce16.html#Reversal_of_irreversible_page_moves" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/AndriyK">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/AndriyK#Reversal_of_irreversible_page_moves</a> such act deserves block.</p>
<p>I request that edit history to be deleted.</p>
<p>In addition, Girlandajo erased my warning against his undiscussed moves of controversial pages (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGhirlandajo&amp;diff=87498704&amp;oldid=87480658" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGhirlandajo&amp;diff=87498704&amp;oldid=87480658" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>) and by its edit comment, accused me of nationalistic trolling. Which is inconceivable. (And of course a grave personal attack.)</p>
<p>It seems to be well-known that Ghirlandajo makes page moves and wages edit wars, without discussing at all. The history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russo-Swedish_War_%281495%E2%80%931497%29&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russo-Swedish_War_%281495%E2%80%931497%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> is just an example of edit and move wars wage by Ghirlandajo, and the article's talkpage displays that Ghirlandajo has never bothered to discuss anything about that article.</p>
<p>I request that Ghirlandajo be blocked from editing Wikipedia for some time. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarrtel_9c5d.html" title="User:Marrtel">Marrtel</a> 18:52, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a judgement call, and obviously we usually err on the side of assuming good faith even if it's been there a while. But keeping deleted articles in one's userspace has attracted negative consequences in arbitration cases before. If the articles being in the userspace aren't being a problem, then it's not being a problem - e.g. if the article content is noncontroversial. If the content is somehow controversial or problematic, then probably the first thing to do is to ask nicely what their plans are for them, perhaps offering editorial help. Heck, bring a deleted article back to a good condition is a very nice use of userspace - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 20:21, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I disagree. Adding that template, when you're not an admin, is a form of vandalism itself. I'd leave a note, remove the template, and then report them on the vandalism project.

<dd>Since the Indian actress was a superstar and the Pakistani one isn't, that would justify covering the more popular one at Nargis and the lesser known one at Nargis (Pakistani Actress).

<li>Anarch was definitely edit warring; it appears to be an issue over the definition of the term "capitalism" as employed by several people. The fourth edit was different from the first three, but seems to serve the same purpose. It's also telling that one of the first actions Anarch took after his half-a-day block expired was to make a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mutualism_%28economic_theory%29&amp;diff=87778083&amp;oldid=87729010" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mutualism_%28economic_theory%29&amp;diff=87778083&amp;oldid=87729010" rel="nofollow">similar edit</a>, albeit with weaker wording than he originally made. After this was reverted once more, he has now added {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPov-section_5dd7.html" title="Template:Pov-section">pov-section</a>}}, which seems like a reasonable solution.

<ul>
<li>If the user is edit warring, he should have been blocked for that. Blocking someone for 3RR should be based on <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. If the admin would have blocked <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">User:Anarcho-capitalism</a> for edit warring, <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">User:Donnachadelong</a> could and have been blocked as well.

<li>It appears that Sasquatch may have considered the fourth edit to be substantially similar to the first three. However, I notice he hasn't yet responded to your query. The other side of the edit war appears to consist of Donnacha and Libertatia, which explains why they have less reverts individually. Of course, two against one doesn't mean the two are right; it may have been better to protect the page rather than block the one party, but that's hindsight. At any rate, an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Anarcho-capitalism_d9cc.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Anarcho-capitalism">RFC</a> has now been opened, which may help.

One of the pages on my watchlist is <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Seven_Samurai_134d.html" title="The Seven Samurai">The Seven Samurai</a></i>, I have noticed that in the last year, on two seperate occasions (Jan 29th and Sept 28th), the category "Criterion Collection films" were deleted. On Oct 22nd <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECop_633_e50e.html" title="User:Cop 633">User: Cop 633</a> went around the category designation by creating an info box listing the CC's films in the order of their original release and began applying it to the films in question.

I am simply trying to get an administrator to take a look at this situation so that we can avoid an edit war. I understood the reasoning for taking the categories out, but, I have to say that they were less obtrusive than these boxes and they gave one a chance of seeing all of their releases on one page.

<dd>Boxes are inherently less useful than categories, IMO. They add bulk without adding content. That's just me, though: I really am no box fan. (Don't fence me in, either.) If the purpose is to make finding common elements easy, then a cat works best. If the purpose is to <i>advertise for Criterion,</i> then the box, which forces you to see every film whenever you look at information for one film, is better. I regard the latter to be outside of our purpose. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:35, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ugh! Talk about your box hell: that article is worse than a UPS wharehouse. It occurs to me that people are sometimes looking for information about the thing at the top of the page, not about "films of Kurasawa," "budget," "preceded by/followed by" in the Criterion Collection, etc. You know <i>a box</i> is one thing, but five is a bit much, and I worry that our poor reader will have so many voices shouting at her eyes, saying, "Read me!" that she won't learn anything about that particular film. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:33, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A vandal who has vandalized my page twice with personal attack phrases and also other pages many times has been caught. Poor guy he forgot to turn off his signature script and the user is none other than a registered user who previously vandalised the Velupillai Prabhakaran page - SnowolfD4. Note the ones below:</p>
<p>1). Please check this topic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASudharsansn&amp;diff=87989520&amp;oldid=87965997" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASudharsansn&amp;diff=87989520&amp;oldid=87965997" rel="nofollow">"F..ing Demalu, we want you all dead. Your and your NCSLC bull. Need some good 'ole lynch. --snowolfD4( talk / @ )"</a>. He has vandalized my userpage and talk page with foul language and racist remarks. He had to do two changes, one with his signature and the other with his signature removed and both of them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=208.101.4.34" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=208.101.4.34" rel="nofollow">from this IP 208.101.4.34</a>. He is caught redhanded trying to vandalize pages with his signature turned on by mistake.</p>
<p>2). His post in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sudharsansn&amp;oldid=87989520#Stop_Picking_on_Lahiru" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sudharsansn&amp;oldid=87989520#Stop_Picking_on_Lahiru" rel="nofollow">my talk page</a> which is clearly personal attack/vandalism</p>
<p>3). FYI, the user has already been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Snowolfd4" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Snowolfd4" rel="nofollow">blocked thrice in Wikipedia</a>. He has resorted to using abusive language and 'Demalu' means 'Tamilians' and he basically wants all 'F** Tamilians to die, which quite evidently is a bad racist remark and also my WP:NCSLC project closed, which goes completely against Wiki policies.</p>

<dd>Dear user,</dd>
<dd>Many of my students at my Private School called the "Learning Community School" are complaining about being blocked from the internet site called "Wikipedia The Free Encyclopedia". I don't know the reason for this six month ban. The private school IP is 72.177.68.38, which is located in a residential area of Austin.</dd>
<dd>I has asked some of the student if they vandalized Wikipedia, many of the students are bullying a student, which was a contributor of Wikipedia under the name Bobabobabo which what she told was having problems with some users over Pokamon articles which looking up articles not school related is against the rules, so the three students began creating user names and began vandalizing the pages that Bobabobabo editted. She and I talked about the bullying. I restricted the three students from using the computer until next year.</dd>
<dd>I hope you can reconsider unblocking the IP and Bobabobabo because what she has told was she being made fun.</dd>

<dd>Thank you,</dd>

<p>It seems to have a ring of truth to it, but is sent from an yahoo.com address, which can of course be faked by anyone. It also doesn't boost my confidence that just a day earlier, Bobabobabo had (as far as i know, falsely) told me that <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a> (<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Centrx_499f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Centrx">contribs</a>) agreed to have her block lifted.

<dd>An idea: why not ask her to send an email from her .edu address in order to verify her title? I don't think that's asking too much; if we're dealing with a 6 month ban, and just considering ignoring her anyway, I don't think another day or two hastle in getting her to send it from an official address would be a problem. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 18:27, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Based on that email, I wonder why the teacher is asking for the block to be lifted. The teacher realizes Bobabobabo was using school computers to edit Pokemon articles, which is against their rules. Why would a teacher ask us to lift a ban that would allow a student to go back to breaking school rules? Because she feels bad the student was bullied?

<p>Certain editors of wikipedia, most notably <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">User:Tobias Conradi</a>, have repeatedly expressed misgivings about what they see as being possible collusion among administrators. The downside of this is that, unfortunately, the only people who have the authority to really discipline administrators are in fact other administrators, whom these individuals can then accuse of colluding with the administrator whose possible discipline is at issue. To date, I seriously doubt that this is a major issue, but it could become one, particularly as the individual mentioned above seems to possibly be heading for a long-term ban from wikipedia, which he would then, of course, blame on the collusion of the admins. On that basis I have created a proposal for a group consisting of admins, non-admins, and possibly even Wikimedia beaureaucrats and employees which might take complaints regarding admin conduct which they either feel other admins might not be competent to judge and/or as a alternate process, or possibly a higher or lower step in the same process. Basically, something like the police boards of most areas. The proposal is at <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_Admin_Oversight_Board_252f.html" title="User:Badbilltucker/Admin Oversight Board">User:Badbilltucker/Admin Oversight Board</a>, and I would welcome any input, positive or negative. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 15:07, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I agree with both of the above. Personally, I think it would work best if it were created as a secondary, or appeal, step for someone who has already applied to the administrators and not been satisfied with the response, or been the subject of administrator action which s/he feels isn't justified. The person presenting the case would be obliged to provide all the evidence for their claim when presenting it. The oversight board could then review the case and either agree to "take on" the case or decide not to take it on. In the latter event, they would be indicating that they substantially agreed with the original decision by not taking on the case. Also, in the rare instances when an admin actually is being considered for discipline, it could potentialy function as the jury in the case. Also, with any luck, the non-admins on the committee would be individuals specifically chosen on a case-by-case basis, maybe from a list of potential members. This might consist of people whose RfA has failed for reasons not related to conduct and/or long-time generally respected editors who for whatever reason have chosen not to seek adminship. Such individuals would probably be most likely to be considered least inclined to automatically support administrator action. Of course, as it is only a proposal, any alternative suggestions are welcome. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 16:03, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>You're proposing a board consisting of trusted non-admins. AFAICS, there are three categories of candidates from this board:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trusted users who could be an admin, but who are not interested in adminship;</li>
<li>New users who want to file an RfA in the future;</li>
<li>Users who failed an RfA (or who would fail an RfA if they would be nominated).</li>
</ol>
<p>I cannot really see why the first group would want to be a member of the board; they are either more interested in writing an encyclopedia. I wouldn't encourage the second group to join such a board: if the board would be effective, they would antagonize a lot of sitting admins. And I don't understand why we admins would trust the third group with overseeing us, when we don't even trust them to be an admin themselves. And without approval of the majority of our admins (who are, by and large, a very reasonable bunch of people), your board will not have the authority it needs to deal with problems.</p>
<p>The AOB would only have as much authority as admins would allow it to, and I don't think it will have very much. A better idea would be to create a board of (say, 15) trusted admins and non-admins, elected not only by admins, but by everyone with a low minimum number of edits. That board would then have the authority to arbitrate in conflicts between admins and non-admins, and perhaps also between two admins or two nonadmins. Perhaps we could even involve Jimbo in the selection, to be sure the board has the authority it needs. -- <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugène van der Pijll</a> 17:31, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would work, as it is a large enough number to allow any of the parties on the board to recuse themselves if they are in any way involved in the case. IF we could have one or two of the official staff of wikimedia involved as well, maybe Jimbo and/or anyone else, that would lend even more authority to the decisions, and make it very hard for any admin to ignore it. And it may not be a bad idea to require that any of the non-admins undergo some sort of admin coaching to prepare themselves for being on the board, whether they ever intend to become admins or not. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 17:35, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My idea was to encourage the <i>would-be admins</i> to do their homework (i.e. AOB). We really need future admins to be more dispute resolution oriented. This would exclude users who failed an RfA. As for the AOB committee, i don't see 15 people enough to handle this. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="SteelBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 17:38, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Remember, only those people who failed the RfA for non-conduct-related reasons would likely ever even be considered. So if someone who has been around for a fair time who still hasn't had a featured article, and failed for apparently that reason alone, were to be nominated, they would still have to receive a consensus vote to be on the board. That should exclude any who are too new or "tempermental". Also, as the board's meetings would probably take place in plain sight, either on the channels or on a board, transparency shouldn't be a problem. And, very likely, the majority of these persons would probably still have as many "followers" as "leaders". And if Jimbo or one of the other staff were to agree to take part, something I would dearly love to see happen, then a concern that has been expressed elsewhere could also be addressed by this group. Specifically, the potential legal complications an admin might face if he were sued in court for suspending someone with more money than sense or who otherwise wanted to get attention. If the staff or directors were to themselves be in the group which agrees to the action of the admin, then it's harder to sue the suspending admin for their actions which wikimedia has supported. I don't know how likely this scenario is either, but at least one admin, <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">User:Kingboyk</a>, had expressed concerns about it elsewhere. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 17:52, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Answers to the above two: the Arbritration Committee, so far as I understand, acts on things beyond simply questions of admin misconduct. This group would deal with nothing else. Also, if anyone knows of any wikipedians who are real-life jurists who would be willing to take part in such a board, and were to be able to verify their credentials somehow, I imagine that those individuals would be looked upon very favorably as potential members. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 18:15, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>There are over 1000 administrators. What exactly are the chances of collusion?</p>
<p>If the argument is that only a small number of administrators read or edit this noticeboard, or that administrator misconduct gets lost in the other discussions, why not address that, rather than a complicated approach that calls for elections and potentially conflicted "authorities"? In other words, if collusion seems possible in the current processes, why not modify those?</p>
<p>For example, there might be something like a RfRoAA (Request for Review of Administrator Action), where the agrieved party (non-admin) selects (say) two administrators who he/she feels aren't biased, as part of the RfRoAA; two administrators without involvement in the dispute volunteer to join the panel review the actions of the administrator in question; and the four of them select a 5th in some way (for example, from a standing pool of administrators who agree to be available) to fill out the panel. (This is somewhat analogous to <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitration.html" title="Arbitration">arbitration</a>.) If the complaining party has to come forward with two admins (who have agreed in advance to participate), then the process should be underway pretty quickly, and if the issue is simply whether an admin behaved properly, it's pretty easy to get a quick decision. That decision might not be binding in any way, but it at least would address the "collusion" issue, and would provide some help if the issue escalates. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 22:18, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that this seems to be an unnecessary complication. We see almost every day on ANI how hard it can be to get a consensus on action against a user or admin, so I don't see much likelihood that a few admins will successfully collude to impose inappropriate sanctions.

<p>This sounds like a case of x disagrees with y, but there is a consenus that y is okay. x refuses to accept that consensus. x needs to accept the consensus or build a consensus the other way or leave or fork or face community sanction. If we geared Wikipedia more to allowing x to be right, how would WIkipedia work, with thousands of x's all being right. Ultimately, Wikipedia has to run on agreement.

<dl>
<dd>Okay, I did anticipate these points, hence my use of the phrase anything <b>on</b> Wikipedia. Now yes, people can attempt to hide stuff, but the problem here seems to be that somebody feels people are complaining that when admin's agree on the admin's noticeboard, that is collusion. Admin's emailing each other can be seen to be collusion, but the place for discussing admin actions is, I believe, the main page associated to this talk page. (Note I'm phrasing carefully now to avoid misunderstanding.) If people think there is a problem with an admin action, they bring it here to be discussed. It doesn't really matter if there has been collusion, since there will then be a discussion of what happened and whether it was right or not. That's what's important, not any claims of collusion. We comment on the issue, not the user. How a decision to act is reached is less important than whether it was the right action to take. I wasn't aware we had an admin mailing list, to be honest. IRC is a whole 'nother ball game, one I have no interest in playing. The point I am making is this. The premise is flawed, because the solution to any problem there may be here is to generate discussion on Wikipedia in a high profile place, and then if there is a problem, act on any consensus or use the dispute resolution process. The problem is not as stated, which is actually a premise born from flaws. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 12:17, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I <b>think</b> the problem is that <b>some people</b> feel that the there is a certain element of (some) admins backing each other up regardless of the merits of the case.

<dd>I think then that we agree on part of what the problem might be, but not the solution. I do think, however, that what admins do isn't dispense justice, but mop up.

Look, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Connor_8056.html" title="William Connor">"it is a powerful hard thing to please all of the people all of the time"</a>. I'm not sure there is a consensus that arb-com is redundant. What seems to happen to me is that people who can't change Wikipedia to their own ends declare this to be the case. Wikipedia should always be an agreeable place, and a place where agreements are made and respected. Agitation is not helpful and not warranted and not part of our policies.</dd>

<dd>If 99 admins support an action, is the one not supporting right to throw accusations of "admins backing each other up regardless of the merits of the case" or should they assume good faith? Legitimate complaints will always be heard. If someone has a legitimate complaint, they should air it here. There must, though be a point at which there is acceptance of the fact that their legitimate complaint may prove unfounded, and in cases where it is proved so, there must be acceptance of that fact. We should not endeavour to create forum after forum in which people may complain because they feel the last forum was unfavourable. If people feel Jimmy is tainted, then I think they have to leave or fork, because as it stands Jimmy is at the top of the tree. Now I have a healthy disrespect of authority figures too, and I've had my share of disagreements with Jimmy too, but at the end of the day the place is structured with him at the top. The only way to change that is to fork or leave. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:34, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wrote <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_Review_8e9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator Review">Wikipedia:Administrator Review</a> with the same goal, but there wasn't enough interest to go anywhere with it. <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_ADMIN_c29e.html" title="WP:RFC/ADMIN">WP:RFC/ADMIN</a> seems to meet all of the proposed goals of this idea, I haven't seen compelling evidence that this offers anything additional. An existing process with community 'cred' should always trump new red tape, in my opinion. One thing that hasn't really gotten air time in this discussion that I'd be remiss to neglect is this: Most people who find themselves on the wrong side of a block or other admin action probably think it was unjustified. There, I said it. It's the 800lb gorilla that everyone has been carefully avoiding making eye contact with. The number of people hit with a block who say "Yeah, I appreciate the vacation, thank you for the block" is microscopic. If too much credence is given to the pencil threat that admins are colluding against the defenseless editors, it'll encourage a specific group of users who see conspiracies everywhere that they themselves are not responsible for any community censure, it's <i>obviously</i> one of the conspiracy admins. This isn't healthy, and would create a real barrier to keeping the signal/noise ratio positive. Tobias Conrad is used prominently as an example of why this new process should exist, but he's also a good demonstration of the deep flaw in the concept, because a review of his actions shows that he appears to think EVERY admin action that he objects to is an example of abuse and is more evidence of some sort of plot against him. We'd be doing both him and the encyclopedia a disservice if we gave him an alternative to assuming good faith, because <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is the foundation our discussions here must be built on. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 15:42, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While not disagreeing that the question of collusion and group admin misconduct is a generally fairly ridiculous one, I think that the purpose of having such a board is to hopefully fend off the possibility of the question being asked in the first place. If there is no "higher authority" or independent authority (and the arbitration committee is almost all admins), some irresponsible journalist (yes, there are such things) might be able to create a probably unsubstantiated story out of the accusation which would damage wikipedia, true or not. In practice, the oversight board would really only be called into existence when one of the rare cases which have substantiation is introduced. Otherwise, all that would happen would be rulings to the effect of "insufficient evidence put forward to justify a hearing", which would be given out by the few "clerks" of the board. I would think around 95% or more of the cases presented would clearly fall in this category. That being the case, only those in the "board clerk" group examing the cases would be involved, and then only to the point of reviewing the case and finding it to lack evidence. The number of "cases" this board would actually "hear" would probably be in the range of no more than a few dozen per year, if that. Also, having the spectre of the potential of such independent overview hanging over their head would probably make potentially abusive admins even less likely to engage in misconduct in the first place. If, as I think, two dozen cases per year would be the probable maximum heard, I would think maybe six total non-admins editors would ever be required to "fill out" the board (two or three per case), and we probably have at least half that number of non-admins already listed as agreeing to the proposal. Secondly, as has been indicated above, if an at least somewhat independent group were to rule that a given admin in a given case did not act improperly, the likelihood of an aggrieved party filing a costly civil suit against that admin would be greatly reduced, if not eliminated, on the basis of the board's "not guilty" ruling. I hope it is understood that this would not be a regular active part of wikipedia culture, but just an "emergency clause" brought into play when the situation calls for it.

<dd>Sorry for the tone here, but seriously, would no journalist think to write a story noting that whilst articles languish needing clean-up, a dozen or so Wikipedians are sorting out what arguments between users should be settled by a committee of grandees? I really do take the points you make Bill, but I don't see the problem. And what sort of authority is this board going to have? And where will it fit in with arb-com? And what's going to happen when a number of users accuse this board of collusion? Do we set up another board and fill it with people the complainant can hand pick? If you think an admin is out of order raise it here. If there are a few of you, start an RFC. We've got a dispute resolution process already, and mostly it asks us to talk about the problem, not create and empower committees and clerks to the committee who get to discuss which issues should be discussed. I'd guess this committee would need a secret mailing list and before you know it, blammo. The arb-com is voted for, and is mandated by the community. If people feel there are too many admins on the committee, maybe those people should stand up and run. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:57, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If a user feels he is being ganged up on there is already the <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">AMA</a>. How is this different?</li>
<li>Any findings made by a board of non-admins could only be advisory, one or more admins would have to carry out any actions. If there really is a cabal, what makes you think another board will help? If there is not a cabal, why would review of the admins' actions on the noticeboards not be sufficient?</li>
<li>If your board has an admin or two who carry out findings that are not supported by <i>admin</i> consensus, isn't that wheel warring?</li>
<li>If you start out with a dozen clerks, you might have two active at the end of the first month. I speak from experience.</li>
<li>If you give the clerks screening authority to bring cases before the board then they're not really clerks, at least not in the same sense as arbitration and checkuser clerks, who have no screening authority. Arguably you would need <b>even more stringent</b> selection procedures for the clerks than for the whole board.</li>

<li>I appreciate your effort to help but I have my concerns also. Likely it is another place that I'm going to need to put on my watchlist so I can stay on top of the major issues and problems. Already too many of those. Be prepared for <i>clueless newbies that do not understand dispute resolution and will leave discouraged no matter what you do</i>, <i>experienced users with longstanding grudges against each other</i>, <i>trolls and abusive sockpuppets</i>. You will get plenty of these, our other boards do regularly. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 18:40, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd want to see some evidence of actual collusion, as opposed to concerted action against a vandal. I think we already have too many places people have to go to look for help, to the point where I suspect many users never manage to find it. Not that I'm opposed to oversight in principle. Perhaps ArbCom should have fast-track procedure for alleged abuse of admin tools? Most such allegations, though, turn out to be routine "<a href="../../../r/o/u/WP%7EROUGE_ace2.html" title="WP:ROUGE">rouge admin abuse</a>", as noted above. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 19:36, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think the proposal has structural flaws, as discussed above. I understand the underlying purpose — to fend off charges of cabalism — but I think that's ultimately a doomed cause. The people who raise the most vocal and vociferous accusations of grand conspiracies are also the sort who engage in vexatious and meritless litigation. A painstakingly independent oversight board isn't going to convince these people to change; they'll just declare that The Cabal has co-opted the board as well and go off to WR in high dudgeon, just as before. Furthermore, I think that expecting journalists to understand all the ramifications of the Wikipedia power structure is over-sanguine. I think we're better off leaving that 5% or whatever of justified cases to go to the ArbCom (whose power to examine all parties is a strong deterrent against vexatious litigation). Accountability is good, but I think this proposal would drain off a great deal of energy trying to satisfy the unsatisfiable, which would be better employed in our present dispute resolution mechanisms. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 07:36, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>For a long view, the accusations have always been with us. That does <i>not</i> mean that they can be dismissed, but it does mean that the existence of a disgruntled/paranoid (these are poles in the continuum, not a characterization of any one editor) people who are accusing the project of being run by a group of abusers is not, <i>by itself,</i> a compelling argument. There are several problems that have arisen. The first is that every user now has the ability to plead to any "court" on Wikipedia, but users either don't believe it or don't know how or don't believe that the hearing will be fair. The question is whether we have several others to agree and if there is specific illustration of the unfairness. I know that there are groups of people who cover for one another, and I, too, have felt that we have had some animals more equal than others, but that has to be addressed person by person. As for not knowing how to present a case, we are at a loss. Do everyday users know what WP:AMA is, where it is, how it works? Do they know RFAR? Do they know where the mediation pages are? None of that is immediately clear, and none of it is particularly easy to use. Even after finding and reading instructions, users can find lack of action, and if they're really off base with their complaints, they may get convinced that <i>that</i> is part of the problem, too. The credibility (not believing it will work) is another matter. Actions against administrators are becoming slightly more common, and I honestly believe that we are on the downhill side of the effort to get administrators held to the same standard as everyone else. Meanwhile, we have been coming up with a ton of informal processes to help out in these cases, such as the mediation cabal, and I'm not against anything new that relieves the pressures, even though I think we need more education about existing procedures than new procedures. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:19, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I hold the opinion that admins are largely not accountable to the user community (would be 'not at all accountable' except that ArbCom sometimes takes action in <i>extreme</i> cases) and that this is detrimental to us as admins and Wikipedia as a whole. As such, I'm very much in favor of making admins more accountable, but don't know that this proposal would particularly achieve that. As the 'review panel' would be no more answerable to the community for their positions than the admins are, the dynamics and outcome would likely be identical. ArbCom is, to an extent, answerable to the community and thus indirectly serves to address this need of admin accountability, but ArbCom is flooded with cases and never takes action against 'minor' admin improprieties... which can have a major impact on the individual users on the receiving end. Every week I see admins calling users trolls and vandals over trivial content disputes... while other admins block users for the exact same sort of statements. I see admins editing and even edit warring on pages and then protecting them - despite this being one of the <i>very few</i> things we are specifically told not to do. I see admins threatening or even placing blocks for users who disagree with them about how to phrase something as NPOV. Et cetera. Nearly every time I point out that an admin has done something which is against policy I get, 'whose side are you on - the admins or the trolls'? Or 'why are you enabling them'? As if it were an 'either / or' situation... rather than the reality where users <i>and</i> admins can do the wrong thing and <i>both</i> ought to be called to account for it. To me it seems obvious that the inability of the community to easily remove an admin who has 'lost their trust' (the standard for <i>becoming</i> an admin in the first place) leads inevitably to community dissatisfaction and anger towards admins. Even if admins <b>didn't</b> often react with hostility to gentle nudges towards civility, and behaved with scrupulous fairness towards the user base... still this would breed considerable dissatisfaction at <i>perceived</i> unfairness. As we are <i>not</i> all saints this is instead magnified to seething hatred in some quarters, to the detriment of the entire project. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:37, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree to a certain extent with CBD's concerns. If we admins want to change our own culture we can do it.

<dd>Ah but the problem is that there is a section of the community (although a minority) that thinks that such self-regulation has and is failing, this isn't at all helped by the fact that all the members of the arb com are admins (yes I know the mantra admins are the most respected, yadda, yadda, but your preaching to the choir here it's not me you have to persuade), so it again comes down to <a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._v._Sussex_Justices%2C_Ex_parte_McCarthy_1a48.html" title="R. v.

Any uncited information may be removed by <i>any</i> editor at <i>any</i> time (WP:BLP only insists on the immediate removal of -ve info about living people) so my removal of most of the paragraph was perfectly valid. We should strive to remove <i>all</i> uncited information from wikipedia, not just that which people complain about. As a source has been found, it should be sorted now, as I don't regard your latest edit as a "revert", I removed "uncited information", you added "cited information", and the two are completely different.

<p>A time ago, I deleted images from this category one by one, making sure that edit history was preserved and so on. I did this thoroughly because I remember from when images were first being transferred to Commons, several users were worried that the necessary GFDL edit history would be lost.</p>
<p>In September 2006, <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">User:Dmcdevit</a> cleaned up this category with some sort of script of mass deletion. It is possible that he has done it on more occasions, I haven't checked. I asked him whether it wasn't necessary any longer to take the necessary precations, such as making sure that edit history was preserved, but he never answered me.</p>

<dd>I agree that undeletion makes the procedure rather risk free. However, is it ok to use a speedy delete tool in assisting deletion, i.e. "cleaning out" the category? It has a substantial backlog.

<dd>I just want to make a comment on this issue. It's understandably frustrating when an image appears on Commons, transferred from another project, where it was never properly sourced in the first place. It would be great if deleting admins could take the time to check the image actually has a valid source. If it doesn't, it should be marked as <tt>{{subst:nsd}}</tt> which is the same as here I believe. Anyway... if you use bots to clean these categories out, I guess that won't happen. --<a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> <small>(<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pfctdayelise/Translations" class="extiw" title="commons:User:Pfctdayelise/Translations">translate?</a>)</small> 13:08, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, this is somewhat unusual. I was about to tag Barony of Barrichbeyan for CSD as a repost of content deleted <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Barony_of_Barrichbeyan_7868.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barony of Barrichbeyan">here</a>. However, looking at the article's edit history, I can't tell that this page ever had the AfD notice on it, or see any signs of it having been deleted (if nothing less, it does not seem to be a recreation, as it predates the AfD by quite a bit). The AfD was closed as a Delete, although the page doesn't seem to have been deleted. To further complicate matters, it looks like Barony of Barrichbeyan was moved to Barony of Barrichibeyan and then back to its original location, with both moves having occured shortly after the consensus to delete was arrived at. Given the unusual circumstances, I didn't want to speedy tag it, and am bringing it here for lack of anything better to do with it that I can come up with. Any ideas as to what happened here and what needs to be done would be appreciated.

<dd>As far as I can tell, the article was moved on 18 April 2006 from one location to the other, using copy&amp;paste. The copy was deleted (properly; an AfD tag was added on 6 September); the current article is the original, which was restored on September 15. It was deleted on AfD, and that was essentially the same conten, so it can be speedied. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugène van der Pijll</a> 18:35, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>There is an abusive string of sockpuppets working to delete legitimate fair use images such as album covers from Wikipedia. I'd assume good faith in that they have erroneously interpreted the need for sourcing, had it not been their use of single purpose throwaway accounts which are discarded after a few hours. The pattern of behaviour is like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create Account</li>
<li>Tag 50-100 images with {{<a href="../../../n/s/d/Template%7ENsd_37e6.html" title="Template:Nsd">nsd</a>}} (many erroneously)</li>
<li>Disappear</li>
<li>Orphanbot removes images, admins delete without question</li>
<li>Wikipedia loses</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples of these single purpose accounts, as well as a more in depth look at the situation can be found at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_5c7e.html#Sockpuppet_Vandal_.2F_Deletion_of_Fair_Use_images" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use">Wikipedia_talk:Fair_use#Sockpuppet_Vandal_.2F_Deletion_of_Fair_Use_images</a>. Another example of this user can be seen at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive146_2da3.html#User_adding_.22No_source.22_to_scans_of_album_covers" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive146">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive146#User_adding_.22No_source.22_to_scans_of_album_covers</a>.</p>
<p>Please be careful when dealing with image deletions. If the image is album art/book cover/movie poster/sceenshot, then the source is not important per-se, rather the copyright holder is. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 18:36, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone in IRC suggested me to use the noticeboard here, so here I am. User Jgmz has been contributing with the lack of <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">manual of styles</a>, and he also recently created two biography articles: Darrin "Fletch" Fletcher and Chet Thomas. I formatted the Chet Thomas but not the other one. I have noticed him about such things as using ~~~~ marks to sign names, make use of edit summary input when editing, and several others. However, I seem to be failing to capture his attention, as he continues to edit without edit summary (reason).</p>
<p>Also, I speculated that he might be Darrin "Fletch" Fletcher himself. His uploaded pictures are all in public domain, and are all under the name "Darrin Fletcher". If anyone can help me get his attention of his contributions, please RSVP. Thanks, <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVic226_3a10.html" title="User:Vic226">Vic226</a> 21:13, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am concerned that an editor engages in edit wars, then essentially locks in his edits by refusing to be civil in discussions of the page content when the article is protected because of edit wars.</p>
<p>I would simply ask that administrators weigh the refusal of a participant, particularly one engaged in edit wars, to engage in civil discussion of editorial content, when protecting pages.</p>

<p>I have had three or four emails from Brian G Crawford asking if he can be unblocked. You may recall that he was blocked due to some outbursts brought on by personal problems he has; these now appear to be under control. If he is unblocked he will need to be placed on some kind of civility parole, I think. Looking back at <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<dd>I suggest you reblock, now. Point of fact #1: Brian Crawford is banned, indefinitely, from all Wikimedia projects by order of Brad Patrick. Point of fact #2: Brian Crawford has sent emails to Wikipedia editors threatening violence, including deadly violence. Point of fact #3: Brian Crawford specifically seeks to attack people who exhibit sexual or gender expression that deviates from his notion of "normal". His entire participation on Wikipedia is focused toward seeking vengeance against those whose sexuality disturbs him. There is no encyclopedic purpose for his participation on Wikipedia, and given the extremely disturbing actions he has repeatedly engaged in in the past, there is no reason to upset Brad's decision to ban him wholesale across all projects, protestations of his problems with his medications notwithstanding. (He's used that excuse at least twice before.)</dd>
<dd>I feel strongly enough about this issue that I am willing to break exile and not only edit Wikipedia, but edit a Wikipedia policy or process page, to discuss this issue. I disclose that I have been the target of Mr. Crawford's attacks. His communications to me threatened me with death, and have been submitted to the police as death threats and as evidence of a hate crime. He has also subjected other editors of Wikipedia to public ridicule for the "crime" of having what he feels is an inappropriate gender presentation. Mr. Crawford's communications with the Wikimedia Foundation were so disturbing that Brad summarily banned him from all projects. Jimbo has supported this ban and personally told me at Wikimania that he would do whatever was necessary to ensure that neither I nor any other Wikipedian was affected by this individual. I earnestly implore the Wikipedia community to reinstate this block and not disturb it for any reason. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 17:45, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I really don't understand why every month or so someone tries to come along and unblock one of the worst offenders we've ever had to deal with. It's like if I turn my back for even a little bit a troll that was sending out death threats is being invited back with open arms. It's ridiculous! Can we please just stop these misguided attempts at reforming people? The risk to benefit ratio is entirely out-of-whack. I can't really think of a situation in which it's succeeded, though of course, I can think of <i>many</i> instances in which it's failed. Our goal on Wikipedia is to write an encyclopedia, not to run a rehabilitation center, and people who've proven disruptive in the past don't get an infinite number of chances to keep coming back. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 17:51, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's because, from my discussions with him, his outbursts are the result of a documented side-effect of medication (for which side-effects the medication is actually not used at all in the UK); he is now not on that medication any more. I don't think I am a soft touch when it comes to disruption and personal attacks, but I do have a small amount of understanding of Brian's illness (which is similar to but much worse than my own). But hey, I just thought I'd ask, to be neighbourly. There was never any chance I would unilaterally unblock him, that's for sure. Seems like opposition is so strong that it's not worth going to ArbCom. Either I didn't know about Brad's comments or I'd forgotten. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 18:36, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm all for allowing second chances, as we all make mistakes from time to time. That said, I draw the line, a very solid and firm line, once the other party has resorted to making threats. In this particular case, as anyone can see from the block log, this person had more than his second chance and continually lost it; threats of bodily harm were made <i>repeatedly</i>, including death threats, as well as several vicious personal attacks against other dedicated members of the project. Not just on-wiki mind you, but via email and even <i>telephone</i>. Contribution logs won't show that, nor will they show some of the more offensive comments which have since been deleted. Wikipedia needs to be a place where everyone feels safe, and that means not welcoming this person back under any circumstances. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_7058.html" title="User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">Can't sleep, clown will eat me</a> 22:54, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a recipient of one of those threatening emails (forwarded to the foundation), I agree completely with the comments from Users:Kelly Martin, Cyde, Clown &amp; Cie above. I don't like to see users blocked and wikipedia by definition needs to be a welcoming place. But at some point the welfare of the overall community of good faith users needs to take precedence. I have a hard time understanding why the question is periodically raised here, but indefinite blocks exist for a reason and death threats, real-world stalking and consistent vandalism would seem to be a good place to start.

<p>This does keep happening. Is it time to create a (fully protected) page somewhere and record every perma-block of a well established user, with a record of when and why and who? Block records are a good start, but for cases like this, they don't seem to be quite enough.

<p>It might actually be an IP he's specifically rented. If you look into it traces back to a company that could apparently sell such a thing, and he mentions that he's several layers from the actual IP, which is an unusual setup you might have to pay for. This apparently hasn't been mentioned on his talk page, I suggest seeing what he has to say about it. In this specific case, does not seem like a bad close, so no real point wasting our time undoing it only to redo it. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 02:09, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm quite happy with allowing anons to close AfDs as 'keep', or any other decision that doesn't require an admin to carry out, if the timespan has elapsed and the consensus is clear. If only admins are allowed to close AfDs, that gives them more priviledges than regular users unconnected to the software, which defeats the point of adminship not being a big deal. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 13:31, 17 November 2006 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</p>

<p>A relatively new user has made a proposal (<a href="../../../d/a/v/WP%7EDAV_27fa.html" title="WP:DAV">here</a>) to increase the usage of voting on Wikipedia.

<dd>Yes, other editor input is needed. Durin means well but has lost me with this interpretation of Wiki policy. My main point of confusion is that the source of the flag image has very clearly said it can be posted on Wikipedia and is not under copyright or royalty protection. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 15:02, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's much better if copyright permissions are mailed (ideally directly by the copyright owner, or in this case copyright-disclaimer-person) to OTRS. That way their email is always available to the Foundation in case of a dispute (which isn't true for mails that go to a specific wikipedian, who might well become uncontactable in 10 or 20 years). This also protects the confidentiality of the email (which appears to be an issue in this case). The OTRS people will put a tag on the image page giving the OTRS ticket number. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 15:03, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed. This is the way it should be done. I have concerns that the actual permissions requested and granted are permission for use on Wikipedia, which is not compatible with our policies. I have e-mailed the City of Corpus Christi requesting clarification and specific release under GFDL but have not yet heard back. That addresses this <i>particular</i> case, but the general case of how Husnock is handling such requests to copyright holders remains unresolved and other related issues remain open as well. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 15:17, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, please pass the message on to permissions@wikimedia.org. I agree that the message regarding the Corpus Christi flag does not seem to indicate that it is PD, only that it may be reprinted, which isn't sufficient to claim it is public domain. (And also relating to that discussion, I don't see a privacy problem in giving at least limited contact information for a municipal employee whose job is dealing with the public's inquiries.)</dd>
<dd>In general, the permissions address exists so that people may be contacted, and that this information may be given without posting names and address on the wiki (though I don't see a privacy problem in giving at least limited contact information for a municipal employee whose job is dealing with the public's inquiries.) We'd like to believe that everyone is acting in good faith and everyone is correct about their assertions. But should there be any question about it, we must be able to confirm this even if you disappear off the face of the earth: who you contacted, exactly what they said, when they said it, etc., or otherwise when we're challenged on it later by someone else we don't have any way to prove that we were told otherwise.</dd>
<dd>Husnock, you might also be interested in using the boilerplate requests for permissions to be sure you're asking the right questions: <a href="../../../e/x/a/Wikipedia%7EExample_requests_for_permission_0f4b.html" title="Wikipedia:Example requests for permission">Wikipedia:Example requests for permission</a> -- permission to use on Wikipedia is not sufficient.

It's people who want to semi-protect after an article is vandalized twice in an hour... that's being frivilous with protection. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 21:20, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a lot of talk about improving the quality of wikipedia articles. What doesn't get talked about as much, I think, is (a) the percentage of time that <i>good editors</i> spend fighting vandals (not edit wars, but clear vandalism, much if not most by hit-and-run anonymous IP addresses, where warnings and blocks are a waste of time), and (b) the impact on readers if an article is vandalized - every 15 minutes of unreverted vandalism equals 1% of a day's worth of visiters seeing something ranging from juvenile greetings to homophobic ranting. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 22:36, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've noticed this to be a problem more as of late. It also seems the number of sprotected pages is going up, and the admins are having more trouble dealing with backlogs (e.g., <a href="#CAT:CSD" title="">#CAT:CSD</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;oldid=88433662" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;oldid=88433662" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>). Perhaps we should review a policy of making the FA protections to be <i>discouraged</i>, rather than forbidden. I think Glen hit the nail on the head on this one - how many readers clicked on San Fran and saw "dick sucking" whatever, and were turned away from this encyclopedia? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 00:16, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Responding to Sandy's concerns about having <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourette_syndrome.html" title="Tourette syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a> on the main page... If you don't want it on the main page, that's entirely understandable. Though, I have noticed that MP featured article vandalism is at a peak on weekdays when kids are on the computer at school. Sundays seem like good day for having an article scheduled for the main page, with relatively minimal vandalism. I notice the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tourette_syndrome&amp;limit=200&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tourette_syndrome&amp;limit=200&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit history</a> for Tourette syndrome, there was no vandalism last Sunday.

<dd>Chowbok has been doing a substantial amount of image work lately; one way to identify problematic images is to browse through a user's upload log; sometimes the user whose upload log jumps out is someone you've recently interacted with; I don't think that speculating about motivation is ever fruitful in these sort of cases. Having a bunch of their images tagged can be frustrating for the user in question, and the timing in this particular case may be less than fortunate in that regard, but looking at the images in question quickly, most seem to have been tagged reasonably. Sebbeng, I understand that this can be frustrating, but please try to just deal with each case on its merits. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobth_3967.html" title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobth_e82d.html" title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 06:30, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is debate on the talk page about how to name (and disambiguate) articles on settlements. Should we use our standard to disambiguate only when necessary? Should all cities by default have a qualifier (e.g. state name) attached? Should we make an exception for cities in the USA? Should it be "City, state" or "City (state)"? Since the issue is a deadlock between four or five editors, some feedback on this issue would be nice (and I'm asking it here because this board sees more long-term users than the village pump).

<p>I have indefinitely blocked Terryeo for these two edits: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:David_S._Touretzky&amp;diff=87242128&amp;oldid=72892432" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:David_S._Touretzky&amp;diff=87242128&amp;oldid=72892432" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ChrisO&amp;diff=87241695&amp;oldid=86077727" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ChrisO&amp;diff=87241695&amp;oldid=86077727" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. Both are flagrant harassment and intimidation - links to Scientologist websites smearing the people he's asking for comments from. Terryeo has already been put on personal attack parole by the arbcom, but this kind of intimidation and threat goes far beyond the pale, and needs to be stopped immediately and firmly. Terryeo has shown himself to be a dedicated POV pusher and bully. There is no sensible reason for his continued participation here. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:44, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just a comment here to say that Terryeo's blocking is well justified and long overdue. After the Wikipedia community has bent over backwards to allow him to still post to talk pages -- and, of course, he was completely free to edit articles not related to Scientology -- Terryeo spent the past seven or eight months pushing his ridiculous "personal Web sites are not allowed" argument on the talk pages, and even attempting to alter Wikipedia's policy to support his position. His real purpose, of course, was to "handle" the Scientology articles in a fashion that would remove all criticism of Scientology from Wikipedia. (Any of the regular contributors to the Scientology articles will certainly agree with me on this, I have no doubt.) He was never here to work towards NPOV and create a collaborative encyclopedia; hence, I am fully in favor of his being banned. The only down side to blocking Terryeo is the strong likelihood of Scientology following its (unalterable) policy: now that he's blocked, he will disappear from Wikipedia completely and a new sock puppet will arrive. This sock puppet will pick up where Terryeo left off, trying to find a new method of handling all of the <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_beliefs_and_practices.html#Scientology_language" title="Scientology beliefs and practices">entheta</a></i> here on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a> 18:10, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's not entirely necessary to get the edits removed, however invloving ArbCOm is also not entirely necessary as there is a clear cut decision here. // <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy"><font color="#000000"><b>Pilotguy</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../p/i/l/User_talk%7EPilotguy_51fb.html" title="User talk:Pilotguy"><font color="#0000FF">Cleared to land</font></a>) 21:33, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd point out, just to emphasize that the right decision was made, that Terryeo was previously blocked for harassment using exactly this <i>modus operandi</i> (linking to a webpage which contains personal attacks/threats upon the editor, pretending he is simply presenting that link to that editor for information). He knew well that what he was doing was unacceptable, but he thought he could get away with it anyways. To prove him wrong is what Wikipedia needed to do. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:47, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Per the MONGO/ED ruling, engaging in or linking to offsite attacks is every bit as unacceptable as personal attacks within Wikipedia.

<p>It looks to me like Terryeo disapproved of the link, and was hoping that bringing it to the attention of interested editors might get it removed from Wikipedia articles, not harrass other users. Is there any way to discuss a link one disapproves of without linking to it?

<p>I've seen a number of vandals today who have been replacing articles with the usual variety of vandalism. The interesting thing is all have edit summaries that read "Replacing page with" followed by the beginning of the vandalism text, for example see the edit summaries of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Age_of_Empires&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88117251" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Age_of_Empires&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88117251" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khoikhoi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88098305" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Khoikhoi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88098305" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:66.125.193.82&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88032457" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:66.125.193.82&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88032457" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Washington_Post&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88030078" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Washington_Post&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88030078" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mediterranean_Sea&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88029507" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mediterranean_Sea&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88029507" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> and there are a lot more out there.

<p>I am referring, of course, to the situation with the featured article for November 17, <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco, California</a>. The page was subject to repeated, automated attacks from a vandal who replaced the body of the page with a homophobic vulgarity, "HOME TO DICKSUCKING FAGGOTS WORLDWIDE". Amid the chaos engendered by the attack, the page was semi-protected. On more than one occasion, another administrator invoked the rule that the day's FA should not be protected and unprotected the page. With the protection removed, the attacks almost immediately recommenced. The administrator who unprotected the page, however, did not hang around to reprotect the page once the attacks had recommenced, leaving it to some other admin.</p>
<p>I would suggest that an administrator who chooses to enforce any policy has an obligation to act responsibly and learn why the policy was not being followed in the first place and then to ensure that there have been no unintended consequences of their actions. I would also suggest that failure to act responsibility in this manner should have consequences.--<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveOinSF_7bbf.html" title="User:DaveOinSF">DaveOinSF</a> 06:59, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A minor suggestion here, not questioning your overall judgment which was imo good, but did you consider putting a detailed comment explaining exactly why the page was semi-protected? I've checked the history and it doesn't look like it.

<dd>Two things come to mind here: <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanlon%27s_razor.html" title="Hanlon's razor">Hanlon's razor</a> and the adage "Nobody reads the manual" (in this case, the page history). There's nothing to indicate malicious intent on the part of the other admin, just human error. Also remember that everyone interpets things differently from the same evidence, so you cannot assume people will see why you decided to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore the rules</a> at a simple glance. Especially since policies exist because they will make sense in 98 cases out of 100.</dd>
<dd>If an editor sees you do something which directly contradicts policy, and you have not made it transparently clear why this one case needs to be an exception, the other editor should not be faulted for bringing things back into accordance with policy. While they should assume you are not gratuitously trying to undermine the law, they needn't assume you are right either.</dd>
<dd>Bottom line: we can't censure an administrator for failing to predict the future. He unprotected the front page, and more vandalism occurred as a result, but censuring him for it makes as little sense as censuring you if it had been unprotected and no more vandalism had occurred as a result. You both acted using your own judgment, neither of you communicated as well as you could have, and at least one of you had to be wrong. Failing to predict the future is not a crime. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 07:58, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, this episode provides ample food for administrator thought.</dd>
<dd>1. As argued above, the dogma that we use unprotected FA main page articles to attract new editors should be re-evaluated. I haven't done the work, but I'd be willing to bet that the number of IP and new-user vandal and revert edits far outnumbers the positive edits from IP and new user accounts. I'd guess the ratio is on the order of 100 to 1 and it is probably higher. Why does Wikipedia cling to a dogma of openness that needlessly eats up the time of its most dedicated and talented editors?</dd>
<dd>2. I'd argue that this can be applied to most FA-class articles. FA articles are supposed to be of a sufficiently high quality that only prose improvements are needed. Yet, examination of the history logs for any number of popular FA articles will see a constant war between the vandals and the vigilant. Why aren't FA articles semi-protected as a matter of course to free up thousands of editing hours that could be spent getting more FA articles? Vandals don't put graffiti on already graffiti-laden walls; they are attracted to pristine walls. As more and more quality articles are added the fight against the vandals may eventually reach a stand-off where there is are so many articles needing defense, that reverting vandalism is a full-time job.--<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul.h_3539.html" title="User:Paul.h">Paul</a> 01:29, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Actually, before accusations of admin incompetence are thrown around, remember that at least two official policies (<a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_protection_94e5.html" title="User:Raul654/protection">User:Raul654/protection</a> and the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia%7ESemi-protection_policy_9387.html" title="Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy">Semi-protection policy</a>) specifically instruct admins to not protect articles featured on the main page, and to leave them protected for the shortest amount of time possible. The relevant policy reads, "<i>It has been suggested many times in the past that the featured article should thus be protected or semi-protected. However, administrators are advised never to protect this page and to only semi-protect it under certain extreme conditions.</i>" I see you disagree with the policy, by your comments on that talk page; however, this is the modus operandi we have been following for years, so it is not fair to call administrators "irresponsible" for doing what they're told to do. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 01:50, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>"I was just following orders" huh? I do think admins should at least try to make a show of helping out if they unprotect, rather than just leaving the article to the wolves and those suckers who do RC patrol. Sure it might have been fine in 2004 to just cut and run but we see much more vandalism now, and more coordinated, article-threatening vandalism... despite what policy and userpage essays say, it still feels like a slap in the face when an admin unprotects an article and runs away from it, requiring editors of the article to refresh every 30 seconds if they want the article not to be vandalized for long. Yes protection periods of the FA should be short and only in response to extreme cases of vandalism, but admins who unprotect should still try to show some comraderie with the people spending their time defending the article. It shouldn't be required, it should just be common courtesy. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 02:03, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But at the same time, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shit_happens.html" title="Shit happens">shit happens</a>. In my experience, most admins who unprotect Main Page articles do stick around to make sure nothing happens for a period of time; however, what I'm objecting strongly is the characterization that we have to watch an article <i>or face sanctions</i>. So, let's say, I unprotect an article, but then someone knocks on the door and starts selling me <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_Scout_cookies_da03.html" title="Girl Scout cookies">Girl Scout cookies</a>, and I can't get rid of the person until 20 minutes later, when she accomplishes her purpose of selling me an over-priced box. During that period, I'm away from the computer, and the article is vandalized. Should I be demonized for things that were beyond my control to begin with? Some of the changes to the proposed policy appear to give the appearance that such an outcome is desired. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 02:12, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it would be silly to try to require it, but I think such situations where you are unexpectedly interrupted are the exception rather than the rule.

It's just a matter of maintaining a healthy and productive environment. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 02:18, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's necessary to maintain a degree of openness to allow new editors to begin to contribute; excessive use of page protections on articles would discourage new editors, thereby causing the number of Wikipedia contributors to slowly decrease as editors left the project. That being said, there is a certain level of vandalism at which interests in maintaining the integrity of a particular article outweigh the loss of openness created by semi-protection, even if the article is the day's featured article. In rare circumstances, articles such as <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Needham_c876.html" title="Roger Needham">Roger Needham</a> that suffer from severe vandalism even after semi-protection are fully protected as a vandalism control measure. In light of the competing interests in allowing legitimate contributions by new editors to the day's featured article, and in preventing vandalism to such a high profile article from being displayed, I propose that the MediaWiki software be modified to implement a new vandalism control measure for the featured article as an alternative to page protection. When a non-administrator edits the day's featured article, the edit wouldn't be displayed immediately. Instead, administrator(s) monitoring the article would immediately be shown the diff produced by the edit, and would have a short period of time (approximately ten seconds) during which to either approve the edit, allowing it to be displayed immediately thereafter, or to reject the edit, thereby reverting the edit before it is ever displayed. Edits neither approved nor rejected during the prescribed period of time would be displayed in the live version of the article by default. Although edits rejected in this manner would never appear as the current version of the article, they would be retained in the page history and in the contributions history of the editors making them. The use of a real-time edit approval process -- which is quite practical for a single, heavily watched article -- would avoid the edit conflicts and/or forking that would be caused by delayed edit approval. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 02:34, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Does Wikipedia do April Fools Jokes (e.g., google style?) I would be all for that... without the swearing. And with a caveat.

This is cavalier to (1) immediately act to delete stubs and then (2) not reply to pleas to be patient and allow the phrase to be posted.

<p>However, the categories for valid checkuser requests at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a> don't seem to apply. The SPAs didn't affect the outcome of the AfD and they're not disruptive except for the reposts. The problem is mostly that they are all editing the same set of articles and passing themselves off as multiple editors in an attempt to create an illusion of consensus. The instructions at RFCU indicate that obvious, disruptive socks should just be banned on the judgement of the admin wanting to request a checkuser, but this doesn't seem strongly supported by our blocking policy. Any advice on this, and such situations in general? Mostly I'm thrown off by the recent changes in the CU process and the gap that leaves between what's blockable by an individual admin's judgement and what needs CU. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 21:58, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've noticed that the number of semi protected articles has grown to over 600 (Category:Semi-protected has more than 3 pages with 200 entries each page). I think that some of these might have been semi-ed and then forgotten about.

<li>Unless there is evidence of vandalism or other nastiness, I'm not in favor of blocking a user that posts a bit of self-promotion. I believe that if we don't "bite" this user but point xem to some indication of what <i>is</i> good content for an encyclopedia, we could turn this person into a good contributor instead of chasing xem off. (besides, if the user is truly bent on adding this article, this is far better stopped by protection than by a block which can be evaded through sockpuppetry). I urge Wknight to overturn his block.

<ul>
<li>I've unblocked her per your request but I strongly disagree with it. If she posted the article twice or even thrice and showed any inclination towards contributing constructively, I'd agree. But Rachel St. John and Rachel St. john have been posted <i>six times</i>, including once by a sockpuppet (which means this may be a moot point) and four different people have been to her user talk page, all in barely 36 hours, and all while nothing else has come from this account. We routinely indefblock accounts which are so clearly here for disruptive nonsense so she's lucky I went so light. (BTW, if I read the blocked users page correctly, she was autoblocked which means she was probably trying to recreate a seventh time, eighth time, ninth time, ...) I don't see why we should bother with <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">WP:SALT</a> to protect such a user. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 12:07, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not an admin but personally I would suggest a block on the user and a prevention of the article being re-created. While this is most likely self-promotion, it's easily possible it's not. We have no way of knowing if the person creating it is Rachel St. John. I've looked at the article via a copy I found on a mirror and while it's definitely not negative stuff, it is personal (apparently even including a photo). No addresses or contact info for sure but still, if the person creating it isn't Rachel St. John, it's easily possible it might not be stuff the real Rachel St. John wants the whole world to know (assuming it's even accurate) <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:52, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I stumbled across the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_King_54de.html" title="Don King">Don King</a> article a couple of days ago. It was, quite frankly, a BLP nightmare with many negative unsourced statements. Not having time to go through the article myself and come up with sources for everything, I reduced the article to a single sentence so that properly sourced information could be re-added to the article. Tevus reverted my edit, restoring all of the negative material. I cautioned him on his user talk page that such action was unacceptable, but he is of the opinion that page blanking of any kind is vandalism and should be reverted on sight. He has stated that he would be willing to listen to an admin's opinion on the matter, so it would probably be a good idea for someone to comment on his talk page before he happens to restore such material in the future and inadvertantly violate BLP policy.

<li>Please review the edits/discusson in more detail, you will find that is not accurate. This was a revert of new contributions to the article that can be directly sourced, and as the lead stands its highly POV and needs some balancing with more facts about allegations, not endless Criticism.

<dd>Kiyosaki, given that you've been reverted on this article by 10 different editors in the past week alone, and during that period been blocked 3 times for 3RR there, perhaps you should examine the possibility that the problem lies with you.

<p>Jayjg, you are quite controversial yourself, I'e been told. Please address the issue regarding the inappropriate use of admn. rollback without discussion, not personal attacks.

<dd>The point of that text is to say, "if you're reverting, let the person know why." It's to avoid simply reverting the page without giving a reason.

<p>While each individual school has its own <a href="../../../l/a/n/LAN_1d59.html" title="LAN">LAN</a> network connecting computers therein, they have no proxy servers connecting the network with the internet. Nonetheless, each school is connected (by means of a <a href="../../../w/a/n/WAN_e4c5.html" title="WAN">WAN</a>) to the DCBOCES servers in Poughkeepsie, where data is sent from the outside world to schools participating in BOCES. Basically, contacting the above school districts (since the students therein vandalize Wikipedia <i>a lot</i>) is pointless because several schools may be using one IP address in sequence, and exactly from which school the vandalism came is occasionally hard to track.</p>
<p>This is just so that this issue might be understood somewhat better. There's really nothing I can do about it, besides dissuade my fellow students from vandalizing. Nonetheless, if an admin wishes to contact DCBOCES about this issue (and encourage them not to block Wikipedia as a solution), that would be ideal, so that people would waste less time on Dutchess County vandalism, and concentrate on... other vandalism. (Although schools should be careful not to <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> their students.)</p>

<p>I'm wondering what the best way of handling "vote spamming" at xFD. After proposing categories for deletion, I noticed that a user had contacted four other people with messages like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BurmaShaver&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89040509" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BurmaShaver&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89040509" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Two of those contacted have "voted" as requested. Two others have not been on-line since the message has been left. My first impulse was to counter the arguments, which <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarine_69-71_ed56.html#MLB_All-Stars_categories" title="User talk:Marine 69-71">I did</a> with one person who had already "voted" and <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html#MLB_All-Stars_categories" title="User talk:Yanksox">another who had not</a>. But this seems to make me just as guilty of spamming. I <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusiCitizen_3f60.html#Vote_stacking_at_CFD_to_keep_All_Star_game_categories" title="User talk:MusiCitizen">left a message</a> with the spammer, and I also thought of removing the vote spams. I notice that <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVote_stacking_376f.html" title="Wikipedia:Vote stacking">Wikipedia:Vote stacking</a> is inactive and did not become policy, so what is the policy?

<dd>I agree they're at least intending to be disruptive. Though one has to wonder how effective they'll be. They're not actually hyperlinked, so I don't know if Google will pick them up.

<p>This one is starting to develop a serious backlog. It's slow work to clean out, so a few more eyes on this would be nice. Even if you are not comfortable dealing with the whole "promo photo of (semi)famous person" issue there are still a lot of "slam dunk" cases like photos of buildings, cars and "everyday items". Just remember to check the article to make sure the image is used in a "replacable" way (identify the subject rater than commentary on the work itself, subject is not itself copyrighted, subject still exist etc.), check for any reasonable objections on the talk page and finaly remove the image from the article (if you delete it). As I said quite a bit of work compared to no-source or orphanded fair use images and such, but if "everyone" processed at least a couple of images a day we should be eable to keep it under controll. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 12:31, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we are going to be looking at very long backlogs on that one simply because of the amount of work involved per image although the number of images should reduce over time.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 03:27, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A handful of editors and myself have been removing links from Wikipedia to the <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> website. I think we’ve hit about 2000 or so articles so far.</p>
<p>A user has raised concern that the project doesn’t have enough "admin" oversight. (see my <a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_YouTube_Linklist_dfa9.html#YouTube" title="User talk:J.smith/YouTube Linklist">linklist talk page</a>) The user in question is concerned with our methods. Basically what I’m doing (and I can’t speak for the other users) is running AWB with a find/replace function. For each link that comes up I look at the context of the link. If suspect its copyvio (music videos are the most often) I remove the link. If the context implies some reliability (Band’s profiles mostly) I leave the link. After that I keep an eye on my contributions list. If <b>(Top)</b> drops off the list I go see why. If I was reverted I look deeper into the situation, review the movie and make a comment on the talk page. Fortunately, (outside of the previously mentioned editor) happened only a half-dozen times that I’m aware of.</p>

<p>I think how the project is being conducted is a clear violation of copyright policy, which states "it is not the job of rank and file Wikipedians to police copyright violations," and that suspected cr vios should be mentioned on talkpages of articles, or reported to copyright problems. The possible YT exceptions, and the steps that need to be taken to affirm that content is licensed under GDFL, are not being explained; a source bias is merely being propagated--the links are being mass-deleted on the assumption that they are not GDFL, not proof that they aren't. I am especially concerned regarding the accusation of OR levelled at the user who verified a GDFL license. Please see discussion at NOR. I think there is a need for adjustment of this project--until last week, they were conducting the purge more slowly--by placing a template first in iffy cases. A new template should be used, which is less biased against YT, and which refers editors to policy pages and boards (where updating is needed re valid uses of YT at NOR, RS and V). Respect for talkpage discussions should also be in effect, when the cases are not clear cr vios, such as recent pop songs. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 19:49, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You seem to be completely missing the points. This has nothing to do with GFDL. We have a specific policy on external links, see here <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html#Linking_to_copyrighted_works" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights#Linking to copyrighted works</a>. Also, the policy states "It is not the job of rank-and-file Wikipedians to police content for possible copyright infringement, but if you suspect one, you should at the very least bring up the issue on that page's talk page." It says at least. It doesn't say you are forbidden from removing it yourself without discussion on your talk page. My understanding of the "police" thing is that it means we don't continually monitor articles very carefully to ensure there are no copyrights. This is important because if we do, we would be more responsible for copyright violations. However it is still important that we make resonable efforts to prevent copyright violations and when users identify problems, they are still expected to do something about them. As with all things, it's up to the contributors. Continually removing content without explaination or discussion is usually disruptive, especially if there is no legitimate reason to remove the content. But in this case, it appears the people involved in this project are making a resonable effort to ensure they only remove external links which violate copyright and they have amply explained. Note that wikipedia is by it's nature source biased. We only want high quality, reliable sources. We don't link to jewwatch, except when specifically discussing them for example. In this case, there is nothing specificly wrong with youtube, but a lot of it's content is circumspect. If you can show us a resonable number of examples where the links that were removed are not copyright violations, then perhaps we need to look in to this further but currently, your only concerns appear to be due to a misunderstanding of policy. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:35, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem is that the technicality they're using is a recent change to the EL guideline--they're not deleting under C (or looking at the links very carefully). Their edit summaries say, "EL--sites that don't provide licensing information." Instead of inquiring re the GDFL license, they are deleting on the assumtption that the Wiki publisher and the YT publisher are not the same, and that therefore the GDFL license is reasonably doubtful (and giving no info to editors about what to do about that, i.e., how to affirm GDFL license.) The problem with that is GDFL is <i>not</i> reasonably suspect--self-publishers publish on YT under public domain/want their work freely disseminated. So no, they are not making a reasonable effort to to ensure that they only remove links which violate copyright--they are mass deleting on the assumption that they're erring on the side of removing some legit links to get rid of a larger number of illegit links. That would still be fine, if they were deleting under C--but deleting under EL doesn't give anyone with an objection info about how to use YT for the benefit of Wikipedia--EL currently gives the erroneous information that YT is prohibited, period, in contradiction to C and V. The same people who changed EL two weeks ago are conducting the purge. (Dmcdevit and Barberio had a disagreement because Dmcdevit changed the EL guideline while it was protected, and wouldn't revert his edit and discuss--D claims he had consensus on the basis of <i>three</i> editors. Three editors against one doesn't seem to me to be adequate discussion or consensus to railroad a <i>guideline</i> change through for the purpose of immediately enforcing it as <i>policy</i> in mass deletions...) As long as they continue to do it/as long as the EL policy contradicts C and V, I will probably continue to monitor what they are doing--the egregious examples so far I would say are <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrington_Hall_e1d1.html" title="Barrington Hall">Barrington Hall</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brent_Corrigan_fa82.html" title="Brent Corrigan">Brent Corrigan</a>, and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Fair_Trade_Association_fa75.html" title="International Fair Trade Association">International Fair Trade Association</a>. In my opinion, <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Goma_25ac.html" title="Guy Goma">Guy Goma</a> was handled very badly, with no assumption of good faith and some newcomer biting. Unfortunately, I think the spirit of the project is unnecessarily hostile, and that as a "raising awareness" about copyvios initiative it's misguided--telling people en masse that YT is prohibited under EL is confusing and erroneous. Copyvios are prohibited under C. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 00:21, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And regarding policy for doing something about copyvios, I think it is very clear that because some cases will be false alarms, and "if the contributor was in fact the author of the text that is published elsewhere under different terms, that does not affect their right to post it here under the GFDL," deleting without discussion merely on "licensing information" is not appropriate. If there's some evidence--such as an url--that a YT link is a copyvio, the YT link could be pre-emptively deleted as a copyvio. (I think for recent songs/music vids, not even an url is needed.) But licensing "suspicion" is not reasonable doubt for pre-emptive deletion without discussion, and the procedures outlined in C aren't being followed. Perhaps there is a need for an accelerated removal process for music/vids songs?--that should be established at C. Making up a quickie technicality at EL and treating all the YT links as if they were music vids isn't just a hassle for the editors at pages with legit links, and a problem because the confusion might result in the loss of some good legit links, but because it doesn't do anything to enlighten anybody about how to use YT usefully, it just misinforms them that YT is prohibited on a licensing technicality, when it's not.</p>
<p><i>It is not the job of rank-and-file Wikipedians to police content for possible copyright infringement, but if you suspect one, you should at the very least bring up the issue on that page's talk page. Others can then examine the situation and take action if needed. The most helpful piece of information you can provide is a URL or other reference to what you believe may be the source of the text.</i></p>
<p>Some cases will be false alarms. For example, if the contributor was in fact the author of the text that is published elsewhere under different terms, that does not affect their right to post it here under the GFDL. Also, sometimes you will find text elsewhere on the Web that was copied from Wikipedia. In both of these cases, it is a good idea to make a note in the talk page to discourage such false alarms in the future.</p>
<p>If some of the content of a page really is an infringement, then the infringing content should be removed, and a note to that effect should be made on the talk page, along with the original source. If the author's permission is obtained later, the text can be restored.</p>
<p>If all of the content of a page is a suspected copyright infringement, then the page should be listed on Wikipedia:Copyright problems and the content of the page replaced by the standard notice which you can find there. If, after a week, the page still appears to be a copyright infringement, then it may be deleted following the procedures on the votes page. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 01:05, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hmmm I came across an admin deleting a bunch of articles straight out. They were almost all all 100% no brainer deletable crap, but they hadn't been tagged. Is this normal? It makes me a bit nervous. But maybe it's necessary to keep <a href="../../../c/a/n/Category%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_4c9c.html" title="Category:Candidates for speedy deletion">Category:Candidates for speedy deletion</a> from being inundated. Is this standard practice, or what? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 05:58, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Things don't need to be tagged to be deleted. Tagging is just a convenient way to bring them to the attention of admins. Things are eligible for speedy deletion (as opposed to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">slow and painful deletion</a>) if they fall into certain categories of things which can be deleted without discussion, "on sight" as <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> puts it, and they can be deleted at any time.</dd>
<dd>Note that some images may need to be tagged for a certain amount of time before they become eligible for speedy deletion (which IMHO is a hurdle for anyone addressing copyright problems, especially now that we have image undeletion) but once they are eligible they can be deleted on sight, regardless of tags. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 06:48, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh. Really. Hmmm I thought that everything had to be tagged first, on the theory that two sets of eyes should see an article before its deleted. I clear out <a href="../../../c/a/n/Category%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_4c9c.html" title="Category:Candidates for speedy deletion">Category:Candidates for speedy deletion</a> now and again and I find that about 5-10% of tagged articles are not properly speedies - of those, some are properly ProD's, some AfD's, some acceptable articles with a few minutes work, some acceptable articles as is. It makes me a little nervous to think of articles being deleted on one person's say-so... but I can also understand the benefit of avoiding needless steps, so if that's the way it's done, OK.

<dd>There are some admins, IIRC, who hold themselves categorically to the <i>tag and permit another to delete</i> standard, and I can't imagine why such standard shouldn't be propagated generally; whilst admins are surely meant to know policy, it is not inconceivable that every admin has erred as regards speedy deletion at least once during his/her time here, and whilst proscribing an admin's speedying an article not previously tagged by another editor as meriting speedy surely will not serve to remedy most errors, it might serve to prevent some. An editor is generally to be at his/her most circumspect when he/she deals with candidates for speedy deletion, and I would suppose that we'd want admins to be exceedingly careful in the realm of speedy deletion, if only because the fact of a deletion's being wrongly undertaken is not always readily apparent (as against that, for example, of a block's being wrongly applied or an AfD's being wrongly closed). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 18:19, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's nothing wrong with instantly speedy deleting an article if you're sure; likewise, there's nothing wrong with adding a tag and waiting for a second opinion if you're not sure. Much speedy deletion is housecleaning of utter nonsense or articles to which the words "non-notable biography" don't do justice; such uncontroversial maintenance work doesn't require admins to be "exceedingly careful". --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I never tag articles for speedy deletion; if they meet the criteria, I delete them outright. I believe this is common practice. The purpose of the tag is to bring the matter to the attention of an administrator; if the reviewer has the technical capability, he may delete the article himself. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 09:37, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have some concerns about this article. Firstly there is a complaint, supposedly by a JC representative, see <a href="../../../j/a/c/Talk%7EJack_Chick_a2d6.html#Legal_Notice" title="Talk:Jack Chick">Talk:Jack Chick#Legal Notice</a>. Although this is obviously in the wrong place and doesn't really give enough info seriously to consider it, I do think someone needs to properly reply to it rather then the sarcasm it has been met with (none of them appear to be admins). Of course, it's probably a joke and may have no merit whatever the case but we should be safe IMHO. However an issue I have greater concern about which doesn't strictly need admin attention but I thought I'd mention here anyway is that the actual article has a notice that most of the biography is from the JC site. Obviously this leads to NPOV concerns but more seriously someone should make sure there is no copyvio. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 15:19, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I have removed a replaceable fair use tag on the image above, since I don't feel it meets the speedy deletion criteria. As an admin I believe I have been entrusted with the ability to make that call, as I would any other page tagged with a template which makes them a candidate for speedy deletion. The template for replaceable fair use states that an image tagged "illustrates a subject for which a free image might reasonably be found or created". In this instance the claim was made that <i>Since the book is in public domain, it should be possible to find a public-domain cover from an early edition.</i> I dispute this, it may not follow that the image can be replaced. There may not exist public domain editions available freely. Now I have been told I cannot remove the tag, because the template states <b>Do not remove this tag.</b> Now if images are tagged incorrectly, what are we supposed to do? I have again removed the tag after it was re-added with no attempt to discuss the issue with me, but I will now respect whatever consensus emerges here. However, I would like the issues surrounding this explored. Can a speedy deletion template really say that it cannot be removed? As admins, how are we supposed to act with incorrectly tagged articles or images? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 17:00, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The tag tells you what to do if you disagree: you add the tag {{<a href="../../../r/e/p/Template%7EReplaceable_fair_use_disputed_a5fb.html" title="Template:Replaceable fair use disputed">Replaceable fair use disputed</a>}} without removing the original tag. Same as with non-image speedy tags: if you disagree, you don't remove the tag, but you add {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} instead. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 17:38, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, as regards some/most non-image speedy tags, this is quite wrong. See, for instance, {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">db-bio</a>}}, which provides, in pertinent part, that, if the page does not, in the estimation of a reviewer, <i>meet the criteria for speedy deletion</i>, he/she may <i>remove th[e] notice</i>; he/she is only enjoined from removing such notice on <i>pages that [he/she has] created [him/her]self</i>, to which the application of {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} is then appropriate. If an admin engaged in speedy patrol finds an article tagged for speedy that is not speediable but nevertheless might be deficient encyclopedically, he/she ought, IMHO, to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">AfD</a> it or alert the original tagger in order that the latter might AfD, and so the analogue here, I think, would be an admin's (e.g., Steve's) removing the tag and listing the image at <a href="../../../f/u/r/WP%7EFUR_13d9.html" title="WP:FUR">WP:FUR</a> or <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIfD_d369.html" title="WP:IfD">WP:IfD</a> (see my edit-conflicted post below). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:48, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>(after edit conflict) I imagine that the tag should be treated as any other the presence of which an admin undertaking <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">proposed deletion</a> or <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">speedy deletion</a> patrol might consider, such that, should an admin find the tag to be wrongly applied, he ought, even in the absence of a {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} (here, more specifically, {{<a href="../../../r/e/p/Template%7EReplaceable_fair_use_disputed_a5fb.html" title="Template:Replaceable fair use disputed">Replaceable fair use disputed</a>}}), to remove it, having determined the image not to merit deletion consistent with the tag. Just as <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">AfD</a> is often counseled in such situations as an admin reviews a SPEEDY candidate and removes its tag, so too might a listing at <a href="../../../f/u/r/WP%7EFUR_13d9.html" title="WP:FUR">fair use review</a> be appropriate where there exists some disagreement apropos of whether a fair use image is replacable with a free image; <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIfD_d369.html" title="WP:IfD">IfD</a> might even be considered. In any event, though, it seems altogether silly for us to have a template that asserts that such template should not be removed; such provision presumes that the initial tagger is necessarily correct and that, in the absence of a {{<a href="../../../r/e/p/Template%7EReplaceable_fair_use_disputed_a5fb.html" title="Template:Replaceable fair use disputed">Replaceable fair use disputed</a>}} objection, an admin should delete the image consistent with the tag, his/her own conclusions notwithstanding. Most of our <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html#Deletion_templates" title="WP:SPEEDY">speedy tags</a> provide that they should be removed should the articles on which they are applied not qualify for speedy deletion (except by page creators, who are to use {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}}; for a discussion of why removal in the former instances is appropriate, see, e.g., the <a href="../../../m/l/_/WP%7EML_adb5.html" title="WP:ML">mailing list</a> <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-June/049065.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-June/049065.html" rel="nofollow">thread beginning here</a>), and I think {{<a href="../../../r/e/p/Template%7EReplaceable_fair_use_fbaf.html" title="Template:Replaceable fair use">Replaceable fair use</a>}} should be styled similarly; certainly it is wholly nonsensical for us to say that a template asserting that a fair use image is replacable with a free one, once applied, can never be removed, and where there is disagreement betwixt admins, as here, some discussion to which members of the community might weigh in ought to be undertaken. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:42, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps it should say "Do not simply remove this tag" instead. Clearly if there is a real disagreement on whether or not the image violates fair-use policy, the speedy deletion tag shouldn't remain on forever; but neither should the person who disagrees simply remove the tag and not do anything further to address the issue. Adding {{<a href="../../../r/e/p/Template%7EReplaceable_fair_use_disputed_a5fb.html" title="Template:Replaceable fair use disputed">Replaceable fair use disputed</a>}} during the 7-day waiting period is probably the best approach; if the admin going through images at the end of the 7-day period finds an image he considers to have been improperly tagged (as in this case), then removing the tag probably <i>is</i> okay so long as the admin then also does something to address the issue, such as taking it to <a href="../../../f/u/r/WP%7EFUR_13d9.html" title="WP:FUR">WP:FUR</a>, <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a>, or <a href="../../../p/u/i/WP%7EPUI_d69d.html" title="WP:PUI">WP:PUI</a>. But simply removing the tag and not doing anything about the original tagger's concern isn't acceptable IMO. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 17:56, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>With that I agree entirely. Just as I am troubled when an editor removes a speedy tag from an article that, whilst not speediable, is likely irremediably unencyclopedic and neither himself acts to {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfD_4f30.html" title="Template:AfD">AfD</a>}} the article nor informs the original tagger in order that the latter might so do, so too would I be concerned were an editor to remove the {{<a href="../../../r/e/p/Template%7EReplaceable_fair_use_fbaf.html" title="Template:Replaceable fair use">Replaceable fair use</a>}} tag and partake of the discussion no further. Where an editor has in good faith and with some justification applied the tag and where another editor has in good faith and with some justification removed the tag, there is clearly a substantive issue to be discussed, and such discussion ought to take place at any of the several pages Angr, as I, suggests. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 18:07, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>No edits - blocked without any vandalism / edits</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How AOL works</b></p>
<p>AOL works in a way that helps stop abuse. When editing with AOL - everypage you edit is delivered through a different IP address. Thus blocking the IP is very effective in that it will stop any AOL user from editing the article they were vandalising. Thus a quick block is very effective against AOL users - I would recommend any IP that makes the same change to any article be immediately blocked.</p>
<p>Additionally, since the IP assignment will remain for a while assigned to a specific page - it allows the AOL user to be responsible for their edits to that page - as well as provides a history that prevents gaming of the system like using differnt IPs to edit the same article.</p>
<p>Finally, users can not easily vandalise in an automated fashion since using the AOL browser limits ones ability to run attached programs through the browser.</p>
<p><b>Action</b></p>
<p><b>I urge the admins to carefully consider this change</b> to the longstanding tradition of not blocking AOL as a proxy. As you can see above - there is vandalism from AOL - but there are many good edits as well. Do not prevent the unsophisticated users from editing wikipedia. I urge you to continue the open nature of the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbeo_Paliurus_864b.html" title="User:Abeo Paliurus">Abeo</a> <small><a href="../../../a/b/e/User_talk%7EAbeo_Paliurus_a94f.html" title="User talk:Abeo Paliurus">Paliurus</a></small> 18:10, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Like I've said before, these ranges ARE OPEN PROXY RANGES. Your actual IP is masked and it costs nothing to use.

<dd>We see helpful edits from open proxies all the time.

<p>Agreed. That fact is you don't know how AOL works any better than the rest of us. What we <i>do</i> know is that these are open proxies (if not, they might as well be), and open to abuse. We are following policy.

<dd>It appears he made a long unsourced addition with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Malta%2C_New_York&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68107666" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Malta%2C_New_York&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68107666" rel="nofollow">this edit to Malta New York</a>. When subsequent large and unsourced edits to other pages were reverted, he decided he wanted to retract the Malta, New York edit. His retraction was reverted as apparent vandalism and then he made his legal threat basically claiming ownership of the unsourced material. Since it's unsourced anyway, I say let it stay out, eh? Does this get referred somewhere anyway? —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 03:04, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wait, never mind on the unsourced material being added back in. So basically, I have no idea why he made a legal threat.

<p>Some organizations NAT outgoing connections to appear from a single IP and have users who vandalize Wikipedia with some regularity. Is there any policy in place to allow those organizations to request a permanent block on anonymous editing from the IP addresses for which they're responsible? If so, I'd appreciate someone pointing me to it. If not, could such a thing be done? Furthermore, if such a thing were to be done, where would the IP addresses be listed?</p>

<dd>I admit, I'm always rather surprised that this is really a problem. It seems to me better monitoring/logging, good company policies and active enforcement within the company are the real solution. Make it abundantly clear users should not be disruptive on the internet or violate policies of any websites they visit. You can even include vandalising wikipedia as a specific example. If it still occurs, track down the perpetrators (with good logs, it shouldn't be hard) and call them up for violating IT policies. Dock they pay or whatever. BTW, I'm not an admin and have never been involved in this sort of thing, but I assume normal practice would be to contact your organisation via the listed contact for your IP. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:41, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Our AUP already forbids things like vandalism online, but our IT department can't and shouldn't be responsible for monitoring all web usage and determining what could be vandalism. Wikipedia only contacts the owners of IP addresses in rare cases (the WP::ABUSE referred to me above seems to be a quasi-policy on the subject), and tracking individual cases of vandalism on Wikipedia down to the user would be ridiculously time-consuming anyway. I'm in contact with the IT Dept at the organization in question; it's WikiMedia that I'm trying to reach now. (I think you might have misunderstood my message; if so, sorry for the flame.) Anyhow, I sent a message to the WikiMedia info address, so we'll see what they have to say. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesboat_29f8.html" title="User:Jesboat">Jonathan</a> 19:01, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's possible (but a lot of work) to take the most recent deleted version, remove all parts that are copyvio, and save the page as such - then copy/paste the "deleted" edit history onto the talk page to keep the GFDL-required records.

<li>Technically, it's not a GFDL issue at all, because the current version of the article doesn't reflect those edits.

<li>It <i>is</i> a shame for the good faith editors who contributed to the article after the copyvio was introduced, but they can always go back in and re-add. One way to ameliorate the situation would be to view the deleted revisions and send talk-page messages alerting them to the deletion, and the reason it was done.

<dl>
<dd>This type of situation, in which deleting a history due to copyvio, libel, etc. concerns or as the result of a move raises GFDL concerns in some people's minds, comes up from time to time. Obviously we want histories preserved where possible, but we don't need admins driving themselves crazy checking every edit, either. Two questions occur to me:</dd>
<dd>1. Is the concern that leaving names out of the history could violate GFDL a significant real-world issue, as opposed to a purely theoretical or philosophical one!?</dd>
<dd>2. Going forward, is there a small tweak that could be made to the license language that would address this issue? <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 15:27, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>My responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. For any Wikipedia article, you need to provide a list of the authors. This doesn't, as far as I know, apply to edits deleted by oversight, but I'm not entirely sure. Of more concern than deletion of edits, in my mind, is people copying and pasting stuff from other Wikipedia articles. The page history makes it look like they wrote the text, when in many cases it was someone at the other page who wrote the text. Technically, the page history only records who added the text to the article, not who wrote it. That is where the lawyering starts.</li>
<li>2. Tweaking licenses after the fact cannot be done if it changes the meaning of the license. You can start a <b>new</b> license and encourage people to use that instead, but you have to get the people that released under the old licence (ie. every person who ever contributed to Wikipedia) to re-release under the new licence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, those are my views. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:13, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The GFDL requirement is to maintain a certain amount of attribution 4b "...together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement." Determining the principal authors of heavily edited page is of course difficult there maybe nothing left of one person contributions even if at one time they covered 95% of the text. We maintain the edit history and cover all authors, that means we are in compliance since we list all of them. Oversight is not an exemption (the GFDL wasn't written for us, the term oversight is meaningless in the GFDL context), but since the use of oversight is generally to scrub a contribution in it's entirety that's not an issue, if we aren't publishing material that the person wrote we don't have to credit them. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 16:24, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah. But what does "author of the Document" mean in this case? If someone writes a sentence, and then someone else copyedits it, who is the author? Either, neither, or both? I wasn't aware of the "at least five of the principal authors" bit, thanks for that. Am I also right in thinking that "the Document" here only concerns the present version, and not past versions? ie. Wikipedia is only "publishing" the present version and not past versions? And any document could be analysed so you can see who added each letter/word/sentence/paragraph/section, and then list those people. If your contribution got rewritten, you wouldn't be credited, is that right? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 17:48, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well multiple people contributing makes for joint authorship. Document there refers to the version you are taking to modify. Through history you can get to any version, so wikipedia is of course publishing multiple versions. If your contribution got removed or replaced a credit may not be required, although of course you may have arguably contributed to the version in question in other ways, such as the structure and layout of the document. Because we retain the full history many of these are non issues and if you want to get "good" answers (not definitive) to actually use, then you need to talk to a lawyer (rather than some editor on wikipedia.) --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 18:17, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh dear. I... don't quite know to say. Really, I didn't mean for anyone to notice that, let alone post it here! It wasn't really a suicide note, more like a personal acknowledgement of the things going on in my head. Suicidal thoughts are a symptom of <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">clinical depression</a>, and whenever I fall particularly low they certainly do occur. However, they are only thoughts. I have always been a logical person, and always will be; suicide is not a logical thing for me to do when I have people who need me. At this time some of those are other Wikipedians going through tough times, and I will not loose the will to live as long as anybody needs my help.</dd>
<dd>You may note that I said in the message "Due to recent events and their repercussions I may do any of the following". May, not will... it wasn't a suicide note, I promise you that. I am not currently sucidal, thanks to the Will that helpful Wikipedians have given me.

My comments were in comment markers, hidden within a message at the top of my talk page: I honestly wasn't thinking at the time I added it (depressive episode) and didn't believe anyone would find it. As I stated above, it wasn't a suicide note as much as a personal admission of what was going on inside my head. When editing my userpages I often forget that many people have them watchlisted, or even that other people see all my contributions.

<p>Is it really appropriate for all these schools (such as <a href="../../../y/o/r/York_House_School_1280.html" title="York House School">York House School</a>) many of which have no claim to notability, to have telephone numbers listed? We don't exist to provide directory information for every school in Canada, plus the potential for abuse of these numbers is very high. I don't think they should be included, but they already have been on hundreds of pages. Certainly a link to the school website or whatever gives enough info for someone to find the phone number, but our mission here should not be to publish such information.

<dd>I have to agree that telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, and perhaps even the physical address are not appropriate.

<dd>I think most of the school articles are completely non notable and unencyclopedic anyway, but given that we need an overwhelming consensus to delete, it isn't going to happen. There's nothing wrong with listing the actual address of the school, I'm pretty sure most articles on buildings will have an indication of its address or map reference. There's no need for contact details such as telephone, fax or email though, when a link to their website should suffice. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 18:58, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Note that I added the article in order to populate a nonfunctional link from [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Directory_Project" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Directory_Project" rel="nofollow">| another wikipedia article</a>]. My recollection (for some reason, there is no log of this contribution at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Orlady" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Orlady" rel="nofollow">| my contribution log</a>]) is that the content I added included both an external link to the ChefMoz website and an internal link to the Open Directory Project article.</p>
<p>At the time that I created the ChefMoz article, the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Directory_Project" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Directory_Project" rel="nofollow">| Open Directory Project article</a>] included a functioning link to an article about MusicMoz, but I see that the MusicMoz article also has been deleted (yesterday!), as logged at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=MusicMoz" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=MusicMoz" rel="nofollow">| this wikipedia page</a>]. There is no reason given for deleting that article, and I cannot immediately discern a reason for speedy deletion.</p>

<p>I would like to clarify here that I did indeed attempt to call and email a student by the name of H. Kelkar at the University of Texas in order to identify whether or not <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">User:Hkelkar</a> was really him and ask some questions regarding Physics research. The details for the email address and phone number are easily available with a Google search of Kelkar's full name, which he has publically posted on Wikipedia himself, in his first edit here. The contents of the email and call were not threatening at all, and any claims that state such are fallacious or misinterpreted. My primary intention was to establish contact with the person so I could confirm whether or not the Hkelkar on Wikipedia was really who he stated he was. This should be taken into consideration. When an admin told me that conducting such research independently was inappropriate, I stopped. Again, although the contents of the email/call were not threatening, I can understand how a user may feel insecure if anyone tried to establish contact with him or her outside their normal comfort zone, i.e. Wikipedia, and I did not take Hkelkar's threat seriously since neither the call or email were sent in a threatening matter. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab">talk</a></sup> 00:32, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have asked Nakontari to unblock.

<p>In general, it is just a good idea to the first make off-wiki communication foray by e-mail, and respect requests for cessation, regardless of how accessible the user's information, just a courtesy and an implicit nod to the separation of "real" life and wikipedia.
