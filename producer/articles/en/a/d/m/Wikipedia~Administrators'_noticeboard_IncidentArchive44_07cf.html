<dd>This is very new territory for me, as I can never recall having defended a racist before, but this Holocaust denier is apparently a frequent (and even sometimes useful) contributor to the discussion about our <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> article, and a number of other pages related to white supremacy. While he has attacked Jews as a class, I don't see evidence in his last dozen or so edits of attacking or harassing any editors in particular (please correct me if I'm wrong). Personally, I guess I am a little too committed to free speech to ban someone for expressing racist opinions on pages related to racism. Now, if he is harassing other editors or bringing racist ideas into discussions where it is clearly not appropriate, it would be a different matter. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 15:45, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "racist" in question is not merely expressing racist opinions, though. He is, rather, abusing other editors with them. Holding or expressing racist opinions is one thing. But abusing other editors under the cloak of "expressing opinions" is quite another.</dd>

We would not defend the latter insult by saying that it's just an opinion about dogs; and we should likewise not defend the former by saying it's just an opinion about race.

<dd>Ummm, you may be reading it differently than I, but the anon started a discussion (several paragraphs above the diff location), about the success and influence of Jewish culture on America, and how social and economic circumstances led to some events be much more widely known than others. As such, I would say the racist in question is actually agreeing with him (albeit in less than wonderful way). Unless I'm missing something this doesn't read as a personal attack to me because it isn't being directed at any editor, merely at the Jewish people (still bad, but not something I would ban for). I think the comparison I might make is to party politics. If the statement had been referring to Republicans instead, would we be having any discussion about a ban or a block? If no, then I would say it is probably tolerable free speech. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 17:05, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank goodness, then, that Wikipedia is not the town square. Certainly, it is <i>legally permissible</i> (in the nation where Wikipedia's servers are!) to accuse people of having had their mental faculties damaged by Jews.

<dd>Fubar, I think you have missed part of my point. I don't read his statement as a personal attack, so I don't think NPA applies. I read his statement as saying that the world in general has been "mentally damaged" (which I read as severely misled) by the actions of Jews, and not an attack on any particular editor for being Jewish or accepting the mainstream views. Do I find his statements and manner offensive? Yes. Do I believe he is racist? Absolutely. But do I believe these statements were meant as an attack on anyone else involved in the conversation? No, I do not. Keep in mind, that he is <i>in agreement</i> with the anon whom he is replying to that other atrocities have been unfairly neglected. Now, we might all get together and decide to ban racists from Wikipedia (which might be a good thing), but under existing policy I don't think there is any grounds to ban him, as Hipocrite originally suggested.</dd>

<dd>If you disagree about the reading of his statements or the meaning of NPA, well okay then, but I've already wasted entirely too much time defending the rights of someone I wouldn't want to let into my house, so I am going to go find something (anything) better to do. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 19:51, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My advice is to let it go this time, and if he keeps it up, then take him to the ArbCom. I can't see an automatic indefinite block just for stating some hateful beliefs. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:42, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I posted a warning on his talk page when I saw his post. This is an editor who has admitted in the past to having some form of relationship with <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.html" title="Stormfront">Stormfront</a> (or has at least posted sympathetically on their forum). I'm minded not to block him for this one comment, but if he repeats it, then I'm going to consider it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:39, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>It's really all in how he chooses to phrase the sentiment. The statement as it exists is certainly treading close to WP:NPA, implying that certain of our editors are "stupid" and have "damage[d]...mental faculties":</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The fact that people call such a statement "conspiracy theorizing" and nod their heads in stupid agreement, as you called my prior similar statements, merely demonstrates the damage to the mental faculties Jews have caused to the population.</i></dd>

<p>Had he instead phrased the remark slightly differently, perhaps along the lines of</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I believe that people call such statements "conspiracy theorizing" because they have been misled by Jews in positions of authority.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The same (extremely distasteful and flagrantly racist) concept is thus expressed without resort to personal attacks on our other editors. Jabowery should be cautioned to tread very carefully here. His viewpoint is shared by a vocal minority, and should be reported in an NPOV manner—but that doesn't grant him <i>carte blanche</i> to insult our editors. I won't shed any tears if he gets blocked the next time he describes one of our editors as mentally damaged. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 20:03, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>James, I'll be happy to post a note here after I take action (though I currently have no plans to), but there's no need to do that beforehand. As for controversy, if you mean the block of User:Amalekite, that was supported by two-thirds of the editors who commented on it, and was a very different kind of case, involving posting a hit list of Jewish editors on the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.html" title="Stormfront">Stormfront</a> website. Nothing borderline about that. In the meantime, I'm going to wait to see what Jabowery's response is to my post, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJabowery&amp;diff=23208287&amp;oldid=20437915" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJabowery&amp;diff=23208287&amp;oldid=20437915" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (and actually, I don't expect he will respond) and hope he doesn't make similar comments in future. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:10, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>So it would be better to block <i>first</i>, and then get into a morass of controversy like before, with the community having no actual say except some diminished input after the fact. Of course I can see why you favor doing things in that order, since once something is done its hard to override it (and if somebody was to unblock, then you'd just reblock), whereas if you discuss it in advance it's much easier for the community to wield a veto. This is how the whole Amalekite thing played out; it's not a purely academic question. There are lots of incidences like this, even if this one in particular might not get to that point. I find your objection to what I'm saying here pretty disturbing and representative of a flaw we've got in WP culture pertaining to admins. If the issue is not clear, then you should get community input <i>first</i>. To do it otherwise means the admin acts and the community just nods. And as to El C, no, I promise if she discussed a block prior to implementing it I would not object at all. In fact I would be quite pleased. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:36, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>if the community (including at least one non-Everyking user) objects to SV's blocks, they can open an rfc against her. SV has to honour <i>policy</i>, and as long as she does that, she does not have to come asking for approval for her every move. A substantial portion of the community <i>are</i> admins (there are about <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_non-admins_with_high_edit_counts_c29d.html" title="Wikipedia:List of non-admins with high edit counts">150</a> non-admins with &gt;5000 edits, as opposed to 570 admins), and they can revert any block by SV they disagree with. For some reason, disagreement about blocks among admins are very rare. That's not because all 570 admins think alike, but because they all have enough experience to know what will be controversial, and enough maturity not to indulge in controversial blocking. The system works very well. When on one occasion an admin unblocked himself, his rfc was very condemning, and I think he was de-adminned. That goes to show that there is no admin 'clique' defending their own no matter what. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 15:02, 16 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Who said anything about a clique? My point was it's preferable to discuss a controversial action in advance, which SlimVirgin has refused to do for a reason that I can only guess at. Are you seriously disagreeing with me that discussing controversial actions prior to acting is ideal? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:12, 16 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have intended to give you that reason&#160;:rolleyes:. I see no evidence that SV's block was considered controversial. If there is no 'clique', no admin will get away with an unfair block in the face of 569 other admins, so where's the problem? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 15:38, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Administrators are trusted members of the community, who have been given their admin powers precisely because of that trust. Use of those powers in support of policy is not controversial, and there is no need for admins to get pre-approval for doing exactly what the community has empowered them to do. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 16:55, 16 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I just find this hilarious. Jay, you're an <i>arbitrator</i>. Obviously the controversy comes from <i>when we can't agree on the interpretation and application of policy</i>. Of course if it's clearly within policy there's no controversy.

<p>I've said, and meant, that getting attacked over the <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogdanov_Affair_7b8e.html" title="Bogdanov Affair">Bogdanov Affair</a> business didn't bother me any, but three weeks later I'm starting to fray a little.

Would somebody else like to keep an eye on <a href="../../../b/o/g/Talk%7EBogdanov_Affair_a499.html" title="Talk:Bogdanov Affair">Talk:Bogdanov Affair</a> for a while?

<dd>My own $0.02 was spent already. <a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXAL_be45.html" title="User:XAL">User:XAL</a> had never posted on her own user talk page, and the contents there were <i>only</i> the insults she had put on <a href="../../../b/o/g/Talk%7EBogdanov_Affair_a499.html" title="Talk:Bogdanov Affair">talk:Bogdanov Affair</a>. Obviously, I have no stake in the undeletion of the page, if folks need to read the past behavior, as deletion of talk pages is iffy under the best of cases.

<dd>For one, his "enthusiasm" is certainly disruptive to the AfD, process, but a long block will definitely cause resentment and create a new problem. Looking at it, my initial thought was that we should try to engage in dialogue and prove that unfruitful before slamming down on him. Perhaps a better solution would have been a short term block with an explanation as to exactly why he has been blocked and a warning not to do it again and let the AfD run its course. If that didn't work, go ahead with the long block.</dd>

<p>I blocked him for 24 hours and rolled back all the deletion tag additions (28, at my count). I notice that someone has already started deleting the actual AfD pages (none of which he actually finished), but I wonder if we might not want to keep them for evidence?

<p>I received a e-mail from DrZhivago which began by assuring me that he didn't "want to start an edit war, and I don't want to drag unfounded accusations and blatant bias into Wikipedia." and ends with:</p>

<p>Maybe the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Iraq_048c.html" title="Flag of Iraq">Flag of Iraq</a> page should've been updated then, because it clearly stated that the flag as pictured in the article <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> was not official yet, so I changed it back to the older flag (which by the way has much better proportions than this weird-looking flag). So I ask: Is the flag official, yes or no? Which flag will you see on official Iraqi buildings? If it's the so-called "Saddam-era" flag, which the basic design (just without the handwritten script) existed before Saddam took power, then the new flag should be removed. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> <i>(<a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_6ee1.html" title="User talk:Revolución">talk</a>)</i> 02:32, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The only thing that changed with the flag is the proportions and the style of the script. But, since materials are very low in Iraq, I highly suspect that many Iraqis will use the Saddam era flag, abliet they both are very smiliar. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 03:47, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about a different/additional throttle, such as this one: the ability to move pages at all is only enabled for accounts that have made at least <i>N</i> edits in the main article namespace, for a reasonable value of <i>N</i> (say, <i>N</i>=20). Of course, that would have to go together with a policy that would allow admins to permanently block any account for which the first <i>N</i> contributions are overwhelmingly vandalism. In other words, we don't want to give vandals who've managed to deface <i>N</i> pages the ability to do page move vandalism as a reward for their bad behavior. However, if we can get <i>N</i> halfway decent edits in exchange for the cleanup work required to undo page move vandalism, it may be a worthwhile bargain. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a><big><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">✍</a></big> 20:13, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>First of all, I wanted to thank the Administrators/editors who so efficiently acted to delete three anonymous attempts to post attacks directed at me on or about June 8, 2005. I cannot thank you enough!</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to ask you to please release any and all information you have in your possession relative to the three attempts that were made to post these attacks against my person and professional integrity. A Google search of my name reveals that three attempts were made to post malicious posts on or about June 8, 2008 on Wikipedia, as one or two sentences are still available online making reference to these attempted posts.</p>
<p>This request for information is meant to elicit release of the following: (1) uncensored, unedited copies of the text of all three posts in full as submitted to Wikipedia by the unidentified writer; (2) copies of any and all identifying information you may have about the writer of the three posts, including but not limited to email address; (3) copies of any and all warnings or notices Wikipedia may have sent to the writer informing him or her that his/her submissions were inappropriate.</p>
<p>Please be advised that I would prefer to obtain this information through informal means, however, if necessary I will pursue whatever civil action is necessary to ensure release of this information so that I may protect my legal rights against whoever is attempting to slander my name and professional image. I suspect I know who is behind the three attempted Wikipedia postings, but I need proof in order to take further legal action against said individual before this person causes some real harm.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me at my email address or at either one of my telephone numbers listed below. Thank you very much for you time and your kind assistance in this matter.</p>
<p><br />
Very truly yours,</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mercedes Alonzo Attorney at Law</p>

<dd>Interestingly, I would expect an assistant AG not to misuse the term 'slander'—defamatory material posted to Wikipedia would, I think, be 'libel'. Oh well. It doesn't do any harm to give out the IP address of the contributor; that information is publicly available anyway. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 15:32, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I belive that in soem cases courts have held defamation on web fora to be slander, rather than libel, on the grounds of their transitory nature and informality, and the reduced rspect they therefore carry. So the term may have been used quite sensibly for the issue at hand. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:17, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>19:15, 17 September 2005 Tony Sidaway unprotected Khmer Rouge (My strategy here will be to block edit warriors. This page has been protected too much, and the warriors blocked all too infrequently. This is a wiki and will be edited.)</li>

<li>15:03, 8 July 2005 Jayjg protected Khmer Rouge (longstanding edit war)</li>
<li>02:47, 27 June 2005 Petaholmes unprotected Khmer Rouge (no progress made on the talk page wrt dispute, but pages has been protected for 2+ weeks)</li>
<li>03:38, 9 June 2005 Petaholmes protected Khmer Rouge (edit war)</li>
</ul>
<p>The cause of the protects in every case has been repeated reverts by <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">User:Ruy Lopez</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">User:Adam Carr</a>. Carr uses provocative language in his reverts, keeping count as follows: "today's rvts: me 1, Communist Party of Wikipedia 1". Some other editors have sometimes been involved, usually reverting Ruy Lopez's edits.</p>
<p>This seems like a classic case of disruption to me. In order to advance the situation, I have warned these two editors in particular, but basically anyone involved in the long term disruption, that I may block them for disruption if they continue to engage in reverting. Ambi disputes this, citing that there is no basis in policy. I am satisfied to put this to the opinion of my fellow administrators. I would like to see <a href="../../../k/h/m/Khmer_Rouge_98c5.html" title="Khmer Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> editable for at least half of the next 100 days and see this as an acceptable way of achieving that end; I would not block the editors for reasons other than continuing their long revert war. On the other hand, Ambi is correct to state that there is no strict basis for such action in policy.

<dd>I suppose it might get them to make some concessions in their edits to avoid making true reverts, which would be worth something, but nevertheless I don't like it much because it seems outside of policy.

<p>This situation will continue until Lopez and all his aliases are barred from editing, as anyone who has been following this dispute (and similar ones at other articles in which I am not involved) knows quite well. It is quite untrue that "both combatants are trying to improve Wikipedia, in their own special way." Lopez is here solely to impose communist POV on articles, as he has stated openly in exchanges elsewhere which I have been sent. In these circumstances the usual Wikipedia conventions, which assume good faith, break down. There can be no resolution until the disruptive element is removed. Until Wikipedia acquires sufficient testicular fortitude to do this, I will continue to defend the integrity of this article with the only means at my disposal. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 12:40, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The content dispute in the article is about topics such as GRUNK. Instead of discussing the content dispute and such things here, Adam Carr decided to go the route of mud-slinging, ad hominems and personal attacks. Perhaps that's why ArbCom adminished Adam Carr a few months ago (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Skyring_59ae.html#Adam_Carr_admonished" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Skyring">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Skyring#Adam_Carr_admonished</a>) in a 6-0 decision for "discourtesy and personal attacks". I'm not really sure how to come to a compromise with someone who stated he would revert any edit I made on the article, no matter what it says. I said we should bring this matter to the mediation committee - he refused. ArbCom suggested to Adam Carr a few months ago that he lay off of personal attacks, but I don't think he has followed their advice. <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> 05:07, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Without going into massive detail, it seems to me that the current version of the article contains quite a lot of opinion rather than fact. That it isn't communist opinion is immaterial, it's still opinion.

<p>I have given 3 users a timeout of 24 hours based on my view that this is an absurd flamewar which has spilled over onto us from another site. I've blocked User:Gadugi, <a href="../../../v/r/y/User%7EVryl_7a0b.html" title="User:Vryl">User:Vryl</a>, and <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikemartin_5333.html" title="User:Mikemartin">User:Mikemartin</a>.</p>
<p>Gadugi is apparently Jeff Merkey himself. Mr. Merkey called me several times last week to complain about various things on the site. Vryl says that he is normally just a lurker in reading the messageboards where this flamewar normally goes on, but he spent a fair amount of time last night provoking Mr. Merkey (who is easily excited, it seems to me) about Mr. Merkey's Cherokee heritage. Mikemartin is either Jeff Merkey's neighbor who uses Merkey's open wireless connection, or Merkey himself (more likely, based on a comment about his needing to 'phone Mr. Wales again'.</p>
<p>Gadugi left quite a flame for me about me being a "LIAR" and so on, but I don't hold that against him. As I said, he's quite an excitable person. And he was being provoked.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, my advice to all of them is (a) take the flame war back to the message boards and (b) treat everyone with respect while you're at Wikipedia. This is not Usenet, this is not a Yahoo board for flaming, We Are Nice People Who Do Not Behave This Way.</p>
<p>My advice to admins who might get involved is to try to handle everyone involved with "kid gloves" -- they've apparently got their own wars to fight elsewhere. Our goal is a high quality encyclopedia which is neutral and accurate, our secondary goal is to have some peace and quiet while we do our work, so we should encourage all these folks to either calm down or go away or both.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 11:30, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Agree on all points. Fact-based websites are documenting Mr. Merkey's involvement in the biggest set of legal controversies in the computer software business. Many people are interpreting the public information to believe that he is aligned with a group claiming intellectual property which is not theirs, attempting to extort lawsuit-protection money from thousands of companies based on their spurious claim, and engaging in a pump'n'dump securities fraud. Regardless of the truth of these matters, people are engaging in a flamewar which appears to have spilled onto WP's pages, and which does not belong here. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox nor a debate forum.

<li>I wandered into the middle of this controversy because Mr. Merkey, using his User ID and a variety of anon IDs, continues to delete Talk page comments by others and text in the article about himself. He had already been blocked before for this behavior, so I blocked him for a week because he was a repeat offendor. I have received several threats from him, both here on the board and by email. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:18, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Er, am I missing something here? The AfD appears to be split 6-4, including one "very weak delete"; I didn't think that was usually considered a consensus. Although, I should note that I would've voted <b>delete</b> on that one if I'd noticed it. ...actually, wait, after I typed that, I noticed that the keep at the bottom was an anon, making it 6-3 if that is discounted. Still, a ~66% consensus seems a little surprising to me; that might be what Dan100 was upset over, though I don't know why he wouldn't just <i>say</i> it. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 04:20, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's not unusual to delete at 2/3, but I also think it's silly to let the final fate of articles depend so heavily on the random chance of who winds up closing the AfD. Which is to say, sure, deleting at 2/3 is OK, but if an admin has serious doubts about whether it was a fair close, they should undelete - just like blocking for personal attacks is sometimes OK, but othre admins should and do feel free to undblock. Also, 6/4 is not 2/3, it's 60%.

<dd>As has been observed many times, VfU displays an astonishing amount of deference towards AfD and towards the closing admin, to the point that, for example, a completely out of process deletion of an article with only 60% delete votes can get a 14/3 "keep deleted." <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 15:57, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I'm sorry you think I was completely out-of-process. There're a lot of others who think I was well within process and it's hardly fair to dismiss all of them simply because you disagree with them: they could just as well dismiss you because they disagree with you and I don't suppose you'd appreciate that. Still, I don't think that disliking a process makes it ok to simply circumvent that process whether you're an admin or not. Now, seeing as you have undeleted it, in the face of an overwhelming consensus to keep it deleted, might you at least do something about that bizarre tag that's presently on it and at least re-nominate it at AfD? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 16:08, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll defend the use of IAR - there is a time and a place to ignore rules in closing deletion. For example, I made clear (And Jimbo agreed) that there were no circumstances under which Cyrus Farivar would be deleted. And if 100 adherents to a given conspiracy theory showed up to demand keeping an unverifiable piece of POV speculation, I would quickly decide to not care about the numbers on that vote either.</p>
<p>But I don't think this article was a slam dunk keep or a slam dunk delete on its own merits. And I don't think that changing the rules to a 60% consensus threshold is remotely appropriate. What bothers me more, though, is how much this demonstrates the deeply broken nature of AfD and its appeals process - it remains the case that deletion is a MUCH easier outcome to obtain than keeping, which is problematic, because it's also the thing that it seems like we want to be more cautious about. If nothing else, there's a reason we let anyone create an article, but only trusted users delete them - one of them is clearly more dangerous, and yet it's also the one our deletion process favors. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 17:30, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uh, I didn't cite IAR and would not do so in order to delete an AfD article. IAR has no place in that forum. I didn't change any rules. I discarded an anons comment as practically every closing admin would have done, so, at risk of stating the obvious, there was two-thirds to delete. And VfU backs that approach - overwhelmingly.

<dd>Fair enough. But here we get to the big problem - neither Dan nor I voted in that AfD at all. In my case, it's because AfD is too large for me to follow it accurately. So I suppose this goes to the larger philosophical issue - what do you do in a case like this? There's something kind of perverse about the notion that my opinion on deletion counts only if I happen to notice the page in a five day window. Particularly when noticing the page is quite a chore. And when VfU isn't even entirely determined on its own identity, I'm not sure it's innately the best place for this to be sorted out. Given all of that, my preference would be that we don't go deleting articles as a default, because it's a lot easier to delete something later than it is to undelete it. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 18:27, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i><small>caught in a wikislow and an edit conflict</small></i>This is an eternal problem, the most obvious solution to which is to cut in about three the number of edits-per-day to Wikipedia and so reduce the AfD load to about 30-50 per day. I'm not sure what the more practical solutions are to be honest. Someone suggested we should just nominate fewer articles to AfD. I'm not at all sure how viable that is given that as the edit rate rises so does the amount of drek that tries to find its way in. I guess some people don't see it as drek. Probably a once-a-day scan of yesterday's TOC for AfD is the easiest way (or the least hard way) to try to feel what's going on. That seems better at least than translating a would-be comment to 'keep' into an action to undelete; the second is a considerably stronger motion than the first. I agree we shouldn't delete articles as a default, and I don't e.g. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Games_considered_the_worst_ever_6ce0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Games considered the worst ever">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Games considered the worst ever</a> was (probably) close enough to two-thirds with enough problems in the article that VfU would have upheld a deletion on the grounds of being within admin discretion. I did not delete it, because I did not judge consensus to have been reached in that case; and the numbers were only a part of my reasoning. Although VfU is looking at changing some of its clothes, I'm not sure that it is broken in the meantime. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 18:53, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I've read the VFU, and realize I am apparently in the minority on this issue, I would like to register my disapproval at the notion that one gets to a magic 2/3 by fully discounting an anon vote and fully counting a "very weak delete". My understanding is that 2/3 is the absolutely the weakest threshold that anyone uses regularly in assessing AFD consensus. In my mind, that means one should look carefully at any and all extenuating circumstance when a vote looks like 2/3. In this case both the weak delete and the anon keep would favor a no consensus outcome. That said, I respect your right to make these decisions and don't think any of the parties should have undeleted it without a discussion and consensus to do so (one that apparently doesn't exist in this case for whatever reason). <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 18:47, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

There is no suggestion that the article was deletable under the deletion policy, but AfD has grown away from the policy and VFU has grown away from undeleting articles that aren't clearly deletable. So well, let's move on and try to learn from it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:42, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The third out-of-process undeletion was very regrettable.The community repeatedly endorsed a contrary decision.</p>
<ul>
<li>The AfD was close, but with a clear 6<u>7</u>% in favor of deletion it is difficult to see how there wasn't a concensus to delete among that group of AfD participants, especially when one reads the commentary in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_gags_in_Airplane%21_9c44.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of gags in Airplane!">AfD</a>. The comments, representing an attempt to reach concensus, really are the heart of the matter in unclear cases, not the votes per se. The comments explaining why a delete decision is the more appropriate make sensible reference to WP policies, explain the role of a sister project (Wikiquote), and give plausible reasons for deletion. The comments in favor of keeping were completely devoid of rationale in 3 instances; in the only one with a reason, the editor claimed there was no rule against humor (which is true, but rather misses the point as no one was saying the List was to be deleted on account of being funny). One keep vote was made by an anon, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.173.96.213_6a3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.173.96.213">70.173.96.213</a>, who voted on the same day of his first edit, and has not made any edits since the day after. I appreciate the difficulty with the "weak delete"; as Sjakkalle has pointed out, however, there is no way to "split" that vote and say it counts as half a vote, or some such. Given that that editor provided a reason for his/her vote, and it is not unreasonable, I think it is fair to count it; what such editors are saying is that of all the options open to them, they're choosing X option, despite some difficulty in deciding that. Of course, if you think otherwise, it is a very fair point to raise in the proper forum—VfU.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The VfU so overwhelmingly recognized the validity of the AfD decision that it is puzzling it can be interpreted in any other way.</li>
<li>The comment that the AfD system results in deletion being "a MUCH easier outcome to obtain than keeping" is very difficult to understand. Every keep vote is worth between 2-4 delete votes; thus, not only must there be a majority of good faith editors deciding an article has to be deleted, that majority has to strongly outnumber the opposite decision before any Admin can delete an article. Conversely, even 20-33% of good faith participants asking for a keep is sufficient to ensure that the article will be kept. Under these circumstances, it is hard to understand the claim. The <i>opposite</i> is true: the system is designed to make it much more difficult to delete. And I broadly agree with that principle.</li>
<li>It must never be forgotten that <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_Raul%27s_laws_b426.html" title="User:Raul654/Raul's laws">WP's most important and valuable resource</a> are the editors who take the time and effort to be "regulars". When we summarily ignore their good faith attempts to come to a decision on less-than-straightforward questions, we damage WP. AfD and VfU may not be perfect, but they are the best we have; they represent honest people trying to reach a consensus. Please do not ignore that.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#B0B0B0">εγκέφαλον</font></a> 19:40, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The problematic phrase is "a clear 67% in favor of deletion". 67% isn't clear, we've heard that if just one person had happened on the vote before close it would have been 60%, which is a no consensus keep. According to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a>, doubt is good grounds to not delete, and there are substantial grounds here. However a decision to keep at this stage would merely be adding a third perversity onto the perversities of the decision to delete and the decision to keep deleted. I certainly don't want to ignore Splash's close and VFU's decision to endorse it, however perverse I find VFU's determination not to look at the content of the article. VFU is entitled to do that, but they cannot be required to do so. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:55, 20 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Very fair comment, Tony. What I meant by "clear 67% in favor of deletion" is exactly that—it is clear that 67% of the participants of this AfD wanted it deleted. I'm not making a judgement on concensus, because as we have all seen (and I'm sure more senior editors such as yourself know this better than I), there is no concensus on a numerical value for concensus. What <i>is</i> clear is that two-thirds <i>did</i> vote to delete, and in so far as two-thirds is a recognized choice as a valid concensus, Splash's decision was not unreasonable. When you say that if even one person happened on that discussion and voted "keep" it would have changed the decision, you're absolutely right. May I point out however, that the same thing can be said of any arbitrary border. For example, I believe you generally take a deletion concensus to be formed only at 80%. Assume that an AfD had 80% in favor of deletion, and you deleted the article. I do not think it would be proper for someone to come along and unilaterally undelete it saying, "If one more person voted keep, you'd have lost your 80% concensus." Where to place the concensus line has always been difficult to decide, and we're going to have to live with that uncertainty for now. However, what is always objectionable is summary undeletions or deletions without any attempt being made to either discuss it with the closer in question, or ignoring VfU [1]. I remain convinced that the VfU process is at heart sound, because I've seen how the editors there instinctively vote to overturn an out-of-process decision even when they personally favor (or do not favor) the article in question.

<li>The way I interpreted the 14/3 vote on VfU was that it reflected community consensus, not on deleting this particular article, but against an admin unilaterally reversing an AfD close <b>without attempting to start a discussion with the originally closing admin</b>. If Dan had chosen to list the article on VfU, or even better, had started a polite conversation with Splash asking about the consensus definition, we would not be in such an acrimonius debate. Note that I'm not saying that the original admin's decision is carved in stone, but that <b>unilateral action reversing another editor's decision-making, without trying to talk about it, is disrespectful</b>.

<dd>You may consider this shouting a whole lot too. It is a very difficult interpretation of the above discussion, and the VfU that says there is more than a small amount of support at all for what you propose. And support for it is what matters, not how much you'd <i>like</i> there to be support. Note that even Dragons flight, who said to undelete in the VfU, has said that it should not have been undeleted, and that they respect the consensus of VfU. Of course, I'm presuming, like Fvw, that the suggestion is simply sarcasm. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:20, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that Snowspinner's suggestion is a good one. The vote on VfU showed disapproval of Dan100's behaviour, not necessarily support for the article being deleted. Dan behaved badly; he should have talked to Splash. But what would have happened if he had? Probably the two of them would have agreed to send it back to AfD. The article shouldn't suffer for Dan's poor behaviour, and how could it hurt anyone to send it back to AfD? <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> 17:16, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>moink, you have twice interpreted the VfU to be simply a judgment of Dan's conduct; this is incorrect. The VfU confines itself to judging whether or not the closer made a decision that is supported by WP guidlelines; the participants in this particular VfU overwhelmingly decided that he had. This is not a judgment of <i>Dan's conduct</i>—a distinctly different issue—although if you were to ask the participants of the VfU what they thought of that, many would probably agree with you that Dan should have spoken to Splash first. <i>That they might think so is no reason to disregard what they clearly think of the AfD itself</i>, and of the validity of the closer's decision. Please read the VfU once more: you will note that the comments overwhelmingly pertain directly to the validity of the AfD, not to Dan's action. Undeleting this article (again) will be a troubling gesture of disregard for both the validity of AfD and VfU as established instruments of WP, and of the opinions of editors who take so much time to participate in AfD and VfU, in good faith, in an attempt to ensure the fair application of WP guidelines and policies.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#B0B0B0">εγκέφαλον</font></a> 18:46, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, I didn't make the interpretation twice; I made it once and repeated myself. &#160;:) Anyway, you may be right. There were a few of the comments on VfU with KD that specifically said they were referring to Dan's conduct, and I got the sense that they meant it almost as a way not to reinforce the behaviour. But I may be taking my interpretations too far... what matters is what they said, not my beliefs about what they meant by what they said. I guess I just think that the original AfD vote was very close, and I'm following the maxim "when in doubt, keep talking about it." But I don't have strong feelings on what gets done in this particular case. <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> 20:26, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>[For a time contextual discussion of the following please see my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:TJive#Blocked" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:TJive#Blocked" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>.]</p>
<p>This posting is a general complaint and inquiry as to the behavior of a particular administrator as well as administrative abilities in general. I have been a regular contributor for several months now, but as of late (and for the foreseeable future) I am unable to spend much time whatsoever on Wikipedia, and with regular users who carry out the ritualistic aspects of this site it sometimes appears shrift or bizarre that some editors do not carry on conversations with great regularity at any length. A few weeks ago I experienced this problem upon reverting bad edits to an article when another editor continued to revert me until I explained myself (which I did not have time for at that moment and about which there exist no hard, objective rules). Eventually however I found time and the dispute died down.</p>
<p>However, in this particular case I have been caught between an anonymous (half-(?))vandal and an administrator of the site. I first came into contact with the former when he began to troll and vandalize various users' user <i>and</i> talk pages with messages similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TJive&amp;diff=22590206&amp;oldid=22583572" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TJive&amp;diff=22590206&amp;oldid=22583572" rel="nofollow">the following</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This guy aka YINever insulted me at GameFAQs and called my grandfather a fascist because he fought for China in the Korean War, yet ironically he supports Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When this user would have his edits undone by (non-anonymous) editors he would get quite abusive. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22733472&amp;oldid=22695237" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22733472&amp;oldid=22695237" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22802457&amp;oldid=22778332" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22802457&amp;oldid=22778332" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Eventually he was blocked by <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">User:Sasquatch</a> for a week for these stunts. He evaded it by using other IPs and appears to have ignored any comments (though he is aware of how talk functions).</p>
<p>I encountered him on a few articles in the midst of this, including a creation of his own, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Chinese_sentiment&amp;oldid=22389606" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Chinese_sentiment&amp;oldid=22389606" rel="nofollow">Anti-Chinese sentiment</a>". While the content is not particularly conducive for the purposes here, I found it to be a rambling (and unsourced) original research piece not worth salvaging for either the purposes of a merge or a cleanup, so I changed it to a redirect of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> (I did something similar to another one of his lovely pieces, Americofascism, which ended up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Americofascism&amp;curid=2616727&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Americofascism&amp;curid=2616727&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">unilaterally deleted</a> by an administrator. The anon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Chinese_sentiment&amp;diff=22621648&amp;oldid=22592535" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Chinese_sentiment&amp;diff=22621648&amp;oldid=22592535" rel="nofollow">became abusive as per usual</a>.</p>
<p>These reverts continued for a few days and eventually another editor, <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">User:TDC</a> (who was in the midst of warding off another vandal who he insulted in turn), took up reverting <i>this</i> anon on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Chinese_sentiment_50b4.html" title="Anti-Chinese sentiment">Anti-Chinese sentiment</a> and others. Enter <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a>. Within a period of two minutes on September 12th, Rama reverted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Chinese_sentiment&amp;diff=23105281&amp;oldid=23099207" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Chinese_sentiment&amp;diff=23105281&amp;oldid=23099207" rel="nofollow">at</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cuban_exile&amp;diff=23105272&amp;oldid=23099300" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cuban_exile&amp;diff=23105272&amp;oldid=23099300" rel="nofollow">least</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vietnam_Veterans_Against_the_War&amp;diff=23105301&amp;oldid=23098848" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vietnam_Veterans_Against_the_War&amp;diff=23105301&amp;oldid=23098848" rel="nofollow">four</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=23105298&amp;oldid=23098840" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=23105298&amp;oldid=23098840" rel="nofollow">separate</a> articles edited by both the anon and TDC, all of them in favor of the former. Two minutes is barely enough time to commit four reverts, much less read and participate in discussion to determine appropriately which version or what portions was/were superior and why. Reverts at "Anti-Chinese sentiment" continued, however, until some time after Rama <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anti-Chinese_sentiment&amp;oldid=23463370" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anti-Chinese_sentiment&amp;oldid=23463370" rel="nofollow">posted a message</a> on the talk page, warning users that he would "take appropriate measures" if the article was reverted without discussion. Keep in mind that when he said this, six days had passed since he reverted the article with no explanation on his own part, and none would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>Now, as I discussed earlier, I do not have much time to dick around on this site, and so I mostly scan through my watchlist, as I happened to be at one particular moment. I reverted "Anti-Chinese sentiment" again, and at that moment I had just finished reading the recent posts to a separate talk page and was coming to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-Chinese_sentiment_9207.html" title="Talk:Anti-Chinese sentiment">Talk:Anti-Chinese sentiment</a> (they were next to each other on my watchlist) when I saw the orange "You have new messages" strip. Rama decided to block me for 24 hours for my severe disruption to that page. Barely nine minutes passed between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Chinese_sentiment&amp;diff=23473406&amp;oldid=23441794" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Chinese_sentiment&amp;diff=23473406&amp;oldid=23441794" rel="nofollow">my revert</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TJive&amp;diff=23473942&amp;oldid=23472854" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TJive&amp;diff=23473942&amp;oldid=23472854" rel="nofollow">the message on my talk page informing me I was blocked</a>. Considering it is not likely such a unique template exists and that he likely blocked me before telling me that he had blocked me, it appears he shot rather quickly without even awaiting my response to his comments (which I had not yet seen).</p>
<p>Incidentally, the anon again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Chinese_sentiment&amp;diff=23498193&amp;oldid=23473406" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Chinese_sentiment&amp;diff=23498193&amp;oldid=23473406" rel="nofollow">reverted the article in question</a> with no explanation of his own and in fact with an abuse of the edit summary field to describe my edits as vandalism. He does not appear to have been blocked, despite Rama's warning (Rama has certainly been around since that point) and despite his abusive behavior, trolling, and vandalism. Meanwhile, my block was somehow extended around a day further than the ostensible 24 hours that Rama claimed, as I was not able to access any pages to edit until today.</p>
<p>Now, it is already unclear to me by what justification and right or ability Rama is blocking me for disruption by simple reverts. There exists no policy of which I am aware that says reverts are not allowed or require particular, individual, in-depth, or superficial explanations in any particular place at any time. A much longer and more severe edit war has taken place at <a href="../../../k/h/m/Khmer_Rouge_98c5.html" title="Khmer Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> for which Tony Sidaway proposed a similar solution. The reaction seemed negative or muddled enough that he decided it was not worth it. Rama does not appear to have even bothered asking anyone's opinion, and when challenged on the point he has merely rested on the fact that discretion is entrusted in him as an administrator. For what purpose exactly do we have an arbitration process if it is now up to each individual administrator to decide (and decree rules for, ad hoc) the outcome and participants in content disputes in which they have already involved themselves? And why precisely are vandals (or anons in general) being treated in much better faith than long-term users?</p>
<p>To me this is another example of Wikipedia fetishizing <i>some</i> processes and customs (which I am not able to participate fully in) simultaneous to objective regulations of that process being bypassed or ignored entirely. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 17:55, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you basing this on similarity between the edits of Blair and the anons, or something else? Also I should note that Blair was not banned <i>altogether</i> as you imply but just from articles pertaining to certain subjects.

<p>This is absurd and I don't think they even grasp the nature of the encyclopedia. They seem to think this stuff has some kind of stamp of approval and don't seem to understand that we actively fight this stuff to the best of our ability, and can't help it if a vandal edit stays up for a few minutes before somebody catches it. If somebody wants to look through page histories searching for old vandalism to indulge their tastes for vulgar juvenile humor, then let them; there's no reason we need to go to the extra effort to clean all that stuff out. "Take action against the website"? What? As if we <i>condone</i> vandalism about Wiesenthal? Somebody write them an angry letter, or several, please. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:29, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, some vandals will probably pick up on this and realize that some people will blame the encyclopedia in general for vandalism (and not even think of it as vandalism, but as information that we are deviously trying to pass off as serious), and step up the vandalism as a result. So I think the article is very irresponsible. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:37, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Below is my email exchange with Josh Landis, the guy quoted in the article. I won't claim that my email is particularly well-written, given that it was sent at about 2AM local time, but I did my best to defend wikipedia:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Sir,</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As a frequent contributor to the Wikipedia article on Simon Wiesenthal, I was disappointed to read your attacks on our efforts in the press. I and other wikipedia editors do our best to create articles that are informative and fair. The beauty of wikipedia is that anyone can contribute to an article. The upside of this is that wikipedia is an ever-expanding resource containing a vast quantity of information presented in (often) highly readable articles. Wikipedia has become a crucial resource to millions of people as a result of our efforts. Obviously, there are always going to be vandals, either children who insert inappropriate words in articles or sophisticated neo-Nazi groups who try to insert their propaganda and disguise it as legitimate. However, many dedicated editors maintain constant vigilance over the website, vandalism is almost always reverted within five minutes and frequent vandals are often blocked from editing. We put in a lot of time and effort trying to make wikipedia a good resource, that occasionally means lengthy battles with other editors who try to insert a point of view and sophisticated research to determine exactly who is committing acts of vandalism. For example in June I successfully fended off efforts from wikipedia users to include links to neo-Nazi websites in the Simon Wiesenthal article, and many other editors have had similar battles. In the specific vandalism you complained about in The Age, I determined that the vandals were using computers in Illinois public schools. I decided not to ask that these computers be blocked from editing wikipedia because I didn't want to prevent thousands of people in Illinois from being unable to contribute to our site. Instead, I decided to trust the wikipeida user community to immediately revert inappropriate vandalism, and this approach has worked. Thanks to the efforts of dozens of contributers from around the globe the article on Simon Wiesenthal keeps improving in quality, and vandalism is almost never present for more than a few minutes. If you investigate the history of the Simon Wiesenthal article you will see that this is the case. As a Jew, I completely understand your frustration at anti-semitic comments on such a popular website, but the problem is not with wikipedia itself but with humanity as a whole. We can't control the fact that there are people in this world who want to spread vile and hateful propaganda, but we are doing everything in our power to make sure that our website is free of such content. I really wish that you had taken the time to explore wikipedia rather than denounce and threaten us in the press.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let me make a few things clear:</dd>
<dd>a) The article does not include any comments by me which are critical of</dd>
<dd>wikipedia. I'd never used it before, and I didn't say anything</dd>
<dd>derogatory about the site to the journalist.</dd>
<dd>b) the comments on the site were grossly offensive. While I appreciate</dd>
<dd>that you and others work to remove offensive material, it remains on the</dd>
<dd>cache of the site and should be permanently removed.</dd>
<dd>c) this council has successfully brought two legal actions against</dd>
<dd>websites for material which is racially vilifying of Jews. I do not</dd>
<dd>regard this case as being akin to those, nor do we have any intention of</dd>
<dd>treating it the same. It is not unreasonable that a Jewish group would</dd>
<dd>protest at this material the day after the man passed away, especially</dd>
<dd>considering the level of traffic on this site.</dd>
<dd>d) we believe that wikipedia, while not being responsible for the</dd>
<dd>material, has a responsibility to prevent abuses by blocking or banning</dd>
<dd>those who cause offense.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think if you review the article, and the comments attributed to me,</dd>
<dd>you will see that you may have overreacted in relation to the position</dd>
<dd>of this council.</dd>

<dd>Two points.
<ol>
<li>What is the relation of Josh Landis's letter to your letter? Which one of them is earlier and which is later? Was Josh Landis's letter addressed to you or the newspaper?</li>
<li>I just <i>love</i> it when outside critics condemn an entire effort for one fault. Surely they implored their readers never to visit, or at least never to contribute to, such a shameful evil anti-semitist site as Wikipedia? <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 12:21, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>In regard to Landis's points:
<ol>
<li>No response needed.</li>
<li>AFAIK, such a removal would violate the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. And anyway, Wikipedia is constantly being archived by search engines such as Google and mirrored by other websites. We have no control over the caches of those websites. Someone might search for "Simon Wiesenthal + Wikipedia" on Google and see a result calling him homosexual, but when he clicks on it, the article revision can't be found. Is this still our fault?</li>
<li>Does this mean the council won't take legal action towards Wikipedia? In that case, it's a good thing, because Wikipedia is not centralised, there is no official agreement on its contents or opinions, it's all a bunch of independent contributors.</li>
<li>No it doesn't have such a responsibility. No one on Wikipedia is obligated to do anything. It is entirely voluntary. That said, I fully support blocking users who vandalise the Simon Wiesenthal article. In fact I remember once doing so myself. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 12:33, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>in thoery we could remove it without worrying about the GFDL sinece selective undelete doesn't remove the names of any authors. The real problem is one of scale there is some much vandalism of that type that we don't have the resources to remove it. Legaly he woulnd't have much of a case. The content is legal under US law. Worst case senario is that Jimbo and current comitte memebers would be unable to vist australia. As to the final point we probably would have a resposibilty to remove material that is illegal or libelus under US law once it had been pointed out to is.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 13:41, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you ask me, insisting that we delete all the vandal revisions from the history would actually give the vandals an advantage: we would be forced to go to far more trouble to clean up after them than usual. Ironically, such insistence on removing vandalism from the page history could mean more vandalism on the current revision. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:06, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Based on my reading of his letter, he isn't threatening legal action so much as making it clear that he finds the vandalism unacceptable in the most powerful terms. Personally, I think we can certainly remove some particularly vile vandalism from the page history, but I don't think we should make a point to remove all of it. JP is right that the stuff will remain in the google cache anyway, in addition I think that its useful to have a record of serious vandalism so we know what current vandals have been up to in the past. I also think recording vandalism is useful to the article as well, it shows that (in this case anti-semitism and homophobia) do exist in today's world and that society doesn't find those POV acceptable. I don't think it serves the Jewish communities interests to simply erase all anti-semitic writings, I think its better to have a record of what the anti-semites have said and then three minutes later a record of someone deleting them as petty vandalism and not even worth three sentences on the talk page. This whole argument is an interesting reminder of just how far-reaching our actions on wikipedia are. A particular edit might only last three minutes before its reverted, but with the article linked on the main page several hundred (or thousand?) people might see that edit in those three minutes. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 15:17, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am sure I remember a case where <b>Jew</b> produced rascist sites on the Google search, then wikipedia <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_bomb.html" title="Google bomb">Google bombed</a> and got our site to number one, and if true we clearly have a positive history to be proud of in fighting rascism, etc (which I think we do). As Everyking says, we do our best, though I absolutely agree with Dragon flight about the rollback &amp; delete" button, and that a policy change for giving that to users with a certain number of edits is needed. Were they to try to sue wikipedia these people should be opposed on the moral grounds that it is an attempt to shut down wikipedia, open source collaboration and freedom on the internet. Weisenthal fought for freedom, and one wonders what he would think of people who want to take the majority of people's freedom to edit away because of the behaviour of a tiny minority. One does hope the person who photographed the wikipedia page had already removed the offending material, and weren't in fact merely looking for publicity for their cause. Almost every famous person who dies gets vandalised, and if you see someone famous has just died add them to your watchlist. Yet the interest these people generate by dying invariably transforms the article, which in almost cases is a fitting tribute which would be lost if such articles were protected in these post death moments. If we had locked <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_II_390d.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> (as a few people wanted) noone would have put Darth Vader pictures briefly in the article but the article itself would be considerably poorer than it is, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:12, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Screw them. I like how they discussed legal action with the paper before discussing it with Jimbo. That's always a nice indicator that they're lawsuit-happy, they want some publicity, nothing more. <i>Let me reiterate that - All they care about in this circumstance is getting publicity for their organization and words.</i> If they actually cared about getting the statements removed, they would have contacted the Wikimedia Foundation before contacting the press. (Note: It's possible I've missed some mention from someone that states that they did, in fact, contact our lawyers. If so, disregard this whole paragraph) The solution is simple - Tell these chaps that when they can get Google to remove antisemitic links and caches from its search engine, we will ponder doing the same. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 17:00, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can Wikipedia ever actually <i>do</i> anything? Like I said, all we are is a bunch of individual, independent editors.

<p>Jordan Capri was an adult movie actress. About a month ago, 2004-12-29T22:45Z (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User_talk%7E2004-12-29T22%7E45Z_f2c1.html" title="User talk:2004-12-29T22:45Z">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_2004-12-29T22%7E45Z_20c4.html" title="Special:Contributions/2004-12-29T22:45Z">contribs</a>) added detailed information on her real name, city of residence, places of employment, and present college. Such information as would be very useful to a stalker and which I consider to pose a legitimate personal risk to the individual in question. At present this information (except for real name) has been again removed from the article. (Please look at the history of the article for the information in question, I do not want to quote it here).</p>
<p>Maybe this information is accurate. It's cited source is what is identified as her blog. As of sometime yesterday all entries from the blog were removed, and as of this morning it seems that three have been restored, but there does not appear to be any verifiable personal information contained therein (except that she resides somewhere in Arizona). Even if verifiable and accurate, I'd still question whether the information 2004-12-29T22:45Z was appropriate.</p>
<p>2004-12-29T22:45Z has twice reverted when anons have attempted to remove this information. His justification is on the article's talk page. Now an individual claiming to be Jordan herself has shown up at the present AFD to say:</p>

<dd>I have been having issues recently with "fans" coming into my work. Just this past Monday someone came in asking for my autograph &amp; said he found me on THIS site. First of all, on my MySpace page, I never gave my last name away nor the engraving shop's name, because I did not want people to find out my real name. This is a serious issue; I could have potential salkers, rapists, ect. now!! What if some crazed fan comes in, waits for me to leave late at night, then follows me home!? Since I found this thing I've been scared to death! Please delete it for the sake of my safety not to mention potentionally being fired from my jobs from the flood of phone calls/visits I've been receiving there. I'm begging you, please take this down.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know if this is accurate, but it does strike me as entirely plausible.</p>
<p>I personally feel that the article should be kept, under the general view that most well-known porn stars can justifiably have articles, but I am raising it here because I would like to selectively delete all versions of the article containing the details 2004-12-29T22:45Z added, as I believe such information poses a legitimate danger to this woman and we should not keep any accessible version of it. From a GFDL standpoint, the present software allows anyone to look at the authorship (but not content) of deleted edits, so the names of everyone involved would be maintained, and I do not believe it poses a copyright problem. (If it does pose a copyright problem, I would be just as happy to simply delete everything since August 20th and start with the most recent version not having these issues.)</p>

<p>I had a look around and there are other issues with this kind of thing. Someone had put the alleged real name of <a href="../../../t/a/w/Tawnee_Stone_39af.html" title="Tawnee Stone">Tawnee Stone</a> (from the same website group as Jordon) in her article and that talk page. If we are going to be consistent that should probably get yanked from those places as well. Note also that the AfD on Jordon's page also has her alleged name (as allegedly posted by the model herself requesting the info be removed), since those are archived later it should probably be yanked from there somehow... but doesn't every instance of the history since then also have that info?

<p>Jordan Capri's porn career, even though it is over, is notable enough. The posting of her real name is not reason for deletion of the article - it's reason for removal of her real neal name from it. We don't have to ask notable people's permissions to write articles about them. But we <b>do</b> have a duty to protect this former porn star from possible stalkers. "Her real name is in her blog" is worthless as a reason for keeping the personal information in, as her blog doesn't mention Jordan Capri. People know Jordan Capri, and they know this woman. What they don't know is that they are the same person. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 13:10, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't really think that sentence is appropriate as the first line of an article, which was why I removed it (and was quickly reverted).

<p>The Tawnee Stone article has personal information which could endanger the girl, and ought to be purged for the same reasons as Ms. Capri's information was purged (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Jordon_Capri" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Jordon_Capri" rel="nofollow">the Jordan Capri incident report</a>). As with Ms. Capri, Ms. Stone has left the adult business and just wishes to put that part of her life behind her and not have to worry that some internet stalker will look her up in Wikipedia and show up at her work or home. For crying out loud, what does any of this belong in an encyclopedia for?!? <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurple_ec9a.html" title="User:Murple">--Murple</a></p>
<p>I think you are going over the top. There is no info that would identify her now. The article doesn't state her real name or her current address.

<p>It doesnt state her real name etc now because I editted them out. They're still in the past revisions as well as the discussion page.

<p>Hmm, not even sure that her real name needs to be removed, but certainly the scholl she went to would not help a stalker find her now.

<p>In it's present form Tawnee Stone's article is not an urgent disaster, so okay, let's pause and talk about this. In my opinion, these articles should not include <i>any</i> personal details about the real life actress. My opinion is based on the view that "Tawnee Stone" is not in fact a person, but rather a role created by the studio and marketing firm responsible for this persona. Certainly there are any number of fictional personas that are notable enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia, e.g. <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Solo_1c62.html" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a>. But unlike Star Wars, where the credits and marketing connect <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrison_Ford_f221.html" title="Harrison Ford">Harrison Ford</a> to the role, the adult entertainment industry goes to considerable lengths not to reveal the true identities of their entertainers. Generally, there is no verifiable link between someone like Tawnee and the actress that plays her. And, even if there is some obscure chain of reference that makes if verifiable, then we still shouldn't be drawing the connection as it is legitimately dangerous to these women. Without drawing a connection between their real world identity and their stage name, I can't see that there is any verifiable to say where she used to work or went to school. What's more, as these facts belong to the actress, and are not part of the persona of Tawnee, I would argue they don't belong in an article on Tawnee anyway. Of course, porn stars can choose to forgo their anonymity, but no one is making that case here. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 22:43, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The information in her article all seems to be flimsy anyway, pretty much "some dude on the internet who says he used to know her"... So even if there WERE some valid reason for it to belong on here, it's hardly solid verifiable information. The discussion page on the article has all sorts of info identifying various people as her brothers and identifying where they go to school... whether or not they are actually her brothers, that information should not be visible to the public. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurple_ec9a.html" title="User:Murple">--Murple</a></p>
<p>The problem is that there is no hard-and-fast rule on this sort of personal information. If there were a rule that an administrator could simply delete such information from both the page (or talk page) and the history, that would be fine - however, at the moment it all needs to go to here, and be discussed, and a big hoo-hah gone through before such deletions can be made. While I hold no particular brief for those who choose to sell their bodies for cash, I think that two important principles need to be respected here: 1) Wikipedia is not a rapist's directory; 2) Wikipedia is not in the business of haunting people with their childish mistakes. I'm still pretty new here, so I don't know how one goes about setting up/suggesting rules that would allow for speedy erasure by admins, so thought I'd bring it here. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 08:50, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a precedent, we have the real names of at least a few people who might prefer they were not public information, such as <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalie_Portman_22ce.html" title="Natalie Portman">Natalie Portman</a>. Is Portman's surname now a matter of public knowledge? <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pak</a><a href="../../../p/a/k/User_talk%7EPakaran_4352.html" title="User talk:Pakaran">aran</a> 18:52, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Considering the IMDB has that, and the IMDB has a lot more commercial oversight than we do, I'd say that one's kosher. The key is, most of these porn star names are collected by people who are either stalking or trying to stalk these girls, or simply by someone doing a tremendous amount of original research - Either way, not appropriate, and not necessary. Put another way - if they wanted their real names to be known, do you think we'd have to search some backwater porn chat forum to find out about it? If that's the only place we have to find their name, then it's not appropriate.

<p>Natalie Portman probably has significantly less chance of problems arising, as she can probably afford personal security. A college kid who made some judgement errors and got mixed up in porn probably doesn't have any real protection. There's also not much real chance that Natalie Portman's life will be ruined if people find out she's Natalie Portman. These porn girls, however, may want to put their past behind them and having this kind of crap being publicly linked to their real identities may cost them jobs, friends, etc. And the fact that the Tawnee Stone actress was not only exposed but had her (supposed) brothers exposed... that's a very bad precedent. I'd hate to think that there are some guys out there now being hassled with "dude I saw your sister having sex on the internet" because someone saw them in whats supposed to be an encyclopedia. In the case of Jordan Capri, the girl's family business was exposed and she was getting "fans" showing up and calling at the shop. Theres lots of different angles here, and we need a policy in place before something really bad happens to somebody. There's the risk that exposure gives to the lives and livelihoods of the girls in question. Theres the fact that much of the information is very flimsy (in the Tawnee Stone case, its basically some guy on an internet forum who says he knew her from an IHOP in his home town). There's the relevance issue in that saying what school some girl who played the role of Tawnee Stone or Jordan Capri went to so and so school is little better than tabloid gossip about semi-fictional people. There's also the question of do we want Wikipedia serving as a porn directory, which I dont think it should. At the very least, the private life details of these girls and their relatives ought to be purged from public view. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurple_ec9a.html" title="User:Murple">Murple</a> 19:08, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good call. I had previously blocked LevKamensky (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LevKamensky_fc02.html" title="Special:Contributions/LevKamensky">contribs</a>) for the duration of an AfD he was involved because of his disruptive behavior. The AfD was closed today and LevKamensky unblocked. It didn't take him very long to start vandalizing again by sticking AfD notices on a number of good articles. He seems to be unaware of the concept of lack of ownership of articles, or even basic concepts like Wikiquette. His campaign of harassment against Zoe has been particularly atrocious. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a><big><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">✍</a></big> 02:54, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And reply I shall. If I recall, the talk pages of articles were to discuss both personal opinions &amp; ways to expand &amp; improve their articles. My articles started off as helping towards the Helen Clark article, mainly by myself plainly stating the question; "Why has no one put on the article that Helen Clark stopped grace before meals". Shouldn't we, being part of the wonderful wikipedia, strive to post the full &amp; honest facts on its articles? It is after all an actual fact that she did infact stop grace before parliamentary meals. Or are we only going to include half facts on wikipedia? Would you find it appropriate if on a German site, that they ommitted the fact that Hitler killed over 6 million Jews? Absolutely not. As wikipedians, we should aim to post both negative &amp; positive facts on all articles, &amp; let people who have opinions on these talk freely on the talk pages. Just because I don't like the New Zealand Prime Minister, doesn't mean you have to delete my posts because you think differently. I wouldn't dream of deleting your posts because your opinion differed from mine. And if you think that people only use talk pages for discussing ways to improve articles, I would suggest you rethink this statement, because I have seen on many occasions, talk pages filled with personal views &amp; thoughts. I will glady retract my insulting comments towards the other users, (especially the Australian who thought he knew more about NZ politics than a NZer), &amp; if you ask of me, I will gladly send a personal letter of apology to him/her. But I utterly detest to my personal viewpoint, which I hold so dear, to be quashed &amp; undermined by being deleted. You could have handled it better too. For example, you could have just deleted the rude comments about Helen, but left the rest, as I spent much time typing those words. Plus, I like to write, as you call them, "Lengthy" posts. I don't know where this goes from here, but I'd like my posts returned (minus the rudeness), &amp; in return I will send apologies to the users I may have offended. Thank you for the chance at letting me having my say against this. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 10:18, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I would strongly encourage Spawn Man to review our policies on <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civility</a>, and note that it is never appropriate to call other editors 'Stewpid'. Spawn Man is more that welcome to dislike Helen Clark and to discuss criticisms of her on the article talk page. I would also suggest that Spawn Man review our article on <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_law.html" title="Godwin's law">Godwin's law</a>, and note that comparisons to Hitler almost never lend credibility to an argument. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 11:38, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I will not get involved in the discussion about what information an article about Helen Clark should or should not contain. I will only say this to Spawn Man: I find your comparing not mentioning Helen Clark stopping grace before parliamentary meals to not mentioning the Jews killed in the Holocaust totally abject, tasteless, irrelevant, not constructive, sickening and appalling, and any other negative adjective I can think of. Please learn to present your argumentation more decently. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> 16:14, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gosh, I was just making a comparison!! I never said I condoned what Hitler did. But my point <b>was</b> that you wouldn't like it if someone ommitted that information due to the fact that it was negative towards Hitler. But that was exactly the response I recieved: "<i>Why put that on there? Not only is it untrue, it is negative towards Helen Clark</i>", or somewhere along those lines. No need to get all puffed up over a comparison Aecis. My main objection is, is that you Gadfium, deleted my more factual posts about her, such as her depleting our air force etc, but left my more vulgar comments about her on there? You seem very inconsistant... I admit it got a bit out of control, but as I have said, &amp; will say many a time more, I dislike a person who assumes they know more about my country than myself. For an Australian to argue with matters of my government , presuming he is right, gets my blood boiling beyond belief. I wouldn't dream of arguing with matters of his government, assuming that I was right. I would expect the same response myself. If you gladly refer myself to a forum other than Helen Clark's talk page, on wikipedia, where I can freely rant on about Helen, I will send apologies to anyone that I have offended &amp; remove <b>all</b> my posts from her talk page. On further note, I will take all of your advice under careful advisement. I will apologise now if I've offended anyone about my Helen/Hitler comment; I certainly did not mean it in the way that some took it. I will also apologise if I have offended anyone over my comments on Helen Clark's talk page. I honestly thought that you could express your personal thoughts on the subject matter on there. Further more, if I have any more personal comments or thoughts to write on talk pages in the future, I will put them across in a more formal manner, as I agree with Ten of all trades, that Hitler comparisons will never further the argument (although, once again, I never meant it in the way some took it). Next time I will use Stalin or Amin, (that was a joke, just to lighten up the mood a bit). I would still like to be directed to a talk forum on wikipedia where I can rant on about Helen Clark without ramifications. I hope we can all come away from all this as friends, as I usually don't like to rock the boat too much. But as you may well have noticed, I go slightly mad when it comes to Helen Clark, a state further aggravated by her practically winning the elections. Well I'll stop writing now... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 23:06, 22 September 2005 (UTC) P.S.

<dl>
<dd>Since you agree your posts "got a bit out of control", why don't you try retrieving them from history, editing out the bits which are over the top, and putting them back on the talk page? I removed your posts rather than edit them because I thought that would be less offensive to you; editing someone else's talk page comments is generally not done on Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>There is no forum on Wikipedia where rants are welcome. This is not a forum, it's an encyclopedia, and the talk pages are places to assist its building. We are much more tolerant of rants on talk pages than in articles, but you went too far. We are more tolerent still of rants on one's own user page; I can't guarantee that anything you put on your own user page will stay there, but it would have to be pretty extreme before I removed it.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I suggest you get over any issues you have with non-New Zealanders contributing to articles on New Zealand politics. The articles are written for everyone, not just New Zealanders, and the extra perspective of editors from around the world improves them.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 00:11, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I think you misunderstood my point. I would love other editors from around the world to submit what ever they wish. I <b>do not</b> have a problem with <b>that</b>. My problem was the fact that he denied the fact that the new zealand parliament has parliamentary sit down meals, when however, I know for a fact, because I have visited parliament numerous times, that they do actually have meals together. That was my problem.</dd>
<dd>I find that my posts were removed completely more offensive than if you edited them somewhat. I read the rules, &amp; it says that you are allowed to edit posts if they are too over the top.</dd>
<dd>Another point, as I have said, most people do see the talk pages as an open forum to the article's subject. I recant on all the offensive stuff I may have used, but I will not on the fact of talk pages being used as personal talk forums. I would not talk about anything other than the article's subject matter on its talk pages. But I think both personal &amp; improving &amp; even critisizing posts should be allowed on talk pages. For example, personal view points can lead to other areas of thought, &amp; even enlighten other users to use their own opinions.</dd>
<dd>E.G. I hate food. <i>Why?</i> I don't like the taste of this food...etc. <i>Well that could be due to the acids in that food.</i> What acids? <i>Check out this page...etc.</i></dd>
<dd>But if someone, such as you, deleted the opening sentence "I hate food" for being unfounded, vauge &amp; useless, then this person would never know why he didn't like that type of food. Not to mention other people who saw it who had wondered the same thing &amp; were now enlightened about the food's taste.</dd>
<dd>E.G. I don't like Helen Clark. <i>Why not?</i> Because she's done this &amp; this &amp; this. <i>Well actually, this MP passed that bill &amp; etc etc....</i> Ok, now I know a bit more. <i>If you want any more answers, see my talk page.</i></dd>
<dd>Not only is more than one person more enlightened, but people who pass by the talk page may post their questions on that person's talk page. But of course, I shouldn't have used rude or attacking posts. But personal opinions could lead to a better place of thinking if left to blossom on their talk pages. Should by no means a post of food be left on Iraq's talk page, but rather should be directed to the food's talk page.</dd>
<dd>I have a few last questions. Why did you pull this disagreement onto this page, while you could have simply deleted my posts (or edited them) &amp; left a note of warning on my talk page? Secondly, where does this go from here? Do I get banned, exiled from the wikipedia community or get a warning etc? Does this stay on here forever? Do I get a strike? Basically, what happens after we've finished discussing things on here? <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 01:11, 23 September 2005 (UTC) P.S. I have rephrased my wording, so maybe it's more to <b>your</b> liking. If it still isn't up to your 'standards', then I will probably throw a taz in my chair &amp; cry like a big baby. (not actually). But I will be annoyed. But then again, it will be up to your standards because is isn't rude. So there...&#160;:)

<dd>I finished reading the history of this subject, and I agree with S.M. You didn't have to, as he calls it, "publicly humiliate" him. I find that quite a few talk pages have a lot of personal opinions, whether they help towards improving the article or not. I think you should be apologising to him, because this is his first time being pulled up for rude posts. But I agree with you Gadfium, his posts were borderlining extreme rudeness.

Now can we all be friends &amp; forget about this, cause I'm getting bored with all this beaurocratic chit chat.

<p>FWIW, to answer the original comment from Spawn Man, grace was stopped when New Zealand gained its first Moslem MP (IIRC Asif Choudhry) which coincided with Helen Clark becoming PM. In other words, it was done in order not to offend an MP from a non-Christian religion - not for reasons of Helen Clark's own beliefs. As such, it is completely irrelevant to the article. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 07:42, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></p>
