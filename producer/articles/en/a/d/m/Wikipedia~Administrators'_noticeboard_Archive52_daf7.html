<p>Jason Soroski is a regional artist in Southeast Texas, and I was approached to enter an article about him, as he is growing in interest here lately. When I heard the article no longer existed, and verifyid it myself, I was a bit confused. He is not a "national" act, but does deserve recognition to the local scene in Texas and Missouri. I am unaware as to whether anyone else edited the page but myself. Please let me know if this article can be restored. Thank you.</p>

<dd>I burned the links out <a href="../../../o/2/_/O2_plc.html" title="O2 plc">O2 plc</a> or <a href="../../../3/_/%28/3_%28telecommunications%29.html" title="3 (telecommunications)">3 (telecommunications)</a> by User:87.113.12.67 and User:87.114.10.152. I asked and mindspillage said he blacklisted <i>.at/aaoffers</i>, which is the common spam set for them. Spam of that nature is particularlly nasty because they're replacing real, legitimate links, with spam links without altering the link description, so that 'official site' links go to spam sites rather than the real ones. As for the IPs themselves, they're dynamic and the spammer is probably on a different IP by now. I have some doubts about an admin blocking it, as its a dynamic IP, and spam bots come and go, but at least some more spam has been flushed down the hole where it belongs. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 03:26, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

WillC put two messages on my talk page, quoted, “removing true information is not a valid edit.” And “STOP REVERTING MY EDITS FOR NO REASON; YOU ARE REMOVING TRUTHFUL, USEFUL INFORMATION.” And put a message on the wikiproject page saying “Burgerworldz: stop deleting information on the jobber page; you are deleting truthful information; stop this stupid revert war. i will contact an administrator. you at least need to justify your reverts with a valid explanation”. He has also put other inflammatory info about me on the talk page at the wikiproject, and has also included in his edit summaries: “don't edit comments i have left, violator” and “burgwerworldz is deleting/editing comments i have made on this page; he has no right or authority to do so.

<dd>Hi, thanks for the response. I was concerned with the addition of the tag to all of the space shuttles and space agencies. It can be a little misleading to have the tag on a shuttle that is not currently on or will soon be on a mission. With the space agencies, if the tag is needed now, then it will always be needed (until the agency goes defunct), and therefore, IMO, isn't appropriate because the "future" aspect of the subject is integral enough to the subject to not have an alert at the top of the page. Each space shuttle will have a time when it speculates on a future flight, but for most of them, that time is not yet, and for that reason the tag is miseading on those pages. If I am way off-base, let me know...it just seems that the tag (as most on WP) is being overused. Sorry for the rambling, and thanks for the imput, <b><a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewnam_d975.html" title="User:Newnam">Newnam</a><sup><a href="../../../n/e/w/User_talk%7ENewnam_f2ce.html" title="User talk:Newnam">(talk)</a></sup></b> 05:42, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The trend to use blocks more liberally has been here for a while and, generally, I view it as a good thing. When I came here, 3RR and ArbCom was about the only source of blocks. Wikipedia changed and the policies written originally became outdated. This is all fine and understandable. Admins now issue blocks at once when the bad-faith behavior seems obvious to them or even for other less clear-cut reason. Again, I don't object to this trend. With more and more editors involved in Wikipedia, the danger of loosing potential edits became of lesser priority but the benefit from preventing the disruption outweighs the cost. However, certain blocks alarm me and I request trigger-happy admins, as well as anyone interested to calmly consider the following case-studies below. Recently, four valuable editors have received some short and medium blocks: <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a> (<a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lysy_76c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lysy">contribs</a>), <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mikkalai_3580.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mikkalai">contribs</a>), <a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirlandajo</a> (<a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ghirlandajo_2c69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ghirlandajo">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotrus</a> (<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Piotrus_9160.html" title="Special:Contributions/Piotrus">contribs</a>).</p>
<p>The first user in the list (blocked now for 8 hours) have shown some clear head and good judgement despite his having rather strong views on the issues. The other three (each of them having their own issues no doubt) are WIkipedia's Golden Contributors, true treasures of Wikipedia by the amount of the exceptional quality content they add to it on the daily basis. Take out those three and perhaps 10 more people, and Wikipedia would lose about half of its value. Since, according to <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> the blocks of users with substantial history of valuable contributions are "always controversial", proper examination of these blocks should not be taken as an offense by the admins involved.</p>
<p>Let's have a quick look at these 4 block histories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a> (<a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lysy_76c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lysy">contribs</a>) was involved in the edit war today over <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erika_Steinbach_7678.html" title="Erika Steinbach">Erika Steinbach</a> article.

Lysy was assisted by <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">user:Halibutt</a> who reverted once, thus getting an advantage in the revert war. Lysy <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:Donnog_reported_by_User:Lysy_.28Result:_8h_each.29" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">reported the violation to 3RR board</a> and following which <span class="plainlinks"><tt class="userlinks"><a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a></tt> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stifle_de53.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stifle">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">blocks</font></a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_protect_c66b.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_protect_c66b.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">protects</font></a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_delete_f5f8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_delete_f5f8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">deletions</font></a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_move_02c8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_move_02c8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">moves</font></a>)</span> (status held since March 2006) blocked <i>both</i> for 8 hours. Lysy, now grossly offended, requests an apology and the one doesn't seem coming. Lysy is obviously aggravated. The polite warning to him would have certainly have the effect without aggravation.</li>

A word needs to be said about Ghirla. For his contributions see his userpage. His value of one of the most knowledgeable, dedicated and prolific editor is unquestionable. At the same time, the user is often rather opinionated and, at times, even rude. His immense positive impact overall is no excuse for the occasionally short temper, which I am pointing out myself before someone comes here and starts to deflect the discussion into the civility issues. I do acknowledge them. Now, back to the issue. Following the edit conflict, and a unnecessary harsh reaction of Ghirla (which I don't condone) to the meaningless (IMO) edit of <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> (<a href="../../../c/i/r/User_talk%7ECirceus_2b29.html" title="User talk:Circeus">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Circeus_c405.html" title="Special:Contributions/Circeus">contribs</a>), the latter places a "template:Civil" warning to Ghirla's talk. Now, this action is easy to perceive a provocation. The patronizing templates like "test", "vand", "civil" were not intended to be used to communicate to anyone but the newbies. Furious Ghirla responded by calling the template placement "trollish" and Circeus who feels offended responds with a block(!). An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ghirlandajo&amp;oldid=62622335#civility" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ghirlandajo&amp;oldid=62622335#civility" rel="nofollow">angry dialog</a> ensues and more is said at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;oldid=62648515#Third_opinion_please" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;oldid=62648515#Third_opinion_please" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

It is also notable that Circeus, like the admins above, is a relative newbie, who said himself on this matter "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Briangotts&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62603026" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Briangotts&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62603026" rel="nofollow">It's mostly that I haven't been doing much user-related stuff since becoming an admin, so I preferred to get some guidances</a>".

However, the admin did not bother to check what was going on, to see that a conflicting party was an obvious sock, something he must have done when dealing with an editor like Piotrus. Also, why was a polite warning not sufficient?</li>
<li>A little different case, but on the same topic. In April <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Bonaparte</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../b/o/n/User_talk%7EBonaparte_ba39.html" title="User talk:Bonaparte">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bonaparte_0181.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bonaparte">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Bonaparte_d7b9.html" title="Special:Blockip/Bonaparte">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>), who though blocked, keeps returning through new open proxies and sockpuppets, produced a false report on myself alleging a 3RR violation at <a href="../../../u/p/r/Uprising_of_Khotin_9f06.html" title="Uprising of Khotin">Uprising of Khotin</a>. Those 4 edits he produced where not within a 24 hour time frame to begin with, of those only two were reverts, and reverts were not about the content dispute, but on the POV-tag the sock was reinserting to a well sourced article refusing to give a required by the tag explanation at talk. A detailed analysis is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2F3RR&amp;diff=49369906&amp;oldid=49368853" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2F3RR&amp;diff=49369906&amp;oldid=49368853" rel="nofollow">here</a> but the overall issue is similar. There were plenty of red flags to give a complaint a detailed analysis (submitted by a non-use IP accountr, time stamps in complaint missing, etc) and still the analysis was not done.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could see how nice it could feel to decide who to punish and who to spare, but getting into judging the issues requires an utmost responsible and careful approach. Studying the matter carefully instead of making a hasty decision should be a must. Yes, people are busy, but no one requires from any admin to frequently check WP:3R and WP:ANI and impose blocks on the problem users. If one doesn't have time to do it with care, better not do it. There are plenty of other admins. If one takes upon himself to enforce the rules whose misapplication is emotionally sensitive to the editors involved, he should take an extra time to study the matter. We've seen the aggravation of some very respected editors for being illegitimately blocked or chastised on the sock/troll provocation or by the conflict co-participant or otherwise inappropriately when the blocking Admin didn't care to study the matter or was too eager to exercise the powers, or lost his temper or because those powers were newfound or because they were acquired too long ago to remember about the responsibilities that come with them.</p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. To summarize, I do not advocate any special treatment for anyone just because of his past contributions. Violators should be punished. I also do not advocate the return to softer treatment times. Blocks by judgement are necessary. However, no block should be issued in haste or when someone's own head is hot. Such a common sense rule as studying the matter, especially when the user is established enough to be sure he knew what he was doing (perhaps there were reasons), is no less necessary as before when the blocks were more rare. I submit these thoughts hoping they would help to decrease an amount of future aggravations for all of us. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 06:14, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would like to add that a day or two after posting this, Irpen was blocked himself for the first time during his long stay in Wikipedia, evidently as a punishment for Irpen's having started this thread. Another typical case of a controversial block, which should not be undertaken without proper consideration, as per blocking policy. After such a long stay in WP Irpen is getting blocked for the first time... for what?.. has he violated 3RR? nope, his edits were not even reverts, strictly speaking. He just did not care to get adminship early enough and now he will be blocked at whim. I suggest all prolific contributors on Eastern European topics should leave this project to the mercy of trolls, nationalists, rogue admins, and Polish Cabal.

<dd>Indeed. I have unblocked Lysy, but it is mostly a symbolic gesture as his block was about to expire anyway. I do not think he deserved this block anyway. In the other three cases the blocks have expired, so now we have to mend the hurt feelings of the extremely productive users. People who work more on Wikipedia then on their paid jobs see us, admins, as the people who owe them some gratitude and respect, it is worth to spend a few more minutes before taking an administrative action if we can make solve a problem in a more respectful way. It is easier say than done, obviously ( I am afraid I am guilty in a harsh 3RR block as well), but lets try. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 06:45, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that many young admins are too trigger-happy and prefer to exercise their tools on those who have lots more wikiexperience than themselves, rather than focus on vandals and trolls. I believe Ronline, when blocking Mikka back in December, felt like one of those rogue referees at the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Cup_64e7.html" title="World Cup">World Cup</a>, hoping to assert his authority by handing our a red card to Zidane. Too many admins think that blocking the most prolific editors around is great fun. Unfortunately, there is no working mechanism to stop their antics. And never will be, as long as lack of responsibility is in the interest of other admins. When I pointed out to these concerns following Mikka's block half a year ago, there followed <a href="../../../a/a/p/WP%7EAAP_7ffe.html" title="WP:AAP">WP:AAP</a>, and that's where the matter ended, as best I know. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 15:49, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I will make one comment on factual matters, that is that <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a> requested an apology on my talk page fifteen minutes ago, and this was the very first I had heard of it so could not be expected to make one by the time of this post. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 21:34, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>After consideration, I wish to observe that blocking Lysy did not serve a useful purpose and was incorrect on my behalf. However, I remain on record as saying that he revert warred. I also wish to note that Alex Bakharev neglected to consult or even notify me about unblocking Lysy. For now, though, everything is at its desired state. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 21:43, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Since Stifle wished to mention here that I've requested an apology on his talk page late and that Alex Bakharev neglected to consult him for unblocking me, I think it should be also noted that I've suggested an apology would be desired immediately in my unblock request while Stifle apparently was busy with other edits. I've also sent him an email asking to have another look at the case. Yet Stifle had chosen to ignore both my unblock request and my email. I could not have written in his talk page as I've been blocked at the time. I had also not emailed any other admin but the one who had blocked me. Alex Bakharev's unblock was more an act of courtesy than anything else, as I had the last hour of my block time left. I believe he could not consult Stifle at that time, as he was unavailable then. All this said, I too think that everything is at its desired state now and consider this case closed. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 06:50, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Your block of Lysy is only a part of the problem. Pity, there is little interest to what I wrote from others and little feedback. If others don't see the need to avoid aggravating valuable editors <i>unnecessarily</i> by acting hastily and enjoy feeling great by deciding whom to spare and whom to punish without due care, we will be loosing editors that we could have kept. So be it if others don't see the problem caused by simply lack of due diligence in disposing of admin duties that has so sensitive consequence. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 04:35, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, come on, you found a wrong page to raise the issue. Do you seriously think that any admin will discuss the problem of admin's responsibility? Don't be naive. Rogue admins block content creators because they know that no punishment or investigation will ensue. As I said many times, there is no such thing as admin's responsibility in this project. No defrocking procedures, nothing at all. It's clear from the above summary that admins, who were given tools to counter vandals and trolls, increasingly turn them towards some of the most prolific content creators, while the others either connive or don't care. As all the above blocks are clearly in violation of the Blocking policy (see "Controversial blocks" section), they not only expose the ignorance of blocking admins in WP guidelines but also should be subjected to a detailed scrutiny in separate RfCs, not here. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 14:46, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ghirla is probably right about, nothing coming of this, at least not on this page. Nevertheless, better that the idea goes "on record", at this time.

<p>It's a nice summary of a problem. I probably would be harsher in describing Ghira's behaviour but then I am not objective here so I won't&#160;:) So back to the main issue: what to do? I'd suggest introducing some rule (or guideline) that when considering blocking an experienced contributor (how do we define experienced?) admin should consider warning the user instead. On the other hand, there are users who are known to completly disregard warnings, and for those, I am afraid blocking maybe the only 'shock' strong enough to make them more cooperative. Nonetheless I'd suggest that when in doubt, admin should warn the party (parties) involve, if he sees they are composed of experienced editors. Block should be the last resort, talk should always be first.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 02:20, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>First of all, before even warning, double check! Maybe there is a good reason. Actually, always double check and when dealing with Piotrus, Mikka, Ghirla or alike tripple check. There is likely a reason for what you see since these users know policies. Second, do warn, unless you are crystal clear that the block is deserved. When in slightest doubt talk first and ask at WP:ANI. Third, never use admin tools or even admin clout in the edit conlict you are involved. If block of the edit conflict opponent in the conflict is warranted, use <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 02:33, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Lysy, exactly because experienced users usually know that they violate 3RR it is worthwhile to check that maybe there are reasons for it. For instance, they are dealing with a sock or a vandal or a sneaky vandal/sock whose account looks like a newbie's one but who apparently knows how to quickly submit a 3RR report, like the one who caused Piotrus' block or the one that caused the first Mikka's block and who managed to get myself "warned" by William who did not bother to check at that time.</p>
<p>Piotrus, I find your using even this very page to continue your anti-Ghirla crusade totally appalling, I am sorry. You may be happy though, since he indeed have left, at least for now. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 02:22, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Irpen, I think I should point out that the term like 'anti-Ghirla crusade' maybe considered a personal attack, as it creates an impression I am making remaks designed to hurt or otherwise attack Ghirla - although I am sure you didn't mean it it that way. As you have started this thread, and lumped together me, Halibutt and Mikka with Ghirla, I thought I would point out that not all cases are as similar as you make them out to be. I will not comment on my case, and I agree with your use of Halibutt and Mikka's cases to illustrate the problems with some blocks, but in case of Ghirla, I am afraid his block was long, long overdue. Still, I would much prefer the outcome that sees Ghirla educated in wikiquette and such, back here, and building encyclopedia with us then scenario involving him not being here. However, the current scenario of him being here, creating valuable content while being impolite, biting newbies, calling estabilished users trolls, engaging in revert wars and generally creating an unfriendly working atmoshere left much to be desired. Whether it is better to have an uncivil but prolific editor, or not have him at all, is a complex matter, but I think all can agree that the best outcome would be to have a civil and prolific editor. Hopefully where years of carrots and appeasment in form of talking have not worked, some ban-sticks may yet yeld that desired effect.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 06:01, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with 172 and could not help but point out that this exchange of spats here was started by Piotrus who carried his grudge against Ghirla even to this thread which is about a totally unrelated matter: what an admin should do when an editor like those two seems to be deserving a block.</p>
<p>As for the issue itself, I already suggested the answer: <b>do block, but not without a thorough investigation</b>, because perhaps, what may seem like a block-deserving behavior may turn out to be a legitimate dealing with a sock, vandal, troll or <a href="../../../b/r/d/WP%7EBRD_8e65.html" title="WP:BRD">WP:BRD</a>. I would like to point out that Piotrus, along with several other valuable content creators, is frequently my opponent over various article's. Many times we went through <a href="../../../b/r/d/WP%7EBRD_8e65.html" title="WP:BRD">WP:BRD</a>-type development, and when this was going on, the discussions at talk pages were intense but the articles were edited intensely too. Never did I go back to check the article's history to find out whether Piotrus or Halibutt or Balcer (or myself) produced anything that may be suitable for <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> report because I would never try this on those editors and I was sure no one of the users above would try doing this to me. If, however, an uninvolved admin would have just reigned in with a bunch of blocks, instead of looking more carefully at the matter, it would have been utterly useless for the article and utterly harmful for the editors involved. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 02:06, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is against the rules to delete a 3RR review request - if Nlu felt justified, the issue should have been addressed, not deleted.

<li>Exactly, no.

<dd>I appreciate Jeffrey Gustafson sharing his concerns; that is the correct action, of course. However, I agree with the others that I don't feel any further action is necessary. I believe following the spirit of our policies is far more important than following the letter; they are not laws which we must abide by (nor is the lack of a policy automatically make an action acceptable). I think this is just one of the areas we use our judgment; I've been aware of Heidi and Joe's shared account for quite some time now (and I consider them wiki-friends), but I am quite comfortable in my assessment that community opinion would favor their continuing. I don't really see how GFDL could be a concern if we allow edits from unregistered users. Of course, I'd be unlikely to support a shared account gaining access to administrator privileges. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 07:55, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with the support for Hydnjo. A husband providing all the keyboarding for himself and a legally-blind wife who would have some difficulty keyboarding otherwise is a very different situation from a dozen employees using an account to edit an article on their company (for example). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 17:39, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see absolutely no problem with this account. Everything posted to Wikipedia from that account is posted by Joe. As I see it, he (they?) chose the name Hydnjo to emphasize the sharedness of their thoughts, since Heidi is blind and cannot post messages herself. It's not as if Heidi logs on on Monday and Joe on Tuesday. Nor do I think that Joe types his own posts on one occasion and has Heidi dictate to him what to say on another. As far as I know, every use of first person singular referred to Joe, but he used the username to acknowledge the influence she has on his thoughts. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 22:45, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_ae0f.html" title="User talk:Jeffrey O. Gustafson">Jeffrey O. Gustafson</a> who initiated this block request I ask why? We have had no interaction until now so how do you come to this requested action at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>? Did you come across my account during your own research or are you acting as a proxy for another admin/user with whom I've caused to be angry with me? In reviewing your contributions I see no such "letter of the law" before now and so I feel singled out by you and I have no clue as to why - that to me is most disturbing. If you've come to this action on your own then should I be always wary of another admin challenging the legitimacy of my account?<br /></p>
<p>For <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> who advised me not to worry and <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick</a> who made me laugh I give special thanks, you've helped me to not take this so personally. And to <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_ae0f.html" title="User talk:Jeffrey O. Gustafson">Jeff</a>, thanks for being courteous in informing me of your action and for letting me feel that your heart wasn't for blocking me.<br />
Except for my one explanation above, I haven't edited for a few days now so as to allow y'all to comment about this based on my history of contribution rather than my reaction to it.<br /></p>
<p>I wanted to say all of this before it all goes to archive heaven. I still have a lingering concern that this may arise again and don't want to go through WP life looking over my shoulder or worrying that I might piss-off some admin and cause another inquiry about the legitimacy of my account. If any of you who have been so gracious as to take the time to support me here have any suggestions to prevent such an action, please drop your thoughts on my talk or by email.<br /></p>
<p>Finally, on a personal note to all, I never ever expected so much supportive response from all of you. I know that I've been moody at times and have spoken in ways that I have regretted the next day. I hoped otherwise but it seemed that those unfortunate responses might end up being my legacy as they were the foremost in my mind. And so far as this being a "role account", I think that I'll let the descriptions of <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember">NoSeptember</a> (both above) stand as the most intuitive descriptions of this account.

<p><b>addendum:</b> Jeff, I was confused at the outset in that I wasn't aware of the "role account" policy and then after becoming aware I was frustrated that I had made so many edits which could mislead someone to the conclusion that my account was a role account. I'm sorry that in my zeal to understand your actions that I posed the possibility that you were acting at someone else's behest. I have no evidence of that and it was improper of me to even mention that such a bizarre conspiracy was possible. I find myself guilty of "blaming the messenger" and posting an inappropriate comment about your motivation.<br /></p>
<p>As for my account, I want to state that it is not a role account and I apologize for leaving the impression that it is one. "<b>hydnjo</b>" is the signature that I commonly use for much of my correspondence and thought it to be appropriate when I first started my WP account. The portmanteau is an acknowledgment of our shared existence and not an indication that Heidi and I share in editing at WP.<br /></p>
<p>I thank you for your courtesy in informing me at the outset of the discussion at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> and for your compliments about my contributions. The comments in my response were made in the shadow of my own frustration with my having left a trail of edits that could easily be construed as having come from either Heidi or myself. I sincerely apologize to you for making any suggestion as to your motivation in bringing up a legitimate policy question. You have a genuine concern for the orderly behavior of our editors and I thank you for initiating this discussion and providing me the opportunity to explain the nature of my account. --<a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/User_talk%7EHydnjo_4abf.html" title="User talk:Hydnjo">talk</a> 18:49, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was my block. I have removed it now. Frankly I was impressed by the amount of vandalism from this particular IP and by a complete absence of productive edits. Still assuming that allocation of IPs by AOL is not completely random and that the number of determined vandals using AOL as an open proxy is low, then long blocks on a few AOL IPs would significantly reduce the amount of vandalism from there.

<dd>Um.. no. Peter and Thomas are common names, the name "Anti-christ", is not. I think that Christ is just a big a "character" as you said as God, Allah, Jehovah or Buddah. Point is, Christ, and being anti-, could offend editors religious beliefs as could saying being anti-god, anti-buddah, etc. and policy says username blocks can be applyed to said names. At the least, he should be encouraged to change his username. — <span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva"><a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#CD2626">The King of Kings</font></a></span> 21:26 July 16 '06</dd>

<dd>The user name is wholly inappropriate.

Both users are quite consciously flouting the letter while disingenously arguing no intent to flout the spirit of the rule. Both the letter and spirit of the rule are to avoid user names that a large proportion of readers are likely to take as a religious allusion, either positively or negatively. All we need is an accumulation of names chosen to press others' buttons! I really doubt the veracity of those who claim that they are unaware of the religious connotation but who <i>don't</i> cheerfully say "oops, didn't mean that, i'll pick a name that doesn't annoy people" when it is pointed out. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 03:20, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course I "bothered to read" your comment. Your "I didn't intend it as a religious reference" defense was exactly what I was referring to. There is no point asking people not to use a certain class of username if the user can say "oh I wasn't referring to <i>that</i> Mohammed" or <i>that</i> banned user. I, and this policy, don't really care what you had in mind, if to a large proportion of our readers it immediately conjures a holy or an unholy or a politically offensive name. If it was chosen in good faith and you didn't intend the religious allusion, then why not actually prove the good faith by changing it? If you really don't understand what your username means to most of us, just google "king of kings" and see what more than 90% of the hits refer to. So we either have a policy of asking people not to choose religious names, or misleading names, or banned names, or politically offensive names, or names that immediately suggest any of those to most of our readers, or we don't. But it makes no sense to have a policy that can be evaded by saying "mohammed really refers to the name of my neighbors' iguana". I don't really care whether you keep it or not, but the hypocrisy when you supported the policy against another username made comment irresistible. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 02:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I think your <a href="../../../a/f/g/WP%7EAFG_0e2c.html" title="WP:AFG">assume good faith</a> switch has been disengaged. You and the policy don't care? I do believe it's just you that doesn't care. In good faith, I would and have asked everyone who had a problem with it to ignore it, and if you really had a problem with it, I would refractor on <i>their</i> talk page if I chose to comment there. I think changing my signature would only prove that I was pressured and bullied into something I didn't want to do, in which I won't change. I won't change my signature because of a Motorhead reference, if you don't like it, I ask you to look the other way because policy doesn't say anything about not making a reference to a song. 90% of the google results show that King of Kings probably refers to the religious reference because it's been around since BC times. The song I make reference to has been popular since March of this year. Theres a few <s>hundred</s> thousand years differance between our topics. The "Mohammed the iguana" comment you made was a little irrelevant, eh? Mohammed the iguana doesn't have an article on Wikipedia, but does the topic in which my <i>signature</i> is based upon? Yes there is an article. The "song reference" isn't something I just pulled out my ass. Its a popular song by a popular band, so live with it.

<dd>Wow. Do you do realize, Moe, that fighting fire with fire doesn't actually put that first fire out? Alteripse is, to some degree, correct. Your name is not <i>as</i> inappropriate as Antichrist's, but the correlation is nothing short of ironic. However, the name Muhammad is not even close to comprable to what we have here. Muhammad is a very popular name (the most popular in the world) and so signing up as Muhammad (which, by the way, no one has done) is not necessarily an insult to Islam (unless the editor is making anti-Islamic statements). Likewise, having the username "Jesus" does not necessarily warrant a block either since it's a popular name (note <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesus_1c05.html" title="User:Jesus">User:Jesus</a> is not indefinitely blocked, or is that in error?). But Buddha, Allah, God, <s>Antichrist</s>... those are almost <i>always</i> religious references and so, based on the policy and the idea that they may offend easily, they should not be allowed. On "King of Kings", I think it wouldn't be a bad idea for Moe to change it, but I'm not going to make a fuss over it; the song it actually refers to, as far as I know, does not make religious references and the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Kings_eae7.html" title="King of Kings">King of Kings</a> article takes awhile to get to the religious references. Regarding the idea Alteripse tried to convey with the iguana example, I agree that we can't just allow people to say "oh I wasn't referring to <i>that</i> [insert religious figure here]", but I think we need to look at each instance individually and try to discern the intention of the user in question. Having a song by the same name does not automatically make a username okay. Yes, there is a song entitled "King of Kings". But there is also a song entitled "God", but "God" is certainly not a reasonable username. -- <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturn</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">r</a> 04:43, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Irreguardless of "King of Kings" being inflammatory or not (not even a username in this case even), "Antichrist has come to mean a person, image of a person, or other entity that is the embodiment of evil and utterly opposed to truth".

<dd>You are again pointing at the trees. The question is whether this particular user name is inappropriate. It is. Arguing by analogy for precedent won't do much good for the conversation. The analogy is invalid as precedent in this case because one can be "a" false prophet, whereas there is only "the" antichrist. Anyone who pretends to be speaking for God and isn't is a false prophet, and the world is and has always been lousy with them. On the other hand, being the antichrist is specifically to claim to be or speak for the son of Satan. It's an entirely different world. One is silly, and the other is infuriating to fundamentalist Christians. Still, we needn't argue by analogy at all. There is one question here: is this an invalid username?

As I've posted there, the article's current title of "Battle of Deir Yassin" violates <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conflict_12e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conflict">Wikipedia:Naming conflict</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> (it's a novel term with negligible use outside Wikipedia - only 81 hits versus over 21,000 for the alternative "Deir Yassin massacre"). It also probably violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a>, as it seems to be a novel and minority-POV term for an historical incident which is generally known by a different name. (It's comparable, for instance, to renaming <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> to "Battle of Srebrenica" or <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_War_of_Independence_edf0.html" title="American War of Independence">American War of Independence</a> to "War of American Aggression".)</p>
<p>In the light of these issues I would normally simply move the article myself. However, the page has already had a move war today and sparking another wouldn't be helpful. Ordinarily, a move poll would be a good alternative. However, there has already been a move poll in which the participants deadlocked, with many on both sides explicitly stating POV reasons for their votes (see <a href="../../../d/e/i/Talk%7EDeir_Yassin_massacre_28e8.html#Clarification" title="Talk:Deir Yassin massacre">Talk:Deir Yassin massacre#Clarification</a>). There seems to have been relatively little consideration of what Wikipedia policy and guidelines require. Starting a new move poll would undoubtedly bring out the POV warriors again and, unfortunately, it's more than likely that they will again ignore policy and vote for their personal POVs.

<dd>Although formal mediation isn't binding, I think most editors would respect the conclusions of it.

<dd>The quick and dirty method is to attract as many uninvolved editors as quickly as possible, because POV warriors work by fighting in packs and outnumbering their opponents. But polls like that are almost always confrontational, so it would be better to try some form of mediation (formal or informal) as Kim suggested. Even if it fails then it's something to show to other users who can determine for themselves what caused it to fail, if it's because someone wasn't cooperating then that will be detrimental to them. A good first step would be to do a survey of the academic literature to see what name is more commonly used, Google is unlikely to settle this one. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 01:01, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the suggestion. I've done a quick check on the literature using Google Books/Google Scholar, Amazon's "search inside" feature and a number of encyclopedias on Xreferplus. It almost exclusively refers to the events at Deir Yassin as the "Deir Yassin massacre", the massacre at Deir Yassin and similar formulations. None use "Battle of Deir Yassin". So it seems plain enough that the article's current title is a novel term. The problem is, of course, that the POV warriors <i>don't care</i> about WP:NOR, WP:NC and all the rest. Mediation is certainly appropriate though I wonder if it's ever likely to work in a situation where the participants are riding roughshod over Wikipedia's fundamental policies. I suspect it'll probably end up in arbitration, one way or another. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 07:38, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As an experienced mediator, Kim is likely picking up on the fact that you are in too big of a hurry to settle the dispute. Having an article in the The Wrong Version is going to happen for some of the parties in the dispute. Mediators (and experienced editors) need to reinforce the idea that Wikipedia is not going to be ruined by having an article in the The Wrong Version. IMO, mediation goes astray once you began reverting or making moves based on the idea that there is a wrong version.

<dd>(edit conflict) It has to go. He's got good edits, but not a good user name.

The word Iron is clearly not offensive, is the word Khan? We are surely not objecting to Kierkegaard right, so we must be objecting to the word Iron, I guess. Tyrenius reminds me of tyrant, how do I know that wasn't part of your thought process when choosing it? <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homie.html" title="Homie">Homey</a> is an offensive term in Australian, so I hope if you push this through, you'll be changing your signature, Homeontherange? What is Gwernol was an ax murderer from China that I haven't heard of. What it Gwern was? I agree that the Iron Guard were a hateful bunch of murdering fascists.

<dd>I can put your mind at rest by reassuring you that the word Tyrant was not part of my thought process, when choosing my user namer, nor for that matter were the words Tyre or Rant, ahem, nor has anybody commented to this effect previously. I think if the Australian offensiveness of Homey had been pointed out at an early stage, then it probably would have been changed.

<dd>For one thing "Irongaard" sounds exactly like "Iron Guard" so a more accurage analogy would be say GenghisCahn for the Mongolian leader and American actor Edward Cahn. As for the offensiveness of Genghis Khan, for it to be an accurate analogy we'll have to wait about 1000 years - AFAIK none of Genghis victims or their children are still alive.

<dd>I think it's pretty clear cut. Its not the terms iron or Kierkegaard that's offensive, it's the combination of those names with clear intent to invoke the term Iron Guard. The fact that the words standing alone don't have offensive meanings is not relevant, just as writing out the alphabet doesn't imply all the offensive things I could use those letters to make. We can surmise about whether the motivation for Tyrenius' username comes from tyrant (not that tyrant is clearly objectionable in the same way); and we can note that many word may have offensive meaning in another language, but here we <i>know</i> specifically that the name is a play on Iron Guard from the horses mouth.

<dd>Well if mens rea is everything, then that would imply: a) users should only be offended if they read Irongaard's userpage and find out he meant to invoke Iron Guard, and: b) given that his intention appears to be historical rather than supportive we have to be careful what we read into it. However, I do agree with Homeontherange's latest point about recency. I think we should ask Irongaard to voluntarily change his username. This seems like a situation where politely pointing out the issues and asking him to change will yield better results than imposing a decision. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 11:46, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I misspoke then. The letter of the naming policy doesn't require intent. Names can be offensive to users regardless of intent. But only in the case of a user who can claim that the name is coincidental does there seem to be any argument that the policy <i>should be excepted</i>. A person whose name was actually aid-off-hittiteler (cruel, insane parents) probably still should not be able to use that username, but would have no excuse if he indicated that his name was based on a fascination with the hittites and nazi Germany (even if he wasn't a nazi sympathizer) and the name was meant as a play on Adolph Hitler. The name alone brings him within the letter of the naming policy prohibition; the admission that it's intentional destroys any excuse that "it has nothing to do with the offensive thing it sounds like" argument.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 12:29, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've asked him to remove his offensive statement, and he's declined. I am reluctant to block him given that he has given us some positive contributions, but agree wholeheartedly that the username must change, and feel strongly that his intent to keep that material on his userpage is unacceptable here. For these reasons, I'm applying an indefinite block on the user and blanking his userpage.

<li>That's not to say there isn't a silver lining, if an AOL range stays blocked, and account creation stays disabled for the duration (<i>hours, days, weeks</i>) it does prevent people from creating accounts, and of course, prevents them from triggering autoblocks, but that's pretty much only a good solution for people who had accounts prior to the existance of anon-only-blocks--<a href="../../../a/o/l/User%7EAOL_user_d3be.html" title="User:AOL user">AOL user</a> 11:54, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I had thought, when this innovation came along, that it wouldn't be a substantial benefit to AOL users, because most of the vandals (probably "most") are using named accounts. However, our IP editors of virtue from AOL (recognize them? they're the ones you <i>don't see</i> because they're helping us along) are going to get blasted anyway. If they tire of being IP's and want to sign up to get the benefits of this innovation, they're going to find that they can't. As for Sam Blanning's recommendation, let's stop with tarring an ISP this large because some of the users are dufuses. We don't do that with other ISP's, and we shouldn't do it here. Saying, "Well, they can just move to another town and buy new equipment and change ISP's" (not what Sam said exactly) is to say, essentially, "We are for the elites." I'm no longer an AOL ISP-owned dialup, but the fact is that the turds vandalizing us are getting their way by getting us to block the helpful with them. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:09, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't understand why not simply uncheck the box next to "prevent creation of new accounts"? The indef block should be used to prevent anonymous vandalism only, if anyone wants to create an account or log into an existing account, that should still be possible.

<dd>It's not soft. You can't edit through it. If a new editor comes across a comma needing fixing, they'll possibly not bother because to go through the registration process (they won't be likely to click the link to see how easy it is) is much more work than the comma-fix itself. Don't kid yourself that any block is at all "soft". It just doesn't affect some people at all; it's as hard as ever on those it hits, and harder still if account creation is blocked also. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 21:31, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm thinking of the interests of registered users only. How does this form of blocking negatively affect registered users? I see only the upside. Whereas in the past, registered users, even admins, who edited from shared IPs, would find themselves autoblocked because of a vandal using the same IP, now it is possible for registered users to continue editing even if the IP is blocked. Isn't this a vast improvement? Honestly, I'm willing to sacrifice the occasional anonymous comma fix in order to prevent massive amounts of anonymous vandalism. Requiring registration from some (by no means all!) users is really not that big a deal. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 05:57, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. Please Sceptre, don't look to get desysopped, you're a good admin IMO. If something really questionable is brought up, theres other ways to dispute resolution than a desysopping.

<dd>No, I'm not joking. He's already suggesting not being an admin anymore which is "down" enough for me. You were blocked by him for 15 minutes, a fairly short time. Although blocks should be a last resort, to him, he had a legitimate reason when doing so and wasn't misusing admin powers when doing it. If you had a problem with your 15 minute block, I suggest taking it to an RFC rather than suggest a desysopping. Desysopping is't exactly something that happens over little matters like this. — <span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva"><a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#CD2626">The King of Kings</font></a></span> 20:34 July 18 '06

<dd>The block would have been correct if I had been actively vandalizing his user page directly (and not his actual vandalism page). Are you familiar with the "blocks are not punative" clause of the blocking policy? If you were then you'd know that regardless of wether or not my "vandalism" was bad faith or not (and I assure you it was not) blocking was wrong. Blocks are not to be handed out lightly particularly as they stay in one's record permanently. Again, short of an apology I'm inclined to agree with those who're talking about de-admining. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 21:00, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I am familiar with policy as I stated it should be a last resort, which I was refering to the same policy that states blocks shouldn't be a punishment. He had a reason, and it wasn't for punishment. I would like for you to look, at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Evilphoenix" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Evilphoenix" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. This is the block log of admin Evilphoenix. He has only had one block and it was a 17 second block by Titoxd. I think that situation is very similar to yours, except he had a clean block log and yours was already to say the least, very unclean. I suggest you did what Evilphoenix did and deal with it. It was a month ago, let it go.

<dd>Re:"<i>Just look at Sean Black's RFA ... once you've been an admin for awhile you collect enough random enemies who will come out of the woodwork to oppose</i>" I opposed and i would not call my self an enemy. We had barely intereacted. I did look at his record though. The fact is that whenever you run for an RfA you are seen by a new set of eyes and by people with a different set of criteria. Personally, i would not rerun for admin. Many who vote do not give great feed back and certainly it gives the trolls a great chance to cause havoc. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 20:38, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm sure Cyde was not implying that all of the opposes on that particular RfA are enemies, merely that that may be the case for some of the opposes. On the more general discussion here, admins are often chosen as the people who are capable of making the hard decisions. Whenever you make those decisions, there are always people on both sides of the argument who are likely to get upset with your choice. (See <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wrong_version" class="extiw" title="m:Wrong_version">m:Wrong version</a>, for example) <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_debe.html" title="User:EWS23"><font color="green"><b>EWS23</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../e/w/s/User_talk%7EEWS23_56e9.html" title="User talk:EWS23">Leave me a message!</a>) 20:47, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To clarify i don't believe Cyde was accusing me of being an enemy. But the sentence makes it sound as if there are few legitimate opposes. i would like to think that many of those opposing were not his 'enemy'. I do agree with Cyde, that the RfA is flawed, and running the gauntlet may not even give one the feedback that is useful. Self reflection and discussion at pages like this are much more productive. And if one has really gone OTT then I am sure ArbCom will waste no time.

<p>looking through some of the older, inactive AOL IP talk pages, it seems like back in 2004 AOL still gave out semi-static IPs to its 64, 149, 152, 205, and 207 ranges, similar to the 172 ranges currently. This means either A) They cheaped out and stopped doing it, or B) eventually they use up all the possible static IPs in a given range, and then move on, which means the 172 range may not stay semi static forever--<a href="../../../a/o/l/User%7EAOL_account_5190.html" title="User:AOL account">AOL account (205.188.116.200)</a> 16:49, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Today's weird Andrew Morrow event: Andrew Morrow created a bio article about me (at John Nagle) and sent me an e-mail about it. Since I don't think I'm notable enough for Wikipedia (there's not enough info on the web about me for a useful bio), I put a {{db-bio}} on it.

<p>I've noticed that more so than in the past, AOL IPs are winding up blocked based on warnings that are anywhere from weeks, to months, and even years old, in some cases blocks are even being issued on IPs that haven't edited in days. Would it be possible for someone to have their bot sweep through all the AOL shared talk pages, and remove all the old warnings? There's really no reason to keep a random collection of warnings, especially since AOL users can't actually receive talk page messages anyway.

<dd>Actually at least some of these changes are problematic. You should not blindly revert all warnings - I've seen at least one example where you removed warnings relating to active or just completed blocks. Removing these is very unhelpful. Its also worth noting that AOL warnings are useful information (even if of less use than on most IP talk pages) and removing them currently considered <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAN_11b1.html" title="WP:VAN">vandalism</a>. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 18:43, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Meanwhile... while the various logos he has made are good graphic design, is there any reason to think any of them are encyclopedic? For example, the image he added to <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_way_%28centrism%29.html" title="Third way (centrism)">Third way (centrism)</a>: he says explicitly that this is something he designed. I this actually in use, and therefore encyclopedic, or is this another unencyclopedic logo he is simply <i>proposing</i>?

Recently, <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template%7EDid_you_know_2dd7.html" title="Template:Did you know">Template:Did you know</a> has been falling far behind the times. Currently there are plans to have an update roughly every six hours. At this moment-in-time, it has been roughly 20 hours since the last update. If there are perhaps one or two interested Admins that would be willing to help out with updates in the next few days, we could really give some of the regulars (For example, in no particular order: MGM, Lar, Brian, Cactus.man) a break. There are easy enough instructions to follow on the <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template_talk%7EDid_you_know_8ba7.html" title="Template talk:Did you know">talk page</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/d/Wikipedia%7EDid_you_know_Guide_6fd7.html" title="Wikipedia:Did you know/Guide">the guide</a> and <b>bold</b> updaters would be appreciated.

<p>I'll second this call. DYK is an important program and the more admins we have updating it, the better. For many new authors this is their first chance at "fame" and it often can set the hook to convert an occasional editor to a solid contributor. The old hands will help you out so please, give it a try, we have loads of great articles waiting for selection and as I speak, the template is eligible for update. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 15:12, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We are once again getting a big backlog of great suggestions and increasing the frequency of update is the way to ensure more great articles get a chance at some visibility. Once again, if you're an admin and want to help out, consider doing an update. It's not hard, although it does take a little time.

<p>I know we're not supposed to vote in AfD debates that we close... but what about ones we decide should be relisted for further consensus? Since it seems that people are willing to close relisted debates whenever they show a consensus, it's not like there's a conflict.

<dl>
<dd>I think it'd be altogether fine for one to participate in an AfD debate he has relisted, especially since those AfDs that require relisting often fail to elicit much participation, such that it is often useful that he who determines insufficient participation exists toward the determining of consensus (which, after all, isn't really a disposition of the AfD) himself analyzes the AfD. As Mango, then, I can't imagine that there's anything wrong with one's relisting and then participating in an AfD (to which the closest analogue, I think, is an admin's properly formatting an AfD another editor has unsuccessfully listed and subsequently participating in the discussion). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 04:16, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I think if you have a strong opinion and wish to express it when relisting, I think it's fine to make a relisting comment or to make a&#160;!vote. If you make a&#160;!vote, it's probably a good idea not to close the AfD unless the post-relisting&#160;!votes are pretty overwhelming in favour of one position. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 14:09, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know which block you are referring to, the one in question shows User:203.87.64.214 <i>has been blocked by Curps for the following reason (see our blocking policy): Autoblocked because your IP address...</i> and then no reason is mentioned, only <i>"reason for block is...<b>user</b>..."</i> and no reason is provided at all.

<dd>I <i>think</i> I actually know what happened. See the edit summary for a block usually reads <i>user</i> if it was a usernameblock (most of the time). If it's indefinantly, thats probably it. As to how it affected the IP address, it's because of a new blocking function that was enabled. If a user is blocked, theres the function of not allowing the IP to create new accounts anymore and the IP's get the same block the username came from. If it was an autoblock, it should tell you the name of the user it's coming from, can you repeat it here? — <span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva"><a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#CD2626">The King of Kings</font></a></span> 14:16 July 20 '06

<dd>Lar beat me to it. However, I don't think that links to carpool services should be provided unless they provide information that increases understanding about the subject of carpooling. Wikipedia articles are for education, not to promote activities, no matter how beneficial they may be. Also, if the links provide have no value other than advertising that carpooling organization, you will have no end to the links being added and/or arguing of which links should be included. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 14:45, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I recently retagged this image as {{<a href="../../../l/o/g/Template%7ELogo_3c38.html" title="Template:Logo">logo</a>}} because I concluded this image was a derivative work of <a href="../../../s/f/_/Image%7ESf_academy.jpg_5dd6.html" title="Image:Sf academy.jpg">Image:Sf academy.jpg</a>. I also removed the image from the userbox it was used in. Subsequent to this, I tagged the image as {{<a href="../../../o/r/f/Template%7EOrfud_2019.html" title="Template:Orfud">orfud</a>}} because it was only used in userspace, and is redundant to Image:Sf academy.jpg. This morning, I was accused of vandalism of the image and of the userbox it was in, and my edits were reverted, with some discussion ensuing on <a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurin_e17e.html#Your_recent_vandalism_to_trekkie_image.2Fubx" title="User talk:Durin">my talk page</a>. Part of the justification for this image not being copyrighted by Paramount is that the source image is from an <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/view/21708009/" class="external text" title="http://www.deviantart.com/view/21708009/" rel="nofollow">image located at deviantART</a>. To me, I find it impossible to imagine that this source image is not a derivative work of art from the original Paramount image. I've also taken Image:Smstarfleetacademy.png, and scaled it (retaining aspect ratio) to the same size as Image:Sf academy.jpg. The resulting two images are virtually identical. Since I am now being accused of vandalism and find myself in conflict with this editor, I'd like other administrators to have a look and either support my actions or that of the person who reverted my edits to the image and the userbox it was in.

<dd>I am also not a lawyer, but it is clear to me that the image is, for all purposes, being used as a "replica" of the original logo. This seems to be circumventing our policies; by simply changing the tint or minor pixel orientations, you cannot call the work your own. In addition, please don't accuse people of "vandalism" when they are making good-faith (and proper, I might add) enforcement of fair use policy - no matter what you think, vandalism applies to bad-faith edits intended to harm the encyclopedia.

<dd>Copyright on a derivative work belongs to the creator but the underlying copyright still applies and the creator can not use it without permission from the original copyright holder. In the case of a "legendary" piece of artwork, assuming it is more than 100 years old and thus public domain, you could make a derivative version (think Warhol) and own the copyright to it. In this case, the starfleet logo is either copyright or trademarked to Paramount, and the fact that it may have been altered does not change the underlying ownership of the original, so the provisions of Fair Use must apply. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 13:51, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>For demonstration purposes, I created Image:Sflogosmall.png. To create this image, I used <a href="../../../s/f/_/Image%7ESf_academy.jpg_5dd6.html" title="Image:Sf academy.jpg">Image:Sf academy.jpg</a> as the source image. I resized the image to be close to Image:Smstarfleetacademy.png's size, changed the hue of the red triangle to a slightly darker red, changed the hue of the yellow interspersed in the image, and added an orangish blob in the lower right and orangish swath through the image from lower left to upper right. This image is essentially identical to the image we're discussing. As such, regardless of the source of the image we are discussing, it is a derivative work of <a href="../../../s/f/_/Image%7ESf_academy.jpg_5dd6.html" title="Image:Sf academy.jpg">Image:Sf academy.jpg</a>. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 13:59, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm sure we can get a bot to delete comments, if necessary. I think that Werdna is suggesting his bot could do so. However, I think that getting people to stop putting comments on AOL talk pages is the primary way to handle it. Even if the comments are deleted, they still cause harm by being added because they are almost always received by the wrong person. I suggest that the warning about not posting comments on {{<a href="../../../a/o/l/Template%7EAOL_b86f.html" title="Template:AOL">AOL</a>}} be made even more explicit and noticeable. Anyway, I appreciate the effort that you have put into this, AOL account (205.188.116.200). Also, I'm glad that you deleted the comments rather than archiving. While there might be a couple of extraordinary situations, it almost never makes sense to archive an anonymous talk page. If there is something that future visitors should know, a note can be left after blanking the page. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 14:06, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I had already mentioned, nobody reads the talk page. Elaborating: People see the article. It had no source before so that's what they see. The article is protected so nobody can add the source. What about putting the sources at the top of the AFD, is that reasonable? Thebainer, you have to admit the AFD is reallly really long. The talk page is longer still and the evidence is burried in there. (Ironically the source is about a newspaper mentioning the website's article for the abbreviation for "too long, didn't read.") <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardvice_3fe9.html" title="User:Hardvice">Hardvice</a> 03:06, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hardvice, you can link to the particular section, although I wish Netscott had just replaced your post with the requested link instead of deleting altogether. As for your characterization, hardvice, that Netscott has "constantly been removing any evidence to support the site's sources", you must admit that is an enormous exaggeration.

<p>Well Netscott made a "Note to closing admins" section that makes a lot of unproven accusations right at the top later. Basically it says, "these people possibly are on another wiki, I don't know for sure or have prove other than one person, but I'm going to declare they all do. (note he basically just declares they all do)" and when others tried to refute it, he removed the comments repeatedly. He claimed to archive them but actually just blanked them. He did that a lot. I think someone may have days later put them in talk. It wasn't until some administrators posted questions to it, did Netscott stop blanking the comments. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardvice_3fe9.html" title="User:Hardvice">Hardvice</a> 03:23, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I, the author of the content in question, strongly disagree with Tyrenius' assesment of this situation as described above and I am disappointed that he chose to deprive me of my right to freedom of expression by censoring content that I created and that I have used and distributed in a manner that does not interfere with the rights of others. First I'd like to address content that I place on my own user page: since that page is created by me and its primary purpose is to relay information about me its cannot be considered sexually harrassing to me, or anyone else. The reader is under no obligation to visit my user page. Moreover, profanity is not banned on Wikipedia, instead it acceptable per Wikipedia's <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProfanity_526b.html" title="Wikipedia:Profanity">policy on profanity</a>.</dd>
<dd>As far as other users' pages are concerned, users may remove the content that I put on their user pages at will. I will not re-instate content on another user's page after the user in question, _or_anyone_else_, for that matter, has deleted the content. I may advise the user, however, that someone has deleted content that I placed on their user page. The user in question has the option to keep the content or discard it. My actions, therefore, are in no way harrassing or offensive. The allegation of (sexual) harrassment would be justified if I distributed content in a discriminatory, derogatory or otherwise demeaning manner, and if I did so clearly against the will of others, or pervasively, even after specific complaints have been received. So far no one has complained, except Tyrenius, and I did not modify his user page in any way or associate my content with his account. I have made it clear, as Tyrenius contends, that the content I authored is gender-neutral, not meant offensively, and intended as a compliment. To underscore my point that the content in question is not offensive, please note that the content in question has remained on the users' pages for a long time, with the users' full knowledge, as I have made them aware of the situation in some cases via their talk page or the edit summary. The user(s) in question had every opportunity to remove the material, address the appropriateness with me, appeal to an administrator or take other remedial actions. None of this, however, has occurred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I feel that Tyrenius' actions not only encroach on my rights to freely express myself, I find that they also create a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chilling_effect.html" title="Chilling effect">chilling effect</a>, discouraging myself, as well as others, to continue to contribute to Wikipedia with an open mind, for fear of being expelled from the Wikipedia community, should their views not be in line with those of the administrators. Specifically, Tyrenius' threat to block my account in spite of my obviously positive contributions to Wikipedia underscores the chilling effect that his action has on the community.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unless I receive a specific request from someone who finds my material offensive or harrassing, I believe that I have the right to distribute it freely, so long as it does not interfere with the rights of others. Should that situation occur, the affected user, admin or guest should address the issue on my talk page, rather than executing an arbitrary summary judgement.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since, as I stated above, I respect other users' rights to edit their own user pages, or any other pages, for that matter, as they please, I will not revert deletion of my content from other users' pages. However, I believe that I share the same right as other users to include the content that I want on my own user page. Therefore, I disagree with Tyrenius' decision to remove benign content that he personally happens to finds offensive, but does not violate Wikipedia policy. If we cannot reach an acceptable consensus, I do intend to appeal his decision and would like to thank him for his candor and forthcomingness when explaining his decision.

<dd>Fellow Wkipedian, please note that according to the page you refer to above, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia is not censored</a> and "...may contain content that some readers consider objectionable or offensive." Sam, are you suggesting that defending my position on this is grounds for suspension of account privileges? I cannot conceive that Wikipedia has any policy that would support such a stance, so if such a policy does exist, kindly point me to it. In addition, your comment above starting with "We don't <i>want</i> this kind of 'contribution'. [...]" suggests that you believe you are speaking on behalf of *all* Wikipedians, which I do not believe to be the case. If you have evidence to the contrary, however, please let me know.</dd>

<dd>As far as potentially offensive content is concerned, I am only referring to content I posted in user space, not content in name space, which should certainly be kept encyclopedic. In user space, Wikipedia policy traditionally provides an outlet for editors to post on a wide range of topics, including their own opinions, even if such views may be unpopular. I noticed that the supporters of censoring material in user space who commented above use <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attacks and threats of suspension in an attempt to possibly discourage those with opposing views from speaking up or perhaps to shield their arguments from public scrutiny. This is understandable, since conformity by the masses is an essential requirement for authoritarian leaders. Please be advised, however, that such arguments may provoke and encourage those with opposing views from yours to enter the discussion.</dd>

<p>Samir, Tyrenius, Sam, et. al, I don't have the consensus needed to keep the userbox content that I created but I disagree nonethless with the decision to prohibit me (or anyone) from posting this (or any) content on my user page, so long as its removal is not absolutely necessary (e.g. as required by law), and even in such extreme circumstances such a decision might frustrate me and I would most likely raise questions regarding the justification of said action. I'd like to again emphasize that I feel that even <b>the suggestion that stating my position regarding this matter, even if it is the dissenting position, would warrant expulsion or other repercussions,</b> does not contribute to a positive and efficient working environment. On the contrary, and without regard to the content discussed above, such a suggestion discourages editors from making statements (in user space or elsewhere) that may not be popular, but valid, nonetheless. Many editors, especially those who are newer members of the community, may not see themselves in a position to withstand a personal attack, or the threat of a summary judgement by an opposed admin, which may result in, possibly unwarranted, blocking. Unless this is disputed, I think it is necessary to clarify here that a user <b>ought not</b> be banned or otherwise reprimanded for stating his viewpoint in discussion, in the appropriate space therefore provided, regardless of the matter that is dicussed or the position that is taken.

<dd>Free speech is free speech, and if you think that saying that another person is 'fuckable' means you lack social skills, then perhaps you've never been to a bar before. Or perhaps no one thinks you are fuckable. Regardless, I agree that the userbox could be construed as offensive. However, simply being offensive does not seem to be enough to warrent its total deletion and threats regarding account suspension.

<dd>The context in a bar is entirely different from the context here: People who go to bars do so because they want to drink and play darts and meet members of the opposite sex. People who come to Wikipedia do so because they want to write an encyclopedia. If you went to a bar and asked a random girl there to write you an article on Gustav Doré, she'd think you were deranged. Why is it a surprise that the inverse is true here? It was inappropriate, and one of the first people who "received" the box immediately (and unsurprisingly) took offense, whether offense was intended or not. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 17:26, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A few thoughts:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I went up to a girl in a bar and asked her to write an article on Gustav Doré. She said she doesn't know much of him and remembers not liking the prevalence of dark tones in his engravings. She is, however, working on a dissertation on some works by Henri Matiss and says she "could use some help". Whether or not I actually <i>am</i> deranged was never brought into question and didn't seem to matter much to her...</li>
<li>Besides: not everyone who goes to a bar does so for the reasons that you have stated. Some people, for example, go there to work. And you obviously left out a lot of activities that Wikipedians do on Wikipedia. Are you suggesting that users of Wikipedia are not allowed to use it as a medium for interpersonal communication or, as a result of this, even, meeting members of the opposite sex? THAT'S definetely censorship. The userbox removal was kind of a gray area because of ceratin decensy laws, user agreements, and such, in addition to the fact that a removal, is constitutionally as equally protected as the speech removed.</li>
<li>I did not receive a peronal complaint from any user personally, so I did not feel the need to issue an apology. If such a complaint has indded been sent to me, with the properties that you imply, I am assuming that you have a copy of said compalind and are ready to sent it to me.</li>
<li>I'm not making myself less credible by defending a point that is no held by the majority. It was my intention for the readers of my previous comment to infer that I feel more strongly about the importance of having a free forum of discussion, rather than the material that was discussed prior. That's why I started said paragraph with <b>"I don't have the consensus needed to keep the userbox content that I created but"...</b> but maybe I was a little too vague.

<p>Please sign your talk posts with ~~~~. You're giving the appearance of wikilawyering here with your arguments, which have all been refuted already. Railing about censorship is not really a good approach, as there is no right to free speech here. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a place to hook up or to be sociable, and everything you do here should be able to be shown (without twisted or torturous logic) to support the project itself. Your box was inappropriate for the collegial atmosphere that is desired here. Internalise that and move on. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 10:33, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I hadn't signed my prior post. I've never heard the term "Wikilawyering" but it sounds really depressing. I've already "internalized" everything that has been posted and I haven't mentioned recreating the user box. I do disagree that there is no free speech here. Either there is free speech or there is not. If there is no free speech, people's constitutional rights may be violated. It's important to detect such a trend early on, before it becomes wide-spread.

<dd>Well said, pgk. Everything you write on Wikipedia is being published by the WikiMedia foundation, and your "right" to say things here is actually a privilege granted by the site's owners because it seems like a good way to get an encyclopedia written. If you use that privilege to do something other than write an encyclopedia, you shouldn't be too surprised when someone asks you to stop. If you think Wikipedia <i>should be</i> a free webhost, or a social networking service, why not address that point directly, instead of feeding us red herrings about free speech, as if Wikipedia were a nation-state or something. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 19:11, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In regard to the second edit, I would recommend that he not change another person's comments in that manner. However, I would not go so far as to call it vandalism. I do not think that his posting of "W00t f0r j00, dr4g0nf1y!" after DragonFly31's comment would qualify as vandalism, either. I believe that he was just expressing his support for DragonFly31's position. I looked through a couple of his edits and did not find any vandalism, but I did not make an exhaustive search. I think that politely requesting that he not modify the content of your comments would be okay. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 14:23, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I received the following as an email. It appears to relate mainly to an article <i>Encyclopedia Dramatica</i> that looks like it describes a somewhat peripheral Internet phenomenon, the kind of article I really don't care either way whether we have or not. It also contains miscellaneous allegations of Admin abuse. On the whole the picture I get is that the sender of this has most likely been repeatedly blocked/banned, has not been willing to deal with any of our usual procedures as a way to try to get unbanned, and instead keeps creating new accounts, behaving in at least a mildly abusive manner (maybe worse - I gave this about 10 minutes, and obviously the person is unlikely to point to his/her most egregious actions), and then getting blocked on those new accounts.</p>
<p>Still, having sampled a few of these, there <i>might</i> be some inappropriate admin actions, which is why I am posting this here. Admins, especially when acting in their capacity as admins, should not be calling people "retarded" and telling them to "fuck off". I've certainly dealt with "contributors" who make me want to do that, and I fully sympathize with the frustration, but venting it this way is, at best, troll-feeding.</p>
<p>I don't tend to watch this page a lot, so if someone wants to ask me any questions on this, please "ping" me on my user talk page.

<p>At the risk of beating a dead horse, and I promise it is the last time I'll say this in this discussion, but am I really the only one here who thinks there is a problem with an administrator calling another user "retarded" and telling them to "fuck off"? Instead, everybody is flaming about the spammer. I've certainly felt that way toward several users myself; that's when I come here and see if some other admin will take over from me in dealing with that person, because I have obviously gotten too engaged to do so dispassionately. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:19, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course, it is a bad thing, and the admin who said it should face some kind of sanction, but regardless of what the admin did, the spammer should have tried to contain the issue within its' current locations, instead of trying to spam everyone about it in their inboxes. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 07:23, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Calling someone "retarded" and telling them to "fuck off" certainly seems to be "acting like a dick"... yet your axiom strangely doesn't seem to hold in such cases. When an admin acts like a troll, and using terminology clearly intended to insult is certainly 'trollish' behaviour, they share in the responsibility for the bad behaviour of the person they abused and provoked. Saying, 'the admin was annoyed so it is understandable' is a cop-out/double-standard... the regular user was equally annoyed and their behaviour equally 'understandable'. But 'understandable' doesn't equal 'acceptable'... for <i>either</i> party. Admins ought to be better than trolls... and when they aren't we should say so and tell them not to do it again. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:06, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've never felt that it's the job of an AfD closer to review the reasoning of a given "voter": people believe all kinds of crazy things, generally for bad reasons. It is, however, the job of the AfD closer to check for sock/meat puppetry and votestuffing - of those who voted keep, I can only find MostlyRainy who has a worthwhile wikipedia track record. As to the rest of the "keep"ers, frankly I've no regard whatever for the opinion of someone who has a handful of contributions - theirs is not an informed opinion as to what should or should not be a wikipedia article. On that basis, there's something in the neighbourhood of ten deletes, to one keep. That's a nice solid delete. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 19:22, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The general consensus has been to remove all links to specific fan sites on the GraalOnline article but a group of people including <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarcaptain_c047.html" title="User:Warcaptain">User:Warcaptain</a> <a href="../../../d/i/4/User%7EDi4gram_0c4f.html" title="User:Di4gram">User:Di4gram</a> are reverting all change because they want to put advertising link to a forum (UGCC). But they also use GraalOnline critics section to make personal attacks against some administrator of the game. Lot of work has been made by the company managing graalonline and a group of player to make a good and neutral wikipedia article but this group of people banned from the game for not respect rule of conduct are using wikipedia to take a revange and are vandalizing the article. The war will never finish. Can a neutral admin please look at the article and possibly protect the page so we can engage in discussion?

<p>I was just asked about undeleting an image. As this is a new policy and I have not done this before, I went looking for guidelines for admins about undeleting images. I didn't find any. If this has been discussed, can someone point me to the discussions? I'm assuming for now that if a single admin deleted an image because it was incorrectly tagged and sourced, another admin could undelete the image if presented with the correct tag and source info. I think this should be handled with a template. If someone wants an image undeleted, they could edit the "Image" page and add the correct tags and source information. They would also post a template {{<a href="../../../i/m/a/Template%7EImageUndeleteRequest_30d4.html" title="Template:ImageUndeleteRequest">ImageUndeleteRequest</a>}} which would categorized the image into <a href="../../../r/e/q/Category%7ERequests_to_undelete_images_e99c.html" title="Category:Requests to undelete images">Category:Requests to undelete images</a>. This way any admin could look at the category, examine the tags and source info and undelete images when appropriate. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 22:24, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Iran's human rights records had nothing to do and no relavancy to the subject at hand. Basically he was telling me to shut up becuase he did not like what I had to say. Good thing I am not a blind nationalist, I am upset though becuase it was clearly a personal attack. I reacted calmly and told him to keep comments directed towards edits and not editors.</p>
<p>It must also be noted that this user has almost consistantly been the subject of conterversal behaviour including uncivil behaviour, disruption, and ongoing edit wars. Here is one example of what he has been up to recently [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:AdilBaguirov_reported_by_User:TigranTheGreat_.28Result:_Protected.2C_review_needed.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:AdilBaguirov_reported_by_User:TigranTheGreat_.28Result:_Protected.2C_review_needed.29" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>].</p>

<p>I'd like to get some external input on <a href="../../../p/e/l/Talk%7EPella_Palace_0f2f.html" title="Talk:Pella Palace">Talk:Pella Palace</a>. The dispute has to do with his insistent removal of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pella_Palace&amp;diff=65573066&amp;oldid=65570532" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pella_Palace&amp;diff=65573066&amp;oldid=65570532" rel="nofollow">an image caption</a>, as ridiculous as it may sound. I am suspecting that Ghirla is either reverting me out of pure spite for the block I gave him back on July 7 or due to his complete inability to accept that he doesn't have editorial fiat over articles. Note that with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pella_Palace&amp;diff=65601011&amp;oldid=65590339" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pella_Palace&amp;diff=65601011&amp;oldid=65590339" rel="nofollow">this revert</a> (without any given justification whatsoever, too), he has violated the 3RR, too, after reverting my edit 3 times, which has been duely reported. His insistance that I justify my edit with <i>policy</i> is laughable at best, as it is the reverter's duty to provide justification other than the "whimsicality" of the edit. <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 20:22, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, there was no 3RR violation, let's just get the facts straight to begin with. Circeus in his <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:Ghirlandajo_reported_by_User:Circeus_.28Result:.29" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">"3RR report"</a> lumped up the edits from 4 days to come up with four reverts. While, any number of reverts over any period of time is ideally too many, care is need as each case is different</dd>

First of all, Ghirla's argument is not laughable, even if Circeus claims so. Second, Circeus forgets to give a full context of their previous skirmish, the edit conflict (not flawless by <i>both</i> parties) which Circeus "won" in the end of the day by simply blocking an opponent. The nearest to the detailed description of that conflict could be found in the archive of this board at:</dd>

<dd>As far as I can see, the caption that Circeus wants to add and Ghirlandajo wants to remove is a comment <i>Ghirlandajo</i> added when he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Pellapalace.jpg&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Pellapalace.jpg&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> uploaded the image in the first place. It is completely beyond me why a text he wrote in the first place would now be unacceptable as a caption, and I think Ghirlandajo is the one that should give a good reason <i>not</i> to include it and not the other way around. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:51, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have admited that the 3RR report was mistakenly done: Ghirla's first revert occured on July 21, although most of the reverting occured today. I will continue tostand by my July 7 block. That Ghirla's attitude can be sanctionned by his edits (the quality and quantity of which I certainly won't deny) is beyond me. He is regurlarly uncivil (when not threading near personal attacks) and constantly maintain strict dogwatch over articles he works on, in adition to his general confrontational attitude. <i>Those</i> are the gripes I have with him, and I am not the only one to have found his a stressful editor to deal with. <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 21:10, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it might be better to submit such things to a review first.

<dd>Incidentally, even if the block you're mentioning about is old, it still created a precedent, because it raises the utility of a review. Maybe a review would prevent all this story...&#160;:( -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 21:29, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I brought this up on <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia_talk%7EUsername_ba3d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Username">Wikipedia talk:Username</a>, where I got two responses. However, since administrators are the ones who do the blocking, I'm bringing it here for more discussion.</p>
<p>It is my perception that editors with email addresses for usernames are always blocked, eventually. Such usernames are often blocked before they make a single edit, but all of the rest are blocked once an admin who blocks for this reason notices it.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html#Inappropriate_usernames" title="Wikipedia:Username">username policy</a> currently just discourages the creation of usernames that are email addresses. I propose that such usernames be prohibited so that the username policy matches blocking practice. I think that it is misleading to suggest that such usernames are a bad idea, but that they will not be blocked. Editors who feel misled may leave the project rather than signing up with a new username, since they just joined and have no strong attachment to it yet. The current wording may also create additional work if the account has made some contributions before being blocked and the editor wants to transfer the edits to their new account.</p>
<p>One way of preventing email addresses from being used as usernames would be to technically prohibit @ from being used in usernames. I think that this is the best solution, especially since not all editors read the username policy before choosing a username. However, this would prevent users from using @ in non-email address usernames, like matt@new york. Also, editors may try to use "at" in the place of @ for usernames containing email addresses, like "matt at yahoo.com". If they do this, there is also the question of whether such usernames should be blocked. I think that these problems are relatively minor, though. This technical solution may take a while to implement, if it can be done at all. For now, I suggest that the username policy simply be modified. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 21:04, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This sounds pretty fair. We have warned people in the past about not using email addresses for their usernames, and I can see several times a day people doing this very thing. While I have not blocked any of those names in recent memory, it would be a good idea too. As for the edit reassignment, I have no idea how it would work. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 21:09, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not convinced of the need to block them, it seems to be for their own protection rather than any particular WP issue. However I do think whatever we do we should amend <a href="../../../s/i/g/MediaWiki%7ESignupend_0a3f.html" title="MediaWiki:Signupend">MediaWiki:Signupend</a> to make it clearer that either they aren't allowed or are not a good idea.

<dl>
<dd>I don't see a need to protect users from themselves by blocking them. Leave them a note or an e-mail, make sure they're aware of possible issues, and let them make up their mind to switch if they so desire. I don't believe policy prohibits people from having bad ideas, yet. Preventing new registrations of such is fine; existing ones should be grandfathered.</dd>

One of them posted some personal details about Ironduke, others created attack accounts, and there have been various shenanigans like constantly reverting his edits, changing his user page, and so on, all very immature behavior. The Gomi-no-sensei and BlindVenetian accounts are currently blocked, and the Gnetwerker account has stayed away from the disputed articles, so the only problem left is Anomicene. I asked him a few weeks ago to stay away from articles he can see Ironduke has recently edited, but he recently followed ID to an article the latter had created, so I've told him if he doesn't stay away from ID, this account will be blocked too. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:40, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Since June 15, I have edited <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Hawash_0f12.html" title="Mike Hawash">Mike Hawash</a>, with only minor exceptions, none of them involving you, until July 18, when I made one set of edits to <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Relief_Foundation_1ce7.html" title="Global Relief Foundation">Global Relief Foundation</a>, on which you had not been active for some time. The edits in question are NPOV, and have been retained.

<dd>I don't know what you mean by "accurate." I wasn't talking about June 15, I was using your edits starting with May 14, when you first left a message on the Gnetwerker account's talk page apprising him that he had "a problem." But fine, let's take June 15. Starting from your date and going to the time I wrote the above numbers, and using my criteria above (all of your edits that stalked/followed/complained about me), the ratio remains the same, this time 106 edits, 8 of which having nothing to do with me: roughly 93% of your edits are focused on me or the work I've done. This is a very, very bad percentage. Even half this number would be cause for grave concern. I also notice that you keep glossing over a telltale edit you made, perhaps you can say what it was that drove you to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ACentral_discussions%2FApartheid&amp;diff=62746703&amp;oldid=62684593" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ACentral_discussions%2FApartheid&amp;diff=62746703&amp;oldid=62684593" rel="nofollow">vote</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Central_discussions/Apartheid#Poll:_Rename_.22Israeli_apartheid.22_article_to_.22Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid.22" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Central_discussions/Apartheid#Poll:_Rename_.22Israeli_apartheid.22_article_to_.22Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid.22" rel="nofollow">this renaming poll</a> (with which you had nothing previously to do), and to vote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ACentral_discussions%2FApartheid&amp;diff=62307507&amp;oldid=62283398" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ACentral_discussions%2FApartheid&amp;diff=62307507&amp;oldid=62283398" rel="nofollow">against me</a>? <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 01:37, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anomicene, please stop posting about this. ID, it's also a good idea for you not to respond. The point, Anomicene, is that two edits to articles by someone else are not the same as two edits by you. You've been accused of being part of a campaign of harassment. By rights, you shouldn't still be editing. I believe that any innocent editor would stay away from Ironduke in order to make sure they weren't viewed as part of the nonsense. That you keep thrusting yourself into it does not speak well of you. Please stop thinking about, talking about, writing about, and editing with Ironduke. If you think the allegations are unfair and ridiculous, fine, but stay away from him anyway. The longer you stay away, the more people might end up agreeing with you. But the more you go on about it, the more it looks as though are you, indeed, obsessed, so you're shooting yourself in the foot somewhat. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:46, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since my name was drug into this above: SlimVirgin, it is one thing to issue a unilateral admin edict that I stay away from "IronDuke's pages" (whatever that means). I have and will do so (for a reasonable period of time, not necessarily defined by you). However, trying to prevent me from seeking the community's (and other admins') opinion on the matter goes too far. I have not been party to harassment of IronDuke, and I'm not interested in your (biased) opinion of what an "innocent editor" would do. At this point I am less interested in IronDuke than in your unilateral and out-of-process actions in support of him (and of course his support of you in the current ArbCom case). -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 18:08, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I agree that editing 2 articles with non-abusive edits isn't wiki-stalking. The sockpuppetry used to harrass another user clearly isn't acceptable. He should stay away from IronDuke, but he also shouldn't be called a stalker either, there just isn't enough of a pattern or behaviour in the edits to warrant it unless there is more evidence somewhere. I'd point out that all edits to articles are articles that involve someone else unless you create it.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:57, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See above for the evidence.

<dd>Which is why I think he should stay away from him. But is there actual evidence that he's following him to articles and undoing his edits or otherwise damaging the articles? There is a difference. And if you suspect Gnetworker is a sockpuppet, please follow the proper procedure for verifying it, rather than just making the claim here. I'm not saying he's not. I'd just feel more comfortable with a check user to be sure. And if that is the case, then perhaps some further action may be warranted here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 18:37, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Check user has already confirmed that they appear to be the same person, but Gnetwerker insisted that Anomicene was his employee, which explained the IP evidence.

<p>I looked at a few of those and they're missing the all important release under the GFDL. Someone can say they're the copyright holder, but they need to clearly state their permission to release under our license or we cannot use the material. The "More specific statement of permission" template is used for these cases.

<p>I am an avid contemporary art collector, and also work for the St. Louis Art Museum. One of my late colleages, Ramsey K. Kohlfinger--created the original article entitled "Joe Wood"--which gave a brief and unbiased summary of the Artist/Author Joe Wood, a native of St. Louis, Missouri.</p>
<p>The article was accurate, informative, and a must for those whom wish to have a general reference on this particular artist, whom has sold his work abroad as far as Sydney, Austrailia, and has his work in galleries from New York to his native St. Louis. As a collector, I too can appreciate the need for in the very least--a short biographical summary for individuals who are not only popular or successful, but create new tangents in the history of art.</p>
<p>Wood created a new style (a word artists usually hate) by mixing elements of retro 40s Deco, 80s graffiti, and 30s regionalism and incorporating it into a new abstract expressionist AND impressionist STYLE, yet all original.</p>
<p>A recent statement by a fellow collector/art critic in Brooklyn NY says it all, "Woods art is both homey and intelligent; it says truthful things, and asks hard questions we dont want to ask."</p>
<p>At the very least, the content of my late friend's article should also compel you of the noteworthiness by its additional and equally valid warrant of Mr. Wood's work in the world of books/African-American Revisionist History. Mr. Wood is also a writer, who has written pieces locally as a freelance editorial columnist, and has brought attention to the subject of lynching in his work, UGLY WATER, 2006--which sheds light on a forgotten lynching in St. Louis, MO, and questions the validity of traditionally taught Afro-American history.</p>
<p>Mr. Kohlfinger could and probably did do a better job of summing up the subject of the article that was deleted recently from wiki; JOE WOOD. But I am asking that this article be restored, and given proper respect as a valid and credible entry of a contemporary person of considerable merit. Although I don't personally own any of Mr. Wood's pieces, I know that Guy Tozzoli, of the World Trade Center Assoc. and Larry Silverstein Properties--is currently considering pieces from Mr. Wood to be installed in the new WTC site FREEDOM TOWER. I know of many other high-end art dealers who would vouch for this artists ability and note.</p>
<p>All in all, I ask that the article "Joe Wood" be restored, and if edits need to be done to improve the quality of the article, I can assure you that it will be done, if given the possibility.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

<p>Hi, I've got an anon user who seems to enjoy making repeated allegations that I've insulted them or others in some fashion (diffs: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZiggurat&amp;diff=63678021&amp;oldid=63677693" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZiggurat&amp;diff=63678021&amp;oldid=63677693" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZiggurat&amp;diff=65602770&amp;oldid=65483987" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZiggurat&amp;diff=65602770&amp;oldid=65483987" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZiggurat&amp;diff=66050518&amp;oldid=65935873" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZiggurat&amp;diff=66050518&amp;oldid=65935873" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>), despite my never having done anything of the kind (the closest was a comment "what is it with guys and gay jokes?"&#160;:). Does this false attribution constitute a personal attack by implication? And given that their address seems to be a roaming IP (dialup?) is there anything to be done about it?
