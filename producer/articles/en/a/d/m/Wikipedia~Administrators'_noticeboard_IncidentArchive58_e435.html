<dd>This is neither a guideline nor a proposed guideline - it's an essay. It is not seeking to gain a consensus of editors, nor does it have a widespread consensus that it is mostly the right thing to do. It's just a commentary. I've tagged it accordingly. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 21:16, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my interpretation this is a proposed guideline. Perhaps we should have started voting for it on its talk page just so it would be harder to harrass (move to userspace) a proposal that had begun voting. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 18:12, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it was the page's creator that didn't want it to be a proposed guideline <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Peter_McConaughey/Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=31654551&amp;oldid=31653717" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Peter_McConaughey/Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=31654551&amp;oldid=31653717" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. It's more of a personal essay/guideline so user space seems more appropriate. That course of action seemed better than nominating it for deletion. If there turns out to be wide support for it as a Wikipedia guideline, let's move it back to Wikipedia namespace. How's that sound? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 18:26, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok. Though I think wikipedia's distinction between "guideline" instead of "policy" is exactly appropriate as it relates to <a href="../../../z/e/r/Wikipedia%7EZero-revert_rule_0981.html" title="Wikipedia:Zero-revert rule">Wikipedia:Zero-revert rule</a> or any "personal essay/personal guideline", quoting from the {guideline} template: <i><b>This page is considered a guideline on Wikipedia. It illustrates standards of conduct, which many editors agree with in principle. However, it is not policy.</b></i> A proposed guideline is exactly an "essay" that only has the support of a handful of editors, it should be given the chance of garnering community support through prominent exposure, though do I assume correctly you would vote against it Carbonite? Maybe Peter wanted to refine it before proposing it as a guideline or some such. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 18:49, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you take a look at the guidelines in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_guidelines_9f5f.html" title="Category:Wikipedia guidelines">Category:Wikipedia guidelines</a>, you'll find <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, all very widely accepted. To me, the difference between an official policy and a guideline is that guidelines generally aren't enforced with punitive measures, while official policies might be. The "zero-revert" rule didn't have any acceptance as far as I could tell, certainly not to the point where "<i>...many editors agree with in principle...</i>". I put a "proposed" tag on the page, but Peter didn't wish to have it go through the porcess of becoming a guideline. Since I figured the page could still be useful in some way, I moved it to his user space, rather than nominating it for deletion.</dd>

<dd>There is the possibility that there was still refinement in progress, but before you reach that conclusion, take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Zero-revert_rule&amp;oldid=30433391" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Zero-revert_rule&amp;oldid=30433391" rel="nofollow">first version</a>. Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't look like a very serious guideline. I was also concerned that the guideline was being referred to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31647722" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31647722" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> before other editors had even seen this "rule".</dd>

<dd>I think the best way to proceed here would be to refine the page in user space and gauge the level of acceptance. If it turns out that "<i>...many editors agree with in principle...</i>", a move back to Wikipedia namespace would be appropriate. If not, it can remain a personal guideline that any editor can choose to follow. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 19:04, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How does a proposed guideline go about garnering acceptance other than by existing as a proposed guideline for a long while to measure community acceptance and solicit comments and suggestions for improvement? For comparison, I don't think <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> was ever forced to move to an editor's user namespace, especially not a few days after it was written... <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 19:14, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most guidelines are unwritten rules that turned into written ones. In the case of the "zero-revert rule", I can't say that I've heard of it as an unwritten rule. Making this a guideline is more akin to creating a rule from scratch rather than writing down what is already accepted. Please note that I attempted three times to add the "proposed" tag onto the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Peter_McConaughey/Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=31186437&amp;oldid=31149774" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Peter_McConaughey/Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=31186437&amp;oldid=31149774" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Peter_McConaughey/Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=31648880&amp;oldid=31648548" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Peter_McConaughey/Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=31648880&amp;oldid=31648548" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Peter_McConaughey/Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=31649784&amp;oldid=31649415" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Peter_McConaughey/Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=31649784&amp;oldid=31649415" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, but was reverted each time. After other admins chimed in Peter stated "<i>Why don't we just remove the tag altogether? I have no interest in subjecting the limits that I impose on myself to the acceptance of the Cabal.</i>" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Peter_McConaughey/Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=31654551&amp;oldid=31653717" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Peter_McConaughey/Zero-revert_rule&amp;diff=31654551&amp;oldid=31653717" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Given that the "zero-revert rule" wasn't generally accepted and that there wasn't interest in making it a guideline, I felt a move to user space would be the best move. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 19:29, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you should give Peter the benefit of the doubt and allow significant time to pass to see if the Zero-revert rule garners community support. I think you are putting the cart before the horse, before something becomes a "guideline" it has to be a "proposed guideline". Just because initially it seems like it doesn't have much support doesn't mean it won't eventually. The proposed guideline template is exactly for signifying proposals that seek community refinement and suggestion prior to general acceptance. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 19:38, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just because there is a disagreement over whether it is a guideline or a proposed guideline doesn't mean it must be moved to userspace. I think Peter is (correctly) inferring <a href="../../../0/r/r/WP%7E0RR_694b.html" title="WP:0RR">WP:0RR</a> from <a href="../../../1/r/r/WP%7E1RR_8afd.html" title="WP:1RR">WP:1RR</a> and NPOV (which does indeed make it a guideline). The inferred guideline is recommending instead of "reverting" or removing someone else's content that you don't like (when not obvious vandalism) we should give the benefit of the doubt and include the other content in addition to our own content to avoid the possibility of censoring information, which I think succinctly summarizes the advantage and essence of collaborative editing. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 19:47, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, that's about all the info I can provide. I made every attempt to make this a proposed guideline. Other admins attempted to make this a proposed guideline. There was agreement that this was <b>not</b> a guideline yet. I'm not sure what else I can say. You may disagree the move, but I believe there was certainly justification. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 20:17, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A guideline that only a handful of editors follow is still a guideline for them. How is a disagreement over whether it is a guideline or a proposed guideline in any way justify moving it to someone's user namespace? Perhaps a compromise header can be worked out with the content at <a href="../../../0/r/r/WP%7E0RR_694b.html" title="WP:0RR">WP:0RR</a>, something to the effect of "this is a new guideline that the entire community may not be aware of" or some such? Peter seems to have valid concerns with the wording of the {proposal} header, for example, guidelines don't require "consensus" -- voting for a guideline just signifies that editor agrees with the principles of the guideline and will try to follow them. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 20:26, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>A page that only a handful of editors follow is not a Wikipedia guideline, should not masquerade as such, should be clearly tagged as 'essay', 'rejected' and/or 'historical', and most likely belongs in userspace.

<li>Yes, <a href="../../../0/r/r/WP%7E0RR_694b.html" title="WP:0RR">WP:0RR</a> is a new and not yet official guideline as most of the community is not yet aware of it, if a critical mass of editors end up following it hopefully one day it can be officialized. How can something possibly be labeled "rejected" if most community members are unaware of it? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 23:45, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Carbonite seems to be implying edits he disagrees with are "disruptive". What specific edits of mine violate any wikipedia policy or are applicable to probation? Since becoming aware of it I've been following the <a href="../../../0/r/r/WP%7E0RR_694b.html" title="WP:0RR">WP:0RR</a> which encourages editors to include other people's content in addition to my own, instead of reverting which can stifle contribution and can inflame confrontation. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 21:54, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just wanted to note here that the only reason why Zen wasn't already blocked from CT was because of a technicality. He was blocked for violating 3RR on December 12th and his probation was extended on <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html#Arbitration_case_modified" title="User talk:Zen-master">December 14th</a>. And the 3RR violation was on Conspiracy theory as was the violation on November 24th that caused him to be blocked. So this isn't new. It's just the latest chapter. And btw, zen is still reverting other people's edits. They are not strictly reverts but that have that effect. And he's doing it without discussion. I hope he is blocked from CT. Like I said, this isn't new behavior. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 21:59, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree I was "edit warring", the other side in the dispute is the only one that has been reverting the article recently and removing relevant info and clarity. I don't think it is unreasonable to strive for a superset introduction of all viewpoints and presentation methods until we work out a bipartite version on the talk page.

Zen-master has been edit warring on "conspiracy theory" articles for nearly six months, including <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">Conspiracy theory</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_conspiracy_theories_4054.html" title="AIDS conspiracy theories">AIDS conspiracy theories</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConspiracy_theory_5aa7.html" title="Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory">Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWords_to_avoid_41db.html" title="Wikipedia:Words to avoid">Wikipedia:Words to avoid</a> and <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>. He already been banned from editing the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a> article due to similar behavior. This widespread disruption is the reason his probation was expanded to all articles. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 22:12, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What "behavior" of mine actually violates any wikipedia policy? Are you citing any of either? All those articles have/had fundamental bias problems with them. I accept that the apparent majority disagrees with my interpretation but that is not justification for direct censorship, obfuscation, and mischaracterization. Also note, I am not "banned" from editing <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a> (which I consider to be a racist and racism inducing article), my edit restrictions probation originally was specific to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a> but a small and highly coordinated group of editors have apparently conspired to expand the scope of my probation/edit restrictions to include all articles.

Though, if you read the entire thread there was and is controversy over that "ban" because of that fact the "banning" admin falled to include a rationale as to how adding the {npov} tag to a fundamentally disputed article could somehow be construed as a "disruption". The admin in question seems to have clearly violated the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EProbation_b457.html" title="WP:Probation">WP:Probation</a> policy: "A ban may be imposed only for good cause which shall be documented in a section set aside for that purpose in the arbitration case.

<ul>
<li>Very well. Considering that Zen-master's edits on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">Conspiracy theory</a> have in the past week been reverted by a number of different users, including Willmcw, Tom Harrison, Harald88 and Carbonite, and on the talk page several people, including Cberlet and Sean Black, state disagreement with Zen-master's edits, I must conclude that his edits run against consensus, and that his repeatedly reverting to the version he prefers is disruptive. Thus, <b>Zen-master is hereby banned from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">Conspiracy theory</a> until January 1st</b>. He is welcomed to propose any changes to the article on its talk page, and seek consensus from there. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 13:07, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The word "consensus" does not mean "majority". Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy was specifically designed to ensure the inclusion of all viewpoints, it is not being followed in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> and other articles such as <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a>. If a small "majority" of editors revert additions to an article, rather than changes, that is perhaps a sign of censorship. To avoid the possibility of even inadvertent censorship editors should try to follow the <a href="../../../z/e/r/Wikipedia%7EZero-revert_rule_0981.html" title="Wikipedia:Zero-revert rule">Wikipedia:Zero-revert rule</a> which frees editors from thinking in terms of "reverting" and does not have the effect of stifling contribution. The 0RR has the advantage of encouraging editors to be bold while at the same time being inclusive of other editors contributions. Articles should be a superset of all viewpoints and sources. Also, if a highly coordinated group of editors repeatedly revert additions or clarity improvements from an article, without making a competent argument for exclusion, then any censorship or obfuscation is increasingly obvious... <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 18:20, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The issue at hand is apparent censorship and obfuscation. A small majority has labeled contributions they disagree with as "disruptive" instead of debating the merits of those contributions.

Saying that he 'caused revert wars' there is a bit disingenuous given that the wars, in both those cases, involved Locke Cole following Andy to pages Locke Cole had never edited before and reverting Andy's changes. There's a term for that. I can cite more than a dozen examples of Locke Cole and you (prior to being banned) doing that. This doesn't qualify as "leaving him alone". Nor does repeatedly reporting him here, making gratuituous negative comments about him to others on a daily basis, et cetera. Yes, Andy is aggressive and disruptive. Yes, he makes negative comments. Yes he keeps track of edits and says 'look what HE did!'... all just like you and Locke Cole.

<dd>There was apparently an interesting discovery made that it is possible to block a user using the lowercase version of their name (i.e. <i>kmweber</i> in this case) and for that block not to show up in the appropriate log because the logging mechanism forces the initial letter to UPPERCASE (i.e. <i>Kmweber</i>). So if you check the logs for all those admins, you'll probably find references to user:kmweber interleaved…try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Karmafist" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Karmafist" rel="nofollow">this</a> for example.

<li>we <i><b>should</b></i> have a policy for blocking people for being incredibly annoying. not indefinitely, of course, but for a couple of days. <i>So</i> much time is lost to the project by random fools, and sometimes valuable editors.

<dd>David notes we can't block people for being incredibly annoying, but the question I would like an answer to is can people be blocked if they are clearly not here to contribute to the encylopaedia AND are incredibly annoying?

<dd>You can block people -- even indefinitely -- for being noncontributors, but not if <i>anybody</i> (with administrative rights, at least) objects to it. We've blocked quite a few people permanently for being total losers, and nobody seems to mind all that much. In this case, though, there are plenty of objectors to an indefinite block of Kmweber, and so nobody is entitled to block him permanently (except Jimbo and the Board, and they haven't gotten involved). Basically, Kmwember hasn't yet convinced all 700-odd administrators that his participation in Wikipedia is without value. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 18:50, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I concur, but I have to agree with David Gerard that desysoping Karmafist for making a hasty decision is a unwarranted. We have the power to overrule and Karmafist has been dealing with a lot of badgering for sure. Other admins have already blocked Weber for long periods of time...so at most, Karmafist is guilty of acting unilaterally. But if things keep up the way they are, the ban may end up permanent anyway at some point.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 19:13, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think a more serious matter (than the fact that the block was indefinite) is that Karmafist blocked a user he was very involved with. David Gerard had already asked other admins to keep an eye on Kurt, so he (Kurt) was being closely monitored. I don't support desyoping Karmafist, but he does need to take a step back and let other admins impose any future blocks. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 19:22, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no doubt that Andy and Kurt are extremely annoying people. That's not the point here, though. We can't keep, as an admin, someone who can't deal with annoying people in a reasonably responsible way. Karmafist has shown that he can't deal with annoying people with enough cool for us to continue to extend the trust of adminship to him. If he had been acting responsibly, he would have refused to use admin rights against him, or he would have taken a wikibreak. He did neither of these things. The private communications that several of us have had with him suggest that these problems will continue to recur for as long as he remains an admin. I don't think it's in the interests of the Wikipedia for him to remain as an admin; if this causes him to leave the Wiki entirely, that's too bad, but it will have been necessary.</dd>

<dd>I have yet to see an editor be bombproof and have seen admin actions worse than Karmafist for much less provocation. I fully understand and agree that he shouldn't have tried to permaban Kurt, and he also shouldn't have blocked any editor he was directly involved with in any content dispute. I think that it is a rather severe punishment to desysop him unless their is evidence that he has done this in the past.

<p>This guy just doesn't get it. I would suggest we chalk this one up to rightfully extreme frustration, correct Karmafist's mistake for him, and move on to dealing with Kurt.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I would like to understand better why the Fortune Lounge Group article keeps on being deleted, as I have tried as much as possible to re-edit the article so that it is less promotional. It would be nice for the Group to feature in the Wiki and I do not mind re-editing the material once again, but I do not understand the grounds for deletion.</p>
<p>I see you have a number of online casinos and poker rooms listed in the Wikipedia and these articles have external links so if this is not ideally the factor for deletion - please could you give me some tips as to how we can feature in the wiki without breaking the editorial rules per se.</p>
<p>I'd really like some feedback and will await a timeous response.</p>

<p>Whoa whoa whoa. Wait a minute. This just hit me not thirty seconds ago.</p>
<p>As much as I'm all for forgiving and reforming abusive users, there has got to be some type of line that we've got to draw. Andy is <i>taking us for a ride</i> with this crap. Look:</p>
<ol>
<li>Refuses to acknowledge/participate in RfC regarding his disputed behavior
<ul>
<li>Including ignoring talk page notice not just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pigsonthewing&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=24194571" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pigsonthewing&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=24194571" rel="nofollow">once</a> but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pigsonthewing&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=24652768" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pigsonthewing&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=24652768" rel="nofollow">twice</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refuses to acknowledge/participate in RFAr regarding his disputed behavior</li>
</ol>
<p>Look. Anyone who refuses to abide by <i>established</i> and <i>accepted</i> Wikipedia policies (not guidelines, but policies) is not a martyr but a <i>troll</i>. If someone doesn't like the established policy, they have every right to contest it, but no right to hold them in contempt.</p>
<p>Andy frequently removes what he considers to be personal attacks on his user talk page. However, according to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>, which happens to be an official policy page...</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>If you find yourself using this remedy frequently, you should reconsider your definition of "personal attack." When in doubt, follow the dispute resolution process instead.</b></dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd><i>If the issue is decided by Arbitration, you will be expected to abide by the result.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And, my favorite (bold emphasis added by myself)...</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The first resort in resolving almost any conflict is to <b>discuss the issue on a talk page</b>. Either contact the other party on that user's talk page, or use the talk page associated with the article in question. ...Take the other person's perspective into account and try to reach a compromise. <b>Assume that the other person is acting in good faith unless you have clear evidence to the contrary.</b></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Both at this stage and throughout the dispute resolution process, talking to other parties is not simply a formality to be satisfied before moving on to the next forum. <b>Failure to pursue discussion in good faith shows that you are trying to escalate the dispute instead of resolving it.</b> This will make people less sympathetic to your position and may prevent you from effectively using later stages in dispute resolution. In contrast, sustained discussion and serious negotiation between the parties, even if not immediately successful, shows that you are interested in finding a solution that fits within Wikipedia policies. For additional ideas, see <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wikipedia%7ENegotiation_07d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Negotiation">Wikipedia:Negotiation</a>.</p>
<p>Do I <i>really</i> need to go any further? Has my rant made any impact? If Andy is unwilling to go through with our established dispute resolution policies as well as hold the ArbCom in contempt, then <i>why</i>, pray tell, are we still debating about what to do with him? <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 18:35, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And yet, since he was banned from this page he has abided by that ban.... despite you and several others taking the opportunity to "rant" and malign him <b>extensively</b> here while he is forbidden from responding. Gee... what possible reason could he have for complaining so much? What has he really done <i>wrong</i> since the ArbCom case? Make a couple of extra reverts after someone followed him around to block his edits? Complained (extensively) about that and the other ongoing <b>viciousness</b> against him? He has honored every single page ban placed on him. He has shown a willingness to apologize for mistakes while those attacking him have not (the <i>one</i> exception being Nandesuka apologizing for her most recent mistaken block). If he is <i>so</i> irredeemable and unwilling to follow the rules as you clain why <b>does</b> he apologize? Why <b>does</b> he abide by bans? Why <b>does</b> he accept blocks he could get around?

<dd><a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Pigsonthewing</a> has a history of taking advantage of loopholes in these and other restrictions, even while under injunction, to carry out the same activity without technically violating the rules.

<p>While it is unfortunate that it has to come to this, I feel compelled to point out that I was mildly shocked to discover moments ago that the above user was actually an admin.

<dd>Err. You really are making a fuss out of nothing. The result of the Requested Move was definitely a "no move". You were the only one to vote support.

<dd>Frivolous complaint, waste of noticeboard space. Enochlau is to be commended for not flaunting his adminship in the naming dispute on the article talk page. I note that Huaiwei brought up his assumption that enochlau therefore couldn't be an admin in a sarcastic manner ("enochlau, if you have just become an admin, let me know"); that Enochlau's "shocking exclamation" in response would fail to shock most readers, especially if put in the company of Huaiwei's own pugnacity and personal attacks on the article talk page; and that Huaiwei (scraping the bottom of the barrel) seeems to want to suggest above that there's something negatively noteworthy about an RFA candidate self-nominating.

<dd>His failure to state his adminsthip can either be interpreted as a case of "humility" in your books, or a case of "nonchalance" in mine. I think we have room for alternative views here, and no one should be in the position to chastise others for their "wastage of space" just because of these disagreements. You are free to speculate over the intentions behind my behavior. However, I would just like to remind, that as stated in <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a>, "<b>Some people apply higher standards to self-nominations, while others view them more favorably as showing initiative and desire to serve the community.</b>" You choose to consider his move as showing initiative or what have you.

<dd>That section of <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> is referencing applying higher standards to the vote to make someone an administrator, not their actions afterward. Self-nominated administrators who have successfully passed RFA are not held to a "higher standard" or put on "Administrative probation" or whatever you wish to call it. I haven't seen anything that Enochlau has done that is out of line; in fact, in everything I've seen, he's done exactly what's expected of him as an administrator. Your claim that it's a case of "nonchalance" (as though this is a bad thing) is ludicrous — where do you propose Enochlau inform you that he is an administrator? Had you bothered to spend less than 5 seconds checking whether he was an administrator, you would have seen that clearly stated in the first section of his user page. He isn't hiding it. Had Enochlau bragged about being an administrator, you likely would have filed a complaint about his lording it over you. What, exactly, is your complaint here? That he reverted your reversion of standard administrative fare? <span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; color: #333333">--<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell">bbatsell</a></span> | <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><span style="font-size: 10px; color: #C46100">« give me a ring »</span></a> 16:24, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And true as you say, I was refering to the "higher standards" perculiar to the voting process, which I note as lacking in discussions over his ability to handle disputes, especially those he was personally involved in. If I may remind, I posted this complaint over his poor dispute management, and not over his failure to declare his adminship status. My illustration of my shock over his behavior when it came to light that he was actually an admin demonstrates my point. How do my failure in checking his position (and why should I do that, unless, perhaps, I am looking to be personal against him?) absolve him of his behavior? My complaint is well documented above (and below). You have every liberty to take 5 seconds or more to read it.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 16:42, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The comment Bishohen quote underscores my point over the suitability of the above as an admin. "enochlau, if you have just become an admin, let me know", is precisely how I felt at that point, for I did not even realise he was one, for if he was, he certainly didnt give me the impression he was. Enochlau's dismissive attitude is certainly a cause for concern, and he appears to miss the point behind my complaint. I am concerned over his overall conduct, his inability to keep this cool when under stress, his inability in being inpartial when he is involved in a dispute (Such as <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_page_protection_b2ec.html#Chinese_New_Years_greetings_.28talk_.C2.B7_history_.C2.B7_watch.29" title="Wikipedia:Requests for page protection">requesting for a page protection in a dispute he is involved in when its purpose is debatable</a>), and his apparant lack of initiative in helping to resolve disputes. These are qualities are deemed very important for every admin, and I see none of these qualities in him by his behavior thus far.</p>
<p>The opening paragraphs of this article clearly states, that "<b>If you want to make an open informal complaint over the behaviour of an admin, you can do so here, but please only do either that, or file a RFC or RFAr, but not both. Please try to discuss things with the admin before bringing the issue here.</b>" This is precisely why I am choosing to post it here. I am not demanding an RFC, for I dont think the misbehavior thus described has reached that magnitude. But I do see a need to remind, that a self-nominated admin is not immune from the same expectations applied to all admins, if not more.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 16:04, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Huaiwei, your original complaint wasn't well-considered, and your posts slide steeply into utter unreasonableness. A little well-meant advice: the smart thing would be to stop arguing.

<dd>An RFC seemingly done more because its nominators cant decide for themselves which is the best way to win a content dispute rather then a genuine attempt to resolve a dispute is of little cause of concern to me.

I do wonder if your advise is well-intentioned anyhow, or it is more reflective of (or bears similarity to) collective bullying by a group of wikipedians from the same geographical area (or in some way or other related to it) against anyone who dared speak up against their continued persistance in introducing bias into wikipedia. If my comments are not "well-considered" or "slide steeply into utter unreasonableness", tells us why.

I don't think this belongs in the intro of the page as it stands. Maybe it belongs in the split up version as per DF's idea. SEW: I don't know what you've done to improve the refs.

<li>Um, is this part of SEW's edit war with WMC over citation styles?

<dd>I'm still trying to nail violators, yes.

I corrected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sea_level_rise&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=31580483" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sea_level_rise&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=31580483" rel="nofollow">(diff)</a> the information and added citations, as required by <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. As a major contributor to the article, I then also invited a peer review <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review/Sea_level_rise" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review/Sea_level_rise" rel="nofollow">(review)</a> to help further. Rather than also help improve the article, WMC deleted the changes because he doesn't have time to participate in Wikipedia. I don't see that listed as an acceptable reason for reversion.

<li>My two cents. I do not believe that it is violation of WMC's parole. His edit and the accompanying talk page note suggest that he deleted the paragraph out of a concern of the structure of the article. He did not express a desire to remove the content from public view; he just wanted to place it elsewhere. That does not need a reference in my opinion. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 15:00, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>He also refers to his deletion of references. Look at the above violation diff for the deletion of 42 citations at the end of the diff because he doesn't "have the patience to go checking through a pile of minor changes". Apparently he owns the article and changes require his approval when he has time. (<a href="../../../s/e/w/User%7ESEWilco_ba0d.html" title="User:SEWilco">SEWilco</a> 03:54, 23 December 2005 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>Um, it appears that WMC reverted the references back to inline citations, undoing SEW's conversion to footnotes. A brief glance at the diff would seem to suggest that no references were deleted outright; rather it that their style was changed. Correct me if I am mistaken. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 04:07, 23 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes that looks like the case, another part of their constant battle with references. Did the ArbCom rule on citation format? If not, there's really nothing we can do... <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 11:11, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You are mistaken, TenOfAllTrades. The deleted citations contained more information than only a URL. Try to find a replacement for a 404 link with only the URL. As <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> repeatedly states, full citations are needed. The style (numbered links) was the same, but additional citation content existed before the deletion.

<p><a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> is currently under several restrictions for 12 months following Apr 7 2005, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/RK_2#Remedies" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/RK_2#Remedies" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/RK_2#Remedies</a> These restrictions include “<i>RK is limited to one revert per twenty-four hour period on material directly or indirectly related to Jews and/or Judaism for a period of twelve months, with violations treated as violations of the three-revert rule and also resetting the twelve-month period. Determing what is directly or indirectly related shall be left to the discretion of the administrators.</i>" Another restriction he is under is "<i>RK is placed on standard personal attack parole for twelve months. If he makes any edits which are judged by an administrator to be personal attacks, then he shall be temp-banned for a short time of up to one week, and the twelve month period shall be reset.</i>".</p>
<p>He is fully aware of these limitations see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:RK&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12148085" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:RK&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12148085" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:RK&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12148085</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, he has not kept to the terms of his RFA and has repeatedly violated them. I am asking for enforcement of the ArbCom decision an for them to take appropriate action, which based upon the Remedy would seem to be a 1 week ban and a resetting of his 12 months of restrictions. The following is evidence of his violations.</p>
<p>Violations of Revert limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>He violated the 3rr rule and got blocked for 24 hours.

<dd>There's no provision for a block that I recall, even if you accept that it's a personal attack (I would call it a bit of an impolite nudge intended to prod him into answering me, not quite a personal attack). <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:35, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Right. And Neutrality has now replied confirming that I was, in fact, right.

<p>Hi, I am concerned by recent edits of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Baez_224a.html" title="John Baez">John Baez</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Sarfatti_a43b.html" title="Jack Sarfatti">Jack Sarfatti</a> by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.139.97.67_02e2.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.139.97.67">71.139.97.67</a> which suggest this may be a sock. Note tha the IP appears to correspond to dsl.snfc21.pacbell.net; apparently this anon is using a DSL line operated by Pac Bell in the San Francisco area. (Compare an email addy recently used by Sarfatti in recent UseNet posts). I have noticed a consistent pattern of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> edits expressing views favored by Sarfatti from IP addies registered to this ISP. The recent edits to <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Sarfatti_a43b.html" title="Jack Sarfatti">Jack Sarfatti</a> mostly speak for themselves. The edit to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Carlos_Baez_76e2.html" title="John Carlos Baez">John Carlos Baez</a> repeats <i>almost verbatim</i> a mischaracterization (the alleged <i>surpisingly candid</i> comment) which has been made by Jack Sarfatti in an UseNet posting (sorry, don't have the link for that, but you can Google for it). AFAIK, <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackSarfatti_1fbb.html" title="User:JackSarfatti">User:JackSarfatti</a> has been blocked indefinitely for misbehavior.

<dd>Could someone do a checkuser on that account? From my experience, whenever a edit replaces all instances of ' with \' it's because of a misconfigured PHP cgi proxy (magic_quotes_gpc is enabled but the script is not unescaping). If so, it should be indefinitely blocked as an open proxy (before it causes more quote damage). --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 19:30, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

His edits are borderline to however, and I did consider rolling them back to be 3RR-exempt. He will argue a single point, which would make for a valid content dispute, and change ten other points. These articles were so far below par that I didn't expect anybody to be watching them, let along consider them in some sort finished or adequate. I do recognize now that this person is serious, and I am unsure how to address this. From his editing behaviour, the user is borderline to troll and/or vandal. From his talk behaviour, he is just extremely clueless in both WP matters, and the subject matter (non-ISKCON Hinduism). If his edits improve to at least correspond to the point he makes on talk, I will consider him bona fide, even if his demands for an ISKCON-only pov are still totally unacceptable. If he continues his erratic behaviour, I will think it admissible to issue short warning blocks.

Here, Gibraltarian (as 212.120.225.93) says he attacks Ecemaml simply because "he is [a troll]". He doesn't even list any diffs to support his claim. He even calls Woohookitty "unworthy for adminship" (once again, not showing any "meat" to back up his claim). He even goes a step further in defacing Ecemaml's user page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AEcemaml&amp;diff=32603947&amp;oldid=30540098" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AEcemaml&amp;diff=32603947&amp;oldid=30540098" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>.

<p>Sir. My carefully constructed contribution to the topic of Subd have not merely been delteed, i have not had them returned-in order to edit or adjust them</p>
<p>It is necessary, in any situation, to analyse as well as document the subject. My experiences, which contain the evidence for a critique of a Subud failing, are a vital part of the history of Subud, and do not merely conern myself-just becasue I was involved. The problem of discord in Subd is a theme which is an undercurrent that needs to be addressed publicly, and there is a place in an encyclopedic volume to cover it, with appropriate neutral reporting and observation. Removing ALL of my comment was not EDIING of the topic. It was removal, or sanitising, of a vital factor which has a need to be included in any documentation of Subud.</p>
<p>You do not want personal stories-the "I did this" here, despite several people naming themselves as they edited their Wikipedia contribution. At this time, I do not wan to be the character in the story either. Just the story-or factor, or problem, is al that matter in th Subd topic. Bronte Grivell</p>

<p>It's Tony against AfD in single combat again. It's that time of the year.</p>
<p>Recently someone pained himself and nominated a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Welcome_to_tha_chuuch_mixtape_vol.1_4555.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Welcome to tha chuuch mixtape vol.1">stack of entries on Snoop Dogg mixes for deletion</a>. The articles were nothing more than track listings. In the ensuing discussion quickly consensus emerged that mixtapes and bootlegs are a dime to the dozen and generally too ephemeral to warrant a place in an encyclopedia, except when the material released there had a bearing on the artist's career. Bob Dylan comes to mind.</p>
<p>Now the material is back, cut-and-pasted into one single article. It doesn't fit the letter of CSD-G4 as "a substantially identical copy, by any title, of a page that was deleted according to the deletion policy", because the old stuff hasn't been deleted <i>yet</i> - the listing will continue a few days more, but it certainly fits the spirit.</p>
<p>Someone made the point than an encyclopedia article on Snoop Dogg mixes might be a good idea, but this copy-and-paste-job of track listings isn't it.</p>
<p>As a result of the failure of the quality control process in Wikipedia a prolific and competent editor has left the project. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AFuriousFreddy&amp;diff=32877289&amp;oldid=32782809" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AFuriousFreddy&amp;diff=32877289&amp;oldid=32782809" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 18:52, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>THe articles are subject to a mass listing for deletion. As an alternative to deletion of material on this significant body of work by a major rap artist, I am producing an article into which the material can be merged. This is normal editing behavior and I take except to Pilatus' patently false characterization of my activities as "It's Tony against AfD in single combat again." This is nothing more than a personal attack. I also take exception to your false statement that "the material is back". The material has never been deleted, so it cannot be "back". --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 18:58, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The material has been rejected as unsuitable altogether for Wikipedia.

<p>Everyone needs to calm down. I would like to reiterate that Tony is right that works by major artists like Snoop Dogg merit inclusion, regardless of AFD's opinion on the matter. Remember that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a bureaucracy -- we do not stick blindly to rules or the logic of process here.

<dd>Sorry Ryan, the albums discussed in both AfD's are <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixtapes.html" title="Mixtapes">mixtapes</a>, where other DJs re-issue the Dogg's material. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Welcome_to_tha_chuuch_mixtape_vol.1_4555.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Welcome to tha chuuch mixtape vol.1">original nomination</a> makes that very clear. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 20:49, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate compilation of information. And Wikipedia works by consensus. If consensus says that something is not encyclopedic, then Tony should learn to respect the fact that he isn't always correct. There have been occasions where there was a good argument that AFD had overlooked, but as Pilatus states this isn't one of them, and Wikilawyering doesn't cut it. Pilatus's first remark isn't particularly friendly, but Tony's response is also incivil. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 00:16, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>It seems to me that there are <i>often</i> cases where material that doesn't justify several articles can be meaningfully compiled into one. The present article doesn't strike me as terribly <i>interesting</i> -- it might be more worthwhile if it were used as an example to discuss the phenomenon of DJs putting out mixtapes. Nonetheless, I don't think that compiling a bunch of non-notable stubs (each eligible for deletion) into a single possibly-notable article is any kind of <i>abuse</i>. It's part of the ordinary operation of Wikipedia. Just because the individual stubs are deletable <i>doesn't</i> mean that consolidating them into an article is some kind of evil nasty disruption. Better to have all this material in one place than in a dozen. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 00:25, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

You will also see that very few have sources. When I asked him to give sources he would say things "promo photo, fair use" without giving a source. He has also removed many no source tags on his images put up by other users. He has done this on many images I have added no source to and I have warned him. When I noticed it happened again I fianlly looked at his recent changes with images and deleted the ones he had recently removed things from. This is endemic and I see no sign of respect for copyright. On the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walid_Shoebat_8f8a.html" title="Walid Shoebat">Walid Shoebat</a> images he told me it was from a TV network and he took the screenshot but he got it from copies he found online. He does have to cite where he got it since it wasn't a direct take form a TV. But, that's the least of the problems as I can see. I have warned him again and I wanted to run by the idea of a 24 block and progressively stepping it up if he continues to do this. He has been warned at least three times by me.

<p>Let's straighten a few things out. First, sock puppetry per se is ok: see <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a> and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser_policy" class="extiw" title="m:CheckUser_policy">m:CheckUser policy</a>. It's only the (quoting CheckUser policy) <i>abuse of sockpuppets use (and in particular voting twice under two different names) which is severely frowned upon.</i> I question whether that's happened here: have a look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Jewish_jurists_61f9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Jewish jurists">this</a>, where the socks actually voted <i>against</i> each other. In other cases, it's a matter of debate if the votes influenced the final outcome of the AfDs directly.</p>
<p>Balanced against that is the contribution history of the various accounts. I guess they were created to contribute to specific areas of the 'pedia (although <i>why</i> I don't know). But the fact remains that until they were used for voting they have contributed a lot to Wikipedia. It does seem a shame to potentially end those contributions over this.</p>
<p>The thing I'm most disappointed about though is people with CheckUser access saying "I think they're socks, I'm banning them, and my word is enough". It's <i>not</i>. {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESockpuppet_e3fe.html" title="Template:Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a>}} doesn't have a "evidence" parameter for nothing. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDan100_803a.html" title="User talk:Dan100">Talk</a>) 09:44, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have you considered that the users concerned might be friends who use the same IP address as a consequence of visiting one another's houses? People do that, you know. Did you consider the remedy of suggesting that they not use the same IP to vote in AfDs or that if one votes, the others cannot? They insist they are different people. Their track record would imply that they are, as Zordrac evidences. This looks a lot like vindictive action on the part of admins who couldn't get their way, Dave, in the absence of any actual evidence. You have ignored the other evidence that they are not sockpuppets -- no previous suspicious collusion, different editing interests etc. Can you not unblock them and give the admonition not to vote the same way on AfD -- admins to block indefinitely if they do? If they are socks, that will hurt in the way desired, and if they are not, you are not blocking useful contributors in error. Please consider it. There's a bad habit here of using blocking as a blunt weapon to <b>punish</b> those who get on the wrong side of admins. -- Grace Note.</dd>

<dd>Oh yes, of course! So for 7 months they waited "just in case", right? And, wait, on that actual vote they didn't actually collude at all. You forgot that bit. You'd think they'd have gone to a better effort given the 7 months of lying in wait, wouldn't you?

<dd>I think its premature to call the locations a lie, since the CheckUser info has not been released. From what I can gather from what <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">User:Kelly Martin</a> has said, they only used the same IP address twice - I am going to suggest somewhere in the period from 17-27 November 2005. And from what she said, on one of those occasions 3 of them used it, the other occasion there were 2. So I am going to go with a theory here - Poetlister visited RachelBrown's house every couple of days, and on one occasion her cousin Londoneye did as well. Whilst I guess its theoretically possible that Taxwoman might have, from what I can gather they didn't really know each other. Of course, it might be more than that, but until they release the CheckUser info <b>WHICH THEY ARE OBLIGATED TO DO</b> per <a href="../../../p/r/i/Wikipedia%7EPrivacy_policy_7b3a.html" title="Wikipedia:Privacy policy">Wikipedia:Privacy policy</a>, then I think that we should wait before making conclusions. All that we know at this stage is that they are different people and that there was no collusion. We don't know why these admins are insisting that CheckUser says that they are sock puppets. Until they present the evidence, we have to wait. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 14:55, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>See User:Zordrac/Poetlister#The_so-called_collusion. This is their collusion. Per User:Zordrac/Poetlister#Creation of accounts, accounts were created on 15 April 2005, 12 July 2005, 10 August 2005, 28 September 2005 and 3 December 2005. The only time when edits were on the same articles was from 17-27 November 2005. So for this fanciful theory of sock puppetry to be true, it would mean that from 15 April-17 November, a period of 7 months, they all laid in wait waiting for this 1 occasion when they would collude. And what was the collusion? Oh, it was to vote to keep a few <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html" title="List of Jews">List of Jews</a> articles - in which they all voted on different AFDs in a different manner on totally different days. Is that collusion anyway? Oh, but on top of that, <a href="../../../p/o/e/User%7EPoetlister_675f.html" title="User:Poetlister">User:Poetlister</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERachelBrown_1109.html" title="User:RachelBrown">User:RachelBrown</a> both edited the talk page of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_jurists_bebc.html" title="List of Jewish jurists">List of Jewish jurists</a> (only RachelBrown edited the actual page, apart from one very minor edit by Poetlister). And the so-called collusion was solely related to Poetlister criticising <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> for his abusive editing process. Oh, and for the record, she was right. He was engaging in abusive editing practises. I detailed that here: User:Zordrac/Poetlister#Lulu_Bad_Editing_timeline. So we are trying to suggest that this "collusion" made any difference. THERE WAS NO COLLUSION! Not only that, but even if there was, IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE! Oh, wait, do you believe that their contributions were somehow hiding what had really happened? I mean, I looked through EVERY EDIT EVER MADE BY ANY OF THE 5 ACCOUNTS. Was there something I missed? Something that a quick CheckUser can tell me that Wikipedia's detailed logs missed? Oh, and so you know, Wikipedia's privacy policy <a href="../../../p/r/i/Wikipedia%7EPrivacy_policy_7b3a.html" title="Wikipedia:Privacy policy">Wikipedia:Privacy policy</a> DOES PERMIT YOU TO RELEASE THE INFO if the users concerned ask for it. I think its safe to assume that they are asking. So release it already! Or else we will know that you are LYING, and that this is all a set up to protect an abusive user. Which is more logical? Yes, Occam's Razor applies. Occam's Razor tells us that this non-existent collusion didn't happen. Occam's Razor tells us that they could not be the same person. Perhaps they had a party one day mid-November and all got on to the computer together. Perhaps they visit each other? Maybe they use the same ISPs. Who knows. But they can't be the same person. It is fanciful nonsensical logic to suggest that. Nobody who has looked at the investigations could conclude that. Or, wait, do we just blindly trust admins? Wait on, according to <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">User:Kelly Martin</a>, I am violating <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> if I dare to suggest that an admin ever made a mistake. Bad me. Yet, in the same breath, she is allowed to violate AGF by not asking the people for an explanation for the CheckUser responses, and not having an Arbitration or anything. Why is it that <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">User:Antidote</a> had for himself a Request for Comment, even after it was already proven that he had sock puppets that were manipulating the votes (in the exact same issue)? <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_e661.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote</a>.

<p><i>I think its safe to assume that they are asking.</i> No, it's not "safe to assume" anything of the sort, especially since you're not in charge of deciding that, either. They would have to, you know, <i>actually ask</i>, wouldn't they? Not just go by whatever you happen to think is reasonable in your own mind.</p>

<p>Under a nice big header so people will notice&#160;:-)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sock puppets are fine unless they're used to disrupt Wikipedia (eg multiple voting) (See <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a> and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser_policy" class="extiw" title="m:CheckUser_policy">m:CheckUser policy</a>, which was agreed by the Board as being the governing policy for CheckUser access).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's look at this case. Yes, all the accounts are sock puppets. However they were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ATaxwoman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ATaxwoman" rel="nofollow">blocked by Mindspillage</a> with the only evidence being an edit summary of "used for edit warring/vote stacking/etc." The "evidence" parameter of {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESockpuppet_e3fe.html" title="Template:Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a>}}, when left on each user page, was conspicuously blank.</p>
<p>SlimVirgin, above, finally points out to me how these accounts were, for sure, being disruptive and are therefore blockable. Yes it needed spelling out to me, but that's because these accounts had made some damn good edits, and I hold the goal of writing an encyclopedia <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">above all else</a>. <b>This presentation of actual evidence is what should have been done at the very start of this whole saga</b>. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDan100_803a.html" title="User talk:Dan100">Talk</a>) 23:34, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh and regards the whole CheckUser evidence thing - some people made a right pig's ear of presenting the "evidence". That didn't help matters. However, it's entirely beside the true point (which I just outlined above), so I'm not going to say any more about it (unless poked).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I mean, Mindspillage and Kelly only wanted these accounts blocked because they felt that they had been used for disruption, not <i>just</i> because they were socks... right?&#160;;-) <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDan100_803a.html" title="User talk:Dan100">Talk</a>) 23:44, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I block people all the time without using the test templates. Know why? Because I write my own warnings. I came across an IP's talkpage last night that had nothing but two identical warnings, side-by-side: one from early January, one from late December. And that's just ridiculous.

<dd>I agree. When I come across a vandal who obviously knows what they're doing (and I try to set the bar for "obviously" high), the standard for "patiently warn" drops accordingly. Sometimes it drops as low as "oi, pull your head in or you get blocked". As, I hope, it should. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 02:36, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Ryan; if their vandalism is such a frequent problem (and this was all fairly slow blanking vandalism, that I could see, nothing egregious), then it should take next to no time to give them a few escalating warnings and then block. Obviously a number of these accounts were the same guy (close IP numbers make it clear) so warning each and every one of them wouldn't make sense, but promoting an attitude that says we block multi-day vandals without warning now is a very bad idea. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 03:47, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understood what you said, fuddlemark, and agreed — especially with the notion that the test templates aren't the important thing; the warnings are. (Though I'll note that the test templates do a good job of giving non-hostile, calm-sounding warnings, something some people might have trouble composing on the spot.) I guess I agree with Phil that we don't need to get to "nineteenth base", either — fourth would seem sufficient. Phil seemed to be calling the runner out somewhere between home and second, though, which I didn't agree with in this case, and he seemed to be advocating that we should all do so: a bad idea. Apologies in advance if I have misinterpreted anything. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 04:06, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Honestly, I'm in awe that we have four whole test templates that must be applied in sequence. We block when someone is obviously doing it deliberately, because we don't want to block over random experimental vandalism. When someone comes back EVERY DAY to vandalize an article, it's pretty obvious it's not a test. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 04:50, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I certainly never apply all four test templates in sequence. For obvious vandalism I apply, say, 2 and 4. Writing your own is good too. I think some people get hung up on the procedure—this applying all four in sequence is nonsense—but at the same time it's vital that people do remember to issue some kind of warning before blocking people. I think we're all in agreement on that. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 06:34, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The test templates are good in that they're well-written, and perfect for slowly introducing the clue-stick to an anon newbie vandal, who may get bitten if the cluestick is too-enthusiastically wielded. There's nothing wrong with what they actually <i>say</i>; the problem is when you get nine or ten (or even more than one!) identically-worded warnings on the one talkpage, any vandal with half a brain will start to wonder about just <i>how</i> serious we are ... <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 13:08, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

While, if I read him right, he isn't actually threatening himself to sue Wikipedia or anybody associated with it, he does seem to harp quite a bit on the alleged class-action suit that's being worked on against it, and insisting that we all have to clean up our acts or we're likely to lose everything we own. This hence appears to be an attempt to use the legal system to bully away the opposition to the changes he wants to make. (His conversations are extremely hard to follow due to the propensity on both his part and those he's talking with to leave their respective comments on the recipient's talk page instead of all in the same place as part of a conversation thread, meaning that anywhere you look you only see one side of a conversation like eavesdropping on somebody talking on the phone. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 19:48, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sure Jimbo trusts our judgment to moderate blocks as appropriate. We collectively have far more time than he. If the community of administrators and other editors wishes to monitor this situation, then I think it's quite reasonable to remove the block. We're not defying Jimbo's authority; rather, we're using our good judgment to carry out actions which previously might have seemed ill-advised. Plagiarism needs to be dealt with strictly, but I don't believe this specific ban will be productive.

<dd>No, it isn't OK to use protection to engage in an edit war. Carnildo should have asked for another person to review it. But you <i>initiated</i> the edit war by deleting a section of a Wikipedia guideline without even so much as an edit summary, and persisting in deleting that section even while the issue was being discussed on the talk page. That's <i>also</i> unacceptable behavior. See <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unclean_hands.html" title="Unclean hands">unclean hands</a>. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 10:28, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What would you have had him do? Unprotect it himself, furthering the offense? He was bold and removed a passage; as the talk page has demonstrated, this passage is highly disputed. He did the right thing by taking it up here and at <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> rather than further escalating the situation by unprotecting it himself.

<dd>It takes two to revert; and I think karmafist did the right thing in this case rather than escalating it further. Moreover, if you look at the history for <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>, you'll see a few people have removed the disputed passage, not just karmafist. As it's disputed, the correct course of action should be to reach consensus (or show that there ever <i>was</i> consensus) for the passage before re-inserting it. —Locke Cole 11:38, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I agree with you that posting here was less bad than escalating to wheel-war. I also agree (as noted above) that an edit-warring admin is not permitted to protect a page they're edit-warring on. However, "less bad" is not "good".</dd>

<dd>My points remain: First, edit-warring isn't OK, no matter how many people do it. It is bad behavior for <i>each</i> person involved; "jointly and severally" as the lawyers would say. <b>That includes you.</b> Second, it is not OK to delete a Wikipedia guideline without discussion. Even before anyone was reverting, Karmafist's initial act of deleting <i>without comment or discussion</i> a guideline he didn't like, was itself a bad thing to do.</dd>

<dd>An explanation, that <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Sharia</a> is the basis of law in some Muslim circles, so I guess the username ranks somewhere between <i>FuckThePolice</i> and <i>AnarchyDude</i> or something...but combined with the fact he is clearly <b>very</b> anti-Muslim, inserting known falsehoods, greatly POV statements, insults and similar into articles, and acknowledging that he is the sockpuppet of the banned <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsent_eea4.html" title="User:Absent">User:Absent</a> on his talk page, I think it's a pretty clear-cut case. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherurcij_4567.html" title="User talk:Sherurcij">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 18:02, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since there is no "Moving review" (heh&#160;:)), I guess this is best place to mention this. Basically, there was a request to move to/from (it's kind of involved due to "out-of-process" moves and multiple requests) <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numerals_48fc.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numerals">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a> to/from <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_numerals.html" title="Arabic numerals">Arabic numerals</a>, with the result being <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_numerals.html" title="Arabic numerals">Arabic numerals</a>. It had very high participation, around 40 users or so, and was quite controversial. So, in an effort of full disclosure I'm listing it here in case other admins want to review it (the discussion was on the talk page <a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EArabic_numerals_890a.html" title="Talk:Arabic numerals">Talk:Arabic numerals</a>), and/or reverse it if they so desire (try to avoid a wheer war though&#160;:)).
