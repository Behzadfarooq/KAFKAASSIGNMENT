<p>Just to let everyone know: Someone pointed me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Blackyheartiez&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36026283" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Blackyheartiez&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36026283" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit. Seeing that I knew people who died in the World Trade Center attacks, I find that calling me a terrorist is mildly disgusting and generally a mean thing for us to just brush off. If we want to get really technical about it, we have several policies that specifically talk about this sort of thing, such as <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>. I have politely asked that Blackheartiez remove the statement from his user page, and I am informing the admins that I am trying to deal with this in as cool of a manner as possible. If someone can back me up (or fight this for me; I don't want to lose it because of these lowlives), I'd appreciate it.. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 01:08, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>By way of background, almost all Jews consider Messianic Judaism (a form of Judaism which honors Jesus as the Messiah) to be a contradiction in terms. The article has a long history of being heavily slanted against the practice of MJ, and has often had statement of dubious truth value.</p>
<p>OpenInfo, however, has crossed some lines. He engaged in hate speech on my user page <a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENathanZook_f523.html" title="User talk:NathanZook">User_talk:NathanZook</a> (now <a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENathanZook_Archive_1_3135.html" title="User talk:NathanZook/Archive 1">archived</a>)in response to an erroneous post I made on his talk page <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenInfo_48ef.html" title="User talk:OpenInfo">User_talk:OpenInfo</a>. This I ignored, although others did not. He appears to have revereted <a href="../../../m/e/s/Talk%7EMessianic_Judaism_8daf.html" title="Talk:Messianic Judaism">the MJ talk page</a>. And he has stated that one organization, which I specifically disavowed, has been given "millions and billions of dollars..." AFAIC, he has demonstrated that he is a conspiracy "nut". I know of no way to reason with such an individual.</p>

However, rather than follow posted policy or find the citations, they would rather argue publically, which tells me, at least, that they have no interestin fact, rather only their agenda.

<p>Hi, I'm editing the wikipedia page on Mono. User Miguel.de.Icaza is always attacking me and he calls me a DotGNU advocate. He cannot be objective at all. It is like if Bill Gates would edit the wikipedia page on Windows. Can anyone limit his access to edit the wikipedia page on Mono, so that his limit to edit he page is limited to *strictly factual*?</p>

If you cannot engage in dialogue with someone there is no way to resolve your dispute.

<dd>Why you don't just make everyone register before any editing and stick this to the top. If this is not allowed at all just remove this possibility. So being said this is very strange from wikipedia admins. [krokas]
<dl>
<dd>Well, please start thinking about this policy now, because it's very important. Articles are written on <i>article pages</i>. Comments about articles are written on <i>talkpages.</i> You're allowed to edit text posted by other people on article pages, that's what being a wiki means. You're not allowed to make any changes in signed comments posted by other people on talkpages, or to delete any part of them. Doing that is against policy, is dishonest (making others appear to say, and sign, something they never did say, making them appear to not have replied although they did, etc, etc), and makes dialogue impossible. Therefore, as Rhobite says, desist immediately from changing or removing other people's comments on talkpages, or there's nothing to talk about. I hope this clears things up. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:25, 23 January 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>User Miguel.de.Icaza tells absolutely wrong things about me that are false. Wikipedia is not his blog and he tells non-sense. He has written false things about me in the Talk|page, and they look to have the only purpose to not allow me add my opinion, as he didn't address me. And if an opinion of anyone is different to the opinion of User Miguel.de.Icaza it doesn't mean to be a wrong one. Very indicative is that user Kesla did agree with the existence of the term. And User Miguel.de.Icaza only attacked me about the frase "Portable .NET doesn't have any problem with patents" by saying to copy/past his email to User Kesla in the Wikipedia page. Only then he started to attack me because of the term "proprietary open source", which in fact does exist, and which was used on the wikipedia page already for 2 months, before user Miguel.de.Icaza didn't start his attack to me.</dd>

<dd>I'm neutral, so I don't have a way.

<dd>Strange that you complain about it being "badly" done... I don't think you would've intervened if the first poll was won by "River Plate" proponents... who DID create that poll. Finally, if you wanted to do a "proper" RM, you should've discussed the options for the naming vote before opening the polls, since some people disagree with the choices that were arbitrarily given. Giving two options for "Rio de la Plata" (with and w/o diac) only confused readers, such as myself, and some may not have realized that they could vote for both. If you solve that problem, I would be more amenable to let the whole issue go and wait until the 2nd poll is over to make further comments regarding this RM. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastiankessel_8c89.html" title="User:Sebastiankessel">Sebastian Kessel</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastiankessel_cf55.html" title="User talk:Sebastiankessel">Talk</a></i></sup> 19:04, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with violetriga on the need for a new poll (although I disagree with her opinion on the name itself); however, I do not agree that the original poll was "not correctly done" -- rather that it simply became an out-of-control mess. The move request discussion had degnerated into a morass of vitriol and ill-will, with accusations that the one or more earlier moves had been done inappropriately. While there was a majority voting to keep the name at <a href="../../../r/%C3%AD/o/R%C3%ADo_de_la_Plata_36bb.html" title="Río de la Plata">Río de la Plata</a>, that cannot accurately be described as a "consensus". At best, it can be said that there was no consensus to rename the article. But since several had questioned the validity of earlier moves, this all became rather convoluted, to say the least--thus the need for a new poll. BTW, you may not have looked hard enough for the entry on WP:RM, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requested_moves&amp;diff=36083281&amp;oldid=36078159" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requested_moves&amp;diff=36083281&amp;oldid=36078159" rel="nofollow">the entry</a> was added at 13:01, January 21, 2006 UTC, more than three hours before your note above. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 19:03, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I wouldn't characterize the discussion as an "out of control mess", but it was certainly going nowhere. That said, the poll itself wasn't conducted in the best manner possible, and I suspect <i>intentionally</i>, so that the losing/initiating side could fall back on the failure as an excuse to look for more hanging chads. As I said on the talk page there, I'm [still] not prepared to question violetriga's neutrality, although I do [continue to] question whether or not s/he read the discussion thoroughly. I'm not opposed to revoting, as long as the "losing" side (yes, in most cases, it really has degenerated to "sides") agrees to leave the issue rest for at least a year, regardless of which name prevails (and I'm the one who made the move!)... Given the resorting to sockpuppetry of at least one of the "River Plate" proponents, I'm not sure that wish will come true, but... In the future, violetriga, may I just suggest that more prominent notice of the <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> entry be given where the discussion is actually taking place, rather than just the template at the top of the article (to which nobody's paying any attention anymore). Also, whoever closes the poll, please summarily archive the talk page...I swear it's the longest single-issue talk page on all of en:WP. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 09:11, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think the poll needed to have a more prominent notice - there are plenty of votes there already, and those that have not voted this time but did last time will be notified shortly before the deadline date.

Onefortyone has re-inserted the text twice, ignoring my request that he wait for comments from other editors, and attacking me in an edit summary: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cary_Grant&amp;oldid=36279414" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cary_Grant&amp;oldid=36279414" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <i>Could it be that you do not like sources which prove that Cary Grant was bisexual?</i> I went to Onefortyone's talk page and discovered that he is on probation for just this sort of behavior.

<dd>My argument is that the single source is not reliable, as it relies on double-hearsay and its accuracy is in question. While the text can easily be balanced with counterarguments (Grant's widow and one surviving ex-wife both vigorously argued in TCM's documentary on Grant that he was heterosexual), a battle of hearsay sources isn't my idea of encyclopedic. | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 01:23, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But all Grant's wives have to go for evidence was . . . hearsay. They weren't with him every minute. They weren't married to him when he was with Scott. One of them wasn't even born. All they had to go on is things he <i>might</i> have said to them (how many gay or bisexual husbands tell their wives the truth?) or they <i>might</i> have heard from other people. In other words, hearsay. If the <i>personal opinions</i> of ex-wives count, so do the personal opinions of colleagues and friends. It is all or nothing.

<dd>That's what I said - hearsay is not good enough for an encyclopedia, and unless we have something stronger than a questionable author saying that someone told him that someone else said Grant was gay or bisexual, it shouldn't be in the article. Onefortyone has no other sources than that one book; the comment from Arthur Laurents is completely unsourced, while the line about <i>Bringing Up Baby</i> is unsourced and probably irrelevant, as it's based on his own interpretation of the word "gay" in the film's dialogue. My point for the original post is that Onefortyone's probation appears to require him to strongly verify edits about the sexual orientation of actors and actresses. These edits appear to violate the probation. | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 02:18, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This quote is from that last link: <i>There is no conclusive evidence that Grant was bisexual.</i> (That's the conclusion of a graf on his sexuality.) If a site dedicated to the topic of LGBT culture in Hollywood says that there's no conclusive evidence, then Onefortyone's edits are merely rumors, which don't belong in an encyclopedia. | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 03:56, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The source only says that there is "no conclusive evidence", which means that there is some evidence, supported by hearsay of the time. Biographers are frequently discussing the topic. Certainly rumors are part of a celebrity's history, especially if there are several independent sources which support the claims. 80.141.240.145 04:07, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Onefortyone has posted the text of the Laurents source on <a href="../../../c/a/r/Talk%7ECary_Grant_905c.html" title="Talk:Cary Grant">Talk:Cary Grant</a>. It's clear that Laurents himself was unsure of Grant's sexual orientation and had no concrete evidence to say that Grant was gay or bisexual. In other words, Onefortyone's edits do not match the source material.

<p>Hello, I am requesting help with a particular admin here that has stated I could be banned for what my personal position is on discussing matters with other Wikipedians. For some background information and I also want to clearly state my problem. I joined Wikipedia in December of 2005 in response to the actions taken concerning the wiki article "wehatetech" or "we hate tech." The article has been pulled several times and I do understand that once it's voted on somehow, not exactly clear on that, it's removed from the encyclopedia. I am NOT here to fight for that particular article. i understand that there is a guideline for articles, BUT my observation and opinion is that the rules were not followed properly in the process of deletion. Why am I still here? Well, in a nutshell, I have seen people removed from the site or blocked for various reasons I also do not agree with, but it up to those individual people to address their removal. I decided to stay in order to provide constructive criticism of the deletion process and to add another viewpoint to the issue. I feel improperly judged, reading from responses to my post, a "one issue candidate" and have been threatened with removal from the site, being a sock-puppet for "we hate tech" and accused of "cluttering" talk pages.</p>
<p>My purpose is not to clutter the site or be on any type of mission to tear down Wikipedia. I wish to understand why certain things happen here and hope to add thoughtful insight and more information to topics in order to resolve an issue. I do feel like I am being pushed around and generally really upset with the whole process with a select group of individuals either working behind the scenes or posting on my talk page. Two Wikipedians have stood out in this whole situation, <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">User:Haikupoet</a> and admin <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>. I have had several exchanges with both, with Haikupoet moving one comment and then deleting my response to because I was under the impression that it was deleted. My response comment was then deleted, which resulted in the blocking User:Xerves. The block happened due to a supposed "legal threat" by "Zoe" which has now threatened me with the same. It's not MY forum I am promoting. I am a member of such forum and website <a href="http://www.wehatetech.com" class="external free" title="http://www.wehatetech.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wehatetech.com</a> and I am NOT trying to promote in the first place.</p>
<p>I AM promoting that fellow Wikipedians discuss issues and not stomp over other postings by others. I am being totally honest and upfront. I do not have a hidden agenda. Have I been totally innocent? No, there are two comments / edits on my behalf that broke regulation. i was dealt with in a proper manner by those admins and I am thankful for that. If further investigation yields that I be removed from Wikipedia then so be it, as long as I am adequately told as to such infractions. i only wish to resolve this issue. i have deleted none of my post and will not edit any of my post to make myself appear in a different light. Everything is available through my user history.</p>

<li>I'm <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">User:Haikupoet</a>, and I thought I'd tell my side. First off, I moved Kmac's posting from my main page to my talk page. If that's not allowed, than I apologize, but I think it entirely reasonable as talk pages are where that sort of thing is supposed to go. Second, I have tried to explain to all parties involved in the Wehatetech mess how Wikipedia is supposed to work (check my user page for a summary of what I've tried to tell all of them). What I think we have here is a clearcut case of refusal to understand the system -- the WHT crew simply don't want to accept "nonnotable" as a reason for disinclusion in Wikipedia, and continue to try to force the issue long after any other AfD would have run its course and been forgotten. As for Xerves' comments and subsequent banning, he did not threaten me, it is true, but he did threaten (implying that he was speaking for the WHT community as a whole IMHO) to drag the fight out until they get what they want. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 00:42, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I told Kmac that if he were to carry out his threat to disrupt Wikipedia by repeated insertions of wehatetach, then he could be blocked for <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKmac1036&amp;diff=36268275&amp;oldid=36111827" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKmac1036&amp;diff=36268275&amp;oldid=36111827" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>). I said nothing to him about legal threats. The legal threat was made by Xerves, as I explained above. <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#User:Xerves" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">#User:Xerves</a>. Kmac is also repeatedly accusing me of having blanked his User page, which is not true, and which I repeatedly try pointing out to him that he can read the history to see that I have made no edits to his page, but he repeatedly accuses me of using "admin tools" to hide my edit. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:20, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I assume "cercemsission" is supposed to be "circumcision". The RfC does not concern circumcision, however, it concerns gross incivility that is, in fact, an egregious part of the user's disruption, as it happens, of circumcision-related articles. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 08:10, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Statements such as "Since that time he's been obsessed with circumcision-related articles...edits to such articles comprising well in excess of 95% of his subsequent edits. First contribution [4] on the subject is incivil, unproductive and overtly trollish. Circumcision-related edits have overwhelmingly dominated subsequent contributions " make me question that. The number of people signing up is low enough to make any claims of dissrupting wikipedia questionable.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 08:35, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So it's OK then if his disruption is limited then to a narrow group of articles and his personal attacks limited to just a few editors, notably those with whom he happens to disagree who, as it happens, contribute to those articles? Until you actually take the time to go through his contribs, it seems to me you should reserve judgment. I think we're done here, as this has now become a discussion of his RFC tho, not of his continued disruption. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 09:00, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The blocklog indicates that User:Hotrocks was blocked as a Willy on Wheels.

Presumably, all their moves have been deleted, so it seems hard to verify whether they were in fact Willy or not.

On the <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EAvoid_using_meta-templates_5249.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Avoid using meta-templates">talk page</a>, Netoholic had proposed that "Avoid using meta-templates" be renamed to a stronger term, e.g. not using the word "avoid". Recently, I've done just that, making it "No meta-templates" (which also conforms nicely with other policy page names) and updated the many redirects. Netoholic is apparently angry with me (see <a href="../../../l/e/e/Talk%7ELeet_d834.html" title="Talk:Leet">Talk:Leet</a> for the dispute) and has reverted this (breaking the redirects in the progress) on grounds that it "wasn't proposed on the talk page". Now 1) a good-faith rename needn't be discussed, and 2) he was the one that proposed this in the first place. Since he didn't respond to my question why, I've protected the page from moving for a short while, because moving back-and-forth is a bit pointless.

<dd>I would say this warrants a block. But the question is what this would help. This is a wiki. We do have to learn how to integrate the good sides of Netoholic. And, believe it or not, the timining of the move that Radiant did on <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> couldn't have barely be worser (in so far I must agree with Neto as per "knowing how to push Neto's button", the thing is this button is so prominent on Neto's surface that it takes an extreme amount of self control <i>not</i> to touch it). The tricky thing is that Netoholic has sound technical knowledge but cannot accept opposition to any of his edits. The worst thing Netoholic did in the past was at <a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELanguage_39a6.html" title="Template:Language">template:language</a> where the people around that (Garzo and others) have clearly stated that they are about to implement <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> but Netoholic constantly pushes his own "Netoholic way" of how to implement that. For Neto, speed of implementing <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> seems to go over anything else. Maybe a block for a week or two would be in order, but do not expect that Neto will change his mind by that. This would at least give the people at template language time to implement their solution without interruption by Netoholic.

<p>Is it true that <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Netoholic_2_dbb6.html#Namespace_and_revert_restriction" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Netoholic 2">restrictions placed on Netoholic by ArbCom</a> are actually in place?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.1) Netoholic is banned from editing in the Wikipeedia and template namespaces for twelve months, and restricted to one revert per page per day. This remedy is suspended while the mentorship in remedy 3 is in effect, and may be cancelled if the mentors consider the mentorship has been successful. The twelve months is counted from the date of the arbitration committee decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Passed 5 to 0 at 22:40, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This remedy was suspended while Netoholic was under mentorship. However, the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Netoholic_2_dbb6.html#Update" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Netoholic 2">update</a> clearly states that the mentorship failed and the above ban is in effect. There is no notice to say otherwise, so I believe that Netoholic has been in contravention of this ban since July. I would like clear opinion on this statement, as this user has been particularly rude and disruptive of late and there seems to have been no remedy for his actions. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 12:15, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a somewhat complex situation. Yes, he is banned from Wikipedia and Template namespaces, and that is technically in force ever since the mentorship failed. About amonth ago he made a request on RFAr that this ban be lifted. The ArbCom has not responded to that, except for a short remark by Raul654 that <i>"several arbitrators (myself and David Gerard in particular) have expressed approval of what Netoholic has been doing vis-a-vis killing metatemplates and possibly creating some sort of exception for that."</i> The point is really that Neto is doing a good job on templates, but doing it in an overly abrasive way. Also, he's been doing some things not related to templates (e.g. <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leet.html" title="Leet">Leet</a>) that are something less than a good job.
<ul>
<li>The easiest solution would be to simply enforce the ban as imposed, until and unless the ArbCom sees fit to change that.</li>
<li>A <i>more productive solution</i> would be to allow him to continue to do good work on templates, but have someone watch him to for instance impose a zero-revert rule and a personal attack parole. That would be somewhat akin to his earlier mentorship. However, it is quite possible that such a watcher would find himself between a rock and a hard place.</li>
<li>And of course the third solution would be to ignore it as we have now, and hope the incivility doesn't get out of hand.</li>

<p>I will unblock instantly if anyone blocks Netoholic over this. He's enforcing an oft-disregarded policy and taking the time to do it properly, and a majority of members of the arbitration committee have given him their explicit consent to do so - preventing this sort of activity was not what anyone had in mind with the original ban.

<dd>If you are interested I can provide you with a lot of edits which can clearly <i>not</i> be referred to as <i>"He's enforcing an oft-disregarded policy"</i>.

The key word is <i>enforcement</i>: it is not Netoholic's job to enforce any policy. In fact, giving a user who has a history of uncivil conduct such powers is bound to cause problems. If the ArbCom are serious about lifting the ban, they should do so on the relevant page. The consensus here is growing that we need tools to control Netoholic's consistent incivility. Giving him <i>unblockable</i> status in this way will make the situation worse: he already seems to think he can do anything. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 15:58, 18 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ambi, please read my previous post again and what I said about a more productive solution? While Neto is certainly working on an oft-disregarded policy, there is substantial doubt on whether he is doing it properly. If you don't believe me, check his contribs log for the last few days and count the amount of revert wars and personal attacks. There has been a request by him on the RFAr page to rescind his probation for over a month now, that only a single arbiter has responded to. It is a longstanding tradition that good edits do not by themselves excuse bad edits, and if in upholding one policy (AUM) he is breaking several others (CIV/NPA/AGF, WP:POINT and the spirit of 3RR) he is not doing a good job. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 16:38, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Netoholic is enforcing his interpretation of <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he's doing it correctly or in a way that the developers would approve of. If you read WP:AUM and <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EAvoid_using_meta-templates_Archive_7eb6.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Avoid using meta-templates/Archive">Jamesday's comments</a> again, you'll see that constant editing of templates is just as bad for server load as templates within templates, and Netoholic's constant revert warring of templates is actually a violation of WP:AUM.</dd>

<dd>Actually, it is. "Netoholic was arguably completely technically correct — but he interacted so negatively with others that he actually convinced people he was not."

<dd>This has nothing to do with the developer-mandated policy. It has to do with his behavior, which hasn't changed at all since the ban or mentorship. We can handle the policy without his "help".

<dd>It's really disappointing to see my efforts being mischaracterized like this. I have recieved <i>several</i> compliments on my template conversions, and in fact, that conversion has inspired many creative uses for templates. In the months that my ban was fully in force, I stayed away, happily. I was drawn back by people contacting me about templates, and specifically the abominations that are the "conditional templates". Unfortunately, because of the nature of how wide-spread my work is in template-land, I have a much higher chance of running into the occasional <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">cliques</a> and <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">OWNers</a>. I can do nothing more than provide the alternative and point to the justification (<a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>). Often, I will try convincing them for a few days, even providing fully working replacements for them, and then leave it be for a few days. Everyone speaking negatively of me in this thread (except Radiant!, oddly) is someome that has had one of their templates challenged by me. I am still "completely technically correct", but that just makes egos bruised even more because they think I'm implying, by fixing or challenging their use of templates, that they've done <i>bad</i> work.

<li>Maybe you don't have a problem with "many many editors" but you do seem to have a problem with most editors you interact with. Apparently everyone that has had one of their templates challenged by you is someone that speaks negatively of you.

<li>You've got your logic reversed... the people here complaining have had there templates challenged by me. I make a ton of edits in the template space, of which the smallest fraction turn into problems.

I do try and respect the aims of those others, and try to present alternatives in good faith. What's happening here, especially with Garzo, Omegatron, and Adrian Buehlmann, is a pile on attack. They see weakness in an adversary, and go for it.

<li>Maybe you can point people to some examples of where your work has been appreciated (and note here that just because nobody noticed your unilateral changes and didn't complain doesn't mean it met with approval).

<li>Netoholic and I don't agree on alot of things (like... say, which way is 'up'), but his hard work has certainly been appreciated by many people. I recall seeing thanks for his work on the 'warbox' (now 'Infobox Military campaign' or something like that), 'Infobox City', something with dog breeds, and several others... just from what I've seen in floating around the same areas. No, compromise and dealing with conflict aren't his strongest suits, but where those issues don't arise he has done a tremendous amount of very beneficial work. His conversion of the 'taxobox' template was a major accomplishment that is now being used extensively. The 'pulling the rug out' analogy isn't inaccurate, but it is usually possible to be standing by with a new rug for the nice people and little harm done. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 19:57, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've not really interacted with Netoholic that much during this meta template brou-ha-ha, but I have done so a little. I find the user's attitude to be unhelpful, unnecessarily confrontational, and prone to unilateral actions without so much as letting people know what is going on. A prime example of this is <a href="../../../s/h/i/Template%7EShip_table_0f5a.html" title="Template:Ship table">Template:Ship table</a>. It was previously a hodge-podge of template code, extremely complicated and prone to breaking if people did not follow complex instructions exactly. I then switched it over to the IF and then QIF templates because they were an elegant solution to the problem of optional rows. This, of course, is part of the series of actions that have provoked howls from the devs about server load. A few days ago I was alerted by another member of the Wikiproject Ships that Netoholic had unilaterally declared my template to be deprecated due to the crusade against meta templates. Netoholic had also developed a 'replacement' that used the CSS trick for hiding rows. Other users had tried to turn Ship table into a version without QIF by using the CSS trick and had nearly succeeded. There were three or four examples of QIF that needing expunging. When I found out what was going on I got rid of the last examples of QIF from the template since the really wanted functionality, ie hidden optional rows in a table, is now available in a way that does not overload the servers. I did this in a manner which did not break existing tables using the template at all. If I could do that in less than an hour why did Netoholic not post a message on my talk page about the possible solutions to the meta template situation? Why did Netoholic not work with me to fix the Ship table template? Why was it someone else who alerted me to what was going on? It is because Netoholic is behaving like a bull in a china shop and is consequently being very disruptive to Wikipedia's smooth running. I see no reason for relaxing the ArbCom ruling, and if it has been relaxed it should go back into effect fully. The negative contributions of Netoholic to Wikipedia are vastly outweighing the positive at the moment. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 01:15, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is clear that a number of users find Netoholic difficult to work with, particularly when working on templates. It is also clear that ArbCom has found against Netoholic and has issued a ban against editing templates. The revoking of this ban has not been clearly set out. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 00:24, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Netoholic's request for clarification about his ban is <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Netoholic" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">here</a>.</p>
<p>The "policy" that Netoholic is enforcing was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;oldid=10032966" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;oldid=10032966" rel="nofollow">written by himself</a> in February 2005, in response to <a href="../../../s/i/s/Template_talk%7ESisterproject_d2e4.html#This_template_should_never_be_used" title="Template talk:Sisterproject">a comment</a> in January that he didn't have the authority to say "calling one template from another is a bad practice". It was originally his interpretation of developer <a href="../../../s/i/s/Template_talk%7ESisterproject_d2e4.html#Technical_impact_of_templates_like_this" title="Template talk:Sisterproject">Jamesday's comments about Sister Project templates</a>, though it has been warred over perpetually since then.</p>
<p>He persisted in trying to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=17170648&amp;oldid=15177225" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=17170648&amp;oldid=15177225" rel="nofollow">make it a guideline</a>, which was heavily disputed. It was eventually declared policy and his ban violations ignored, strictly because of the connections to "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=32756105&amp;oldid=31891220" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=32756105&amp;oldid=31891220" rel="nofollow">lead developer</a>" Jamesday and the server load issue. Recently, the claims about server load and the consensus of the developers were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=36043188&amp;oldid=36039987" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=36043188&amp;oldid=36039987" rel="nofollow">largely invalidated</a> by lead developer <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion Vibber</a>. His comments on the issue were, of course, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=36047941&amp;oldid=36047614" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates&amp;diff=36047941&amp;oldid=36047614" rel="nofollow">immediately removed</a> by Netoholic, and guideline status re-imposed.</p>
<p>So, basically, he wrote up his own policy and used its status as an excuse for all kinds of abusive behavior, knowing that admins like <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=35682908&amp;oldid=35682265" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=35682908&amp;oldid=35682265" rel="nofollow">have his back no matter how disruptive he is</a>.</p>
<p>Funny... he was accused of doing the <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.english/15044" class="external text" title="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.english/15044" rel="nofollow">exact same thing</a> two years ago on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28television%29_fd20.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (television)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (television)</a>.</p>

<dd>I would have called that afd as delete.

No-one is arguing that the working group is worthy of an article.. There's been a sockpuppet check which indicated vote stacking previously.

<li>Can I just point out that firstly none of the sockpuppets took part in the 2nd AFD. Only 4 sockpuppets took part in the first AFD and the result was 19-5, thus without sockpuppets it would have been 15-5. However, I understand that some of the comments by the sockpuppets could have possibly influenced peoples minds…although it was vigorously pointed out that there were sockpuppets in it by Peter_S. and DreamGuy, thus people were less likely to be influenced by them as they were made aware. There’s also a TV show about aladin’s daughter and family on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Channel_f606.html" title="National Geographic Channel">National Geographic Channel</a> called <a href="http://nationalgeographic.com.au/front_new/watch/default.asp?mode=program&amp;tdatetime=12%2F23%2F2004+6%3A30%3A00+AM" class="external text" title="http://nationalgeographic.com.au/front_new/watch/default.asp?mode=program&amp;tdatetime=12%2F23%2F2004+6%3A30%3A00+AM" rel="nofollow">Running For Freedom: Roxanna's Story</a> and he’s been on a radio station called <a href="http://www.familytechshow.com/archives/000146.html" class="external text" title="http://www.familytechshow.com/archives/000146.html" rel="nofollow">The Family Tech Show</a>.

<li>Indeed, this is not a 3RR violation. However, I stand by the opinion that this is excessive reverting. Thus, I should have said "blocked for revert warring" rather than "blocked for 3RR". If people are of the opinion that making a number of sequential reverts is perfectly fine as long as one sticks to the letter of policy and makes exactly three reverts per day, they should probably unblock. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 14:58, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>If one editor is reverting, and a group of other editors opposes this by also reverting, both sides are engaging in a revert war. There was discussion ongoing on the talk page; either side could have stopped reverting at any time. The page is protected now; I see no need to block one party, effectively halting the discussion, when there is no longer any way for the revert war to continue. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 17:10, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes, the 3RR doesn't imply a right to revert three times a day. It's the reverting without waiting for consensus to emerge that is the disruptive behavior. I'll say this till I'm blue in the face, there are few edits so urgently needed that they can't wait until consensus emerges. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 16:34, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Note: there has been a related revert war at <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladdin_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Aladdin (disambiguation)">Aladdin (disambiguation)</a> over whether this page should include a link to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin_%28magician%29.html" title="Aladin (magician)">Aladin (magician)</a> or not. It seems clear to me that <b>if</b> the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin_%28magician%29.html" title="Aladin (magician)">Aladin (magician)</a> article is to be retained, and particularly if <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin.html" title="Aladin">Aladin</a> is to redirect to the dab page (as it now does) then the dab page should include an entry for the magician, while <b>if</b> the page for the magician is to exist only in the histroy for the redir, or is to be deleted compeltely, then there is no reason for an entry on the dab page.

<dd>But the article isn't going to be retained (as the vote clearly said to get rid of it) so the mention there isn't needed. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 03:20, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's the summary on what happened with this page:</p>
<p>1) A group of now proven sockpuppets created the article at <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin.html" title="Aladin">aladin</a> claiming that such and such articles in such and such papers said such and such about the guy, which turned out to be false.</p>
<p>2) First AfD: The sockpuppetws were voting and a number of editors just took them at their word that these sources said what the sockpuppet (apparently "aladin" himself) claimed they did. Delete failed.</p>
<p>3) Page was updated to only include facts that could be verified and to remove all false claims. Turns out there wasn't much of anything there any more, nothing worth having a Wikipedia article about. A number of editors agreed the article had to go, but we wanted to preserve the talk page and history to prove the hoax and the sockpuppeting should the guy come back later.</p>
<p>4) I redirected the page, as there was nothing left. One editor complained that redirecting wsa the same as deleting so we should have a vote. AfD part 2... But those of us who exposed the hoax didn't want the proof of the hoax deleted, so we voted "KEEP BUT REDIRECT". Keep article on Wikipedia was small minority of votes, overwhelmingly reject by the outright deletes and redirect.</p>
<p>5) AfD 2 ends without it being outright deleted but with the clear consensus to either delete or redirect without preserving contents. So I redirect.</p>
<p>6) Now we have a person comlaining that the vote was "keep" so that it therefore can;t be redirected... OK, so, the argument I guess is if you want the page to stay, consensus to redirect isn;t enough, and then voting to redirect isn;t enough either, in fact apparently there is no way to redirect at all. I ignored this person as clearly not understanding how things work and trying to wikilawyer the results to do what only a tiny minority wanted.</p>
<p>7) Then some uninformed outside person came out of nowhere and decided to move the entire article to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin_%28magician%29.html" title="Aladin (magician)">aladin (magician)</a> and redirect <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin.html" title="Aladin">aladin</a>, which ignores the whole point that the redirect was intended to get rid of the article but preserve the history and talk. Now we have people arguing there that it can;t be redirected because nobody looking for the magician would be looking to be redirected to Aladdin, except the only reason that's even there in the first place is someone jumped in and overruled everyone who voted.</p>
<p>8) So, basically, we have a couple of people clearly ignoring the wishes of the majority of people who voted, demanding that redirects can never happen without a vote and then ignoring the vote when it happens, and edit warring to overrule clear consensus... and then *I* get blocked for not violating any rules or policies whatsoever? Very, very poor form. Radiant, for future reference, when you screw up and miscount a 3RR violation, the proper thing to do when your error is pointed out to you is to undo the block, not let it stand just because you are grumpy. If you wanted to protect the page, then protect it. If you want to go beyond policy and start blocking people for edit warring, there is a long list of people you should have alsoblocked at the same time.</p>
<p>I think what needs to be done to restore sanity on this page is to move <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin_%28magician%29.html" title="Aladin (magician)">aladin (magician)</a> back to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin.html" title="Aladin">aladin</a> to preserve the comments and history there, then redirect like was originally agreed upon but that some people ignoring policy and common sense keep trying to get around. Creating the new article served no purpose whatsoever other than to try to keep an article the vote didn;t want kept and was only there in the first place from a series of hoax sources from a group of sockpuppets to be used for self-promotional purposes for this "aladin" person. Furthermore, now that we have IDed these sockpuppets, a team of editors should go through and check all of their contribution histories with the goal of undoing other spam and probably hoaxes placed elsewhere. Running around wikilawyering and so forth and letting these spammers get away with it is absolutely the wrong answer. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 03:17, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Solution</b> Here's an alternative solution, how about <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> get's his head out of the sand and leave things be for once? I don't claim to be an angel here, rather much I'm quite happy being one of those users who just points out the blatant obvious and the blatant obvious in this case to me is that <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuyis</a> being stubborn to the point of idiocity. The vote was no consenous; keep, rather than no consenous; re-direct, the margin for the re-direct vote was so minor in fact the re-direct vote if counted properly is only touching a one or two lead, add to the fact that the article wasn't even allowed time to breathe and be verified or written correctly and Dreamguy's constant reverting <b>Incorrectly</b> in my opinion to a mere Aladdin alternate spelling page (at least that's how it more or less looked to me) doesn't actually help.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Further to this, <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> has been acting in rather bad faith calling anyone and everyone who disagrees with him a sockpuppet. In addition he is calling all verifiable sources a hoax, an extreme accuassion. Rather than present his arguement in a dignified manner which would allow for neutral users to vote properly he hypes up the sock-puppet incidents, accusses in bad faith every single other user who comes along and revert wars the page. This is more than enough evidence in my personal opinion to result in blocking said user from even touching the article, regardless of whenever he is "right" or "wrong" since when was it for HIM to decide on a whim when a vote may be declared re-direct or Keep. My point is, the vote was so close people can interpretate it in different ways, of course <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> believes that anyone with an opinion that isn't to his high god glorified standards is <b>Wrong!</b>
<dl>
<dd>Further to this, why is it that various users have managed over MSN to present me with not just one but EIGHT verifiable links of distruptive, bad faith behaviour from <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> of which, SEVEN are up and around on wikipedia. Seriously, I would think that people would take this into account, since after all we would be suspicious of a guy living next door with a criminal record as long as our arms, shouldn't we therefore be suspicious of this indiviual for his stained record on wikipedia, some of which has very dubious results coming out. What makes me wonder is why there are allegations of politics at work here. Regardless, you can take my comments how you will, make an example out of me if you so must, but this has gone to extremities this isn't a community debate it's pratically several users against <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> of course, you can claim he's the victim here of mass hounding, hell we all know what he thinks don't we?
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Summary, why not just stay away from the article instead of continuing your little ego parade regardless of whenever it is in good or bad faith and just allow for those who wish to present a verifiable page do so. Then if you don't like it nominate it for a fourth, fith, sixth, seventh deletion, seeing your behaviour so far I'd theorise it'll go on to twenty five AFD votes until you finally get so many lies in a tangled web that people will finally delete it for you. Then maybe you can get back to your wonderful life outside of wikipedia?

<dd>Summary: Look like RBlowes is making incoherent and deceptive statements solely for personal attacks and is outright lying about the results of the second deletion vote. You and yer buddies on MSN can say whatever you want, but I have no stained record here: I have an exemplary record of stopping spammers, hoaxers, sockpuppets and POV-pushers... which of course means every spammer, hoaxer, sockpuppet-user and POV-pusher who didn't get his way is all pissed off.<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 01:30, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's also worth noting that <a href="../../../r/b/l/User%7ERBlowes_9ca1.html" title="User:RBlowes">User:RBlowes</a>'s first edits to Wikipedia were only on Jan. 2, 2006, when he immediately started voting on articles for deletion... and was already talking to <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">USer:Englishrose</a> (who posted the fraudulent info with fake sources that turned out to be wrong and thus derailed the first vote for deletion) as old friends. I smell a sock. Certainly this person's view is extremely biased and uninformed, as he/she either is brand new and taking the word of a person who largely contributed to the hoax/spam/free advertising or a longtime user under a new account trying to make it appear like his/her side has more support than it really does. Considering the proven sockpuppets in the first vote and the creationof the article, I would recommend sock check on all these "new" users who showed up to go on the attack over this issue. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 01:37, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Now that's out of the way, continue to write your blurb on anything with the word "puppet" in it, I'll make it clear though that all that convinced me to join in the aladin debate was just watching the comments roll off and my eyes roll to the other side of my head due to the sheer non-sense from said comments. Beside a no-consenous;keep &gt; your opinion anyway.

<dd>When people say outright "Keep but only to redirect and preserve the history", claiming that the vote was to "keep as is and don't you dare redirect it" is nothing but a lie. Sorry if that offends you, but to be blunt, only someone trying to twist facts can deny that. Furthermore, it's clear from Englishrose's actions that he/she was involved from the start in quoting sources that turned out to be fraudulent, claiming that he/she had seen the sources in question and that they said something which, upon checking, turned out to be 100% wrong. I don't know why you showed up out of nowhere and how you think you are justified in making the rather intense claims that you are, but when the article in question has been demonstrated to be part of a hoax publicty campaign by someone lying about sources and posting under a huge number of proven sockpuppets, the more you try to raise a fuss the more suspicious the whole thing looks... especially with you and Englishrose and RBlowes making extremely uncivil remarks and strangely timed accusations. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 11:42, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You're the one who's trying to spin a web of deciet and lies. Fact- I wasn't involved from the start. The start of what? The article? The AFD discussion? As for qouting fraudulent sources that's also a decietful comment. The only thing I said that turned out to be unproveable was the "Internation Magician of the Year", which I took in good faith from the article. Upon research...I believe that the award does exist and is hosted at a place called Magic Castle. Quite a few magicians have claimed the won the award. As for the "claiming that he/she had seen the sources in question" that's even more lies from you, cause I've never claimed that I've seen anything without giving links to the relevant sources. You are creating a web of lies in order to fulfil ur dying obsession of trying to make the article out to be false.

<dd>Jtkiefer, just because people disagree with you about permanent blocks doesn't mean they are "thickheaded" - I find that to be a personal attack against everyone who holds a different opinion. Boothy443 has made a number of good contributions and while his behaviour has by no means been impeccable, especially his votes on RFA pages in the past and the actions he took on his user page in July - which I blocked him for - people who contribute well shouldn't be permanently blocked. They should be watched, certainly, but not prevented from contributing. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 03:26, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Who the heck is wheel-warring? I said "If you want to re-block instead, I will <b>not</b> block again, but I don't advise it". So obviously nobody was going to wheelwar. I must point out that "Don't be dick" is the most childish idiotic, ad hominem, "policy" to site, and it is oxymoronic. When I said that Boothy <i>may</i> have trolled, people attacked me like I was evil, no everyone can casually say it know, even though little has changed. I don't like it when one personal attack to an implied personal attack gets someone blocked, maybe if it is like "FUCK YOU, I"M GONNA KILL YOU", then fine, but Boothy was more argumentative than insulting...If other admins want to block then fine, as I said, I am not going to wheelwar. I really think that Boothy needs to go to arbcom instead, to finally resolve this issue. Also, indefinitely blocking someone who still contributes by one admin is bad for Wikipedia, IMO.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_a6ef.html" title="User:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font> <font color="darkblue">of</font> <font color="black">All</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All_b66c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">ESP</font></a></sup> 19:30, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The point Oleg was trying to make, and I fully agree is that you shouldn't have undone another admin's action without discussing <i>first</i>. That is exactly what starts wheel wars and keeps them going. Unless an admin action was <i>clearly</i> wrong, leave it alone and discuss. If most people feel it was wrong then it will be quick and easy to get agreement to overturn it. But undoing an admin's action just because you wouldn't have done it is the problem. I don't understan why it is so hard for the people that start wheel wars to understand this. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 14:59, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No he couldn't have. Other admins undid his infinite block and the few others that tried to reistate it. If he wheelwarred it would have gone to arbcom.

<p>Lets look at the issue here, without any specific names:</p>
<p>1. User A asks for an image to be created. 2. User A inserts said image into a policy page, without consensus. 3. User A engages in edit warring to keep said image in article. 4. Sockpuppets make identical edits to page, as done by User A. (there were no other supporters of this image)</p>
<p>This is a situation for checkuser. If the socks can be shown to be coming from the same IP as Cool Cat, the issue can then be brought before the arbcom with evidence. If the socks can be shown to be coming from another contributor's IP, then that contributor can be reprimanded for impersonating and framing Cool Cat. If the socks can be shown to be coming from an open proxy, then that proxy can be blocked and any sleeper accounts ferreted out.</p>
<p>Making an issue out of who I am only detracts from vandal fighting efforts. If I were Cool Cat, I would be asking for the checkuser to be run too, so that any socks can be found and linked to someone else. I don't know why he fought the checkuser request the last time the sockpuppets attacked the article, but I do find that suspicious. There is no way I'd approach Cool Cat otherwise, because he has a history of harassment and childish behavior leading up to an arbcom decision against him. Thus, I chose to use a non-disruptive role account, which is NOT prohibited by policy. Sorry, but I don't need one more person harassing me, I already get enough standing up against a systematic homophobic bias in other articles. Hexagonal 08:09, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Either way, something about that image gives me the weepy creeps (never mind it's not nearly simple and stark enough for a logo icon). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 09:31, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Given that "homophobe" is actually a personal attack lobbed by homosexuals, and given that noone here seems to be named "Gaylord", I think complaining about hir user page (which is obnoxious in the extreme, don't get me wrong) is really counterproductive in complaining about hir making personal attacks. It seems like blocking him for adding material, taken by some editors as offensive to them personally, to his <i>user</i>page is, at this point, simple vindictiveness. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia content is not censored for the protection of minors</a>, but users are blocked if some editors don't like other editors?

<p>Yes. That still isn't a good enough reason to delete such categories. If liberals, conservatives, pro-lifers, pro-choicers, Irish users, British users, monarchists, republicans, Americans and others can all notify each other about debates that interest them, why can't christians? What can't users in a free society communicate with likeminded individuals on an issue of mutual interest? Sometimes it seems as though the least liberal and least pluralist individuals are those who proclaim themselves liberal and pluralist but who insist that <i>their</i> views and agendas are right and everyone who disagrees with them are wrong, a bigot, a fascist, a conservative, or something else. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 01:06, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why on earth not? Irish users let me know if there is an Irish-related topic being voted on. Writers on royalty let me know if there is a topic on monarchy being voted on. UK editors inform me if there is a vote on UK issue being voted on. Do you imagine that people are physically able to keep track of every debate? They can't. Like-minded individuals will <i>always</i> let others know what is going on. It seems to me that the issue here is that its those damn pesky Christians doing it!

<dd>This is a more complicated issue than either side makes it out to be. On the one hand, we don't want people to bring in tons of <a href="../../../m/e/a/WP%7EMEAT_8cd6.html" title="WP:MEAT">meatpuppets</a> from outside Wikipedia to interfere with deletion discussions. On the other hand, we don't want to delete potentially valid articles without the contributors knowing about them. As mentioned above, people can't always keep an eye on every article they've edited in the past. If someone nominated one of my articles for deletion for whatever reason, I might not even know about it until after it was done. Maybe the answer is more notification requirements on AFD debates in general? Then this kind of campaigning would be unneeded, and could be stopped. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 03:05, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It depends from your definition of "role account". There are different definitions. An account that can be used by multiple people fulfilling a single role is frowned upon. But an account used by a single person to distinguish edits made when <i>that one person</i> is acting in a particular role (from other edits made by that one person) is generally acceptable. ('bot accounts fit the latter description, after all. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G%27s_major_work_%27bot_fee3.html" title="User:Uncle G's major work 'bot">Uncle G's major work 'bot</a> (<a href="../../../u/n/c/User_talk%7EUncle_G%27s_major_work_%27bot_abfd.html" title="User talk:Uncle G's major work 'bot">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Uncle_G%27s_major_work_%27bot_d3e7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Uncle G's major work 'bot">contribs</a>) is, in this sense, one of <i>my</i> role accounts, for example. I have also seen some administrators that that have secondary accounts that explicitly do <i>not</i> have administrator privileges.) Accounts that are purported to be role accounts, but that are actually <i>not</i> role accounts are frowned upon. Two purported role accounts that are both contributing to featured article/talk page/deletion discussions are not <i>actually</i> accounts where a single person is acting in distinct roles. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:06, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I too support this. What I take issue with here is the attempt to push POV. Notifying users who already have a stake in the discussion (as in, they already gave input) is fine, as if the situation has changed, it would be good if they could clarify their stance WRT the changes. It is also okay to notify users who might know something about the subject -- in other words, "Experts". For instance, if a Malaysia-related article were put up for deletion, it would be best to ask Malaysian editors about it to see how notable it is. Likewise, something may be very popular in Ireland, but the article being AfDed may not have made this context clear -- Irish folk can help clear this up. But there are at least a billion people who claim to be Christians in the world, and the chances of finding one who knows something important about theology (and can thus expand the AfDed article or explain a point of importance on the AfD) are rather slim. Thus, this is not an attempt to clarify the facts (which should be done more often, but isn't done for fear of POV pushing) but an attempt to push POV, which must be strongly condemned. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 02:07, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's going way too far IMO given the ambiguous nature of the comment. Some American Christians refer to almost anything they do as a "ministry", rather than reserving the term for actual preaching alone.

<dd>This chap contacted me in email and I've told him I'll unblock his main account if he can list his sock puppets so they can be blocked.

The other isues with his behavior can be addressed in the normal way but at this stage I'm trying to look for evidence that this guy has a good faith wish to work with us and start a dialog. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 06:51, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have, I think, three major problems with Gastrich.</dd>
<dd>First, his use of socks. He is quite open about past use of socks, professes intent to use his main account for "the vast majority" of edits going forward, but still appears to be using socks (or possibly meatpuppets) to evade 3RR on articles where he is in an edit war. I can't offhand think of a credible reason for him to use a "role account" (I have considered using my old account for main space edits now my new account shas sysop rights, but even then I'm hesitant).</dd>
<dd>Second, his blatant intent to use WP as "ministry". There is nothing wrong with being guided by faith, and nothing wrong with openly working to ensure that Christian subjects are <i>covered</i>, it's working to the effect of having them covered<i>to a specific viewpoint</i> which is the issue. He removed Ben Franklin from the list of <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deist.html" title="Deist">deists</a> citing his own "evidence" on his website; Franklin is on record as openly a Deist, and there is authoritative evidence now linked form the resotred entry in the list. Gastrich appears to be one of those black-and-white people, and that is always going to cause friction. His representation of the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_Baptist_University_19ac.html" title="Louisiana Baptist University">Louisiana Baptist University</a> entries as "Christian biographies" is a case in point: LBU is, according to the available evidence, an unaccredited institution teaching fundamentalism to fundamentalists. These fundamentalists then go on to teach other fundamentalists, creating a sort of walled garden.</dd>
<dd>Third, his incivility - or rather, the fact that he tends to personalise everything. Not that I am unfailingly polite myself, anyone can kick back when riled, but it's his invariable tendency to ascribe motives to actions; anyone who AfDs an article on somoene who happens to be a Christian is thereby anti-Christian (even when they are a self-declared Christian) - much more, all on the RfC. There was an edit war over the inclusion or non-inclusion of a Gastrich book rebutting <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Skeptic%27s_Annotated_Bible_dc85.html" title="The Skeptic's Annotated Bible">The Skeptic's Annotated Bible</a>. Both sides were pushing POV: one pushing a critique of Gastrich's critique, the other pushing Gastrich (being mainly Gastrich himself, anons on what is stated to be his ISP, or suspected socks). I solved this in the usual way by removing both and taking it to Talk, with the comment that <i>it seems to me that there is sufficient dispute about the authority of the Gastrich text that including it is unacceptable at this stage absent consensus on how to handle it</i>, which I would have said was pretty uncontentious, especially given that those removing it had cited some pretty scathing and apparently well-informed criticisms of Gastrich's books. This provoked a very aggressive response, and a vigorous assertion that Amazin reviews are reliable, and that the fact that many of the reviews were high star ratings automatically made the source a good one - omitting to mention that the high star rating reviews were accompanied by some very well-argued one-star ratings, and in any case Amazon reviews are not a reliable source.</dd>
<dd>I would like to be satisfied that Gastrich will be massively less aggressive in the future, but his RfC response is utterly defiant. I believe he genuinely can't see what's wrong with what he's doing, and <i>that</i> is probably the fundamental issue.</dd>

<p>Tom, I appreciate your point that using words like "ministry" and whatnot doesn't necessarily taint the fellow's contributions, and I agre that his religious motivations aren't the issue here. Since he contacted me he has been very quiet and I think he's just waiting out the block. This doesn't bode well; I had hoped to see him make a full disclosure of socks and start a dialog, but no response so far. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 18:34, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Which seems to be par for the course. From what I can find of his participation in other fora across the web, he's treated each as a vehicle for self-promotion and witnessing.

<li>Not a personal attack.</li>
<li>Are these Wikipedia editors? If not, then it's not a PA.</li>
<li>As above.</li>
<li>You <i>do</i> appear to have a personal vendetta against Joshua, as evince by your rejected RFAR and harrassment like this. He is describinb your behaviour, not your personality. Not a PA.</li>
<li>Questioning your competence on a matter is not a PA.</li>
<li>Is it an attack to call you a Velikovskian? This is not a common insult, but if you are offended by it maybe you should have advised Joshua that you consider it an attack. As for the second part - either you have formal training in physics (in which case it's a factually inaccurate statement) or you don't. But it's not a personal attack.</li>
<li>"Non-scientist layman" is not a PA.</li>
<li>Again, unless VanFlandern is a Wikipedian, this cannot be construed as a PA (and even if he were one, I don't think NPA forbids one to comment on the quality of a person's off-Wikipedia professional persona).</li>
<li>Nowhere near a "personal attack".</li>

<dd>Guettarda, on reading the Wikipedia's policy on <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_personal_attacks.html" title="No personal attacks">No personal attacks</a>, the 1st two sentences read "Do not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia. Comment on content, <b>not on the contributor</b>." (my emphasis). Bearing that in mind,</dd>
<dd>(1) "not in the mood to educate you" is clearly aimed at the contributor, and questions their education.</dd>
<dd>(2) (3) (8) These may not be aimed at Wiki Contributors, but are still personal attacks, because (a) they are aimed at individuals, (b) seem to fail the very first sentence on the policy page. I wouldn't expect to see any of these comments in an encyclopedia, or professional journal.</dd>
<dd>(5) "User:Iantresman, very incompetent in this regard," again is aimed at the contributor</dd>
<dd>(6) "... hasn't received formal training in physics or astronomy" (6) "Non-scientist layman", again are both aimed at the contributor. ScienceApologist, doesn't know my education beyond what I have on my personal web page, and whether the comment is true or false is irrelevent to the content of my contributions.</dd>

I just assumed that if there was a Wikipedia policy against something in order to focus on content rather than contributors, we'd get a better encyclopedia. It also seems pretty ironic that Guettarda suggests that I am harrassing ScienceApologist, merely by bring to attention evidence of contravention of a Wikipedia policy; a bit like punishing whistleblowers for speaking out --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">Iantresman</a> 00:58, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am highly concerned by the precedent being set here, although I still hold out hope there was a mistake. To summarize. Article was created in december and was AfD'd. Result was non consensus/keep. Immediate deletion review. It was immediately AfDd again. Again result was non consensus. Now there is another deletion review. Fine, that is the process. But while it is deletion review, a couple of users have chosen to redirect the article endlessly, despite the fact that the AfD result was keep. I posted a message requesting temporarily page protection of this article at least until the deltion review took place, and now (either as a mistake or out of spite) the BLANK article has been protected. Can someone please do something about this? <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhantasmo_d655.html" title="User:Phantasmo">Phantasmo</a> 20:14, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, sorry... there wsa no consensus to DELETE, but that doesn't mean there is no consensus to redirect. 46 people wanted the article removed, only 20 people wanted it kept as is... that's a clear consensus. So it's been redirected. No we have people who were on the side that had less than 1/3 of the vote trying to claim that they can force their will upon everyone else and being deceptive about what the votes were in order to try to keep it as a full article. The redirected article has been protected, which is certainly clearly within process of how things should be handled. Deletion review has no bearing on whether the article is redirected or not. If they do consider redirecting as part of the official delete vote, then they would also have to consider the 46 votes to remove and then go ahead and redirect anyway. People who lose votes need to stop playing little wikilawyering games where they try to claim that no consensus to do one specific action means consensus to do their action, because that's not how things work. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 20:28, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Who lost the vote? The result was non consensus KEEP! Those who favored deletion then put this up for deletion review. While the deletion review is taking place, the article should remain in the state that the AfD result dictated, which is KEEP. The guy who placed the article up for deletion review (below) even agrees that the redirect is a misuse of power!!! All I ask is that the process be honored. I have no personal stake with this article, but I do have a stake in wikipedia's processes being honored. This is an end around at best, a blatant violation at worst.<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhantasmo_d655.html" title="User:Phantasmo">Phantasmo</a> 20:32, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is semantics. The article in question is up for discussion in deletion review. Those who supported deletion redirected as an end around. Now, the deletion review process is meaningless because there is nothing left to judge. The article was a non con keep. Not a merge redirect. That also results in a clear difference.

<dd><b>Oiy vey...</b>For goddsakes, this is not a hard concept. I understand that AfD is not a vote. I am not the one falling back on #'s! I am basing my comments on the closure result. The simple, unalienable stance that I have is this. AfD twice was closed with the result of No Consensus: Keep. Not Merge redirect. Not delete. Not KEEP. I believe that there is no detriment to leaving the article as a standalone article while the deletion review process plays out. If the result of deletion review is delete, let it be deleted. If it is relist, let it be. I just believe that is the most acurate representation of the process as it is supposed to be. I understand that the power to redirect is always there, but following a 2nd non consensus keep, a redirect/protect in the middle of a deletion review by an admin involved in the back and forth editing REEKS of impropriety and abuse of power. It just does. There are even proponents of deletion who believe this. Just because something CAN be done doesn't make it the right thing to do. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhantasmo_d655.html" title="User:Phantasmo">Phantasmo</a> 01:10, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Klaw, perhaps, but the closing admin declared it non con/keep as only 40 of 66 favored deletion. Whether or not that was a correct closing is a discussion for the deletion review page.

<li>Since there was an obvious edit war, protecting is proper. Since one side was supported by strong consensus on the AFD page, protecting it in that version is acceptable.

<li>I heartily concur here with Radiant!. The closing admin's decision was <b>no consensus</b> which, as he said <i>in making the closing</i>, supports neither keep nor redirect. Johnleemk's closing decision was most definitely not "keep". Either keeping or merging would be acceptable <i>purely as a result of the AfD</i>; which one ought to have been hashed out on the Talk: page rather through an edit war. The edit war resulted in page protection, as always on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="extiw" title="m:The_Wrong_Version">m:The Wrong Version</a>. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 01:48, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not up to date on this whole debate, but I'd just like to comment that an AFD result is <i>never</i> an argument against creating a redirect and/or merging.

<dd>True, but the issue is one of page protection. It would be appropriate the create a redirect and protect it if the consensus had been delete, but the article kept being recreated. There are two concerns here - one is that the page was protected by someone who was involved in the edit war, and the other is whether the page needs protection at all (the decision should have been made by an uninvolved party). <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 01:19, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was the closing admin, and anyone who is claiming the AfD supports them should be shot (yes, this means both Phantasmo and DreamGuy are wrong). The AfD got no consensus, defaulting to keep. This does not preclude the formation of consensus in the future (and not necessarily through AfD) nor can it be used by itself as a reason to either keep the article as is or redirect it. I intentionally typed this message in caps to highlight this on the AfD, since I've noticed more and more of this retarded "OHNOES NO CONSENSUS === KEEP SO FUCK OFF YOU DELETIONIST REDIRECTORS" occurring in the wake of no consensus AfDs. Apparently the message didn't get through: AFD HAS ZERO BEARING ON THE CONDITION OF THE ARTICLE NOW. IT'S OVER. IN THE PAST. IRRELEVANT.

<dd>John, again, I have to defend myself here. I understand that the closure of AfD does not preclude a redirect. All I am saying is, I think it is inappropriate for those who were pushing for deletion to suddenly reverse course and push for a redirect as soon as the AfD is closed, and while the deletion review is taking place. I also think that it is inappropriate for an admin involved in teh debate to protect a redirect version of the page. I think that your remarks in your post above are unnecessarily hostile. The deletion review should have taken place and then redirect could have been considered. There would have been no great harm in that, and it would have shown greater adherence to the spirit of wikipedia policies, if not the actual letter of them. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhantasmo_d655.html" title="User:Phantasmo">Phantasmo</a> 14:35, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no reason this dispute can be hashed out on the talk page. No reason at all. Shifting this out to DRV or AfD is a delaying tactic from whichever side is behind this (I honestly don't care who it is) to delay getting consensus. You can discuss this on the talk. There's no need for a DRV, and even if the DRV is filed, you don't need to discuss potential redirection there -- the talk page isn't automagically deleted if a DRV or AFD is filed. I honestly don't care if those "delete -- be gone!" people changed their minds overnight, but without bothering to examine their actions in depth, it makes sense to me, unless they all specifically stated "delete -- no redirect". All this reflects is the pointless AfD custom of having only one "vote". I wouldn't be surprised if, when asked to prioritise, they would have put delete first and redirect second. Perhaps this sort of <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant_run-off_voting.html" title="Instant run-off voting">instant run-off voting</a> (except we don't call it voting; we call it alternative recommendations in the debate. ^_^) would be helpful, if people actually practiced it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 15:00, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ah yes...the BS that AfD has become. It should NOT be a vote. If many people want to merge or redirect, then <i>no consensus</i> <b>obviously</b> does not equal keep. The article should be a merge at best, consider that only at Wikipedia would you find such untterly unnoteworthy cruft and ignorance to the process. If THAT cruft is notable enough, then Wikipedia is .01% of what is size should be right now, 99.90% of this site should be BS cruft that only a small of minority (often related to the topics themselves) want in there. This is getting way out of hand. Process...process...process...people just keep milking this to find any excuse to put in BS, and then complaint about those who try to trim out the fat by protecting. Protecting may have seemed unreasonable before, but it seems justified now. I bet Britannica never has to have editors actually have to argue over the inclusion of BS, its like having arguing why -2^(1/2) does not exist five times...what a waste of time.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_a6ef.html" title="User:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font> <font color="darkblue">of</font> <font color="black">All</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All_b66c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">ESP</font></a></sup> 15:50, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

No apology is enough to make up for "<i>me and my KKK friends will come into your house at night and slit your throat.</i>" Just saying that is a <i>crime</i> offline, and we have zero tolerance for it here.

<p>I'm having an issue with an admin who claims he can reveal one of my other editing accounts if he feels like it even if I'm not violating or planning to violate <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>.

<dd>From the conversation it became clear that the admin in question used admin privelidges to compare IP addresses. I'm mainly asking if it is normal for admins to 'reveal' double accounts whenever they run into one, especially when in a situation where they are not in a neutral position. To me it felt like harassment, the admin in question states his behavior is acceptable. --<a href="../../../z/i/m/User%7EZimZum_4ba3.html" title="User:ZimZum">ZimZum</a> 10:47, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, he didn't use admin privileges to compare IP addresses. It's a common mistake to think that admins can do that, but they can't, for privacy reasons. Only the handful of people with <a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7ECheckUser_0bbc.html" title="Wikipedia:CheckUser">Wikipedia:CheckUser</a> privileges can identify the IP addresses of logged-in users, by using the CheckUser tool, and they're only allowed to do that if there's independent good evidence for suspecting that a pair of accounts are a) related, b) being used abusively (for instance for one person to vote several times). Please see the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7ECheckUser_0bbc.html" title="Wikipedia:CheckUser">CheckUser</a> page for these safeguards of users' privacy. Tomer had no special "admin" way of finding out you were running a sock, so I suspect you told him, maybe unintentionally. Anyway, that's why Greg Asche is asking how Tomer knew. We can't say what's "normal" when admins "run into double accounts", because they simply <i>don't</i> run into them.

<dd>People have all sorts of reasons for running multiple accounts, e.g. people who edit a type of article they'd rather not have associated with their main account, admins who like actually editing articles without having trolls follow them around, etc. I don't (I have <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuerulous_e91b.html" title="User:Querulous">User:Querulous</a> but haven't actually ever used it for anything), but if they're not doing evil with them then that's not actually a problem. If I spot multiple accounts with CheckUser, what I do about it if anything depends if they're actually doing evil with them. If one person is using two different names in two different areas, it actually looks just like two different people.</dd>

<dd>I have no reason to believe there were any traces linking the two accounts. The admin in question didn't deny when I accused him of using admin priveleges, leading me to believe he did use an ip based method, or had someone with checkuser abilities do it for him. I also think it's questionable when an admin engages himself in 'user account guessing' which I believe is frowned down upon as well though I'm not overly familiar with wikipedia's guidelines. --<a href="../../../z/i/m/User%7EZimZum_4ba3.html" title="User:ZimZum">ZimZum</a> 12:37, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I really don't feel a need to "defend myself" here. The <a href="../../../z/i/m/User%7EZimZum_4ba3.html" title="User:ZimZum">ZimZum</a> account was initially created for the specific purpose of endorsing User:Dabljuh's bizarre response to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Dabljuh_9749.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Dabljuh">RfC</a>. Anyone with one working eye and access to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ZimZum_331c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ZimZum">Special:Contributions/ZimZum</a> can figure that out. Examining those contributions and the writing style that accompanies them and comparing them to the interests and style of the other user makes the association a no-brainer. "ZimZum" might think there were no traces linking the two accounts, but as they say, a leopard can't change its spots. Of course I didn't deny using admin privileges to link the two accounts, as I said in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_TShilo12_7623.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/TShilo12">my RfA</a>, responding to trolls is counterproductive. There really was very little "user account guessing" required. Regardless, ZimZum himself confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt exactly who he was by his response. As for what's "questionable", that'd be the claim that ZimZum is Bo Peep's sheep. The account is being used to harass another user on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_comment_Dabljuh_ee5e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment/Dabljuh">Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment/Dabljuh</a> and elsewhere, and to engage in other <i>truly</i> questionable behavior. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 12:54, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If a user is interested in US politics, that's potentially useful information as far as the 'pedia is concerned: that user can be invited to join various politics-related projects, etc. But if a user is decidedly not interested in US politics, why should we care about their opinion on Mr. Bush? That's irrelevant, non-actionable information as far as the project is concerend, in the best case.

<li><span style="position: relative; left:+6px; margin-right:+6px;">The number of articles in each category is a random number determined partly by the number of templates that referenced each category, the number of users who transcluded each template, the number of users who who subst:ed each template, as well as the server's current mood. Most of these categories are essentially empty, what you currently see is just the ghost image still present in the cache somewhere. And I strongly resent the implication ("empty gesture") that real-world politics has anything to do with this, precisely because real-world politics is entirely irrelevant on this wiki, as I've tried to explain above. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 21:41, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</span></li>

<p><span style="position: relative; left:+6px; margin-right:+6px;">By the way, I have now confirmed that all three categories are indeed empty.
