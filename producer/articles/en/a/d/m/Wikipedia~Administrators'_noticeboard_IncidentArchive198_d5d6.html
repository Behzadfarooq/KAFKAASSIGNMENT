<dd>Seems he very clearly removed the same material four times, and was quite uncivil in his edit summaries. The "you didn't warn me" thing doesn't fly - he's been blocked several times and two of them were for 3RR.

<dd>Actually, if you look more clearly, those were not reverts. Those were legitimate edits. If you look more closely, you will notice that disruptive users were vandalizing article, example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ivan_Kricancic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ivan_Kricancic" rel="nofollow">Ivan Kricanic</a>. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 04:10, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Legitimacy of edits is in the eye of the beholder. The edit war was in itself disruptive, and should not have occurred in the first place. Those edits were indeed reverts, and hence the block stands.</dd>
<dd>P.S. Perhaps all parties should be more civil in their edit summaries. Why is it that whenever I view a Balkan, Greek, Turkish, or Turkic article there is almost always rampant personal attacks and incivility? --<sup><a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhysicq210_4b59.html" title="User talk:Physicq210"><font color="#000000">210</font></a></sup><b><a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0" face="Comic Sans MS">physicq</font></a></b> (<i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Physicq210_25e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0">c</font></a></i>) 04:16, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Looks like there's nothing left for me to say.

<p>An Administrator needs to look into this, please. Recently, I started fixing up the article <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Descent_b0ff.html" title="Royal Descent">Royal Descent</a>. However, over the last few days, another editor <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">User:Michaelsanders</a> has taken it upon themselves to take over the article. Everytime something new is added the editor deletes it. I have tried to discuss the issue on the talk page with them, but they delete my edits, revert to theirs and then argue about it to the point it just had gotten silly. This user has already been blocked twice for breaking the 3RR rule and has been in trouble for their behavior in the past. I am not sure if this user has broken the 3RR rule again by re-editing the article several times already or if they violated any other policies on this site. But given their behavior the last few days there is definitly an issue that needs attention as no one may be able to edit the article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosePlantagenet_bf5f.html" title="User:RosePlantagenet">RosePlantagenet</a> 17:07, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It should also be noted they have done this at the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_7748.html" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a> article as well. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosePlantagenet_bf5f.html" title="User:RosePlantagenet">RosePlantagenet</a> 19:32, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The editor making the complaint persists in her own opinion, and continually reverts (possibly breaking 3RR rules). I have tried to discuss the issue with her; she simply talks down to me because I am 'a young editor', and considerably worsened the issue by taking a condescending attitude, before eventually saying she was no longer going to discuss because of my age. She appears to regard the article as her own (having taken particular offence today when I stripped the article of OR etc, and reverting). And finally, as a <i>coup de grace</i>, she did not even bother to inform me of this complaint. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 19:49, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Looking at a simple comparison of the two editors' versions, two things are quickly obvious. One, RosePlantagenet has engaged in a ridiculous quantity of OR (Although it's reasoned out fairly well, it cannot be a part of Wikipedia).However, Other sections of Rose's edits are sourced, and MichaelSanders removes them as rapidly as he removes the OR. Neither editor is working for the betterment of the project at this point, instead each is now defending their own page.</dd>
<dd>As for MichaelSanders efforts on Harry Potter, his edits are fully sourced, relevant, and generally add to the topic and content, and should be restored.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 20:06, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Michaelsanders's recent edits on Harry Potter are totally unsubstanciated and irrelevant: they are basically original research about a word that the author herself has refused to explain. What Michaelsanders proposed in the article was no less than a full interpretation on the meaning that the word <i>will</i> have in the next HP book, and his sources are no less than fansites. Also, he doesn't seem to be disturbed by the use of <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYNT_6790.html" title="WP:SYNT">Synthesis of published material serving to advance a position</a>.</dd>
<dd>While, to be honest, he didn't technically write these edits, he has vehemently tried to prevent anyone from removing all this OR, facing the risk of wiolating the 3RR rule without caring much about it. Of course, he has never been able to justify his reverts in the talk page, <i>not once</i>. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolken_de_Fanel_8812.html" title="User:Folken de Fanel">Folken de Fanel</a> 22:46, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would answer this, but it's inappropriate for this page (Folkendefanel seems to have no objections to violating 3RR and provoking long arguments, but I feel such is not suitable here). Anyone who wants to find out about this issue can see the relevant discussion page. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 23:46, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You have started an edit war, you do not seem to have any objections to revert without debating it first, and you are ready to break the 3RR rule.</dd>
<dd>Arguments are the base of Wikipedia. I know you want to impose your opinions and your edits without further discussion, bu as long as Wikipedia remains as it is, you won't be able do do just everything you want. You'face opposition from other editors, even if you don't like it.<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolken_de_Fanel_8812.html" title="User:Folken de Fanel">Folken de Fanel</a> 00:06, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, MichaelSanders' edits seem thoroughly substantiated by the links, and present the nature of the word Hallows. he cites OTHERS who construct the Arthurian parallels, Cites the Arthurian hallows, and so on. Perhaps the only place where he flirts with OR is in the parallels of House Symbols and which element each represents. However, The vast majority is well cited, and germane to the topics. I support it's inclusion. Finally, Consensus and Citation are the bases of Wikipedia, NOT argument and conflict You're becoming combative, FdF.

<dd>Wikilawyering is too-easy an excuse. Any one can accuse any administrator, or any editor removing vandalism/OR of wikilawyering, in that case.

<dd>As regards the information removal, I removed the cited information principally because, with the OR etc removal, the cited information became irrelevant (e.g. "Since, illegitimate children could not marry into other royal families because being bastards left them undesirable matches, these children had to marry <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_class.html" title="Upper class">upper class</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_class.html" title="Middle class">middle class</a> families from their own country." - becomes pointless, since it was referencing an uncited claim that some Europeans are descended from royalty. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 20:14, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let me rephrase what you just said. <i>Sorry, I was just poking her one more time to see if I could get away with it, and by the way, here's me pointing her bad thing she did out once more</i>. It's childish to the Nth degree. Finally, I meant exactly what I said. If illegitimate children of royalty couldn't engage in inter-monarchial married, and had to settle for marrying upper-class fellow nationals, that should be easily sourced, so source it. The inclusion of the fact does explain why some 'commoners' had royal ancestors. From there, you've got a sourced basis to establish spread of royal lineage through generations, if you can source it. But that is exactly the statement explaining the 'seeding' of the commoners, pardon the pun. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 00:28, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A while back, there was a lengthy discussion at <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSNUM_3545.html" title="WP:MOSNUM">WP:MOSNUM</a> regarding changing the MOS on binary prefixes, currently stating that any change to them should be accepted.

<dd>This is becoming a major problem. These sockpuppets/meatpuppets are creating edit wars on a number of pages. Many editors are reverting them to comply with current MOS guidelines, they have all been informed of the policy, and some have even had temporary blocks imposed. These anon editors try to debate the validity of the guideline on various users' talk pages, despite being asked to take up their issue on the style guideline page. This guideline has been challenged many times and still stands, which I think the anons fully realize. Can some administrator please watch some of the pages that are being warred over for IP reversions? The persons editing anonymously have shown no attempt to work this out within the established conflict resolution system, and at this point I think we are looking at simple vandalism. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2007-02-11T22:35Z</code></dd>

<dd>IMO you're being far too lenient. Were I an admin, I probably would have blocked him indefinitely as a spam-only account. <i><a href="../../../y/u/s/User_talk%7EYuser31415_0c1d.html" title="User talk:Yuser31415">Yuser31415</a></i> 23:13, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We need to be quick and decisive on these issues. IMO as more people realize that Wikipedia articles usually show up on "page 1" of Google searches due the wiki's inter-linking system, more spammers will try to put their stuff on the site. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 02:25, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

His block, by the way, he has attempted to conceal by deleting it from his talk page without archiving it.

If any more evidence is needed, or Clarification of existing evidence, then please let me know. I can explain everything, and all the ways User:Rama's Arrow has been abusing his admin privileges in order Ban users who disagree with his POV, no matter the credibility of the ban.<br />
This admin has also been ignoring "extreme Insults", edit wars, and big offences from Indian users, Usually letting them away with Nothing or a mere warning.<br />
I have been given two, 1 week bans for putting forward <b>Arguments on Talk pages</b>. After the second ban, I was accused of Anti Semitism. I (without thinking) defended my self against his accusations on the admin review panel without loggin in. Ramas Arrow, ignored my statements, and banned me straight away for "Block Evasion" Surely there is a difference between Block Evasion, and defending yourself against extremely hurtful accusations.<br />
This admin has been behind the banning of half a dozen users who happened to disagree with his POV. And naturally, certain Indian users seek his help when settling "disputes" going against their POV, which usually result in the ban/block of the non Indian user.<br />
I hope he can be brought to justice. I have been through 3 weeks of unfair bans because of his agenda.<br />

I believe he wishes to interview users about how what happens on Wikipedia when a celebrity dies, as he showed up when several other users and I were busy editing and removing vandalism from the Anna Nicole Smith article. He also wants to talk about how users protected (the protection, of course, was done by an administrator, but he doesn't seem to know that) and maintained the page directly after hearing the news of her death.</i></p>
<p><i>It's due to the fact that this situation involves the press that I decided to come to you, as you have dealt with the media. I have told this user to stop contacting other users about press inquiries for the moment, as I am unsure if his actions are legal on Wikipedia. I thought it was best to tell him that in order to avoid trouble.</i></p>
<p><i>I do hope I have not misused your talk page, sir. As I said, I came to you because I believed that you have the most experience at handling these situations.

<p>I am going to inform Mr. Jimbo Wales about this discussion here so he knows about it. I feel it's worth letting him know.</p>

<dd>It is very common for the media to contact members, especially administrators, for comment.

<p>Here is a new case of clear misuses of administrative rights on wikipedia:</p>
<p>As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Emir_Arven" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Emir_Arven" rel="nofollow">Emir</a> pointed out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Two Indian administrators misused admin policy and they blocked me in coordinated action. They are: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nishkid64" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nishkid64" rel="nofollow">Nichkid64</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aksi_great" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aksi_great" rel="nofollow">Aksi great</a>.</b> Their admin rights should be taken away. I got a 2 weeks block, after a 72h block. First Aksi blocked me for 72h then Niskid64 blocked me for two weeks, because I said that Aksi great misused his rights. This is not over. I will be back, and you are not going to misuse your rights again. Regards.

<dd>Emir Arwen might not have read the reason I provided for extending his block.

He left a number of personal attacks against this user, and so did Ivan, so I blocked Ivan for 72 hours since it was his first offense (Ivan had some hateful stuff against Emir at his user page, too), and I extended Emir's block to two weeks given the situation and his past history. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 20:31, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>"It's too funny. If you don't like U.S. entertainment, then create your own! Don't call it "Hollywood North" unless you are willing to debate the theft. It's not America's fault that Canadians (and the whole world) loves our entertainment or that you guys are incapable of making your own without a heavily subsidized industry! - Donteatyellowsnow"</i></li>
<li><i>"You guys aren't Hollywood! No matter how much you try to convince yourselves of it. And yes, I would know because unlike you guys I actually do know something about the subject. So yes I do have a specialty, unlike many of you "dabblers" or Canadian nationalists who have to have their government provide welfare to support their workers because the films wouldn't come there without it. Why don't you guys just create your own independent Canadian films and hire your own workers? Why do you feel you have to steal Hollywood's industry away and then steal even the name of the U.S. film industry too. I mean, come on! Should we start referring to Eureka, California as "Vancouver South"?! Should we start calling Montreal "New York North"?

I don't really have any advice in this case. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 03:37, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've left a message on the user's talk page. Maybe this editor will appreciate hearing from a fellow Californian. Recommended <a href="../../../a/d/o/WP%7EADOPT_c4e7.html" title="WP:ADOPT">WP:ADOPT</a> and some practice editing other topics. From a browse of the edit history I'd refrain from <i>the t-word</i> in this instance. Based on a lengthy and cited addition to the bio of Los Angeles mayor <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Villaraigosa_fd47.html" title="Antonio Villaraigosa">Antonio Villaraigosa</a> I consider it likely that this is an entertainment industry professional who's concerned about outsourcing of jobs to Canada (a genuine issue in that field) and may have a COI on the matter. Maybe this is someone who can adjust to site standards. Get in touch with me if problems continue. Maybe my SoCal location scores a point or two here. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 04:13, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While he may be concerned with a genuine issue that may be a COI, I still feel that it does not excuse his vandalism to userpages, continuously removing maintenance templates, his exceptionally rude comments, randomly messaging other users with personal attacks about editors, accusing people of working for some sort of Canadian conspiracy, very anti-Canadian changes to articles, and disinterest in adhearing to concensus and other editors who have tried to give him friendly advice. This response just seems too light for someone who has already been blocked once and been informed about Wikipedia policy continuously and then deliberately ignores them. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELangara_College_ac2a.html" title="User:Langara College">Langara College</a> 05:48, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Starting with a friendly but cautionary note from a SoCal Admin is appropriate IMO. The goal is always to salvage potentially good (faith) editors while improving or at least protecting the encyclopedia. It's not wiki policy to punish editors for prior offences, and now that Durova's involved the editor's inappropriate actions will either be curtailed voluntarily or involuntarily. That's the Wiki Way.

<dd>Aside from the fact that he has already been warned by admins in the past and subsequently been blocked for a period of time. If a user is continuously warned by his peers and admins and no serious consequences take place, he has no reason to change his habits. People have tried to help him, talk considerately to him, and in some cases, wrongly talked inconsiderately to him with no change. After he was blocked for 24hrs after a <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> incident if you look at his contributions afterwards you will see not much has change. I will trust in your decision but at the same time will express my concerns. The best we can hope for is for him to accept this challenge and prove me wrong. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELangara_College_ac2a.html" title="User:Langara College">Langara College</a> 22:20, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello. I don't know who this "Langara College" is only that I've only seen his postings recently. He has vandalized my talk page and constantly left unfounded warnings on there (along with others). I believe that "Langara College" might be a sock puppet site that is in fact a college IP address? I could be wrong, but I thought I would mention it. I seriously don't understand what this person's problem is. He is part of a group of people that have attacked, harassed and tried to provoke me. They engaged in an edit war with me, inciting an accidental 3RR (which was actually only the removals of tags that they kept reverting -- my actions of which are not formally considered vandalism on Wiki). This person "Langara College" and a few others ("Skookum" is another user) have constantly harassed this editor and deleted vital wiki content because it goes against their extreme Canadian nationalistic POV or simply because it was written by this editor. They have also tried to use the <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyranny_of_the_majority.html" title="Tyranny of the majority">tyranny of the majority</a> in the case of the "<a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_North_85d8.html" title="Hollywood North">Hollywood North</a>" page and have constantly removed sourced material that I have added to that page. Wiki is not a democracy, but they have acted with a false "consensus" that is extremely Canadian POV and have attempted a group "ownership" of that page. With regard to this user accusing me of "changing the POV" on the <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runaway_production.html" title="Runaway production">runaway production</a> page, that is an outrageous and totally unfounded and uneducated charge because I was the one who CREATED that page in the first place. I have used sources to back up all of the writing and editing. I got sick of these people constantly barraging my talk page with unfounded warnings, so when they continued -- I sent a few warnings back to the ones who persisted. It's too bad that these people can't play fair and that they feel that they should try to have me blocked (for nothing!). I would seriously have administrators look into the antics of users such as Langara and Skookum on the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_North_85d8.html" title="Hollywood North">Hollywood North</a> and other pages. These people have engaged in other nationalistic fights on other pages long before I ever came around. This seems to be their "M.O." - Donteatyellowsnow 23:23, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I request a review of the recent conduct of both myself and of admin <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> on <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Cultic_Studies_Association_3b5c.html" title="International Cultic Studies Association">International Cultic Studies Association</a>.</p>
<p>The important events as I see them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Without identifying himself as an admin, Jkelly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Cultic_Studies_Association&amp;diff=107371402&amp;oldid=107299149" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Cultic_Studies_Association&amp;diff=107371402&amp;oldid=107299149" rel="nofollow">removes</a> a mention of a living person. His edit comment says that it was not a well-sourced mention. In fact, it was extremely well-sourced, but Jkelly did not ask whether it was well sourced before making the deletion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Still unaware that Jkelly was an admin, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Cultic_Studies_Association&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107371402" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Cultic_Studies_Association&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107371402" rel="nofollow">revert</a> the unilateral deletion of well-sourced material.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jkelly then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Cultic_Studies_Association&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107373426" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Cultic_Studies_Association&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107373426" rel="nofollow">dleleted</a> the material again.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Cultic_Studies_Association&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107382307" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Cultic_Studies_Association&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107382307" rel="nofollow">revert</a> again with a demand for an explanation. (This was my second revert and I was not planning to revert again.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jkelly deletes the well-sourced material again and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Cultic_Studies_Association&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107384260" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Cultic_Studies_Association&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107384260" rel="nofollow">protects</a> the page. He <i>still</i> had not yet identified himself as an admin; this was the first indication .</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A lengthy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:International_Cultic_Studies_Association#Mention_of_specific_person" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:International_Cultic_Studies_Association#Mention_of_specific_person" rel="nofollow">discussion</a> ensued.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWeniWidiWiki_b655.html" title="User:WeniWidiWiki">WeniWidiWiki</a> ends the discussion with "You do not dictate policy at wikipedia, and Jkelly has every right to discuss this issue, edit and end a revert-war or remove inappropriate material just like any wikipedian." My response to this would be:
<ul>
<li>I did not attempt to dictate policy at Wikipedia, I attempted to apply it by restoring well-sourced material. Someone has recently been blocked twice for deleting well-source material on <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_apologist.html" title="Cult apologist">Cult apologist</a>. The admin involved called such unilateral deletion "edit warring." Perhaps I misunderstood in trying to apply that concept to the present article.</li>
<li>If this can be called a "revert war" then Jkelly participated as well, and not as an admin because he had not declared himself as such.</li>
<li>If Jkelly can delete "inappropriate material just like any Wikipedian", meaning that he was <i>not</i> acting as an admin, then I can certainly revert it as well (please note that I was being conscious of and observant of 3RR) since it was a unilateral deletion of well-sourced material.</li>
<li>In the discussion Jkelly suggests that I did not respect his admin authority. We were well into the revert cycle before he revealed himself as such.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My POV during these events was formed in large part by the fact that we have quite recently been through about 20 deletions of well-sourced material on the other articles mentioned above. We still haven't recovered the material.</p>
<p>The ICSA page is also cult-related. Absent <i>any</i> prior discussion I could only assume that the same thing was happening there. Perhaps I now don't have enough tolerance for unilateral deletion of well-sourced material without proper explanation either before the fact or for awhile after it, I don't know.</p>
<p>An opinion on these events would be appreciated. If I need a hard slap to the head then please do apply it. I'll accept and apologize profusely to Jkelly. I will actually consider that an acceptable outcome to this posting, as if I have screwed up I really need to know it. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 22:50, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would like to offer that Jkelly never said a single word about an OTRS complaint. When he first arrived as a non-admin editor and starting deleting well-sourced material, all he said was that "someone complained". I did not find that argument from just-another-editor to be compelling. Later, after revealing himself to be an admin (or rather after I had to deduce it), he dropped that argument entirely and started asking why we were using ICSA's own website as an RS for a mention of who the ICSA's own staff was.</dd>
<dd>I am used to admins identifying themselves as such rather than making editors guess. I am used to them showing respect to editors by giving at least a brief explanation as to what guideline they are enforcing. None of this would have happened had Jkelly done that. I happen to have respect for admins. Bishonen has advised me on several occassions that I was misunderstanding the guidelines, and I have been happy for that. But all of this has completely bewildered me. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 23:21, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can understand why you might be agitated by having your edits reverted, but I don't see what the big deal is about the admin identifying himself, etc. You were not blocked or anything. His second edit summary should have been more descriptive, because the fact did have a source. (However, the source is not a strong one—it is a non-published website and not an independent source—and even supposing the accuracy of it, there are separate reasons why it would not be appropriate to have listings of living non-notable ex-members of organizations who choose to leave. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:09, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To clarify, don't worry too much about whether or not you misunderstood guidelines. We are here to create an encyclopedia, and in this case we have a living person affected by it, in a real sense and a sometimes legal sense. In such case, we have weakly sourced information which, even if it were perfectly accurate, would not be very important to the article—and it may very well be completely false. Both of you were trying to improve the encyclopedia; Jkelly's summary of the edit or other explanation was simply not sufficiently explanatory. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:17, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, I'm really not trying to fight you folks here, I'm really honestly sincerely trying to understand so that I don't repeat this apparent screwup in future. Please help me here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually, I was not at <i>all</i> agitated about having my edit reverted. Not at <i>all</i>. On the "cult-related" pages (like ICSA) I get the hell reverted out of me all the time. Actually I and others have been so reverted that someone has been blocked twice on those pages, the second time just a day ago. I've gotten used to it. My <i>strong</i> understanding from the admin in that case is that it just "isn't done" to unilaterally delete well-sourced material without prior discussion and consensus -- if I understand her correctly then she considers this to be "edit warring". Perhaps there are nuances to this that I don't understand, and that it is sometimes ok for a new editor on an article to to delete well-sourced material, and that it is improper for other editors to protest, ask for an explanation, and revert until the deletion can be discussed. Honestly, that's where my head is at right now, trying to understand this. I know that if I go to the disputed pages mentioned above and start unilaterally deleting well-sourced material that Bishonen will hand me my head.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'm really not at all understanding why the ICSA website is not an RS from which to source a mention of who their <i>own</i> staff is. It would seem that it would therefore not be possible to make mention of the staff of any organization anywhere in Wikipedia. I'm not trying to be flippant. And so far there has been <i>zero</i> support offered for the proposal that he has left the organization. Had that <i>ever</i> been presented to the other editors on the article we could have discussed it. As things stand I didn't realize that a rumor, presented by an <i>ordinary editor</i> (which is how Jkelley was functioning as I now understand -- see below) that someone had left an organization was sufficient cause for invoking <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Again, I could easily be confused. And at this point, I'm definitely not being flippant about that.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jkelly has elsewhere recently told me that his initial edits were made as an ordinary editor rather than as an admin. I thought that someone who was an editor on a page was not allowed to exercise admin authority on the same page because it is a COI. I got this notion from <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">Jossi</a> who has several times mentioned that he was not allowed to administrate artricles on which he was an editor. But I must have been confused about that as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any help understanding these things would be appreciated. Honestly, I'm very very confused. I want to be a contributor, rather than a troublemaker, and I need to understand these things. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 03:02, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, your actions are not those of a troublemaker and I don't think this qualifies as a "screwup", though in general even if it had been some random user removing the name, it makes sense to bring up the change with the user without reverting repeatedly. Still, not doing that would not mean you would be a troublemaker. The reason the website of the organization is not the most reliable sources is that they have may have an interest in skewing the data; they could, for example, want to inflate the numbers of their leadership, or associate themselves with authors and academics in order to appear more credible, even though the authors and academics might have been only loosely or never related to the organization. I cannot anywhere Jkelly said that his initial edits were made as "an ordinary editor". There are several things he could mean by such a statement, but he does not mean that he is a regular editor of that page or that he has any special interest in it. He came to the page in response to a complaint on OTRS. Making some edits to an article, or for example coming there after a report on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, does not entail that the admin suddenly becomes biased. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 05:41, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Hi, Tanaats, 3 points:</dd>
<dd>1.) I don't at all agree that Jkelly's actions were just the same as those I have blocked another editor for twice in the last few days. That editor had, as you point out above, not merely removed well-sourced material, but removed it <i>about 20 times</i>, performing essentially the same few reverts over and over. My first block was for 3RR violation together with edit warring on other articles, and incivility on talkpages. The second was for aggravated 3RR vio together with gaming the 3RR on another article. I haven't gone into the matter of sourcing at <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Cultic_Studies_Association_3b5c.html" title="International Cultic Studies Association">International Cultic Studies Association</a>—can't face it at this time of night—but there's no way Jkelly could achieve anything approaching that lot in the few edits he did.</dd>
<dd>2.) There was no need for Jkelly to mention his other, admin, hat to you when you were discussing edits; you're ascribing too much importance to adminship, it's "no big deal". It's often positively inappropriate in an editing discussion to mention one's being an admin; as it's quite likely to raise complaints of being threatening, or of trying to "lord" it over other users. And a lot of the time, it's simply irrelevant. I won't belabor this point, as I think several people, including Jkelly himself, have been bringing it home to you. When it comes to giving editing advice, being an experienced, knowledgeable user is the point, and hopefully that point proves itself; being an admin is irrelevant.</dd>
<dd>3.) However, I agree with you that Jkelly was wrong to change hats in mid stream, i. e. to protect an article he was involved in an edit dispute over. "Do not protect a page you are involved in an edit dipute over" is both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy#How" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy#How" rel="nofollow">official policy</a> and common sense. Overtly reverting to one's preferred version and then immediately protecting, as shown in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Cultic_Studies_Association&amp;diff=107384494&amp;oldid=107384260" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Cultic_Studies_Association&amp;diff=107384494&amp;oldid=107384260" rel="nofollow">this edit summary</a>, is even wronger. The way you've described seeing Jossi do it is the right way: he edits the articles, and therefore never protects them. The only correct alternative is what I do on the same articles: protect them or block editors when necessary, and therefore never edit them. Just don't edit them at all, IMO, if they're in the least controversial, as you never know if somebody else will find your editing to be conflictual. (Mine is a dull role, yes. Best kept for articles you're not any too personally interested in.) Sorry, Jkelly, but you need to pick one of those, not mix them. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 03:54, 12 February 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Hi Bishonen. Thanks for your comments.
<ul>
<li>I definitely see your first point. I wasn't actually intending to make it seem that this issue was anywhere remotely as egregious as the earlier incident, but I definitely made it sound that way. I sincerely apologize to Jkelly for speaking unclearly enough so that such a comparison could be inferred. I really messed up in allowing such an inference to be made.</li>
<li>Thanks for the reminder, and I am actually aware that an admin doesn't have to go around saying "I'm an admin" every time he makes an edit to a new article, and that an admin is just another editor most of the time. I don't think that there was any problem at all with his not mentioning his admin hat <i>if</i> he was going to take and keep the role of an ordinary editor. This issue, however, you have already addressed.</li>

<dd>Bishonen, I'll email you more details, but this wasn't a content dispute. Either that, or we need two admins to respond to every OTRS complaint. One to fix the problem, and one to deal with people undoing the fixing, since the original admin is now "involved". <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 04:00, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jkelly, perhaps I've been too voluble previously to be understood clearly. Here is is in a nutshell... Were you or were you not functioning as an admin? If you <i>were</i> functioning as an admin enforcing WP:LIVING, why did you not say so right up front? I wouldn't have blinked an eye. You would have been in and out in flash. I would never have reverted your deletion, and you would never have had to make the same deletion three times in a row. We wouldn't have had to discuss it on the Talk page, and neither you nor I would be here on ANI. It really confuses me that you didn't do that, but instead chose the route of multiple reverts and page protections instead.</dd>

<dd>But if, as you've told my on my talk page, you did <i>not</i> make the deletions as an admin, but rather as an ordinary editor with <i>no</i> OTRS mandate, then in what way were your deletions appropriate? You did not discuss first on Talk. You did not give an adequate reason in any of your edit comments. You just unilaterally deleted well sourced material. In what way was this appropriate, and in what way were my two reverts, taken before I could get you to Talk, inappropriate? I really would appreciate having this explained to me, as I am very confused by this as well.

<p>It doesn't seem to me that Jkelly did anything wrong. There was a complaint to OTRS. OTRS participants are expected to act on legitimate complaints, and if there is an unsourced assertion posing a problem it can and should be removed, and if an edit war ensues, page protection is appropriate. Policy is at <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>. OTRS participants, or for that matter any admin removing unsourced assertions per <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>, are not expected to find a different admin to protect the page if protection is necessary to enforce the removal. Once the immediate problem is dealt with, discussion and consenus-based decisionmaking are appropriate, but the onus is on the editors adding assertions to demonstrate that they are well sourced. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 04:59, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whatever this OTRS system is, it seems to be secret.

<dd>No, you would need to be personally mentioned in the article, and you would still need to bring up an argument—a sounder one than would probably be necessary on wiki, and ultimately you would get the same result if you brought the matter up on <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>, or <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_N_9f16.html" title="WP:BLP/N">WP:BLP/N</a>, <s>only more immediately</s> <small>(Actually, this is not true.

<dd>I believe it's incorrect to state that there is "no reliable source" for including this particular staff member. There is. The reliable source is the organization's own web page which lists it's own staff members and had this person on it. That is sufficiently reliable in an article about the organization. That the organization has now removed the person, actually makes the event even more notable. In fact it's downright suspicious. Makes me want to research the person to see why they are so important to generate all this fuss. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 07:04, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Or, as in the example I described above, they may wish to appear more credible by associating themselves with certain academics. I don't see what would be so suspicious about it. The most reasonable explanation is that the organization inflated their relationship with this person, or someone simply made an error, and then when they were contacted they removed it because it is false. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 21:36, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For my part, I would like to drop this now. I thank everyone for their comments. I have learned some valuable things. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 17:52, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd respect Tanaats's wish to drop it, except that I feel a need to reply to Bishonen (with whom I seldom disagree). Bishonen, your third point was that Jkelly "was wrong to change hats in mid stream, i. e. to protect an article he was involved in an edit dispute over." Actually, if I were to make a list of the admins I considered to be least likely to abuse their powers, I'd struggle to think of someone who'd be higher on that list than Jkelly. It's true that the proection policy forbids admins to protect a page when they are involved in an editing dispute. But the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> policy explicitly allows editors to "enforce the removal of such material with page protection and blocks, even if they have been editing the article themselves." Even with that exception, I'm far from convinced that Jkelly was in any way "involved" with the article. That article was started in March 2005, and Jkelly never edited it until yesterday, when he removed something, citing <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> in his edit summary. Since Tanaats did not know he was an admin, and since there was a source for the information that Jkelly had removed (though it turned out to be controversial, and was subsequently removed), I see no reason to blame him for his revert. (Of course, asking for clarification on the talk page would have been better, but let's face it, <i>lots</i> of respectable editors revert once before going to the talk page.) Yes, Jossi is correct not to protect articles that he edits, <i>unless</i> there are BLP issues. If there are, then he, Jkelly, you, and I, not only may, but <i>should</i> protect if it's necessary. It would be an entirely different matter if Jkelly had been editing one of his favourite articles, had come across an editor who was inserting something he personally didn't like, and had protected the page after reverting, but it would be difficult to convince me that that's what happened here.</p>
<p>Jkelly, of course, had no reason to identify himself as an admin immediately. ("I'm an admin: don't revert me" would be a very inappropriate edit summary.") He should have made it clearer to Tanaats a little earlier, but that's not an abuse; that's an "oops-he-didn't-explain-himself-properly" mistake. Tanaats, I don't think you "need a hard slap to the head" at all. Your misunderstanding was entirely excusable, and since you did misunderstand, it was perfectly okay to raise the question here. There's no indication that you were trying to be disruptive in any way, and I don't think anyone, least of all Jkelly, will hold it against you that it turned into a big discussion. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 23:27, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but is it just me? If someone appears here and their immediate demand is for a desysopping then my kneejerk reaction is to check their edits and look for evidence that they are abusing editing priviledges. Which they usually are.</p>
<p>Anyone who appears here wanting the immediate desysopping of someone - and in the last month or so, this has not been an unusual cry from people who have disagreed even on a minor issue with an admin - should really go away and think about what they're saying. If nothing else, they are promoting a situation where <i>real</i> abuses <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf_ec71.html" title="The Boy Who Cried Wolf">will be ignored</a>. A similar thing is happening with people dragging admins to RfC because they disagree with policy or the implementation of policy.</p>
<p>Perhaps something along those lines, less <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bitey</a> perhaps, could be added to the header of this page? <b>〈<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">RED</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers"><font color="red">VEЯS</font></a>〉</b> 20:46, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would have to say I agree with you, Redvers. I have frequently seen headings stating admin abuse, but I never actually see a case where this has actually occurred.

<dd>I completely agree. We shouldn't miss the point I was making (well, not <i>this</i> quickly): if every single dispute with an admin is to be declared "ADMIN ABUSE!!! DESYSOPPPP THIS IDIOOT!" then we'll soon never be able to spot admin abuse on the rare occasions it does happen. The screams of "ABUSE ABUSE!" and the pointless RfCs are increasing the signal-to-noise ratio so much that a genuine complainant will simply never be heard. This is a <b>Bad Thing</b>.

<dd>I doubt there's anything you can do or say to stop it, though. A warning will not deter trolls. A warning is most likely to deter cautious editors who have legitimate, especially borderline, claims, and who really don't want to cause a scene. Those are exactly the people we want to hear from. I think it's better to leave the ANI header warning as it is, and just get used to taking one short look at lame complaints, marking them unfounded, and then letting them get archived away. --&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> -- 21:31, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>(back on track) legitimate editors with legitimate claims are unlikely to come here screaming abuse in all caps.

<dd>Indeed. If I see a report that starts with "I have a concern" or something similar, I'm inclined to pay more attention than practically <i>anything</i> in all-caps (also, in the above thread, I checked the block log of the complaining editor to <i>very</i> quickly ascertain the editor's tumultuous history with admins).</dd>
<dd>Basically, while I think the concern about crying wolf is valid, I think most of superfluous complaints/complainers distinguish themselves from legit situations well enough that we have little to worry about. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 22:15, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thid editor has a long history of introducing inappropriate articles. Look at his user talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Zmaz0ox" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Zmaz0ox" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> and you'll see it has some messages about this, and finally, at the end, a warning. After this warning, the user went on to contribute a couple instances of petty vandalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Cockcroft&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107624230" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Cockcroft&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107624230" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107628374" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107628374" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>. I haven't reported this at AIV because they'll just say he hasn't been warned enough, but it's pretty apparent that this person isn't going to contribute constructively. Also, this person has a history of introducing bogus names to image thumbnail descriptions like these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_War_II&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53499594" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_War_II&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53499594" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_War_II&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53499872" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_War_II&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53499872" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nazi_Germany&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53500276" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nazi_Germany&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53500276" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Benito_Mussolini&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54918101" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Benito_Mussolini&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54918101" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, etc. etc. Most of these are sneaky and probably aren't detected right away, so people don't bother to find who did it and warn him. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheQuandry_2564.html" title="User:TheQuandry">TheQuandry</a> 21:14, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The image thumbnail edits were from May 2006 as far as I can tell, the initial talk page warnings were on some of these. Since just one edit in September and 2 now on 12th February:</dd>
<dd><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107628374" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stalin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107628374" rel="nofollow">Joseph_Stalin</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Cockcroft&amp;diff=107624230&amp;oldid=95602355" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Cockcroft&amp;diff=107624230&amp;oldid=95602355" rel="nofollow">John_Cockcroft</a>, each of these deserves further progressive warnings as per policy, but I do not see that each type of disruption needs qualify in turn for the 4 warning steps before we take action over disruptive only accounts. Given page creation at warning level 4 (block on next such edit) with heed to follow policy, these 2 edits today seem to confirm the editor as making only disruptive edits over a period of time. I've issued test4 and test5 (blocked for 24hrs). Further disruption should lead to progressively longer blocking or an indef block. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 01:29, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A new user, User:FarmSanctuary is stubbornly inserting and reinserting materials into the <a href="../../../f/o/i/Foie_gras.html" title="Foie gras">Foie gras</a> article which is taken straight from the [www.nofoiegras.org] site. He says he FarmSanctuary is his organization and thus he has ownership and right to copy them here. I have two questions based on this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1)Should the user be allowed to keep the name of "his" organization as his username?</dd>
<dd>2)Should we take this user at his word that he duly represents the organization and therefore has the right to license the material to Wikipedia under GFDL?</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) Mm... well, at minimum, some proof of ownership of the copyright is necessary. I believe this is usually handled either through contact with the Wikimedia Foundation, or through a statement placed on the organization's web site stating the material is so licensed. If that should happen, then there's no issue with using that material, per se. However, it may still be a conflict of interest. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 21:28, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What nonsense. First he called me a vandal when it was infact only a content dispute. And then when I had had enough of his crying wolf, I left a {npa2} on his page. This he now claims is my 'threat' to him. Between all this, he filed a frivolous rfcu in bad faith against me and many ips with all sorts of fabricated evidence. It got thrown out. As for his references, I'd like to see him point out even one user that he has managed to convince on the half dozen talk pages that he's pushing his case on. If he thinks I have some kind of pov and am biased, let him show atleast one user who has supported him. Fact of the matter is that all his so called 'refs' do not prove what he is claiming. For details, people can take a look at Template_talk:Dravidian topics, <a href="../../../y/a/k/Talk%7EYakshagana_3ee1.html" title="Talk:Yakshagana">Talk:Yakshagana</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Talk%7ECarnatic_music_1cb6.html" title="Talk:Carnatic music">Talk:Carnatic music</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Talk%7EDravidian_people_ec0f.html" title="Talk:Dravidian people">Talk:Dravidian people</a> etc.,. You will see that he is fighting a lone and losing battle and yet he is continuing to tag dozens and dozens of articles with his nonsensical {Dravidian topics} template. If anything, he is guilty of blatant trolling and vandalism. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 19:12, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Sarvagnya does have a record of showing a short temper and pushing pov. Plus, if per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_checkuser%2FCase%2FSarvagnya&amp;diff=85077436&amp;oldid=82981280t" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_checkuser%2FCase%2FSarvagnya&amp;diff=85077436&amp;oldid=82981280t" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> he has been found guilty of sockpuppeteering, and should get down from his high horse. What we require from Sarvagnya is a statement that he recognizes that sockpuppetry is unacceptable, and that he is required to seek for bona fide compromise within policy; Wikipedia is not a bullying competition, but a collaborative project. His dispute with Wiki Raja may be justified in good faith, but he needs to deal with it in a much more wikilike way. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 08:27, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>First things first. <i><b>No</b></i>. <b>I have not been found guilty of sockpuppeteering or anything like that.</b> It was an erroneous result that concluded so and upon further investigation by Blnguyen, dmcdevit and few other admins, we(me and Gnanapiti) were cleared of the charges. Unfortunately however, the rfcu page was never updated <i>until yesterday</i> to reflect this. This has made me fair game for people like Wikiraja who revel in coming up with fabricated evidence using half-truths like this.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>I have never been blocked for 3rr.</b> Wikiraja's claim is pure BS. Anybody is free to check my block log. The first time Aksi warned me about 3rr violation in august, I was very new and I didnt even know what 3rr was. Technically it wasnt even a violation, coz nobody warned me when I was 'in danger' of a violation. Since then I have <i><b>never</b></i> violated 3rr. The recent warning by <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">User:RaveenS</a> was frivolous and stemmed from the fact that the user probably forgot how to count.</li>

<li>As for most of the other diffs he's dumped above, who was I warring with? With a WP all time great - <b><a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">User:Mahawiki</a></b>. Everybody who was involved knows what he was and I am unapologetic. <b>I dont apologise for having been rude to trolls, vandals and sockpuppeteers.</b> He and his comrade <b><a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EArya_Rajya_Maharashtra_6561.html" title="User:Arya Rajya Maharashtra">User:Arya_Rajya_Maharashtra</a></b>(who later was caught using multiple and abusive socks against me and banned) were systematically targeting me and the articles I edited. More recently <b><a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvabhaum_35d6.html" title="User:Sarvabhaum">another user</a></b> who curiously had the <i>exact same POV and editing practices</i> as the duo <b>got banned indefinetely</b> from Wikipedia, again for using abusive and block evading socks repeatedly.

<li>And dear dab, you accuse me of POV pushing. May I know <i>where</i>? POV pushing was what wikiraja was accusing me of on that template too. Now the votes(many of them from admins) on that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2007_February_12" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2007_February_12" rel="nofollow"><b>tfd</b></a> speaks for itself.

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>And dab, you of all should know that reading selectively quoted diffs can be misleading. For example, I can make a collage of diffs of your correspondences with say, WIN or Baka or somebody(and vice versa) and make a specious case that you've been incivil, vandal, pov-pusher etc., etc.,. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dbachmann&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76853796" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dbachmann&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76853796" rel="nofollow">I only know to say it the way it <i>is</i></a> and call a spade a spade. For that, I am unapologetic.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<ul>
<li>If anybody(an admin or a respectable user) needs any clarification about any particular diff that wikiraja's dumped above, <i>ask</i>.

Does it go against Wikipedia policy for sockpuppet and/or meatpuppet accounts to engage in voting? I have been attacked from all directions for the fact that I have formed a WikiProject Dravidian civilizations and have had Dravidian topics templates on Dravidian related sites. But, when those accusing me go against the rules and even break some of the most severe rules, they get a slap on the wrist. I just cannot believe how much biasedness, prejudice, and favoritism is going on here on Wikipedia. There is an intollerance for non-Hindus, non-Brahmins, non-Aryans (Tamils and other Dravidians), and especially against Sri Lankan Tamils here by these editors and administration of this social club who is campaigning against me. I have never once spoke out against a particular ethnic, religious, or any other group. However, it seems that some people are exempt to really trash mouthing the Tamil civilization in both India and Sri Lanka. I promote an interest group, and I get bombarded because it goes against some peoples nationalistic biased POVs. So, what policies are we going by here? Wikipedia policy, or POV policy? It is truly sad what is going on here and how much some of these editors and administrator can get away with by revising history and stating that certain ethnic groups or <i>family</i> of ethnic groups do not exist. When they feel that their POVs are threatened, they go for low blows and fight dirty. I have nothing else to say, other than I am really disappointed with Wikipeida. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_Raja_d537.html" title="User:Wiki Raja">Wiki Raja</a> 22:02, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Oh please do stop it. Sarvagnya has gotten close to line before when dealing with Mahawiki, Arya_Rajya_Maharashtra and Sarvabhaum, except that all those users are now either banned or are likely outdated sockpuppets of each other. Another user Dineshkannambadi who has provided multiple FAs for Wikipedia was also gotten irritated by the antics of these users, so the fact that Sarvagnya has gotten a bit hot under the collar is understandable if not ideal behaviour. Right, what exactly is the issue?

<dd>I have never spoken against Brahmins or any other caste, or any other ethnicity, or religion. Not even once. But I see that it is fair game for others to do so. However, I will not stoop to that level and put anybody down on the basis of ethnicity, religion, or caste (Even though I do not believe in the caste system). Also, by the way, another round of anonymous IP Address users are at it again this time taking off the <i>WikiProject Dravidian civilizations</i> templates off the Dravidian related sites.

<p>This user is attacking me with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nadirali&amp;diff=107520966&amp;oldid=107519088" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nadirali&amp;diff=107520966&amp;oldid=107519088" rel="nofollow">these comments</a>.</p>
<p>I don't want to get baited into another fight by people like this user as I did by Hkelkar so i seek a neutral admin to handle this.</p>
<p>Here is the pattern:If Indian nationalists cannot have their POV in the articles,they either start with threats like these or get a an Indian administrator to punish us for not accepting their pro-India POV. His threats clearly indicate that he wants to get me blocked by an Indian admin as other Indian users have done to Pakistani users in the past.</p>
<p>The dispute is regarding Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar who was born in <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahore.html" title="Lahore">Lahore</a>.Many indian editors insist that pre-british SOuth asia (including Pakistn and Bangladesh) was Inida. User:Fowler&amp;fowler who is not Pakistani may i add is also agreeing that falsely claiming pre-british SOuth Asia as "india" is completely incorrect.</p>
<p>user Anupamsr placed a bogus warning on my talkpage(as others of his kind did on Fowler&amp;fowler's talkpage as well).</p>
<p>His statement "our encyclopedia" enraged me as wikipedia is not "owned" by any single user.I am not going to respond to him anymore as I know where it will lead to and ask that a neutral admin or party handle this.</p>
<p>Since I am not the only one know that Lahore,along with the rest of Pakistan was <b>never</b> part of India,I would like user:Fowler&amp;fowler,user:unre4L and other users who know that I'm correct on this issue to comment here.--<a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadirali_c5a5.html" title="User:Nadirali">Nadirali نادرالی</a> <small>at 16:26, 12 February 2007</small></p>

<p>We have tried "Dispute Resolution", and even RfC in other articles. Unfortunately, I was banned before the debates started, for bringing up the Argument in the first place, which was referred to as "POV pushing" in order to ban me.<br />
I can confirm this. user:Anupamsr and a few other users, insist on writing "Lahore, India, (now Pakistan)", even though Lahore is a Pakistani city and has Never been part of India. It was part of British India for 95 years, however, these users refuse to write British India, or link the page to British India. The page is currently linked to the India Disambig page, where the reader has to guess which India is being referred to.<br />
Besides, in every encyclopaedia out there, Lahore is a Pakistani city. I dont understand why they just cant write "Lahore, Pakistan".<br />
The fact is, that Lahore has only ever been an Indian (British) city for 95 years, which was during the British Raj.<br />
I gave up editing this page, as I have been banned twice for having my say in articles like these.<br />

<p>I just don't see the purpose of such threats to get me blocked.And accusations of "block evasion".If I made such an accusation against an Indian user,RA would block me on the spot.As he stated in his threats about Unre4L being blocked,it corresponds to what Unre4L being blocked.I just think a warning should do for the time being thats all.--<a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadirali_c5a5.html" title="User:Nadirali">Nadirali نادرالی</a></p>

<dd>Here i quote the part I am concerned about:</dd>
<dd>"<i>If you sell a small part of your property to a person who builds his own house will that make you to change the name of your house. Also Pakistan is just a temporary nation that may exist or may not exist in the future. It is based on Islam and the nation is not just Pakistan but an Islamic republic of Pakistan. If China can claim part of Tibet and especially Taiwan formed 50 or so years ago, surely India has a better right to claim Pakistan. Just because it is not done at present did not mean it cannot be made in the future, nor there is a guarantee that the so called Pakistani's themselves will not be joining India (Bharat).</i></dd>

<dd>This entire post is extremely offensive towards Pakistani users and it is taken as a direct insult by Pakistanis. Please note that it is a part of a thread which was started by a Pakistani user. This post is an open claim over Pakistan's territory; most Pakistan vs. India edit wars, even over talk pages, are because of Indian users' indirect claims over Pakistan.

<p>I notice that a person I was in conflict with some time ago - a person with an academic career, by the way - is now going to extraordinary lengths to cover his tracks, hiding some very intemperate remarks that he made. I will refrain from mentioning his name, but I question the ethics of these "concealing" edits. As one of the parties involved in the (past) dispute, I am mentioning the matter here, and suggesting that someone may want either to revert, or to make some indication on these talk pages that considerable matter has been cut. Please note that I am avoiding linking the material that is liable to reveal his identity: that is, I am not linking to where a username was related to his actual name.</p>

<p>I am getting a bit bored with three editors making personal attacks claiming individuals are biased. There seems to be a constant pattern with other people describing their particular edits as biased (which is fine, we all make bad edits sometimes) but their retort being by attacking individuals which isn't on. Perhaps they don't see the distinction. See for example <a href="../../../z/e/e/User_talk%7EZeeboid_d1dd.html#3RR" title="User talk:Zeeboid">User_talk:Zeeboid#3RR</a> where <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">User:UBeR</a>, <a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">User:Zeeboid</a> and <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">User:Mnyakko</a> are having a go at <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">User:William_M._Connolley</a>. Since I have also been accused by them of systematically biased editing by one of the three ("as I compile your comments and reverts throughout Wikipedia it seems more and more like a strong case of your own biases being exercised against content you do not agree with and users who provide that content." in a long passage at <a href="../../../g/l/o/Talk%7EGlobal_warming_controversy_cca2.html#Reverted_edits" title="Talk:Global warming controversy">Talk:Global_warming_controversy#Reverted_edits</a>) I don't think I should be the one to tell them to try not to play the person rather than the ball. Two other sysops also seem to have suffered this sort of low-level abuse. I actually think the issues they raise are quite legitimate but the manner in which they conduct themselves continually really undermines the WP spirit.</p>
<p>Anyone feel up to reviewing, taking on and giving some friendly advice? If you find my conduct has been to blame for antagonising them or anything, do say.
