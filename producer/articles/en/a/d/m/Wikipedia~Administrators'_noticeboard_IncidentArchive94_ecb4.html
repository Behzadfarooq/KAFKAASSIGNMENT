<p>Please note the political maps of india related sites. Some group of users(Ravikiran r , SwiftRakesh etc) selectively remove Thiruvananthapuram and add Kochi in the region even after the repeated corrections.This is to create a false impression that Kochi is the capital or prominent city in the state.</p>
<p>Thiruvananthapuram is the capial(also largest) city of Kerala and is the Educational &amp; RD center of the state. It houses VSSC,ISRO like space organisations and also head quarters of southern aircommand.It will be the headquarters of newly forming aerospace command.</p>
<p>All the official maps give prominance to Thiruvananthapuram look at some of the most popular official sites I take example of Railways &amp; Airport sites.</p>
<p>see what railways say 'FACILITIES OF TOP CITIES' at <a href="http://www.southernrailway.org/city/facility.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.southernrailway.org/city/facility.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.southernrailway.org/city/facility.asp</a>, they consider only Thiruvananthapuram from the state.CHENNAI ,MUMBAI ,PUNE ,NEW NELHI ,HYDERABAD ,KOLKATA ,BANGLORE ,TRIVANDRUM are included .</p>
<p>Also please <a href="http://www.airportsindia.org.in/aai/airports-frame.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.airportsindia.org.in/aai/airports-frame.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.airportsindia.org.in/aai/airports-frame.htm</a> like many ones</p>
<p><br />
Please do some thing to stop this venegance against thiruvananthapuram by a group(looks like they are promoted by a Kochi based lobby)</p>
<p>Also please look at India talk page--<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESathyalal_150b.html" title="User:Sathyalal">Sathyalal</a> 17:25, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

As an observer, I just want to comment that the image IndiaMap2.png was the existing image which <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESathyalal_150b.html" title="User:Sathyalal">Sathyalal</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESathyalal_2b33.html" title="User talk:Sathyalal">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sathyalal_3e1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sathyalal">contribs</a>) replaced with his version IndiaMapUpdated.GIF against consensus, as seen in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Talk%7EIndia_23a2.html" title="Talk:India">Talk:India</a>. He then went on revert-warring with others and was blocked for 3RR. This is a content dispute, and a current discussion thread is there in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Talk%7EIndia_23a2.html" title="Talk:India">Talk:India</a> which relates to this.

<dd>I admit that being a new user I tried to change the ambiguous information in the map without knowing the 3rr rule. Sorry for the same. But that is not an excuse to keep a wrong data there. The specified map with ambiguous information was created by the same people who maligned information in <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thiruvananthapuram.html" title="Thiruvananthapuram">Thiruvananthapuram</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a> sites. Finally the admin has corrected the information in those sites. <a href="../../../k/e/r/Talk%7EKerala_96f5.html" title="Talk:Kerala">Talk:Kerala</a></dd>

<dd>So I would like to request the admin to give justice after verifying the facts. --<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESathyalal_150b.html" title="User:Sathyalal">Sathyalal</a> 10:32, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can I make a suggestion? This has popped up here a few times now, and it's not really the appropriate place, it's a dispute over facts rather than something requiring admin intervention. You should sort out a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequest_for_comments_2d04.html" title="Wikipedia:Request for comments">request for comment</a> on the subject, to get some outside views. If, once you've had some neutral parties look at the subject, certain individuals persist in changing things contrary to consensus, bring it back here. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 10:49, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Andrew, That is where exact the problems is. If no consensus is reached the ambiguous information will be there for ever and that is what one set of people need. So if some body is in a compromise mood, then they should be willing to put both the cities in the map or remove both. That is why we need admin intervention --<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESathyalal_150b.html" title="User:Sathyalal">Sathyalal</a> 11:01, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that's why you need an RFC as a first step. Get some people who don't live in southern India to look at the situation, and see what they think (I'll have a look myself). Or try for formal mediation, but I'd go for an RFC first. If it's clear that partisans of one city are being unreasonable, outsiders with no axe to grind will be able to see that, and the situation can then be resolved, by admin action if necessary. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 11:05, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed yesterday that an anon from IP 87.116.178.132 had removed a number of tags from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_legendary_kings_of_Britain_efbf.html" title="List of legendary kings of Britain">List of legendary kings of Britain</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_of_Chinese_monarchs_c834.html" title="Table of Chinese monarchs">Table of Chinese monarchs</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Oman_acb3.html" title="History of Oman">History of Oman</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Vietnamese_dynasties_cb79.html" title="List of Vietnamese dynasties">List of Vietnamese dynasties</a>, and <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rulers_and_heads_of_state_of_Ethiopia_ea83.html" title="Rulers and heads of state of Ethiopia">Rulers and heads of state of Ethiopia</a> with no explanation. I cleaned up, &amp; did a reverse lookup of the IP number: it appears to be a dialup in Belgrade served by Serbian Broadband (SBB). I thought about a 24-hour ban, but since the addressing was dynamic &amp; there was reasonable doubt that said user was a vandal (could just be some young kid discovering that, yes, he could edit Wikipedia), I let this slide.</p>
<p>Took another look today, &amp; another SBB dialup IP (87.116.171.209) reverted all of these changes. Moreover, <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> left a 3RR warning on this user's talk page. A bit of study of <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rulers_and_heads_of_state_of_Ethiopia_ea83.html" title="Rulers and heads of state of Ethiopia">Rulers and heads of state of Ethiopia</a> shows similar edits from IP 87.116.165.178 (both also resolving to dialups in Belgrade). Obviously banning IP numbers won't work here, but we need to educate this person somehow. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 20:47, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Hi -- I noticed that you blocked this anon editor for 8 hours. Would you consider reducing this block to half an hour or an hour? For reasons that I explain at WP:AN/I, I suspect that a ban of more than half an hour will be counterproductive: it won't stop this person, but will likely block good-faith editors in Belgrade, Serbia. Thanks, llywrch 21:42, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Seems better to answer here. Answer: I don't know. So I'm not going to do anything myself, other than release this block into the care of anyone who wants it, with freedom to reduce it if you think its appropriate <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<p>Hmmm... no-one took me up on that. And now he anon has a 24h block for the same behaviour. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 15:39, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry. I didn't act on your offer because (1) I knew I would be away from my computer for several hours, &amp; would be unable to monitor the situation if I reduced the period of this ban; &amp; (2) you had stated here that you had no problem if another admin removed the block if it affected another contributor. So far, all this guy appears to be interested in is removing templates on 3 of these 5 articles -- &amp; not communicating. I expect him to pop up at another SBB IP address soon, though. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 15:54, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mmm. I was about to point out that nominating articles for deletion requires an account, and therefore creating an account to nominate articles for deletion is perfectly logical. But the possible sock changes things. That said, the few nominations I looked at (it's late) look as if they could go either way even if there isn't <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> or sockpuppetry going on. I think the AfDs should be left to run their course, bearing in mind that as new users TrollHistorian and RabinicLawyer could both be discounted by closing admins as new users.

<dd>Might I point out that <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Graham_a3b5.html" title="User:William Graham">waffle iron</a> is a member of the SomethingAwful forums, as such is biased towards these articles. Historically SomethingAwful forums members are virtually militant in leaving their "mark" on the internet, such as Wikipedia articles, forum vandalism and others. All of the articles I nominated for deletion are articles that could be easily merged into the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_Forums_a7ce.html" title="Something Awful Forums">Something Awful Forums</a> articles, thereby reducing the amount of unnecessary cruft. <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERabinicLawyer_d566.html" title="User:RabinicLawyer">RabinicLawyer</a> 00:11, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not questioning your objectivity. I'm questioning whether or not the articles are encyclopedic. Wikipedia is not the SAclopedia or whatever they call it.

<dd>Attacking people for legitimately voting their opinions here and on the AfD pages is abusive. Please be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>. Meatpuppets are friends or family members or coworkers you drag in to participating in a WP debate despite not having been active before. It's clear that your friends/family members/coworkers are getting involved; whether they were dragged in or not, and whether they were previously active in WP or not, are not obviously concludable. People who aren't connected in real life agreeing with something does not, by definition, become meatpuppetry.</dd>
<dd>It is generally contentious whenever anyone starts nominating many like articles for AfD.

Every edit of Curval save one has thus far to agree with all of RabinicLawyer's AfDs. In other words, these are friends of RL who he asked to come on here and support his votes.

<dd>Actually, you might notice I even closed one, the first Kevin Bowen AfD. However, I also had an edit history outside of those AfDs - something you and your cohorts, except Incognito, cannot say. However, I will assume good faith, something you have thus far failed to do, and assume that it's just chums who decided to rally to your call. However, you should note that that is, in fact, the definition of a <a href="../../../m/e/a/WP%7EMEAT_8cd6.html" title="WP:MEAT">meatpuppet</a>: "A related issue occurs when multiple individuals create brand new accounts specifically to participate in (or influence) one particular vote or area of discussion. ...

<dd>So, when SomethingAwful Goons decide to post on their forums to "hey, vote agains this AfD" or something equivalent, or a group of them mobilize to protect their poorly written, cruft-filled articles, that isn't meat puppetry?

<p>Also, I have been informed that a thread on the Something Awful general forums was posted about the AfDs. This suggests more bad faith to me, since they attempted to use meatpuppetry to ensure these wikipedia articles were not deleted. I have PDFs of the thread, kindly provided to me by a friend, but I lack anywhere to upload them at present. But the thread was full of people encouraging eachother to vote against deletion of the articles.

<dd>I'm still feeling uneasy about a blanket block on an IP that may include hundreds of schools. Typically there were several days between the usual batches of school vandalism (Mar 1, 9, 24, 27, Apr 5, 20, 21, 24, 25), not what I'd call persistent.

<dd>Yes we could. For that matter, we could just revert the edits as they appear and not bother with a block at all. The point of blocking (in general) is that it saves us from having to do that.</dd>

<dd>According to <a href="http://www.pvsd.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.pvsd.org/" rel="nofollow">pvsd.org</a>, the Perkiomen valley school district includes seven schools (4 elementary, 2 middle, 1 high school). The blocked IP is one in a block of 32 addresses allocated to the district. My guess is that it probably serves as a proxy for the student workstations of one school. There's probably a small group of students at that school who have discovered a fun new game they can play between classes on this site called wikipedia dot org.

This means that blocking the IP can inconvenience legitimate logged in users (who you cannot know about) and still fail to curb the vandals. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 15:32, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In this case, judging by the histories of the vandalized articles, the IP seems to be static enough. Collateral damage is of course always a risk, but the fact that Hall Monitor's two-week block last months seems to have caused no complaints makes me consider it unlikely.

<p>It appears that innocent registered users have been unfairly blocked of editing the Kven page, due to actions by <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a>.</p>
<p>I ask myself to be immediately unblocked of editing Wikipedia articles and for the above mentioned administrator's rights to block or unblock users to be revoked, please, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Despite of many pleas for them to do so (on the<i>Kven</i> discussion page), the above mentioned user <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> and user <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a> have not provided sources for their claims, which are not - to my knowledge - supported by any known historians and/or other scientists.</p>
<p>Furthermore, users opposing the views of <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> and</p>

<p>Below are just a couple examples of the serious shortcomings of the Kven text version compailed in part by <i>Fred chessplayer</i>, which the user <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> has recently kept reverting to, and which he has now blocked several other users of correcting. While <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> has kept reverting the Kven page to this no-good version by <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a>, he has now blocked other registered users with good records also of reverting to the better text version, where the offered information was correct and where the information kept being backed up my more and more respected and known sources. The following exact quotes given first are from the currently standing <i>Fred chessplayer's</i> Kven text version. <i>Fred chessplayer's</i> claims are followed by correct information which is backed by known historians (the sources offered in <i>Fred chessplayer's</i> text version agree with this correct information, but not with the claims of <i>Fred chessplayer</i>):</p>
<p><b>1.</b> "Kvens (alternate spellings: Cwen, Kven, Kvæn, Kveeni, Quen) were a historical group of people that lived in the coastal areas around the Gulf of Bothnia, part of today's Finland."</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There is a wide concensus among historians, that large areas of today's Northern Sweden, particularly the areas around the Gulf of Bothnia, were also part of the historical Kvenland.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Thus, the historic Kvenland areas are not only "part of today's Finland", but also part of today's Sweden (and - according to many historians - perhaps also part of today's Norway, even parts of today's extreme Northwestern Russia according to some evidence, including historic maps).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>2.</b> "Possibly, Kvens referred to all Finnish people. (Suomen historia (History of Finland), page 27, Jouko Vahtola, Professor of Finnish and Scandinavian history. )."</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On the above mentioned page, Professor Vahtola does not claim such a thing. He only says that in 870 AD the "Kven" reference made by the Norwegian explorer was - perhaps - ment to refer to Finns in general. He is not discussing there any of the numerous other references to Kvens.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Professor Vahtola himself indeed has - in his various books - made it clear that Kvens are a separate group within the Finnish/Finnic people, and that the term "Kven" - used in various historic texsts - has not referred to the Finnish people in general, but to a historic group/tribe of people. There is a wide concensus about this matter among historians.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>3.</b>"In literature, the first known occurance of the Kven in the Account of the Viking Othere, a chronicle in the time of King Alfred the Great in the 9th century AD."</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>According to the distinguished Kven expert, the Professor Emeritus Kyösti Julku, the first reference to the Kven people in literature was made by the Roman historian Gornelius Julius Tacitus in 98 AD.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>4.</b>"Before the 8th century there are scarsely any remains of the Kvens."</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"On the contrary: The archaeological evidence of agricultural settlement on the Finnish side of the Bothnian Gulf is strong before the 9th century, and it gets weaker during the Viking period."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Despite of requests, neither one of the avove mentioned users have provided sources for their claims in this article in question, nor have they answered to the questions about the above mentioned and other shortcomings, misrepresentations and distortions of facts.</p>
<p>Some of the less important peaces of information in the current Kven text is correct, thanks to the contributions by users other than <i>Fred chessplayer</i> or <i>Mikkalai</i>. Much of the current text, however, is not reflecting the opinions of the utmost experts of the Scandinavian and Finnish history, nor does the current information match the views of the sources and references offered on the current Kven page.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the text version of "16:20, 18 April 2006 Ppt" provides valid information with maching distinguished sources and references, including a couple of exact quotes of the wordings by known Kven experts, etc.</p>
<p>Administrators, I the under-signer need to be unblocked immediately, please. I am not an anonomous user, but a proper registered user, and I must not be mixed up with any other users, regardless of what computers they might have used. I ask user <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> to please now proceed and provide ecidence of any wrong doing by me, or otherwise for him to unblock me immediately.</p>
<p>I also ask on the behalf of other Wikipedia users, where in the Wikipedia rules is it prohibited from the users of using two user accounts in Wikipedia. That appears to be the reasoning behind <i>Mikka's</i> blocking strategy in this particular case - - <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Dominique_8658.html" title="User:Art Dominique">Art Dominique</a>, April 26, 2006 15:38 - -</p>

<p>(Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I think it requires an Administator's attention. Apologies if this is not the right place.)</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnog_4f1b.html" title="User:Donnog">User:Donnog</a> has earlier today made a large number of edits to pages about the British Royal Family and Concentration Camps, as apparent from his User Contribution list. From the few I have looked at (<a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh_e472.html" title="Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</a>, plus various category additions and changes) these all involve adding references about their distant German family links.</p>
<p>His changes to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concentration_camp.html" title="Concentration camp">Concentration camp</a> have been questioned in that talk page as regards their NPOV.</p>
<p>I have questioned the veracity and relevancy of some of the changes to <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</a> at its talk page. I have also raised a query at <a href="../../../s/a/x/Talk%7ESaxe-Coburg_and_Gotha_75e4.html#United_Kingdom" title="Talk:Saxe-Coburg and Gotha">Talk:Saxe-Coburg and Gotha#United Kingdom</a></p>
<p>He appears to have added the new Category:German-British people.</p>
<p>I do not wish to appear racist, but it appears that this user <i>may</i> be making (relatively minor, and perhaps seemingly innocent) changes to a large number of pages to promote a specific Polish and/or German POV. I regret I do not have time to investigate all the recent changes, but I feel that this may require further investigation. <a href="../../../t/d/w/User%7ETdw_dd74.html" title="User:Tdw">TrevorD</a> 14:06, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you are referring to the article's talk page, yes I have. Most of the editors are in agreement with me. The problem boils down to a few editors who constantly change nationality sentences in the article without any supporting evidence to back it up. A few of the comments have become heated.

<p>I would like to report <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> for his/her overzealous use of deletion privileges. This has continued dispite many requests from other users to take more care in his/her actions. I copy below the various comments from myself and other users on Vegaswikian's talk page:</p>
<p><i>You deleted an article titled "Sam Ross." You felt that I was writing about myself. This however, is not true. I have read about Sam Ross in newspaper and magazine articles. From these sources, I was able to compile enough information to write a breif bio of him. Please do not delete valid articles. It is qualified because of "A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following"</i></p>
<p><i>I see you deleted the <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Lester_7251.html" title="Julius Lester">Julius Lester</a> article while I was creating it. I've put it back now -- with content! -- but just so you know, WikiProject Biography's instructions for creating a new biography are explicitly to</i> Add {{<a href="../../../b/i/o/Template%7EBiography_b518.html" title="Template:Biography">subst:Biography</a>}} into your article page and save<i>, and edit from there. So if you see a new template and don't give it an hour or two, that's probably what's happening. Now, admittedly that initial work could happen in a user space sandbox, but I was following the instructions of the Wikiproject in charge of the name space. If you find the method confusing, perhaps you should take it up with them and persuade them to change their doc? Thanks. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeborah-jl_154c.html" title="User:Deborah-jl">Deborah-jl</a> <sub><a href="../../../d/e/b/User_talk%7EDeborah-jl_4156.html" title="User talk:Deborah-jl">Talk</a></sub> 03:09, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><i>why did you delete my Pee Tanks Entry?</i></p>
<p><i>So it was a stub about a ghost story... That isn't necessarily a reason to speedy it, is it? You categorised it as "nonsense" but I'm not sure I agree with that categorisation being friendly or accurate. If the story is sourced enough (and I do find some other hits for it via Google: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Branch+Brook+Park++Newark%2C+New+Jersey++ghost+white+lady&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Branch+Brook+Park++Newark%2C+New+Jersey++ghost+white+lady&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) it's (possibly) notable as a story (just like this user's other contribution might be), regardless of the existance of ghosts.

<p><i>I'm sorry that I didn't write enough about Bob Olson to make it into a good article. I saw that the page had been requested for over a year, and I attempted to begin fulfilling that request by writing what I could find. Please note that, according to the deletion log page and request page, my stub was the closest to the request's notes. I would also like to make it known that I am not a newcomer to Wikipedia. I have been around Wikipedia longer than my account has been, and I have much more experience than the average user. I am also fully aware of user pages and their function, and if the information under "Bob Olson" was about me, I would have put it on my user page.

<li>I beleive you were too hasty in your deletion of the article, it was too "speedy". I was able to get the picture right and before i was finished adding text it was gone. I wouldn't even have had time to add hangon. You just as easily could have made the article a stub for the maentime and then come back.

<ul>
<li>that is completely false - there was a picture there, not to mention if you did the proper research (or just clicked what links here) you would see that hea is very notable and the article for a disease named after him is actually a featured article. don't be rediculous. and yes i made similar pages and was in the middle of doing a redirect. speedy deletion is meant to be an efficient way of monitering new article production and not hindering of the production of new articles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I am sure you are familiar with this phrase "Administrators, remember to check if anything links here, the page history (last edit) and any revisions of CSD before deletion." as it is plastered to the speedy deletion announcement. The article is finished so if you would be so kind as to remove the template... thank you. --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarsie_1c33.html" title="User:Larsie">Larsie</a> 18:17, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>If I may ask, what made you decide to delete the article for Nicolas Metoyer? I know it was just a stub, but I don't think it merited deletion. I'm only a little curious as to why you didn't feel it was necessary to at least tag the article or initiate a discussion about it. Metoyer may be non-notable to you, but he was a prominent figure in the developement of a self-sufficient colored community in Louisiana. I will admit that Louisiana history is a bit of a specific interest, but simply because you are not familiar with it does not give you the right to remove it from an encyclopedia. You may want to look at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se_Metoyer_3db5.html" title="Marie Thérèse Metoyer">Marie Thérèse Metoyer</a>, his mother, as well, but would you be kind enough not to delete that article (if you, as i suspect, believe it to be lacking in merit) until you have given those of us who care an opportunity to argue our case?<a href="../../../e/v/k/User%7EEvKnight13_f34c.html" title="User:EvKnight13">Dlayiga</a> 22:05, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><i>Ok but did you take time to actually read what I said in the discussion before arbitrarily deleting the article? <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> states that the notability standards are not official wikipedai policy.

<p>And finally my note:</p>
<p><i>I have noticed that you deleted the page <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._H._Brennan_6054.html" title="J. H. Brennan">J. H. Brennan</a>, as soon as I created it, even though I noted in my edit summery that there was more to come. I find this kind of over zealous deletion hinders Wikipedia and simply wastes time. If you had taken a moment to view my user page you would have found that I am a long time member of the community here and would not add something without consideration. Beyond this a simple search for JH Brennan on Google reveals that he has written more than fifty books including both fiction and non-fiction, which have been translated into as many languages and have been very influential. This is clearly notable. I am simply in a position now where I will have to start the page again, but I now have a deletion against my history. Please try to <b>discuss</b> before acting in this way in future. Thank you. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 08:47, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>This should show that this user is being overzealous and in my opinion is abusing his/her admin privileges, deleting pages before a user has finished working on them with no consensus just seems disruptive and unhelpful all around. - <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 18:54, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

(and I'd suggest that citing entire threads may be better than just interspersing comments) I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say that there's an issue here although I certainly would wish Vegaswikian had been more responsive to my queries.

I beefed the other one (<a href="../../../a/n/n/Annie%27s_Road_9a69.html" title="Annie's Road">Annie's Road</a>...) up with some research. I think it's marginally acceptable now, but unfortunately, that new user is gone now, near as I can tell last time I checked. I asked a different admin to undelete and userify the article Vegaswikian deleted and I have it in my userspace, I will rearticleify it when I finish sprucing it up.

When you take it upon yourself to remove IFD tags from your own images, it gives the appearance of the immatures who keep removing AFD tags from their own articles. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:20, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wasn't 'mucking about on someone's userpage'. I was adding notice of the IFD to the image's caption <b>as I am required to do by <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a></b> when nominating an image: '(If the image is in use, also add {{ifdc|{{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}}_{{subst:CURRENTDAY}}}} or {{ifdc|Image name.ext}} <strong>to the caption</strong>))'. However I wasn't aware that 'unencyclopedic' doesn't apply to userpages (I also missed the mainspace article in that image's list), my mistake. <a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynical_3d57.html" title="User:Cynical">Cynical</a> 14:28, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hear that, Sjakkalle.

<dd>For the record, <b>I did not remove any images from SqueakBox's userpage'</b>.

<p>Evilphoenix briefly returned from his Wikibreak to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FCyde&amp;diff=50140395&amp;oldid=50136434" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FCyde&amp;diff=50140395&amp;oldid=50136434" rel="nofollow">cross out</a> his statement of the dispute because he had not been intending to file this RFC yet, and Lulu went ahead with it anyway without his permission:</p>

<p>Is anyone else disturbed by Lulu's behavior in this matter? This is an RfC, a request for comment from the <i>community</i> (not just Lulu). It was originally written by Evilphoenix, yet Lulu is taking advantage of the fact that Evilphoenix is away on vacation and attempting to take total ownership of the RfC by reverting any edits Evilphoenix makes to properly reflect the fact that he, the original author of the RfC, did not want to go through with it at this time.</p>
<p>Lulu has also been making some other questionable edits to the RfC, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Cyde&amp;diff=50160138&amp;oldid=50159745" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Cyde&amp;diff=50160138&amp;oldid=50159745" rel="nofollow">blanking another user's comment</a> (rather than simply moving it to the appropriate section).</p>
<p>I am obviously not going to be taking admin actions against Lulu at this time because I am (obviously) involved in a dispute with him, so I am following the traditional route and bringing it up here on ANI for comment.

<p><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">User:Cyde</a> is subject of a user conduct RfC. I am one of several certifiers of this RfC (and admittedly, its most vocal proponent). Evilphoenix was one of several authors of a draft of the "Statement of Dispute" for the RfC before it was filed. Other co-authors of the RfC statement of dispute include myself, other certifiers, and outside participants on the RfC. Evilphoenix has not, at this time, joined as certifier of the RfC, nor has anyone claimed or implied he has (he may or may not choose to do so when his wikibreak is over). Indeed, Cyde is correct in stating that Evilphoenix believed (and may still believe, I do not know), that an RfC is not the best means to resolve the underlying problem (at least at the time Evilphoenix went on Wikibreak).</p>
<p>As subject of the RfC, it is inappropriate for Cyde to modify the statement of dispute to better fit his wishes about what the subject of the RfC <i>should</i> be: when he did so, I reverted it. Cyde, of course, is more than welcome (as he has done), to state a response or make an additional statement within the RfC.</p>
<p>Btw. The claim that I "blanked" a user statement is wholly fabricated. I did, however, move Evilphoenix's non-certifying statement below the "statement of dispute" section (I may have done so as a cut-then-paste, in two edits, but within a minute or two of each other). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 21:56, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I find it disturbing (and I'm not even an admin (so why am I posting on the admin noticeboard?).) From the initial history of the RfA, it looks like you and Evilphoenix were discussing the issue harmoniously before he went on vacation. Then, Lulu decided to take a draft and make it go live, without Evilphoenix's desires (and indeed, against his wishes). I don't think it's fair at all to get Evilphoenix involved while he's on vacation -- if it were me, I'd be pretty upset if someone got me involved in Wikidrama while I was on <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glacier_National_Park_%28United_States%29_5193.html" title="Glacier National Park (United States)">vacation</a> away from a computer. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu's user page</a> states, "This editor suffers fools poorly, and just is not able to assume good faith when it is self-evidently absent." Well, under that definition, anyone could be a "fool" if he/she disagrees with Lulu's assessment. That's not a good attitude for this project. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_Esperanza_be6e.html" title="User:Elkman/Esperanza"><font color="green">E</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">lkman</a> - <sup><a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(talk)</a></sup> 20:57, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>HEY, you don't have to be an admin to post here, I'm not an admin... despite trying (twice) and I still post here on occasion, though hopefully if nothing else an admin will take notice and close the RFC early. Having his userpage usurped while he's on vacation no less makes us obligated to at least do that for Evilphoenix if nobody else.

<li>Cyde and I had a strong disagreement over his alteration of the Harvard style referencing in the article <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850.html" title="Retreat of glaciers since 1850">Retreat of glaciers since 1850</a>, an article that was featured and on the main page at the time that Cyde determined it was important to change the Harvard referencing (that had been discussed exhaustively on the article discussion page by the major contributors to the article). I reverted his changes and then he reverted me...the links are on the Rfc. I was not happy about this at all, especially with his admonishments that I was acting as if I owned the article and his belief that that all other reference styles had been deprecated (which was false). Evilphoenix contacted me and asked to post diffs about the incident on the rfc, and then Evilphoenix decided not to participate, and even later claimed that he was not happy about Lulu moving the Rfc from is userspace to a live version, without consent. Regardless, the information originally posted by Evilphoenix and myself were incorporated into the live Rfc version, which I and three others were in general agreement with, though only a total of 3 persons signed on officially. I see nothing wrong with what Lulu did and I am surprised that Cyde is trying to play this off and reframe it as some gross misconduct issue on Lulu's part. No one has been grossly in misconduct..all myself and Lulu want is a small fraction of patience when altering citation styles, and a recognition that even Wikipedia accepts various different styles for Featured level articles. This has been well detailed on the Rfc.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 01:47, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'd normally discuss a request for unblock on the blocking admin's page, but since thas falls under the auspice of "community patience exhausted" I'm posting it here. I've corresponded with this user regarding their request for me to look at the application of an idefinate block. I gave the conditions in which I'd support having this block lifted. I have permission from Rgulerdem to reprint this portion of an e-mail where he agrees to them all:</p>

<li>I would agree to letting him back in if he abides by those terms, but only on the condition that the first violation he commits he's back on his indef block without a warning. He should have been warned enough to know what not to do. I will not reprotect his user talk unless he, again, starts trolling or being incivil - at which point my opinion on this chance for him will go down the drain and I will reject this. <a href="../../../n/s/l/User%7ENSLE_4a42.html" title="User:NSLE">NSL</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">E</font></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../n/s/l/User_talk%7ENSLE_f7ec.html" title="User talk:NSLE">T</a>+<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NSLE_ad4c.html" title="Special:Contributions/NSLE">C</a>)</sub> at 01:39 <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coordinated_Universal_Time_e510.html" title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</a> <small>(<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_26.html" title="April 26">04-26</a>)</small></li>

<ul>
<li>I support unblocking Rgulerdem under the conditions quoted by brenneman above. However, I think he shuold first serve out a 30 day block, counting from when he was blocked indefinitely. When he comes back, I think a "zero warning" policy is just a little too strict. I would support something that gives a little room for human error and/or reasonable differences in interpretation as to what constitutes a violation. I think this is very important. While I agree he has done blockable things in the past, I don't believe some of his more recent comments which were said to be a violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> were truly policy violations. They may have been arugmentative and unwise perhaps, but most users would not have been blocked for them IMO. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 02:19, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What's the normal process with regards to appearing impartial? That is to say, we'd like to avoid any Admin A: "That was out of line, blocked", Admin B: "Not really, unblocked" back and forth.

<li>I agree with Tony - if he abides by his words, there's no need for a longer block.

<li>Statement by Outside Party - Netpari I'm glad that everyone has decided to unblock Rgulerdem. If he agrees to all the demands placed by the admins, there is no reason for him to stay blocked for 30 days. His articles, especially on the subject of interfaith dialogue, are much needed. In order for Wikipedia to continue growing, it's contributors should be given a chance to redeem themselves when they err. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalmaakbar_3655.html" title="User:Salmaakbar">Netpari</a> 04:30, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I do still agree to mentor Rgulerdem. If the community supports it, I do like the idea of my being "allowed to smack down as [I] see fit" (within policy limits of course). If I am agressive at working with him on any small mistakes that he may make, then hopefully others in the community will not experience any problem. I still like the idea of serving out a 30 day block to demonstrate that we are really serious about the need for good behaviour - but I'm not stuck on that idea. If the consensus is to unblock sooner, that is fine with me. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 15:34, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Over the last few days, various IPs and new users, whom I strongly suspect are the same person, have made highly questionable edits including repeated section blanking in the article <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palladium_Books_408e.html" title="Palladium Books">Palladium Books</a>. All of these edits concern that particular company's current financial difficulties (which the company itself has openly admitted exist). There has been no discussion on the talk page despite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.192.10.247&amp;oldid=50155784" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.192.10.247&amp;oldid=50155784" rel="nofollow">a request for such</a> (sorry that isn't a proper diff, but it is the only edit to that talk page at this time), and in no case was an edit summary used.</p>
<p>In addition, one of the new users in question, User:NMI, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:PurplePlatypus&amp;diff=50187800&amp;oldid=50043853" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:PurplePlatypus&amp;diff=50187800&amp;oldid=50043853" rel="nofollow">blanked my user page</a>, a clear-cut act of vandalism that I assume was in retaliation for my restoring the section twice and/or leaving the above message. I will note that at this writing, the vandalism of my user page and one of the section blankings are this user's ONLY edits to Wikipedia under that name.</p>
<p>I request the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A check to determine whether any two or more of the following are the same person:
<ul>
<li>User:NMI</li>
<li>User:24.192.10.247 (who the above-linked talk page belongs to, and who has no edits that do not consist of removing information about Palladium's financial troubles)</li>
<li>User:69.213.95.246 (has only two edits, both to <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palladium_Books_408e.html" title="Palladium Books">Palladium Books</a>, one of them another blanking of the relevant section)</li>
<li>User:Godcheese (Another user with only two edits, both to this article. These are also related to the same financial difficulties; in one case this user put the heading "Palladium needs its fans more than ever" at the very top of the page, in violation of more Wikipedia policies and guidelines than I care to name at the moment; the only other edit was to move this to a more reasonable spot in the article.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For someone to keep an eye on this person or these individuals (and anything that might emerge from their sock drawers) and block them if this sort of behaviour continues.</li>
<li>If the problems continue over a long period or get worse, semi-protection may be warranted. However, I doubt the page sees enough traffic for that to prove necessary.</li>

I haven't had the stomach to really NPOV the entire article, especially since I don't particulary know much about this Alex Jones, or these types of theories and beliefs in general. However I do know that almost the entire article depends upon highly dubious sources and original research.

<dd>Moshe...that is one of many poor sourced articles, all spin offs of the articles that relate to the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> article...the only thing notable about Alex Jones is he is one of the biggest loudmouths of misinformation regarding conspiracy theories of the events on 9/11/2001. A lot of linked articles from Alex Jones were POV forks as a concensus of editors in the main articles of the events of 9/11 refused to allow much detail to be there, so POV fork articles were created...many, many of which went through Afd, some were kept and some were deleted...no doubt the article is probably watched over by adherents to his "cause".--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 07:52, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IRC log posting is banned, as far as the IRC channels care (that is, I am <b>very</b> likely to permanently ban any users doing such things from all Wikimedia-related channels, forever). As for Wikimedia wikis, ignoring the legal consequences w.r.t. invasion of privacy (which, AIUI, aren't as stringent in the US as almost everywhere else), I have considered their posting banned by consensus for a very long time. Certainly, I don't think that the page in question should ever be undeleted (and invite someone who isn't Doc to make sure that it stays deleted; given that I'm first responder, however, I think I should leave that to someone else).</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Don't undo another admin's actions until you've made a good-faith effort to contact the admin in question.</b> We have <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" title="Special:Log">Special:Log</a> for a reason—it lets you identify the admin involved, and it may shed light on his reasoning.</li>
<li>If discussion with the admin fails to clear things up, or the admin is unavailable and the matter is urgent – note that very few situations clear the latter bar – <b>Seek comment on AN/I on your proposed course of action.</b></li>

<p>After their favourite propaganda weapon, <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">User:Molobo</a>, was blocked for a month on account of incessant revert-warring and multiple violations of 3RR, his chief defenders and mentors - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">User:Piotrus</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">User:Balcer</a> - took to revert warring themselves and broke 3RR on several occasions. <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">User:Piotrus</a> was reported by <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumber_6_0a61.html" title="User:Number 6">User:Number 6</a> and got blocked for three hours, as it was his first violation. After <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">User:Balcer</a> made five reverts in three hours on <a href="../../../n/i/c/Talk%7ENicolaus_Copernicus_e9d5.html" title="Talk:Nicolaus Copernicus">Talk:Nicolaus Copernicus</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2F3RR&amp;diff=50224808&amp;oldid=50215290" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2F3RR&amp;diff=50224808&amp;oldid=50215290" rel="nofollow">I reported him</a> on <a href="../../../a/n/3/WP%7EAN3_1491.html" title="WP:AN3">WP:AN3</a> too. Anon's comments which he reverted were rather harmless and should have stayed on the talk page. It is not vandalism to be exempt from 3RR.</p>
<p>While there was no denial that 3RR was broken, I was subjected to a stream of insults. Piotrus (an admin, by the way) called my notice a "libel" and a "personal attack", motivated by the desire to "smear" Balcer's name and calling other admins to issue a stern "warning" to myself. In fact, Molobo's mentors turned <a href="../../../a/n/3/WP%7EAN3_1491.html" title="WP:AN3">WP:AN3</a> into an offensive discussion of my presumed motivations, which they always do when their aim is to downplay the importance of 3RR and to encourage revert-warring on Poland-related subjects. I would like to know why Balcer's behaviour was ignored by admins and nobody even cared to discuss the issue at hand.</p>
<p>Back in December, when I reverted a disruptive anonymous sock of <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte">User:Bonaparte</a>, now permabanned, I was blocked for 24 h - although I had never broken 3RR before and voicefully pointed out that my opponent was a sock - and nobody ever apologised for that. Why should <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">User:Balcer</a> be exempt from responsibility for a much graver offense? --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">-трёп-</a></sup> 08:32, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The full text of the discussion is <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:Balcer" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR#User:Balcer</a>. Note that none of the editors besides Ghirlandajo saw anything wrong with my actions. Also note the personal attack against me with which Ghirlandajo justifies his posting ("The guy is so much given to revert warring ... "etc). Anyway, the comments I reverted were obviously trollish. Another administrator, <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">User:Kusma</a>, agreed with me and reverted the anon twice (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANicolaus_Copernicus&amp;diff=50078141&amp;oldid=50077628" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANicolaus_Copernicus&amp;diff=50078141&amp;oldid=50077628" rel="nofollow">example</a>). Even the anon himself, who attempted to reinsert the comment 6 times, eventually agreed with me that the comments were inappropriate and stopped posting them (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABalcer&amp;diff=50106650&amp;oldid=50101516" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABalcer&amp;diff=50106650&amp;oldid=50101516" rel="nofollow">diff)</a>.</dd>
<dd>As for the rest of Ghirlandajo's allegations, I will not even bother to answer them in detail. My differences with Molobo were plentiful, and I always deplored the style of his edits and frequently asked him to compromise, instead of fighting revert wars to insert his POV. Since when is it Ghirlandajo's job to determine which user is which user's tool on Wikipedia?</dd>
<dd>Anyway, in my opinion Ghirlandajo's latest campaign against me is a reaction by him to the recent discussions on <a href="../../../r/u/s/Talk%7ERussophobia_b9bb.html" title="Talk:Russophobia">Talk:Russophobia</a> and his rather embarassing behaviour there. I think it is essential for users interested in the matter to check out that page. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 12:24, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The user, who has identified themselves as the PR person for Adams' personal company, keeps on removing information that I have added to the article about the company's website offering e-mailed tarot card and "love" readings for credit card payments. I have worded this a couple different ways,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephanie_Adams&amp;diff=50085378&amp;oldid=50085206" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephanie_Adams&amp;diff=50085378&amp;oldid=50085206" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephanie_Adams&amp;diff=50171180&amp;oldid=50153460" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephanie_Adams&amp;diff=50171180&amp;oldid=50153460" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and the user has attempted to attack my claims as somehow "false," apparently not liking the word "solicit" despite its clear meaning in a commercial context.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GODDESSY&amp;oldid=50170858" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GODDESSY&amp;oldid=50170858" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> I think selling e-mailed tarot readings is a clearly relevant feature of the website, and I can only interpret the user's removals as a POV attempt to keep the site's commercial activities from being so nakedly described. I'd appreciate another set of eyes to review this issue (and take a look at the edit history of the user's talk page, as they keep on deleting old messages I have left), as I'd rather not create the appearance that I have used my admin powers to enforce my side in an edit dispute.

User 68.161.222.151 User Goddessy</p>
<p>Same person, I am new to this part of it all, but they are clearly the same person making comments one right after another and doing very bad slip ups.</p>
<p>See here:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=68.161.222.151" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=68.161.222.151" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=68.161.222.151</a></p>

<p><br />
All comments within seconds of each other and you'll notice that quite often, User 68.161.222.151 signs her comments with GODDESSY</p>
<p>I don't know if this is just user 68.161.222.151 accidentaly forgetting to sign in, but it is starting to look like it is just to circumvent the 3RR rule.</p>
<p>Both 68.161.222.151 and GODDESSY had been banned from Wikki as a troll, yet reinstated by a different moderator. I believe ALOT of the "moderator and admin fighting" are due to personal feelings of GODDESSY ( who is in reality Stephanie Adams )</p>
<p>Let's not forget the Wikipedia rules.</p>
<p>She left a message on Jim Wale's Talk Page</p>
<p>Seen here:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=GODDESSY" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=GODDESSY" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=GODDESSY</a></p>
<p><br />
This person wants you to believe that they have spoken to Jim Wales personally on the telephone, and that he has commented the above inquiry that she left on his Talk Page, yet no signature from Jim Wales is present, therefore looking at the history on Jim Wale's Talk Page it is very easy to see that this person made the comments by themselves to make it LOOK like Jim Wales had commented on her Inquiry</p>

She's already been blocked several times and banned once and the ban was lifted I would believe only because of personal feelings towards her.</p>

<dd>Surprised that someone at least figured that inserting a grand total of two pertinent links is not spam. Other than that, I'm glad to find that Wikicabalia is working so well (kudos to Feldspar to monitor all my edits so efficiently), but, fact is, that WP has links to Wikitruth in the name space as well and apparently there, there is no "legal concern" about that. If you want to be consistent with the censorship policies, you will have to delete my link <a href="../../../m/a/d/User_talk%7EMademoiselle_Sabina_ec9b.html#Your_native_tongue" title="User talk:Mademoiselle Sabina">here</a>, too. <a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossa_35fa.html" title="User:Fossa">Fossa</a> 09:05, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>kudos to Feldspar to monitor all my edits so efficiently</i> I don't really see there's any need for sarcasm. I had never heard of Wikitruth, at least by that name, so it was only because you openly <i>volunteered</i> the information that you were using the resources of Wikipedia to do an end-run around the acting policies of Wikipedia that I knew something was up. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 12:39, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since someone diligently removed my link to Wikitruth on M. Sabina's talk page too, note that by clicking through to my German user page you can still reach Wikitruth from Wikipedia by n number of clicks. (Or you just type in "wikitruth" on the English Wikipedia and you will get several direct links in the name space), and you will find even more roundabouts to W-Truth.

<p>User 68.161.222.151 User Goddessy</p>
<p>Same person, I am new to this part of it all, but they are clearly the same person making comments one right after another and doing very bad slip ups.</p>
<p>See here:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=68.161.222.151" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=68.161.222.151" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=68.161.222.151</a></p>

<p><br />
All comments within seconds of each other and you'll notice that quite often, User 68.161.222.151 signs her comments with GODDESSY</p>
<p>I don't know if this is just user 68.161.222.151 accidentaly forgetting to sign in, but it is starting to look like it is just to circumvent the 3RR rule.</p>
<p>Both 68.161.222.151 and GODDESSY had been banned from Wikki as a troll, yet reinstated by a different moderator. I believe ALOT of the "moderator and admin fighting" are due to personal feelings of GODDESSY ( who is in reality Stephanie Adams )</p>
<p>Let's not forget the Wikipedia rules.</p>
<p>She left a message on Jim Wale's Talk Page</p>
<p>Seen here:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=GODDESSY" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=GODDESSY" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=GODDESSY</a></p>
<p><br />
This person wants you to believe that they have spoken to Jim Wales personally on the telephone, and that he has commented the above inquiry that she left on his Talk Page, yet no signature from Jim Wales is present, therefore looking at the history on Jim Wale's Talk Page it is very easy to see that this person made the comments by themselves to make it LOOK like Jim Wales had commented on her Inquiry</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
I left a comment under the Let's Clarify Something here title</p>
<p><br />
She then came in and edited it and used all caps to show what she was editing.</p>
<p>This person really, I mean, SHE might be notable, but her company is NOT.</p>
<p><br />
She's already been blocked several times and banned once and the ban was lifted I would believe only because of personal feelings towards her.</p>
<p>Keep reading all the comments down the page.</p>
<p>Wikkipedia is about what is verifiable and not what the person the articles is about WANTS it to say.</p>

<p>I didn't want to post here but now I feel there is no other option as I have been threatened with a block for adding verifiable information to two articles. I have been trying to update the articles <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr._4834.html" title="Sammy Davis, Jr.">Sammy Davis, Jr.</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvera_Sanchez_3316.html" title="Elvera Sanchez">Elvera Sanchez</a> with information from a 2003 biography that showed that Sanchez who was in fact a New Yorker of Cuban descent, not a Puerto Rican as Davis had claimed in his lifetime. I was blocked for 3 hours by User:Marine 69-71 aka Tony the Marine after I reverted the edits of another Puerto Rican editor <a href="../../../x/l/r/User%7EXLR8TION_9129.html" title="User:XLR8TION">User:XLR8TION</a> on <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvera_Sanchez_3316.html" title="Elvera Sanchez">Elvera Sanchez</a> who had posted a message on Tony's page:</p>
<p>"<i>Tony some nutcase is saying that Elvera Sanchez (Sammy Davis Jr's mother ) is Cuban. He cant show any proof from the family. He claims a new book on Sammy says she was Cuban. This is hearsay as the book is not authorized by Sammy's estate. Can you put this loco out of commission and revert the article back to it's original state?</i>"</p>
<p>I then tried to be more neutral by removing the Cuban stub from Elvera Sanchez (which is appropriate as she wasn't actually Cuban) but was then threatened with a block for "continuous vandalism" by Tony the Marine and my edits were reverted by <a href="../../../x/l/r/User%7EXLR8TION_9129.html" title="User:XLR8TION">User:XLR8TION</a>.

<ul>
<li>I have tried to reason with User:Arniep in regard to his continous reverts in the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Davis_Jr._f93d.html" title="Sammy Davis Jr.">Sammy Davis Jr.</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvera_Sanchez_3316.html" title="Elvera Sanchez">Elvera Sanchez</a> articles, see:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Arniep#Puerto_Rican_Descent" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Arniep#Puerto_Rican_Descent" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. Arniep insists on posting his version and his version only. Arniep cites as proof the following transcript from an unathoritized bio, a book written without the permission of the Davis Estate by Wil Haygood. The transcript can be found here:<a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780375403545&amp;view=excerpt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780375403545&amp;view=excerpt" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. For some unknown reason Arniep refuses to accept the overwhelming fact that every reference to Sammy Davis Jr., and his mother point to the fact that Elvera Sanchez was of <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rican_ff02.html" title="Puerto Rican">Puerto Rican</a> descent and "not" Cuban. Nor Arniep or the author of the book cite official documnets to back up these claims.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only three sites of the many which state that Davis' mother was Puerto Rican: <a href="http://www.us.imdb.com/name/nm0204572/bio" class="external text" title="http://www.us.imdb.com/name/nm0204572/bio" rel="nofollow">Bio of Elvira Sanchez in IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/sammy-davis-jr/" class="external text" title="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/sammy-davis-jr/" rel="nofollow">Sammy Davis Jr.</a> and <a href="http://www.sammydavisjunior.com/reader.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sammydavisjunior.com/reader.htm" rel="nofollow">Tribute to Sammy Davis Jr.</a>. In every other biography of Sammy Davis Jr., it is stated that his ancesters were Afro-American and Puerto Rican. In his own autobiography <b>"Sammy : The Autobiography of Sammy Davis, Jr. by Sammy Davis, Burt Boyar, Jane Boyar"</b>, Sammy Davis claims that his mother was Puerto Rican. How could we doubt his own words?</p>
<p>Another thing, tghe author claims that Davis denied his "Cuban" ancestry because of the "Anti-Castro" sentiment. This does not make any sense since it would be almost impossible to keep his whole family and his friends quiet for so many years. If that was the case then way didn't <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desi_Arnaz_15b5.html" title="Desi Arnaz">Desi Arnaz</a> of "I Love Lucy" fame, <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cesar_Romero_b004.html" title="Cesar Romero">Cesar Romero</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celia_Cruz_8e7a.html" title="Celia Cruz">Celia Cruz</a> do the same?</p>
<p>I have tried to reach a "middle ground" with User Arniep by offering these new versions: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvera_Sanchez&amp;oldid=49832723" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvera_Sanchez&amp;oldid=49832723" rel="nofollow">Elvera Sanchez</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr.&amp;oldid=49831912#Biography" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr.&amp;oldid=49831912#Biography" rel="nofollow">Sammy Davis Jr.</a> as a solution but, Arniep refuses to cooperate and instead of having an open dialogue about the issue, continues to revert.</p>
<p>I have no personal interest in either article. My main concern is that commonly accepted facts and not "hearsay" be posted in Wikipedia articles. To quote Sammy Davis himself: <b>"I'm colored, Jewish and Puerto Rican. When I move into a neighborhood, I wipe it out!"</b> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarine_69-71_4b09.html" title="User:Marine 69-71">Tony the Marine</a> 01:31, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>(P.S. A note to Arniep, Your temp block was due to the violation of the 3 revert rule. Nothing personal.)</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> has expressed a desire for this to be brought up on this page, so I will oblige. The issue is this: there is a notable point of view that 7 World Trade center was demolished by the use of explosives. <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> states that, on pages with multiple points of view, external links should exist that represent each point of view. In accordance with that policy, I linked the page to <a href="http://wtc7.net" class="external text" title="http://wtc7.net" rel="nofollow">wtc7.net</a> and included a Popular Mechanics article that gave the opposing POV.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> reverted the article numerous times, simply calling wtc7.net "junk" and "nonsense". Finally, a user pointed out that wtc7.net offers a DVD for sale and that websites whose primary purpose is to sell merchandise are not generally acceptable as external links.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> is now continuing to revert any mention of wtc7.net, calling it "advertising" (and even implying that I am somehow involved with the site, saying things like "sorry if this cuts into your pockets") It is crystal clear to me that wtc7.net is a political site that happens to sell a DVD, and not a site that exists to sell merchandise. There is nothing in <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> that prohibits it, and everything that encourages it.</p>
<p>Obviously, we're having trouble resolving this edit war. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> has taken a tone indicating that he and he alone will determine the content of the article, and I will honestly say that I am concerned he intends to use his administrator powers to block those who disagree with him, as I have seen him make similar blocks in the past, pouncing on those who do not share his POV at their first arguable infraction (for example, <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a>. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 09:24, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How many hundreds of thousands of people have to hold a point of view for it to be considered "notable"? I concede that the idea that 7 WTC was demolished by explosives is a minority view, but it is certainly far, far more notable than the subjects of thousands of Wikipedia articles. Searching for "7 world trade center" + explosives returns 23,300 Ghits, and that's a fairly restrictive search that certainly doesn't catch them all. I still don't feel I've received a satisfactory answer to why the site shouldn't be linked to both <a href="../../../7/_/w/7_World_Trade_Center_db3e.html" title="7 World Trade Center">7 World Trade Center</a> and <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> - it is a POV relevant to both of them, and <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> seems to suggest that that means it should be there. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 18:11, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the suggestions, but don't you think wtc7.net is more specific to 7 World Trade Center than the byu article (which prominently discusses the collapse of the Twin Towers)? Also, we've found in talk that using wtc7.net as a source is probably even more problematic than presenting it as an external link. One question I'd like to settle here is this: does the presence of a single DVD on a website qualify it as "spam"? Or does a site's primary purpose have to be to sell merchandise in order to disqualify it as an external link? --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 18:11, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Case in point...I haven't blocked Hyperbole, nor have I threatened to do so. The link Hyperbole wishes to have is <a href="http://www.wtc7.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.wtc7.net/" rel="nofollow">this one</a> which clearly has the banner that links to a DVD that is for sale. This violates <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>.

<li>It's fairly hard to find serious conspiracy theorists who aren't also vanity press authors or videographers or some such. The example here isn't unusual, nor is the DVD the sole focus of the site. Many conspiracy theorist websites would have to get blocked from being referenced if we make "having something for sale" an exclusion from being a reference link in articles.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>We could link to <a href="http://www.wtc7.net/contents.html" class="external free" title="http://www.wtc7.net/contents.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wtc7.net/contents.html</a> instead, which states their position without including the DVD ads, if that's the problem point. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 00:50, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As the discussion page clearly shows, regardless of the obvious violation of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>, the site is based on original research that is not collaborated by any major recognized impartial news media, university, trade journal or scientific journal. Regardless, the same effect exists...the site is self promoting and certainly does exist to profit, not only from sales to their DVD but also at the expense of all those that died that day. Pretty sick. Furthermore, the inclusion of the site violates the undue weight clause of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPOV#Undue_weight" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPOV#Undue_weight" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> and I quote from there "If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) regardless of whether it's true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not. In other words, views held only by a tiny minority of people should not be represented as though they are significant minority views, and perhaps should not be represented at all. In particular, to elaborate on the last comment above, if you are able to prove something that nobody currently believes, Wikipedia is not the place to premiere such a proof. Once a proof has been presented and discussed elsewhere, however, it may be referenced." Complete non scientists as the website has provide nothing but their opinions, nothing more. There are other reasons why we don't violate policies to present nonsense.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 01:08, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Personally, I would say it is a notable point of view. I watched a 2 hour academic lecture on the issue via google and the conclusion was that the only scientifically possible explaination was that building # 7 was demolished via explosives, and that even the official report on the building collapse admitted their best explanation of the collapse was flawed. I never considered myself a consipracy theorist prior to watching the lecture, now I certainly have questions. This lecture made the front page of <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.html" title="Fark">Fark</a> and the resulting discussion had nearly 1000 comments from what I recall. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 01:42, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>FWIW Kimchi.sg is not an admin, so I guess it's arguable which action was out of process, the early closure or the rejection of that --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 07:01, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, He should have never closed it in the first place. I'm fine with no action being taken. I've already warned JRM against reopening closed AfD's and advised her to seek admin assistance in the future.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:12, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally I think the AfD should have been left open for longer than it was before first closure (and closure should have been by an admin in this case). As it has now been left open for longer and consensus is clear, I'm happy for another admin to close it now, or just let it run its course (no harm either way). Several users on IRC did say it should go to AfD rather than simply removing the speedy tag, which is why I did that after asking for advice. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 08:16, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My whole contention of speedy was that it was a content dispute and would obviously be kept in an AfD. That said AfD was the right place for it an even if the 5 days are allowed to elapse the result is the same and there is no harm in an AfD tag on the article for 4 more days.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:12, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is part of a pattern of banned user Skyring, banned user Ted Wilkes, and many, many, many anonymous IPs posting messages telling everyone which Wikipedia editor they think is Jim Duffy in real life. (In case you're not aware, Mr or Ms 72.234.22.85, editors can be banned from Wikipedia for revealing personal information about Wikipedians.) I couldn't care less if another editor is really Jim Duffy or the Duchess of Cornwall; nor have I any particular interest in the article. In fact, the only reason it's on my watchlist is because of the trolling and harassment that has been going on. I'm actually getting a bit bored at this stage, constantly being told WHO HE IS. I even received an e-mail about it. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 16:26, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'd like to know what exactly I'm supposed to do then, to deal with this kind of abusiveness. It sort of puts me in the position of "Great, theres no consequences for abusive people, and nothing to be done about it, and no real authority to contact." It reduces the situation to anarchy, and it offers no solutions or consequences for blatant abusiveness.</p>
<p>Under such conditions, I fail to see how wikipedia can operate, and it makes me think i am probably wasting my time here in the first place. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPrometheuspan_ArbcomCase_283b.html" title="User talk:Prometheuspan/ArbcomCase">User talk:Prometheuspan/ArbcomCase</a></p>

<p>&lt;spewn out elsewhere&gt; In any case, I am slowly coming to the realization that Wikipedia is a mostly headless beneficient dictatorship combined with a loose level of consensus process resulting actually in pack psychology driven anarchy, and, I will probably quit participating, because i don't see that theres any sane way to deal with abusiveness, and the policies in place that do deal with the issues require exorbitant amounts of time and energy, which means that only the very worst problems are ever resolved, and editors who are clearly gaming the system and manipulating and lying can continue to do so as long as they are clever enough not to become a really big pain to some administrator. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 19:59, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Prometheuspan, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Power_structure" class="extiw" title="m:Power_structure">m:Power structure</a> is a good read about how Wikipedia really works. This is a weird place, but there are all kinds of ways to get things done in it. From your comments here and at the arbitration page (you use the word "illegal" to refer to editorial behavior - I find that very unnatural), it appears that you think of Wikipedia according to a legalistic model, and are disappointed with the "legal system" you find. I think that those who are happiest and most productive here don't use that kind of model at all, but something different. Just... food for thought. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 22:01, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 22:35, 28 April 2006 (UTC) Thanks bacchus, that was interesting and informative. I don't really care what the legal model is, I am certain that merecats behavior is abusive, manipulative, and will require some sort of authoritative intervention to stop. You are right, thanks for pointing it out. Part of my stress here is that the system isn't conforming to my expectations, and thats an important thing for me to keep in mind. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 22:35, 28 April 2006 (UTC) You're right, Prometheuspan - I went through much the same epiphany (a lot of people do) and came out the other side, figuring, ok, if that's how it is, then I'll deal with it on that basis also. No point fighting it, and it would be a shame for a good editor to walk away. The more editors, the less of a headless dictatorship also. I find this perspective helps me - hope it helps you too.

<p><a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 22:35, 28 April 2006 (UTC) It seems the "headless dictator" concept was confusing here to you. The more people particpate, the more distant the final authority becomes and the less accessible the final authority becomes. Jimbo isn't headless, but as a dictator, he can't possibly be in the loop or in the know of whats really going on. This sets up a pyramid structure, or chain of command where authority of the sort that does anything useful is swallowed into the black hole of the sheer number of people that are involved. I am not an admin, and never want to be, probably best i recuse myself from actually writing articles even, I'm a biased Formal logic argument machine, I can identify neutrality, but getting it to come off of my lips or from my fingertips is nearly impossible. The important question here is really simple down to a single point. Can a single person, cleverly gaming the system, be allowed to lie, delete entire pages of comments without justification, make veiled ad hominem attacks, and straw man arguments, all just to keep an article from being written? Is that right? Is it just? Or, are there realistic means to deal with this sort of abusive behavior? The ONLY reason why merecat quit deleting pages without cause is because i went ballistic, and even then one of his fellow cronies had to tell him to wise up. There are at least three pages of ad hominem and straw man abuse heaped against poor Nescio over there, Nescio should never have had to endure that. This shouldn't be combat. A realistic and factual complaint regarding abusive behavior should be dealt with in a realistic and timely fashion. If that isn't possible here, then I do need to find someplace else to give my energy to. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 22:35, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The above seems to me to be wrong in a number of ways. Clerk's powers are to be strictly limited, and the section in question is clear editorialising, not summarising. Reversions without discussion are to be avoided, and I'll cop my licks for the second revert of mine. However, use of blocking to gain advantage in content disputes are off the map, right? I'll note to that I received no warnings and that both of these users have some slight history with me. I don't accept that "clerks" have been given the level of authority that they appear to think that they have, and <i>even if</i> they have than it was not applied properly here. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 07:16, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Geez...why not ask Tony before you made the change...if you thought he was biased in the case, can you show a link in which you stated so before you altered the headings and then reverted back over him? Why not see if you can become a clerk too. It's hard to see changing a subheading title as a content dispute but not so hard to see it as edit warring somewhat. The block by Tony was a bit reactionary...kind of looks like something I might do. Phil blocked you for a longer stint and I am surprised others unblocked you.

<dd>I've reproduced the section in question. It's not a question of "bias" it's that this isn't even remotely within the auspice of the clerk's position. This is an <i>opinon</i> that's being given extra weight by having the heading "Clerk Notes." If the clerk's are now going to be able to <i><b>officially</b></i> recomend rejection of cases, I'm sure that the community would like to have a say in that.<br />

<p>The Arbitration Committee will discuss this matter. The blocking has already been briefly discussed. We do have <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration</a> on our watch lists and have some awareness of the personal interactions involved. Personally, I am not happy with the "Clerk's comments" section, but would rather Aaron had waited and let us deal with it. But perhaps it would not have come into focus so sharply had this incident not occurred. The request of Rgulerdem has been difficult to decide on for me, so perhaps Tony's note was helpful. Bottom line, it is not action which is required, but consideration of the questions raised, by Rgulerdem, by Tony, and by Aaron. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 08:01, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Examine my comments above, as a clerk. I strictly examine the question of the provenance of the block (it was community-imposed, not an arbitration remedy) and the question of whether there was any substantive dispute that would be suitable for arbitration (I found no evidence of any).</p>
<p>Now examine this, which I wrote on my own behalf, as an editor, in response to a mentorship and unblocking proposal made on behalf of rgulerdem:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>This seems like a responsible proposal. I don't agree that he should serve out a block; if he's willing to abide by the conditions then there is no reason to keep him blocked.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I did not block until Aaron Brenneman began edit warring over the <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> page. The duration of the block was three hours and I believe it was a sensible thing to do in view of Aaron's impetuous actions and clear unwillingness to wait for a response; the RFAR page is bad enough without people going around changing one another's edits, much less those of clerks.</p>
<p>By coincidence, Phil Sandifer, another clerk with whom I was not in contact, also blocked Aaron Brenneman at exactly the same time and with the same purpose, but for twenty-four hours. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 09:06, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't believe that's a coincidence at all. Tony and Phil have been linked together in several discussions of the inappropriate expansion of clerking powers, and it would not be surprising at all to see them take the same stance toward someone who questions a specific instance of inappropriate action. Further, I have been on record, several places, and remain unswayed in the opinion that clerks should have no summary actions, must not be imposed, and must, in all cases, be people who have no history of involvement in a case. I also objected to clerks being volunteers accepted simply on the basis of ArbCom not being able to think of anything against them, in the dark. Finally, on what would be an unrelated matter but for what has just occurred, I've been warning for a while, Cassandra-like, that countenancing "community blocks" and unilateral blocks with a simple "I did it" on WP:AN is begging for a wheel war. The pedophilia wheel war could not have existed if we had not silently allowed non-ArbCom blocks to go and go and go. Not only should not this particular person have blocked Aaron, <i>ever</i> and <i>under any circumstances,</i> but neither should clerks or "community spokesmen" other than the community-approved board have been involved in blocking. Frankly, blocking of a personal <i>nemesis</i> is right at an RfAR offense by itself. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:42, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many editors (not just the trolls, either) were unhappy about the creation of clerks, and saw it as a case of rejected arbitrators thumbing their noses at other editors. All I can say is, cases like this do not help reduce that perception.

<dd>Tony's actions here were straight wrong. Clerks have the power to summarize <i>submitted</i> evidence, not to act as an official investigatory agents during a request. If Tony wants to investigate claims during that stage -- anybody can, of course -- let him do so under his own name. One supposes the arbitrators will have some vague familiarity with who "Tony Sidaway" is anyway. The blocks were just abusive. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 15:11, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me first state that Tony Sidaway and I have had several disagreements about his aggressive style. Having given full disclosure on that, let me add my total disapproval of his handling of this affair. He has no standing to do anything of this nature in arbcom cases, and his repeated edit warring in order to insert his personal opinion is entirely inappropriate, as was the block, since blocking someone you are in disagreement with is strongly frowned on <i><b>by the community</b></i>, whom Tony always claims to have full backing from. It's time to reconsider Tony's admin authority. But then, it's far past time to have done so. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:28, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oddly enough, the page you cite shows nothing of the sort. It shows six other admins imposing blocks, for a variety of reasons -- with two of those admins' blocks removed as policy violations, and a third user ending up de-adminned for misbehavior. Adding Crypto in, and the real numbers say that the majority of admins who imposed blocks on her do so in violation of policy. Some of us draw obvious inferences. And you knew perfectly well about the Crypto situation, you were actively involved in the discussion at deletion review where he acknowledged it.

<p>Those are red herrings, folks. Let's stay focused: clerks with expanding powers, Tony Sidaway blocking a user with whom he has had longstanding disagreements, Tony explicitly saying that the blocks were from "the community" when they were personal. Other issues should be addressed under a separate cover, and let's not argue by analogy. The clerking issue is bigger than one inappropriate action, but this inappropriate action is a good indication of the problems with clerking. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:16, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>um... the red boxed text Tony wrote strikes me as an accurate description of the state of affairs. I've seen talk about community blocks before; someone put on an indefinite block, it was reported on ANI, and no other admin chose to challenge/defend/modify it. That's shunning, in my view, and the community (those admins there at the time and those that became aware of it later) chose to let it stand. It still stands to my knowledge, no admin has reversed it.</dd>
<dd>The beef here in my view is whether what was accurately reported was an <i>official statement</i> or not. And that's a mighty fine grain of sand to tussle over. Aaron should have known better than to thrash around on it, and Tony and Phil should have known better than to block Aaron over changing section headers!!! I've pleaded with Aaron and Tony on their talk pages before to <i>stay away</i> from each other, and I did it again earlier in this incident. They knew better before and they know better this time. My advice is to drop the whole thing and never ever interact with each other again. If ArbComm wants to clarify what parameters official statements have, that would be some good come of this, instruction creep or not, but I can't see anything else good coming of it. I'd love to see this go no further. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar"><font color="blue">+</font></a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 23:55, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't argue that the lack of anyone else overturning a block is an indication of assent nor "the community." First, that salmon colored banner is dissuasive. Second, folks who aren't scared by pink border probably know the personalities involved and don't want to enter into a grand royale battle. Third, those who aren't afraid of a war of attrition with the personalities involved might still not wish to fight over this ground. In other words, the fact that no one was willing to join in the kind of battle necessary to have any hope of headway against "I am a clerk, and I speak for All" is not really a sign that the community agreed with the clerk. This is even assuming that the issue was actually read, the diffs clicked, and people aware of the situation. I agree, of course, that Tony and Aaron and Phil are in frequent conflict, but I <i>generally</i> see Aaron working on defining policy and then getting jumped by unilateralism from the other two. Perhaps I'm biased and jaundiced at this point, though. Whatever flaws I might have, I'm pretty consistent in being against unilateralism. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:39, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's hard to advise someone never to interact with a member of WP administration if they're active at these levels. In particular Tony and other clerks, who seem to be everywhere.</dd>
<dd>I think both sides should take a breather (mutual assured frustration and incivility), but the question of what and where Clerk's powers are needs to get answered. It may not be wrong to allow them to expand, but if they're going to expand then they need to be expanded, and any arguments about it hashed out, and whether there's unanimous agreement or not it needs to become a stated policy. Otherwise, like it or not, it <i>is</i> two admins without evident special powers having an edit conflict over something and one just blocking the other to end it.</dd>
<dd>The only thing that would incline me to object to giving those powers to Tony is that he blocked first and asked whether his power covered it later in the situation, and Aaron isn't exactly an unknown vandal whose good faith is in question.</dd>

<dd>Well, you might be a <i>known vandal</i>, but if it's any consolation, your good faith (or lack thereof) is <b>not</b> in doubt. ^_^ ... OK, more seriously, what I was trying to get at here is that at the time that Tony wrote what he wrote, it struck me as being a true statement of facts... the user had been blocked for quite a while, no one had unblocked, it was a community shunning. Since then, things have changed. Heck, YOU unblocked him after leading a discussion about it. But at the time, it was factual, at least in my view. I'm in the camp that doesn't think it ought to have been an official statement and would have liked to see it with an ordinary heading and not in pink. And I'm in the camp that thinks Tony and Phil overreacted a bit. But geez, Brenny, why didn't you ask someone else to change it for you?

<p>To focus on the immediate situation, edit warring on important process pages like this really isn't on, and Aaron's impetuous actions were disruptive and he was fully aware of what he was doing. That he was blocked simultaneously by not one but <i>two</i> clerks acting independently should tell him something about the inappropriateness of his behavior. That he has in the past engaged in sock puppetry and vandalism against me, which he avoided admitting for several days in the course of which he sought to evade responsibility by accusing David Gerard of serious misconduct, in no way limits my own scope of action with respect to his own misconduct, and he should be aware of that.</p>
<p>There is certainly a need for discussion of the role of clerks. There is no question of their having, or needing, special powers--they're just editors like anyone else and their role requires no powers other than the ability to edit. But what clerks should write, and where, is a matter for the arbitration committee to decide in consultation with the wider community. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 09:05, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For what it's worth, I thought that Tony's comment was wholly appropriate, demonstrating exactly how having extra pairs of eyes in the form of the Clerks benefits the Committee, and that Aaron's alter-someone-else's-comment-first-talk-later approach is wholly reprehensible; OTOH, although I can see the utility and sense in keeping sysops from straying into edit-warring, I think that Tony should not have blocked Aaron himself, as he was, indeed, involved, both in this individual case, but also in a more general wiki-encompassing disagreement with Aaron, as I'm sure we're all aware.</dd>

<li>The whole initial statement probably <i>could</i> have been re-phrases as a "summary" by saying something like <i>"two adminstrators have stated blah blah blah"</i> but then would have had to have been followed by <i>"however other adminstrators felt blah blah."</i> Barring that, if the clerk's are to be allowed broad interprative powers I'd like to hear it from ArbCom. This was tantamount to a declaration of <i>"Reject! So sayeth the clerks, so sayeth the flock."</i></li>
<li>Tony's implied that he's <i><b>allowed</b></i> to block in this manner as a clerk, which would require at lest an amendment to <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">blocking policy</a>, and the block as applied would require a <i><b>massive</b></i> overhaul to existing policy. (No waring, involved parties, etc.) Again, I'd want to hear from the ArbCom that this is what they've got in mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting blocked did piss me off something shocking, no word of a lie there. But for a couple of hours I could only edit my talk page? Big deal, I'll live. So while I'd dearly like the underlying issue to be addressed as openly and widely as possible, for me <i>personally</i> it's history already. (Although I'm still curious about my "tawdry" actions.)

They don't get to empower their <i>friends</i> without consent from the community. If they continue to act in this manner, they encourage every admin with disagreements to simply wheel war (as Tony has done and as Phil has done), as each admin has as much inherent power and dignity as the members of ArbCom. If ArbCom doesn't meet, doesn't spell it out, doesn't agree, and doesn't announce, then <i>there is no ruling.</i> It is only when the corporate body assents and speaks that there is any power adherent, for the power was not in the person, but in the body.

<dd>I think you need to re-read "Wikipedia is not a democracy" <i>et al.</i>. We wield Jimbo's supreme power at his (and, formally, the Board's) pleasure, limited only by his guidance and our opinions, and act through the prism of common sense, not some formalised system as you strongly suggest. We are not official a body corporate. I'm utterly amazed that someone of your standing and for whom such respect is due would move to wikilawyer so. I'm assuming that you didn't mean it in quite this way, though. :-) Obviously we don't expect people to kow-tow and consider our every phrase pearls of wisdom imbued with divine judgement and exquisite perfection, but they should consider our individual opinions and carefully-considered statements to be (as they almost always are) strongly indicative of the general opinion and mood of the Committee.</dd>
<dd>As for encouraging normal sysops to wheel war, well, they're welcome to. We will desysop them all, as necessary - doing so to every single one, and starting from sratch, would be <i>bad</i>, but it is not an utterly impossible or unimaginable activity. We're here to build an encyclopædia, not "have fun" or build an "equitable society" for everyone to play with in a "fair" manner. This is the real world, and the real world isn't fair, isn't equitable, and doesn't defer to idealism over the pressures of reality. It's far more important to have the right result than the "right" process.</dd>

<p>What a beautifully disingenuous use of "apparently" woven into the "Jimbo trusts us" argument. The "wikilawyer" charge is linguistically and logically null, as it is invoked whenever a person gets caught acting outside of policy and practice. You cannot argue, on the one hand, that this is common practice that ArbCom gets added powers to their persons <i>and at the same time</i> that it is never stated and must not be stated. You wave the "wikilawyer" complaint and combine that with the "not a democracy" to try to excuse not only abuse but the claim that you need not tell people what the rules are for them to be rules, that you need not have the community agree in order to demand that the community comply. That you would further gleefully claim that you will "desysop" people, basically saying with George Bush "Bring it on," is a simply <b>staggering</b> instance of bad behavior, bad attitude, and breach of trust. Since you argue that Jimbo's trust of you (unstated, and we must not ask to see it written) imbues you <i>personally</i> with powers above the powers of administrators, you therefore must question whether I am a person to whom there is trust and respect due. I ask for none. I ask for logic, for reason, for good will, and for good practices, and I use <i>words</i> rather than the mystical touch of a king or the mysterious essence. If I speak truly and can defend my positions, then respect will follow. You seem to reverse this and say that, because you are on ArbCom, your words must be respected.

<dd>I'm sorry, I'm just still not seeing anywhere Tony implies he was allowed to make this block <i>because he's a clerk.</i> Call me naive, but I'm going with the statements above that it was simply over edit warring on RFAr. Yes, <i>he</i> shouldn't have made the block because it was edit warring over his own statement. And yes, unless 1RR got approved somewhere I didn't see, there isn't a clearly defined process for what happened. But everyone is squabbling about motives, and it's just fanning the flames. So now Aaron feels Tony is trying to assume more power than he's actually got, and Tony's feels Aaron's deliberatly trying to provoke him...look back at some of the RFAr cases you both have worked on before, guys, <b>you've been here before.</b></dd>

<li>I'd say this, combined with zero evidence of Tony thinking that there was any problem with this block, speaks to <i>"Tony imp[ying] he was allowed to make this block because he's a clerk."</i> There is nothing in <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">blocking policy</a> that suggests this wa a valid block and several things that explicitly say it wasn't — unless clerks get exemption. I also find it simultaneously amusing and horrifiying to hear that "edit warring" warring is now expanded to include a single revert after four hours "pending discussion."</li>
<li>I also find <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">User:Jdforrester</a>'s responses here to be breathtaking. <i>"Tony should not have blocked Aaron himself"</i> makes it clear he supports the block. I know I'm repeating myself, but I'd <b>love</b> to see him suggest that blocking policy be expanded in this manner. I'll cop his "reprehensible" on my changing of a section heading (not a comment) as simple intellectual laziness, and let it go.</li>
<li>In that vein, however, I'd suggest that if James <i>needed</i> Tony's summary in this case, he should probably hand in his ArbCom badge. Given that not only the facts were clearly and succinctly spelled out and but that at the time the section header was changed Dmcdevit had already suggested this go back to ANI, what <i>exactly</i> was it that we needed a clerk for again? I'm sure that ArbCom are overworked, and that the word smog on most cases is horrific. But if they are so busy that they can't be bothered to read the under one thousand words that were there in <i>this</i> request and instead look over the précis and say "good enough" than we have bigger problems than a measly three hour block of a known agitator.</li>

Comments on the talk pages are also useful in raising wider community concerns about the arbitration process. Arbitrators do read these comments and respond. My experience of observing and working with arbitrators over a period of some fifteen months is that they care passionately about Wikipedia and want to reach the best possible decision. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 01:04, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think clerks summaries are useful. I don't want to see clerking come crashing down like a house of cards. I just don't think Tony should have been the person to block Aaron in this case. Too personally involved. If Aaron had been futzing with someone else's summary, then MAYBE. But probably not even then. Ditto Phil. Get someone else to do it. We have 800+ admins after all. If Tony could not convince an uninvolved admin (and sorry.. Phil is not "uninvolved" at this point) to do it, it wasn't the right thing to do.

<dd>I have to take issue with this idea that anyone who belongs to the ever-expanding circle of people who have ever had problems with Aaron's behavior must be forever counted as being "involved" with him in some way. We don't in general apply such criteria to matters like this. So while it is arguable that I was in some way "involved" with Aaron Brenneman in the immediate case (because he was aggressively editing my clerk summary) and therefore should not have blocked him for three hours, I think the idea that Phil Sandifer was in any way involved is completely mistaken. There was no discussion between myself and Phil, we blocked simultaneously. The person we blocked was edit warring on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>. If Phil's block was wrong, it wasn't because he was involved. He wasn't involved by any reasonable measure. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 01:14, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a clerk I act partly on my own account and partly on instructions, both direct and indirect, from the arbitrators, who should of course show sensitivity to the wider community. I do (as can anyone) send a reasonable amount of material directly to the arbitration committee, and some of this has to be confidential, but my opinion is that it's better if case summaries and whatnot be placed on the applications alongside public statements by other editors. This way other editors may spot a factual error or omission in clerks' notes (as was the case with the timeline for the userbox war case) and submit corrections to the clerks or the committee as statements on their own account.</p>
<p>My opinion of the status of the clerk is that he's really no more empowered than any other editor. Any other editor may open and close cases, submit opinions and evidence to the arbitrators. The difference in the case of the clerk is that he is constrained to only perform clerical work on cases in which he is not involved. This can be a severe disadvantage; in one case in which I was involved, someone botched the opening of the case and only created a workshop page; it took a couple of days for me to get sometone (who happened to be a clerk) to open the case properly. by contrast, it is acceptable for an involved party who is not a clerk to perform clerical work in lieu of a clerk--you don't have to have a clerk in a case if you don't want one.</p>
<p>The reason why clerks are appointed? They volunteer and they undertake to stick with the job, taking on some of the boring work that would otherwise eat into the spare time that arbitrators are able to devote to their own difficult and grueling task of making good decisions. Being a clerk doesn't give you any special powers, it only gives you responsibilities, which in my experience my fellow clerks take very seriously. Nothing we write has any more meaning than what the parties of the case write, but we are more constrained. We do not make statements on our own account, because we don't clerk cases in which we are involved. It is to be hoped that this gives us a detachment that permits us to see the issues raised in the case, and thus bring things to the arbitrators' attention that may otherwise be missed. We are also available to help involved parties by giving them non-judgemental advice on how best to prepare their cases. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 01:04, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Let us stray not into untruth, please, Tony: "aggressively editing my clerk summary" and "edit warring" are hyperbolism at best.

<li>Tony edits in this period, but fail to engage in the "discussion" that was "pending."</li>
<li>Three hours and forty-eight minutes later, I create discussion thread. Three minutes after that I place a note on the existing "discussion" saying I've done so, and one minute after <i>that</i> I change the section header again.</li>

<dd>I'm trying very <b>very</b> hard to remain civil, to focus on the issues. I've said in every venue I've touched that I want to avoid this being personal and that I'm happy to laugh off the block itself. On the other hand, Tony has made unfounded personal attacks both here and on his talk page, failed to respond to concerns raised, and generally acted un-adminlike. If he can just stop acting like a prat and sinking the boot into me we can have a civil discussion about the clerk's issue. If Tony going to continue to weasel around and use the best-defence-is-good-offence approach than this will probably get escalated.

<p>I don't think I need to defend myself against the above false charges of obfuscation, weaseling and whatnot, which appear to be the usual manifestations of a rather tiresome and very unwelcome personal grudge. The facts are that an editor engaged in edit warring on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> and was blocked simultaneously by two clerks acting independently. Creating a discussion thread and then waiting <i>four minutes</i> before reverting, as in this case, doesn't constitute a genuine attempt at engaging in discussion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 08:56, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>First of all, blocking anybody one is involved in a conflict with stinks. Blocking a trusted and respected editor with whom one is in conflict is a serious incident which requires at least an apology. But that's ephemeral.</p>
<p>The serious and lasting questions here are those of authority and responsibility, starting from the definition of the position of clerk, but also other issues Geogre is raising. Wikipedia may not be technically a democracy, but it has been traditionally ruled democratically and very many editors (especially those who write articles) are volunteering their time and brains on the assumption that that's how it will stay, because they have no desire to work in a community ruled by secret rules, unknown authority invested in persons rather than positions, and "common sense" that's common only to the people who agree, and everybody else is a troll. Apart from wikipolitics, wikilawyering, and the moral of the community, the tendency to avoid accountability is seriously harmful to the encyclopedia. The corner-cutting and authority-grabbing behaviour of people who consider themselves to be the in-crowd (which is laughable - what percentage of all articles have individual clerks, arbcom members, or admins edited?) is an inspiration to many a copycat in the main namespace. If this is how old hands get things done at Wikipedia, how do we expect new editors to behave in articles?</p>
<p>As an aside: When ArbCom was established, it was supposed to be the last resource, after mediation, if anybody still remembers that. But, as was painfully shown over and over again, mediation can't work if "common sense" is the supreme law of the community. You can't mediate common sense, because if the people involved had any sense in common, they would have worked it out themselves. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 03:09, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the word "commonsense" doesn't work for you, try another word with a slightly less pure-sounding meaning: pragmatism. Democratic structures and fixed rules are slow and they're open to subversion. A more pragmatic technique is more suitable to online content development. Development proceeds in a bottom-up fashion with disputes being resolved by direct communication between individuals. Disputes that aren't quickly resolved in this way attract attention and, eventually, usually a resolution emerges from wider discussion. No voting is involved, although polls are sometimes used to gauge whether there is consensus on a course of action.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Only when such techniques (including mediation) fail, does the final step come in. Here a group of people appointed because of their wide acceptance within the community meet <i>en banc</i> to produce binding resolutions to otherwise intractable cases. The closest thing to democracy here is that they make decisions by majority vote. Wikipedia really isn't democratic and if someone has told you that it is then you were misled. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 10:24, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right. Maybe you should read what he said again. He didn't say "Wikipedia should be a democracy," he said, and I paraphrase, "You should stop acting in a manner that is damaging to the encyclopedia." I think you should stop hurting the encyclopedia, too.

<p>I think this is all a storm in a teacup. The only thing I'll say is that admins should not, never, ever, block anyone in a case where they're involved. That means Tony Sidaway should not have blocked Aaron Brenneman, but should have posted here or somewhere requesting another admin to check on it. That is all. Now go have <a href="../../../t/e/a/WP%7ETEA_9830.html" title="WP:TEA">WP:TEA</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 13:32, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I tend to agree with the above sentiment, that it's a storm in a teacup, but I still find your interpretation somewhat problematic. I'm not involved with Aaron Brenneman, I'm a clerk trying to stop <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> getting any messier than it already is. As it happens, one other clerk blocked Aaron at precisely the same moment. This may well be the wrong way to deal with edit warring on important process pages, but the simultaneity of the two blocks makes that question somewhat moot. This was a decision reached by two clerks acting independently.</p>
<p>Predictably I have seen suggestions that somehow <i>the other</i> clerk must <i>also</i> be involved with in a dispute with this editor. Further I've seen attempts to drag in quite independent parties, one of them a former arbitrator whose only involvement with Aaron, as far as I can see, is that Aaron once falsely accused him of serious malfeasance.</p>
<p>I am not in favor granting provocative and, frankly, trollish editors more leeway than they already have. Making false accusations against someone does not give you an out. Disrupting <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> and at the same time being opposed in principle to clerks does not stop clerks blocking you--in this case, severally, simultaneously and independently. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 01:12, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm becoming slightly confused here. First we're given an official-looking "clerk note", informing us that there is apparently a community-imposed block. A bit later, we establish that clerks are "really no more empowered than any other editor". Meanwhile, the community overwhelmingly opines that Aaron should not have been blocked for what he did, and unanimously tells you that in any case, you shouldn't have made the block yourself. Now we're back to the authority of not one but two clerks thinking that it's alright, so it must be alright. So, let's try to get one thing straight: what is it, in your opinion, that gives you the authority to:
<ul>
<li>circumvent the established admin code of conduct by blocking an editor that you were in conflict with,</li>
<li>assume bad faith and engage in personal attacks by calling editors which disagree with you provocative and trolls,</li>
<li>and ignore the community's opinion on the whole matter?</li>

<dd>Tony: <b>No</b>. You were involved in a conflict with Aaron Brenneman, you blocked him due to a matter arising, this is something that admins <b>must not do</b>. <b>At all</b>. There are over 700 other admins who could have dealt with this. Whether or not they would have blocked, I won't go into. All I'll say is that I personally would not.</dd>
<dd>I think that the activities of some Arbitration Clerks in some situations may give other administrators and users the impression that they consider themselves to be somehow "above" them, and would urge you to avoid taking actions that may lead to this impression being formed. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 21:14, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I agree with User:81.104.165.184. I have also experienced <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_scarlet_6377.html" title="User:Captain scarlet">Captain scarlet</a>'s agressive and uncompromising attitude in the recent weeks. In particular, I was seriously attacked by Captain Scarlet for using American English spelling, which he seems to dislike a lot, and for telling him that Wikipedia frowns people who change American spelling into British spelling when nothing justifies it. You can also have a glimpse into Captain Scarlet's behavior by having a look here: <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Paris_Network_main_content_c3d2.html" title="Template talk:Infobox Paris Network main content">Template talk:Infobox Paris Network main content</a>. Not content to be told by two users that he was wrong in his edits of the infobox, Captain Scarlet decided to turn around the problem by creating a dummy template (<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Paris_Network_main_content_real_49f0.html" title="Template:Infobox Paris Network main content real">Template:Infobox Paris Network main content real</a>), without leting anyone know, in order to bypass the template where his uninspired edits had been opposed. That's the sneakiest behavior I have seen on Wikipedia so far.

As for "in most cases" and "clearly deserving," let's give examples. I object to the deletion of articles on notable subjects, particularly academics and writers, simply because their authors, mostly new editors, don't assert notability as clearly as experienced editors might. As for "personal attacks," I think an editor who nominates articles for deletion wholesale, based on his personal animosity towards another editor, is acting in bad faith, as well as violating <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.

I am 95% convinced that Eusebeus thinks he is acting in good faith, and that looking at the contribution history of known "de-prodders" is just a good way of finding deletion candidates. However, I believe that regardless of his intentions, the result of his action is wikistalking, and I have advised him to find other ways of locating articles for deletion. I believe Eusebeus is also somewhat hasty and non-selective, for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMonicasdude&amp;diff=50507024&amp;oldid=50505471" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMonicasdude&amp;diff=50507024&amp;oldid=50505471" rel="nofollow">asserting</a> that the article <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horsemen_of_the_Esophagus_8389.html" title="Horsemen of the Esophagus">Horsemen of the Esophagus</a> (a new book about competitive eating) did not assert notability and could not be found in google, despite the fact that the article itself shows that the book is excerpted in <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> (really, how many books get that treatment) and has 4 book reviews on google news after only 3 days in release. I do not approve of Monicadude's forays into uncivil language or his voting <b>speedy keep</b> on every one of Eusebeus's AfD noms, but on the other hand, Eusebeus, probably unintentionally, has found Monicasdude's sore spot and seems determined to keep poking it.

<dd>Strongly disagree. If one doesn't add info when removing a prod, one should either have a good reason to remove it and say so in the edit summary (which Monica rarely does) or should list it at AfD noting that one prefers to keep it. Simply removing prods en mass is unproductive, and Eusebus' response is an understandable attempt to get at least something out of the mess Monica is making removing other peoples tags. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:53, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Basically what you have here are 2 editors who have thrown all pretense of rational behavior out the window and are hellbent of playing a wikipedia game of chicken. Rather than chill out a bit in light of the RFArb, RfCs, numerous warnings, and advisements from other editors they've both escalated their questionable behaviors. In my opinion, trying to reason with either of them is pretty much a waste time at this point... they are going to continue down their respective paths regardless of what anyone else says. Let ArbCom sort it out.</dd>
<dd>I respect the concept of bringing articles that have been deproded (without the deproder making any attempt to improve the article) to AfD for a "peer review" of sorts, but at this point Eusebeus knows how contentious things are and he should be backing off for a bit to let things cool down.

<dd><i>...the result of his action is wikistalking</i> Bullcrap. It's called "quality control". If Monicasdude asserts the right to dispute the proposed deletions, then Eusebeus has an equal -- probably superior -- right to put the question up for a larger discussion. Unless you are somehow asserting that Monicasdude's judgments are not allowed to be questioned, for fear of bringing his anger-management issues to the surface. Hmmm, chosing between more discussion or placating a single civility-challenged editor? Not a hard choice.</dd>

<dd>There are a number of ways an editor can locate articles in need of "quality control." If he found a bunch of bad articles and some of them happened to be Monicasdude de-prods that would one thing. By specifically examining Monicasdude's edit history to find articles he has deprodded, Eusebeus certainly gives the <i>apearance</i> of wikistalking. If he was systematically reverting or contesting MDudes' edits in main article space there would be no question about it. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 14:02, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It wouldn't be wikistalking if Eusebeus was actually thinking about the nominations, but he's managed to make some really really bad nominations. Now a bad nom can lead to a better article, but it might still be "wikistalking" in the sence that Eusebeus doesnt' really seem to be thinking about his nominations. Monicasdude very probably is thinking about his de-prods. Whatever <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffBurdges_be5a.html" title="User:JeffBurdges">JeffBurdges</a> 13:27, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wouldn't be comfortable concluding from someone's edits whether or not they're "thinking" when they make them. It's very easy for me to believe that Monicasdude and Eusebeus are both acting in good faith (though maybe not recognizing good faith in each other). Besides, what if an article goes to AfD when it probably shouldn't have? Well, somebody says something, and it gets kept.

<dd>I just want to add that, as one of the PRODders reverted by Monicasdude, (I believe that article was later speedy deleted), I appreciate the work Eusebeus is doing. As {{PROD}} doesn't leave good records behind, "wikistalking" is the only way to detect <i>questionable</i> {{PROD}} removals, unless the individual PRODder remembers to check. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 14:35, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Now that's just off base. All the PRODder needs to do is put the article on his/her watchlist. And you should note that Eusebeus has said quite clearly on several occasions that he doesn't take the deprodder's comments into account, but looks only at whether the original prod nomination makes a "prima facie case," without even checking out whether the prod claims have any real basis. That's indiscriminate work, not good work. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 15:49, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Monicasdude - no harm, no foul. I sincerely believe that Eusebeus believes that he's doing a service by fixing what he sees as your indiscriminate de-prodding. I'm not agreeing with him, just saying that I really believe he's doing what seems right to him. What's more, it's prefectly ok for these articles to go to AfD, where they can be calmly and civilly discussed, and then kept or deleted on their merits. You're a check on the Prod system, Eusebeus is a check on you, and AfD is a check on Eusebeus.

<p>I just wanted to comment on one thing here. The "User contributions" link exists for a reason. Using it does not equal wikistalking! Editors are <i>supposed</i> to check up on each other. Intent to harass is the essential ingredient in stalking. If someone's going around prodding or de-prodding lots of things, they should expect other people will review them. This editor review is what makes the project work. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:14, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to agree with Thatcher here. The definition of Wikistalking goes beyond simply editing the same articles, it's the intention of it. I sometimes have followed editors from one debate to another, and I've found that Monicasdude is a particularly good one to follow because he seems to catch on to articles about academics. What I do is definitely not wikistalking, because I'm just finding areas of the encyclopedia to contribute to. If I was doing this beacuse I was going to unilaterally disagree with Monicasdude on everything, that would be a kind of harassment. And that's what Eus has been doing; it seems pretty unilateral. Unfortunately, Monicasdude has responded by wikistalking back. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 16:04, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've had a back-and-forth talk with Eusebeus about his actions and dispute with Monicasdude, and I am convinced that Eusebeus has acted in good faith. As he brought up on my talk page, 60% of his nominations have tended toward deletion, 15% to keep, and the others redirected, merged, and so forth. In the evidence of such numbers I find it hard to fault Eusebeus for trying to clean up articles, many of which likely would have quietly expired if not for Monicasdude. However, to counterpoint that, I would like to agree with something Thatcher131 has brought up before, that both involved parties in the dispute with just a smidgin more time could have cleaned up the articles in question to a more acceptable standard, and that is an issue that seems to be a major concern in the environment surrounding PRODs and AFDs today. <a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a> 16:34, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kind of an odd take on things, but its interesting to note that if Monicasdude would take a second when he de-prods to edit the article and fix the reason the article was prod'd, most of these problems would be avoided. It would be especially helpful since sometimes its difficult to find the sources Monicasdude was looking at to decide to de-prod. .:.<a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJareth_d262.html" title="User:Jareth">Jareth</a>.:. <sup><a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJareth_7e10.html" title="User talk:Jareth">babelfish</a></sup> 16:25, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The deletion policy places the burden of fixing articles on...nobody. It's nice to give new editors time to work on their first article, but not required. It's nice to notify the primary author of an article on their talk page if the article seems to have a problem, but its not required. It's nice to try and improve an article rather than tagging it for deletion, but its not required. It's nice to improve an article when removing a deletion tag, but its not required. It's nice if people on AfD read the articles instead of just the nomination, but its not required. I'm keeping a rough list in my user space of articles that were tagged for deletion within minutes of their creation by new editors (without notifying the editor or trying to work with them) where the article was kept but the editor was apparently driven away. Isn't that nice? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:04, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Eusebeus Speaks!</b> I apologise for the length of this comment but I won't post aything else, I swear. I didn't really wish to comment here, because I feel that any cursory review of my actions will exonerate me from even the suspicion of wrongdoing. Monicadude's behaviour has been a colourful blend of the bizarre and the obnoxious. Indeed, I'm sure that once I have posted this, he will rejoinder with a point-by-point refutation of everything I say, that (if it is in keeping with the screeds so far) will contain heavy doses of self-righteousness, finger-pointing and adamantine declarations of my bad faith. Ick.</p>
<p>However, to make it easier on the unlucky admins or anyone else who may have the misfortune to be wading through this, I will briefly list what I feel are the salient points here, most of which I have expressed elsewhere . Personally, I feel MD should be sanctioned or censured. His behaviour has been rude, irredeemable and destructive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prodding and deprodding are part of the process for establishing inclusion here. AfD is a further part of that process. Sending up disputed prods to AfD for futher review should not be considered any kind of problem.</li>
<li>I have admitted I used user contribs as an expedient to identifying deprods for review. I <b>completely deny</b> that makes me a stalker. I don't how many deprodders I have brought up for review, but the leader of the pack is <b>not</b> MD. And yet he is the only one who's reacted in this way.</li>
<li>I have brought many deprods to AfD for review. Not all my nominations have been perfect, far from it. But AfD is about building consensus and articles that have been kept are probably stronger for it. At the very least, future contributors are more assured that their efforts are being directed toward something that has community sanction of notability and value. This point has been simply missed entirely by a certain editor, but then he is so obsessed with stalking and point-making, I doubt he has taken the time to think the matter through. So: I absolutely reject that I have brought any, even one, deprod to AfD to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">make a point</a> or in bad faith. Of the many prods I went through, I have brought <b>only a very few</b> to AfD for further discussion. Another point missed entirely by a certain editor who at one point insinuated I was bringing his entire recent batch of deprods, which is long indeed, to AfD.</li>
<li>I have had no contact with monicadude prior to this ridiculous outburst, nor shall I want to do so again. He has given no rationale why I would ever want to target him in the first place. Although his subequent actions could well have been prophecy fulfillment.</li>
<li>Finally, much has been from certain angry quarters that I was only looking <i>at whether the original prod nomination makes a "prima facie case," without even checking out whether the prod claims have any real basis.</i> Oh yes indeed that is so exactly what I was doing as all my contetsed prod nominations so abundantly make clear. It <b>is</b> true that I argued my criterion was whether the original prod made a <i>prima facie</i> case. I assumed that it would be obvious that that meant <b>where the initial argument had not been satisfied by the reasons for the deprod.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>A case in point may be found with respect to the deprodding of <a href="../../../g/y/p/Gypsy_Sun_Experience_93bf.html" title="Gypsy Sun Experience">Gypsy Sun Experience</a> on grounds that <i>so obviously meets notability standards there should be no argument</i>; indeed none was provided. MD has subsequently used this nomination as an example of my spectacularly bad faith and wikistalking. When I tried to get into specifics about its notability, he simply insulted me, eventually resorted to deleting my comments, shouted a bit and then I think he slapped up a vandals notice, lol (all the salacious details on his talk page somewhere). However, a search on the band turns up a <b>mere handful</b> of google hits, and <b>practically nothing</b> actually verifying their existence beyond two gigs they played in Tennessee in (if I recall) 1999 - <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Gypsy_Sun_Experience_44a8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gypsy Sun Experience">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gypsy Sun Experience</a> has the dirt. When pressed to provide tangible evidence, the deprodder (after much angry dismissal of my efforts) eventually produced from Google Groups a posting from some guy named Manny who was thirty minutes late to one of the two shows I had already adduced in the AfD nomination - that still makes me laugh. Given who the members are of the band two gigs in TN in '99 may be enough for inclusion (shockingly, so far it is), but it is a stretch to call that <i>so obviously meets notability standards there should be no argument.</i> And this is the poster child of my bad faith. Yea, right.</p>
<p>Do I really need to say more? (I'd rather not.) As it stands, my deprod review is souring on me. <b>NO WAY</b> that something like <a href="../../../g/y/p/Gypsy_Sun_Experience_93bf.html" title="Gypsy Sun Experience">Gypsy Sun Experience</a> should pass AfD after the obvious verifiability problem I have identified (add to that the 0 Lexis Nexis results talked about on the page). Yet extreme, groundless and angry ranting have been sufficient to taint my actions and turn something that is perfectly proper, procedurally sound, and frankly good for what we are doing here into a real question mark. That is unfortunate. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 17:06, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Arthur, I wouldn't consieder any edits where they person is reallly thinking about it as wikistalking. Eusebeus IMHO is clearly wikistalking Monicasdude because Eusebeus AfDed a Harvard dean, among other botched AfDs. Monicasdude is *also* wikistalking Eusebeus as M accused Eusebeus of bad faith on several articles which are really questionable (see Eusebeus's comment). Anyway, my point is: It ain't wikistalking if your at least half right, but making any series of bad calls based mostly upon the identity of the editor is wikistalking. Nothing wrong with using another person edit history, thats why its there, but you need to actually think about what your doing.

They continue deleting absolutely all information on the indigenous community of Argentina, so that there is no longer any mention of the indigenous population at all.

<dd>You mean he's returned from his month's block, right? Those posts of his aren't very polite, but I wouldn't say most of them, if you take them separately, are on the face of it done with "no intent other than to harass"; many seem like attempts to discuss. On the other hand, I do agree that this isn't normal talkpage interaction. The sheer number of posts, their smallness and annoyingness (such as inserting sarcastic headers, and interminably editing his own previous posts), does constitute trolling and harassment IMO. You shouldn't have to put up with this stuff. Do you want him to not post on your page at all? Or to keep his posts to a certain, specified, number a day, so that discussion remains possible? Please tell him exactly what kind of posting on your page you will accept, if any. That is, if you haven't already. (I can't find anything about it on your page, but then he's turned it into a mess, and his own page is worse, with all the deletions and reversions it's suffered.) If you make a direct request and he doesn't respect it, I'll warn him, and if he flouts that, I'll re-block him. His activity on your page sure isn't building the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:09, 29 April 2006 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I meant block. I've changed the header to reflect the correct terminology.</dd>
<dd>You are correct in that while the posts may <i>"constitute trolling and harassment"</i>, that <i>"many seem like attempts to discuss"</i>. This may appear so at first glance, because some posts do contain scientific phrases or statements (regardless of their correctness). But it is clear (IMO) that he is not interested in discussion, as he refuses to answer any direct questions - he posts deriding remarks as if they are answers. You suggested: <i>"Please tell him exactly what kind of posting on your page you will accept, if any."</i> The problem is that I HAVE. On Mar 17, I wrote: <i>"Since you have brought this to a standstill, I will be gracious and [answer your questions] first. <u>After this you must answer my questions, or this discussion is over.</u> As it is not even a discussion if one party refuses to [answer questions]."</i> (the underlining was included in the actual post for emphasis as well) I then posted one very specific question (which I had asked before as well), and even to this day he refuses to answer it, or other questions.</dd>
<dd>I feel it is <i>very</i> reasonable to expect answers to simple direct questions in a discussion. He has shown to me that he does not want discussion, he just wants to continue harassing and publicly trying to claiming that I am incompetent, as well as push his incorrect scientific views. (Which I have even shown him to be incorrect through reliable sources.) <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregory9_32be.html" title="User:Gregory9">Gregory9</a> 00:09, 30 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It may be reasonable, but I would rather not have to try to evaluate whether or not he can be said to answer particular questions (they're not that simple to me ;-)). Your request to him is too old, too, and it frankly doesn't sound as if you've got much hope of getting a straightforward discussion going; I'm assuming he didn't get a month's block for nothing. Would you consider posting something really unambiguous like "This is leading nowhere, please don't post on my page again", or "I'm finding messaging on this scale unmanageable, please post no more than four times a day to my page from now on"? That I could deal with. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 00:33, 30 April 2006 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I guess you're right: <i>"it frankly doesn't sound as if you've got much hope of getting a straightforward discussion going"</i>. So I will post your suggestion. Hopefully this will end it quietly. Thanks for your help.</dd>
<dd>Oh, and after this is done, can I delete all that to clean up my talk page and remove the accusations? Or what is the appropriate procedure here? Thanks <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregory9_32be.html" title="User:Gregory9">Gregory9</a> 00:40, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Normally it's best to clean up your page by archiving it, but this is a case where I for one wouldn't hesitate to delete the whole conversation. It's important to have an informative edit summary if you do, though, something that shows that this is still accessible through the History tab.

If people are presenting evidence which you object to you can rebut it; if they're presenting evidence or conclusions which are factually wrong, you can ask for things like IP address checks to try and clear your name from those claims. But you have to do it over there. Launching personal attacks on Tony here is... what they've filed an Arbitration case about. And makes you look guilty on all the other claims / counts as well. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 23:47, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You responded once to the Request for Arbitration case, but that's like making an opening statement in a court case and then never bringing any witnesses to testify or documentary evidence to court, or cross-examining any other witnesses who testify. Arbitration is a dynamic and ongoing process, you are able to and strongly encouraged to keep responding to claims and evidence and opinions made. You can continue providing evidence and comments until the Arbitration Committee vote to end the case.</dd>
<dd>There are no equivalents of attorneys in Wikipedia arbitration, but you do need to understand and participate in the process. If you do not understand the process, and the available information on the Arbitration WP pages does not explain it well enough to you, please contact the Arbitration committee and ask for help or a mentor or something. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 00:46, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It wasn't my choice to bring the arbitration case; if it had been up to me I would have recommended that we continue to use normal administrator tools to deal with your problematic edits. Sadly it seems that you are close to a formal one year ban from Wikipedia, which I think could have been avoided has we continued to deal with you, as we were, sensitively and with due concern for your incorrect belief that those you are dealing with are all right wing conservatives. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 00:44, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As for the arbitration thing, I responded some time ago. I came across this thing recently only by snooping into other people's mail and edit-lists, your own included. I gather this is technically 'wikistalking', but I see others on my case have pretty much done the same thing. As for you being a Karl Rove rightwinger abusing you office to zealously promote the Republican cause, I withdraw the charge, but remain suspicious of your editorial and administrative POV. There have been public press reports about Republicans vandalizing articles, in order to help Republicans or hinder Democrats -- and this THIS IS THE ISSUE: you either think this is a good thing or you don't; my accusers seem think this is a good thing, and you as an admin are in the line of fire and may be tarred with the same brush.</dd>
<dd>I thought I had requested a mentor, in the person of admin <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a>, and that the issue was now closed. Since this seems to not be the case, it will take me several hours to address the issue, and this may take me several days to execute; I will probably ask institution of arb procedings against them in return. I find this all very opaque. I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to do. --<a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourthAve_051f.html" title="User:FourthAve">FourthAve</a> 01:28, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

However, I might be being blind or something, but to me I can't see any direct copy and pasting, so you might well be right- this will need to be reviewed by other admins as well. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 14:30, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you, I will do so immediately. Although, I have recreated the page already, as it isn't very practical to say "my page has been deleted cause it looks like this one", if I haven't got my page to show, isn't it?</p>
<p>I have also responded quite rudely to the Petaholmes, and I meant every word of it. I know that is not recommended or tolerated here, but I was mad for all the effort I wasted only for someone to make a judgment in a split second. The admin in question is also from Australia, as I am, and it is half past midnight here. I don't think a decision made at this time of night can be well-considered by anyone.</p>

<dd>The article doesn't have to exist in order to show that it looks like another page.

<p>User:Spearhead has unfortunatly decided to violate an AFD ruling on information on the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Metal_8348.html" title="Black Metal">Black Metal</a> article. The article <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll_Metal_fdab.html" title="Troll Metal">Troll Metal</a> was placed for AFD sometime ago and its contents merged into the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Metal_8348.html" title="Black Metal">Black Metal</a> article. Recently Spearhead has decided that he wants to delete the section on the basis 'he doesnt like it' even though this violates AFD, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>.</p>
<p>I am also on revert parole so i have no intention of running a revert race, but this is vandalism and as such shouldnt be allowed. I tried warning Sceptre [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Spearhead&amp;curid=1048013&amp;diff=50746079&amp;oldid=50659857" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Spearhead&amp;curid=1048013&amp;diff=50746079&amp;oldid=50659857" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>], [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Black_metal&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50746522" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Black_metal&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50746522" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>].</p>
<p>Spearheads response was <i>report it and see what happens</i>, implying that he is untouchable by admins due to his normally high work and good faith <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Black_metal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=50746522" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Black_metal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=50746522" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Leyasu&amp;curid=3065787&amp;diff=50746234&amp;oldid=50745307" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Leyasu&amp;curid=3065787&amp;diff=50746234&amp;oldid=50745307" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>. However Spearheads normal good faith doesnt give him a right to vandalise any page, and as such this should be dealt with appropriatly. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Ley Shade</a> 15:33, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A general concensus was reached on the BM talk page to remove this and another section as well as it can be considered an act of vandalism to put it back in. As such it has been removed several times by various users. Only Leyasu seems to want to keep this on the BM page as per AFD. I have advised Leyasu to find a proper place to store it or if no such can be found to put it on his user space. Spearhead 15:44, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I've made an attempt to mediate on this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Black_metal#Troll_metal:_Where_next.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Black_metal#Troll_metal:_Where_next.3F" rel="nofollow">here</a>. As above, the basic problem is that the original Troll metal article was "kept" in an AfD, then later merged into Black metal. Debate has since raged on that talk page and other places about whether it belongs there (or anywhere) as a subsection. I've suggested a couple of things, hopefully something will catch hold. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> 16:26, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
