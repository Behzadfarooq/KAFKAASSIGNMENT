<p>This image <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Dylan_jams_with_campbell.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Dylan_jams_with_campbell.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> was uploaded about a year ago, identified as a "private photo," and supposedly GFDL-licensed by an editor who did not have any rights in the image to license. None of the standard IFD processes appear to apply in this case. The image is plainly not a "private photo"; it is clearly a video capture/screenshot (note the characteristic distortion at the bottom of the picture). The image is drawn from a commercial bootleg video, and therefore cannot be validly licensed for Wikipedia use. What action is required to delete the image, which is currently available, quite inappropriately, on Wikipedia Commons? <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 05:55, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suppose it could possibly be "<a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>" in an article about that particular bootleg video. Regardless, I notice that <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">User:JDG</a> is the uploader. Does that user claim to be the author of the video (which it clearly is from)? If not, it needs deleting both here and at Commons.

<dd>This image very obviously falls under fair use. It was not "pulled from a moderately well-known Dylan fansite". It was sent to me by an acquaintance in 1998. Other uses he may have made of it don't concern me or Wikipedia. Whether it is a photo or a still from a video is also irrelevant. The law is quite clear about fair use of images of public figures (as Dylan assuredly is) and there is no problem with its inclusion here. Jkelly, I suggest you take your cue from the history of similar fair use images that exist by the hundreds in Wikipedia and have attracted zero litigation. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 23:38, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">User:JDG</a>, thank you for responding. The issue, unfortunately, isn't entirely settled. The most important problem is that <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_6ffa.html" title="User:Mailer diablo">User:Mailer diablo</a> has asserted rights to the image that they do not have by tagging it <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, which means that copyright-infringing material is now at Commons. I will tag it for deletion there. Further, please review <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>. Simply because Bob Dylan is a public figure and appears in the image does not automatically make it fair use in our article about Bob Dylan. Finally I cannot bring myself to agree that inaccuracy in labelling images (as a private photo vs. a bootleg video screen capture) is "irrelevant" -- it is quite important to creating fair use rationales. If our conversation has inspired you to help out in keeping Wikipedia free of copyright-infringing material, please feel free to check out <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fair_use_d046.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fair use">Wikipedia:WikiProject Fair use</a>.

<dd>If GFDL is inappropriate then our grounds-for-use should be changed to "fair use" and the image retained at Commons. This argument regarding images of public figures has been had many times over and the consensus has been to retain the images. Your work to keep Wikipedia free of copyright-infringing material is laudable, but whose copyright is being infringed by this image?

<dd>Yes. Also, allow me to keep watch over his contribs so I can revert them on sight. Which would be made an easier task if <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_rollback_privileges_419d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for rollback privileges">Wikipedia:Requests for rollback privileges</a> were still active. Still, I think if I and perhaps another user had a link to the contribs located in a easy place (maybe the userpage), reverting vandalism and quelling it would be much more managable. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanZero_5c06.html" title="User:MegamanZero">MegamanZero</a>|<a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegamanZero_9677.html" title="User talk:MegamanZero">Talk</a> 19:12, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now that a teacher is involved, maybe Help Desk can ask him to get people (their IT folks?) to start clamping down on people who use those school computers to vandalise.

Over the past 12 months, an extreme amount of disruptive vandalism has originated from your school's network, resulting in an appropriate block from editing. The learning process has not been impeded in any way; anyone who attempts to access Wikipedia from your school <i>will</i> be able to read content normally, but not make page changes. Make note that this institution has been blocked over 10 times in the past <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&amp;page=User:204.218.244.11" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&amp;page=User:204.218.244.11" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and received a long series of warnings beforehand.

<li>I disagree. I am well aware of those constant blocks. Which is preciseley why I ask you let me take responsilbility and keep up on the IP's contributions. Note that the last 10 times had no one keeping an eye on the contributions enough to revert. I will take this seriously, and I request you give me a chance to do so. And regarding learning process, I was not referring to wikipedia, I was, in fact talking about how blocking the network prevents e-mail between teachers, and possibly even more problems. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanZero_5c06.html" title="User:MegamanZero">MegamanZero</a>|<a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegamanZero_9677.html" title="User talk:MegamanZero">Talk</a> 21:37, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Plus, I find it highly doubtful that middle schoolers and below would be so persistant (also take into account they are almost never allowed on the internet anyway).

The latest policy is <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>. Whereas Netoholic has been useful in drawing attention to the policy and working on ways to reduce templates' excessive server load, it has been done in an abrupt and rude manner.

<p>Another group of AfD nominations have been made in the GNAA "War on blogs". See User:Timecop/The war on blogs. It's getting old. Several GNAA members are attempting to delete as many blog articles as possible. It's true that some of these articles don't belong here, but many of the nominations are of good articles about well-known subjects. It's clear that a group of 7-8 editors are coordinating their efforts off-site so that they all vote for deletion quickly after an article is nominated, and they care little about whether the subject is actually notable. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 01:19, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's more a commentary on the admin who speedied it than on the participants in the AfD. If "trolls" want to improve wikipedia by finding and nominating for deletion non-encyclopedic material, more power to them. We can certainly encourge them to make better nominations, or to space them out more, but ad hominum remarks are pointless. If the material isn't up to scratch then it should be deleted. Bad nominations are best countered with calm, rational explanations of why the article is about something notable, with appropiate references <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITEd</a>. Noting very new acccounts is fine, and putting the "sockpuppet beware" template on the AfDs is a good idea, but dismissing contributions based upon the contributor is a poor precedent. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 04:26, 6 January 2006

<dd>We definitely shouldn't start munching on newbies, but I still don't think it's a good thing when people vote quickly and uniformly, almost without thinking about it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Forallah" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Forallah" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Jmax-" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Jmax-" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Tapir" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Tapir" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Depakote" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Depakote" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. I'm sure they're good people, it'd just be nice if they put a little more thought into their votes, and at least give the appearance that they came to the AfD with an open mind. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 04:49, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. Lupo, the situation is more complex than that, not to say nightmarish. It does happen that (especially AOL) users get blocked in a way that they can edit other pages besides their own talkpage one minute, but not the next.

<dd>Questia.com is a legitimate publisher of out-of-print books. It is a commercial outfit with low prices ($20 for 30-days access to all its books online). Wiki recommends listing publishers and so Questia seems to fit in the guidelines. (Questia's name does not appear on the Wiki pages, only a hot link like this: <a href="http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=62946671" class="external text" title="http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=62946671" rel="nofollow">Freeman, Washington</a>. I have no connection whatever with Questia, except I paid $99 for a one-year membership. But the reason I link it is not to sell a product but because it offers two very useful services, free to everyone. which fit very well I think with the Wiki goal of maximizing access to information through the www. You can read the first page of every chapter of every book in Questia (and cut and paste), and you can do a full text search through its huge database. It carries mostly old and out of print books, that have been selected by librarians to be of value to researchers, and historians like myself. Reading every first page will help people decide if they want to buy the book through Amazon or Questia, or order it through their library, or track it doen in the stacks of a major university library. When you have a bibliography of maybe 30 titles and have to narrow it down to a couple, Questia is a godsend. The online feature means you will not wait a week for inter-library loan. I am told that some libraries will pay the Questia fee (which is a bargain, considering that libraries say an interlibrary loan costs them $20+ to process.) <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 09:55, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can't believe I'm hearing myself speaking in favor of <i>any</i> commercial link, but Questia is indeed a good deal and a good outfit. Their niche is to sell subscriptions <i>only</i> to private individuals, at very affordable prices; they're not available to libraries. This is a Good Thing. It counteracts the tendency for texts to become more and more easily available to academics, and less and less to everybody else. Such a tendency has arisen because so many big, yummy databases are now on the web—stuff like the huge Early English Books database (yum, yum), the <i>OED</i>, the latest <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, the Chadwyck-Healey complete English pre-copyright poetry and drama text collections—drool— but are in practice only accessible to University employees. Their subscription prices are so outrageous that only Uni libraries (and far from all Uni libraries) can afford them. Questia is not exhaustive like these library-aimed services, but it's big all right, it's very useful and cheap, and as far from a scam as you can get. One thing that impressed me specially when I was trying to decide whether to get a Questia subscription for a friend was that my own University library —a big, stuck-up outfit (through which I enjoy access to many goodies) which is extremely puritanical about commercial links—actually recommends Questia to staff and students. That was an unusual sight to see. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 10:30, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>they're not available to libraries. This is a Good Thing.

<dd>True, but non-academic libraries won't carry even the big juicy services -- don't want them -- and Questia would be of no more interest to them than Ebsco, e.g. Only in very large cities, at very central branches, do public libraries, at least in the US, feel that their patrons want dry, scholarly services. (NY pub lib is fantastic, as we know, but the Reidsville public library wouldn't want Questia.) I think, though, that Questia is able to purchase copyrights <i>because</i> they can assure publishers that the works are being accessed by single users, a la being checked out of a library. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:17, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On a cursory check, it looks like the benign sort of link. It provides some evidence that a hard-to-find book actually exists, lets you confirm publisher information, and probably lets you read the first few pages which could be useful to get a feel for its usefulness as a source. All that for free, and a potentially useful source of additional facts for people who can subscribe. My only question is whether similar free services are available: is there any overlap with Google Books, for instance? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 10:42, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I use Questia, myself. If the links are, in fact, to books/articles <i>on</i> Questia, it seems like licit behavior. If the links are to "subscribe to Questia," probably not, unless the article containing the link is on things like "books on the web" or "web publishers." In general, Questia is a kick *ss site that does a great service for us all. One reason that folks in universities might not hear of them, though, is that Questia is <i>not available for institutional licenses.</i> It's aimed solely at individual scholars (and I mean scholars). Great stuff. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:11, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Geogre. I would also like to add that a citation to a source is useless unless people can actually locate the source. I happen to work three blocks from one of the largest municipal libraries in the U.S. and I live near a sizable private university, but I still use electronic access (through my local public library) to another company's online offering (ProQuest) for materials for certain types of research. A citation that tells me that an electronic publisher has the material available in a real time saver. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDS1953_dfdb.html" title="User talk:DS1953"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 23:58, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm glad I asked. Still don't like the <i>look</i> of ten links to the same site on a page, but the unholy combination of Geogre and Bishonen is enough to convince me.

<p>I didn’t want to do this, since I figured it’d set a bad precedent for future instances, that people would feel a need for it to be required, but I’ve come to believe the exact opposite after a bit of thinking about it, hopefully you people will realize that nobody on this board knows anything about copyright law, including myself, and that anyone who tries to claim themselves knowing anything more than the very basic levels is basically just trying to go through with how policies and guidelines are actually made, or at least partially made(since nobody ever follows them) around here – grab a group of people that agree with you and intimidate your opponents into submission.</p>
<p>My next door neighbor’s best friend from High School is Mike Tamburro, the General Manager of the <a href="../../../p/a/w/Pawtucket_Red_Sox_25d1.html" title="Pawtucket Red Sox">Pawtucket Red Sox</a>, the top farm team of the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>, which means that he has alot of interaction with their head offices. I’ll ask my neighbor to ask Mike about the Boston Red Sox logo in regards to userboxes.</p>
<p>I also know a man in my town named Gaetan DiGiangi, he’s a member of the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_National_Committee_458c.html" title="Democratic National Committee">Democratic National Committee</a>, and being as such, knows just about everybody who would have any claim to proprietorship over the icon in <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_US_democrat_b404.html" title="Template:User US democrat">Template:User US democrat</a>.</p>
<p>I can almost guarantee you knowing both of them that instead of these groups having a hissy fit like some editors on here and screaming bloody murder to cut off their nose to spite their own face, in all likelihood they will probably be overjoyed that they have so many supporters here on Wikipedia and will ask that the userboxes have official links to their respective websites or something in an attempt to grab some grassroots <a href="../../../v/i/r/Viral_marketing.html" title="Viral marketing">viral marketing</a>.</p>
<p>And, since pretty much everybody’s ignored <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412">BD2412</a> (<a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BD2412_dbd3.html" title="Special:Contributions/BD2412">contribs</a>)’s assessment of things on <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template_talk%7EUser_US_democrat_6b5a.html" title="Template talk:User US democrat">Template talk: User US democrat</a> in regards to images such as these, I have another lawyer friend here in town, I’ll try and contact her and get a statement from her, although I have a feeling that’ll be little good since those of you who have disagreed on this have done so to the point where you’re unlikely to listen to any reasoning of any sort.</p>
<p>No, this is sheerly about Wikipolitics now. This is about if 100 users say 2+2=5 and 1 or 2 users say 2+2=4, if those 100 can intimidate those 1 or 2 with blocks or harassments or deletions or edit wars or attempted deletions of user pages against those who disagree with them.</p>
<p>I’ll be back fully in a few days with what they’ve said and if needed contact information to verify my claims. Hopefully by then Wikipedia will have regained its sanity.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, did anyone enjoy the irony of Template:User support Kelly Martin? I wonder if she or one of her cronies will try to summarily delete it like they did with userboxes that they don’t like. I sincerely doubt it. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 15:33, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Karmafist, I'll wager you'll be surprised at the responses you get from the Red Sox guy and the DNC guy. Marketing departments like viral marketing and such. Corporate lawyers hate it. Hopefully, I'm wrong, though.</dd>
<dd>I got some great advice from BD2412 awhile ago; he obviously knows his stuff regarding fair use. It's rather annoying that the <i>actual</i> lawyers are being ignored, but that's to be expected. This is Wikipedia, where everybody is an expert in everything.</dd>
<dd>No doubt the Foundation has its own legal representation. Perhaps we could appeal to Jimbo to get <i>them</i> to weigh in on this matter? If Jimbo is $DEITY, then certainly $DEITY's lawyers' word is law.</dd>
<dd>Then we could all get back to, oh I dunno, <i>writing an encyclopedia</i> instead of worrying about silly boxes. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 15:41, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would BD2412's comments be the ones where he says that fair use <i>may</i> allow use of logos like the Democratic National Party logo, because that logo has been designed to allow people to use it for self-identification? <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a>|<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yakkity yak</a></sub></font> 17:52, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many years ago, I participated in the organization of games conventions. Similarly to Wiki, there were tons of volunteers, all ages, all opinions, struggling to achieve consensus, where some topics should be excempt from that process. I volunteered to run some play money game tournaments, and tournaments using duplicate scoring, where the players could bid on positions in games like Diplomacy, and the winnings be from the bidding pot proportionally based on how well they did. Several other volunteers claimed my plans were illegal gambling. I took my plans to 2 lawyers on the convention committee, and to the Chief Prosecutor for the City of the convention. All said my plans were perfectly within the law. However, I got nothing but grief from people, where their opinion was more important than that of lawyers. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">User:AlMac</a>|<a href="../../../a/l/m/User_talk%7EAlMac_adb0.html" title="User talk:AlMac"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:36, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I haven't vandalised since being warned.</li>
<li>The Ariel Sharon change was completely justified. The other picture had no source information and was too small to fit in the box (So it looked stretched and distorted on the page). I simply restored an earlier version as a result.</li>
<li>Everyone gives non-rudimentary awards all the time, what I've awarded is nothing new....I was expecting it to be taken light-heartedly so we could put my acts of vandalism behind me, but instead it has been shoved back in my face. I've reacted angrily and so unsurprisingly I'm the one been branded a troll:</li>

I am actually new to this username wise.....I'm just about getting the hang of things, but I continually am pestered instead of helped. I hope you understand that this is why I responded with anger. I hadn't created an article before (You can't by IP) so I wanted to try it. There is no such person called "Glyn" it's just something childish that came into my head. I hadn't finished testing and I didn't see a problem in you waiting for me to finish......I could have marked {{db}} on the article myself. I'm not that stupid.

<p>I think Wikibofh was suggesting a remark be placed here if we felt his handling of this was a mistake. Well at least a couple of us do. One from each side of the arguments, so we can claim a balanced view!</p>
<p>A consensus can't be produced by a vote, a consensus is won by exhaustion, there aren't any short cuts. The 'dictator' issue has been resolved, a stable version has held for a day and a half. All the vote will do is stir up calmed waters. The second question is: what is the correct description of Cuba government to put in the info box? This can't be resolved by a head count of opinions. The question behind it is: what is the standard criteria for defining 'Government' in a country info box.

<dd>Wow, it takes balls to say that node_ue only contributes by making controversial edits to Romania/Moldova related articles. Especially considering that node_ue has been editing here since 2001, and you joined us exactly two months ago. Especially considering that node_ue has edited an incredible variety of articles, and your very first edits were to make a beeline for Romania and Moldovan-related articles, followed by a flurry of talk page edits and then "file a vandalism report on user User:Node ue". <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilsor_f92e.html" title="User:Silsor">silsor</a> 07:28, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Node is a passionate supporter of the rights of speakers of minority languages.

Bonaparte is in a content dispute with Node ue and when things get heated, we see vandals and trolls everywhere.

<p>User:72.245.34.187 added a good deal of information to the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punisher.html" title="Punisher">Punisher</a> article a while back, however, some of the english seemed broken, and there was some POV content. I did my best to clean up, keeping as much of the relevant information as I could. Since then, he's been adding the information again (making much of it repetitive) and refuses any attempt at discussion on the talk page, resorting to wild claims about Wikipedia as a whole, backing them up with commentary from imaginary editors (it's the same ip), and even, on one occasion, an incident of vandalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Punisher&amp;diff=33986361&amp;oldid=33986216" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Punisher&amp;diff=33986361&amp;oldid=33986216" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. History of the article indicates that the other editors seem to agree with my version, with many of them reverting his edits themselves. I don't think mediation is possible in this case, as I've tried numerous times to have a civil discussion with him on the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Talk%7EPunisher_a6ec.html" title="Talk:Punisher">talk page</a>. If it were up to me, I think an indefinite block would be an acceptable solution in this case.</p>
<p>Note: I have tried to follow 3RR. Though I reverted the page 4 times between 6:28 Jan 4th and the same time Jan 5th, two of those reverts were blatant vandalism, one of which wasn't even by the above ip.

<p>It's an unnecessary detour to apply to CheckUser for the typical Hollow Wilerding editing that we're seeing from IP's in the 64.231... range. It would be absurd to <i>not</i> assume it's HW. At first, I blocked the ones I came across, but I've gotten bored; it's much simpler for her to IP hop than for me to block, write a block reason, place a sock template on the userpage, etc, etc. By the time I'm done, she's gone, and some innocent user may be getting hit by the block intended for her. Feel free to go on blocking these IP's on sight if you wish (please keep blocks to 8 hours or less, to minimize the risk of collateral damage), but I'm not sure it's meaningful. What I recommend instead is that everybody just roll back her edits on sight. No CheckUser, no block, no templates on the userpages, and also no bothering to check whether they're good or bad edits (once you've determined from the style and subject of a few of the contributions that it really <i>is</i> her). Remember this is a <i>blocked</i> user, evading an extremely well-deserved block for abusive sockpuppeteering and a storm of of deceit and disruption. Blocked users aren't allowed to edit. Just roll her back. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:14, 7 January 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>A reasonably targeted and short range block — say, a few hours for 64.231.0.0/16 — might be enough to discourage her from bothering, without inconveniencing too many other editors for too long. I know a range block is a blunt weapon, but it's not unreasonable to use it for short periods of time to gain some breathing room. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 06:21, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For a start, the moves are not against the Wikipedia naming policy. Secondly, I have never been asked <b>nicely</b> not to move pages (and the page I moved in November was a differant situation, and I admit I was wrong according the Wikipedia Policy). The suggestion that <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">User:Proteus</a> has 'egged' me on totally riduclous, I was unaware of his support on this matter until after I changed the pages in the first place! In addition, I think it is very insultive to him to suggest he would do such a thing. And I too would welcome a review of the policy, and if the Naming Policy stays as it is and I am right I would like an apology from <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkalexander100_03f8.html" title="User:Markalexander100">Mark</a> for blocking me. --Surrey10 23:01, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He did it again, so I blocked him again for 24 hours. Surrey, if you want to have the naming conventions changed, please discuss it at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29_58d7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (names and titles)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (names and titles)</a>.

<dl>
<dd>It's a difficult one, this, because the naming conventions on life peers is somewhat fluid. The principle that the peerage title should be in the name except where the person is known without it is a difficult one to judge because life peers tend to have become notable before their elevation (that's why they got the peerage). Surrey10 seems to be of the opinion that most, if not all, life peers should have their peerages in the article title. If adopted as a general principle this would create some badly-named articles, and I don't believe that <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkalexander100_03f8.html" title="User:Markalexander100">Mark<sup>1</sup></a> overreacted because it is disruptive. Perhaps the response to this is to make the policy more explicit. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 00:21, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I shall not bother to ask another administrator to review it, its not worth it. I have decided that Wikipedia is totally flawed, as recently discussed in an article in "The Times" newspaper, and I do not intend to use it again. It allows people with no specialist knowledge to edit pages, and then in the case of Mark, Morwen and others give them special powers, when they do not deserve them and can not use them properly. The whole website needs to be changed if it is to gain widespread public backing.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I will give Mark the joy of winning this battle, although I am adamant he is wrong, and that I will be proven right in the near future. Indeed the fact he never answers my points shows that he has little evidence to back him up. People like Mark and User:Morwen make more vandalise this website, and this will only increase until administrators with their huge egos are got rid of completly and replaced with paid professionals who would know what they are doing.</dd>

<dd>I would like this placed on the Administrators' Noticeboard, but because of Mark's childish behaviour in blocking me I can not put it on there myself, and would appreciate it if someone else did for me. For the last time, --Surrey10 10:57, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Unfortunately, rather than a discussion about the technical aspects of the change, it devolved into arguments about the <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> policy itself. There is also some general confusion about how various methods of avoid meta-templates work.<br />
Yesterday, I began back in earnest working to convert the articles. I made a goal to convert all language articles starting with "C" to the new template. During this, I made some adjustments to the template and to the articles, but, <i>and let me stress</i>, NO information was lost. The infobox at all times showed the same information as before my conversion. These edits have since been reverted multiple times. I was even blocked <i>twice</i> by <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Garzo</a> for this - the blocks were rapidly undone.<br />

<dd>(edit conflict)I don't agree with the accuracy of a good deal of the above, but I'll stick to just three points;
<ol>
<li>I have made precisely ONE revert here - when Netoholic replaced the existing <a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELanguage_39a6.html" title="Template:Language">Template:Language</a> with a copy of his <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_language_6fe7.html" title="Template:Infobox language">Template:Infobox language</a> which, since it has different parameters and calling syntax, caused numerous languages in the article space to start displaying incorrect information. I made this revert only after checking five languages and finding them all displaying improperly.</li>
<li>My only other participation in this has been <i>decreasing</i> the usage of meta-templating by <a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELanguage_39a6.html" title="Template:Language">Template:Language</a>. Contrary to what Netoholic says above I haven't seen <b>anyone</b> arguing that we shouldn't remove meta-templates. Just that we should discuss and work together on what we replace them with.</li>
<li>Netoholic is doing a tremendous job converting meta-templates... but his successes and the recognition of his efforts have been greatly muted by the confrontational and often condescending way he goes about it. His work on <a href="../../../t/a/x/Template%7ETaxobox_3269.html" title="Template:Taxobox">Template:Taxobox</a> was excellent, but <i>not quite</i> what the people on that project wanted. Rather than working out the kinks he yelled about 'stonewalling' and beat them over the head with <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> until they decided they weren't going to use Template:Taxobox at all, but rather go back to the old style of calling a separate template for each row of the table. However, all it took was a few minor adjustments and they are now going to use Template:Taxobox after all... primarily Netoholic's work, but almost squandered over the same sort of intransigence and browbeating now going on with Template:Language.</li>
</ol>

<dd>There is no 'policy violation' going on here (except for an increasing <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a> issue). Everyone is working to reduce the usage of meta-templates.

<dd>Heh... you've 'named' me and I neither assume that nor am a member of that Wikiproject. Mostly I think they just want you to 'work together' <i><b>before</b></i> converting the articles rather than after. The new infobox looks very different from the old and doesn't have all the same features. Some of those differences are probably significant to the language wikiproject people and ways of synching things up should be explored. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 23:57, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, that's not really relevant to the dispute here. <b>Everyone</b> agrees on this point. Nobody is saying 'we are not going to stop using meta-templates'. They are saying, 'the new template doesn't work right'. I've been trying to reduce meta-template usage without disrupting the way the templates work. Since I only started looking at templates like this about a <i>week</i> ago I'm nowhere near as familiar with it as Netoholic is. I also haven't been able to devote as much time as he does. Still, slow and 'nobody screaming bloody murder' has its advantages. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 00:07, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I agree that the template needs to be changed to come in line with AUM, I'm worried about the way Netoholic seems to be going about it. Posting one comment on the template's page saying "this needs to come in line with AUM," following this by accusing others of trying to "fake out" the software and "assaut[ing]" AUM <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Language#Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Language#Wikipedia:Avoid_using_meta-templates" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, and then later counting this as an attempt to reach consensus on the changes is innapropriate. Yes, the template <i>needs</i> to be changed, but Netoholic also needed to put more effort into trying to work with those who worked on the old infobox template to make sure the changes went smoothly (his claims that no information was lost are wrong--the color codes for the languages don't show up in the new template; he says the new template is still being improved, and is in use, but he nonetheless implemented it in many articles). I admire his desire to bring the template in line with Wikipedia policy, but he seems to be doing it in an unnecessarily confrontational way (he also tried using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Language#prepare_RfC_Netoholic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Language#prepare_RfC_Netoholic" rel="nofollow">deceptive edit summaries</a> to change some articles over to the new template, which I feel is completely unacceptable).

<p>You miss the point. The issue isn't AUM. It is Netoholic's behaviour. If he worked <i>with</i> people, rather than bulldozing his way through pages, insulting people who question what he is doing, posting swear words on users' pages, issuing threats and throwing tantrums there would not be a problem. He has created the problem and <i>he</i> is the biggest problem with the AUM project. His approach to it has alienated the middle ground, offended genuine users, and sent a loud "fuck you" message to people who have worked on pages for months. Gareth is no vandal, just an understandably offended genuine user who has been shouted at, attacked and bullied by Netoholic. And as the pages Netoholic has been working on show, there are tons of very annoyed users out there, all thanks to his behaviour and his refusal to work with people, just shout obscenities at them and threaten them if they do not let him bulldoze their work out of the way to do what he wants. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 00:08, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Another point: It looks silly to me, to try to totally avoid meta-templates on enwiki, while this policy is not in use on any (all? some? at least not at <a href="../../../../de/index.html" class="extiw" title="de:">de:</a>) other projects.

<dd>Thank you Kelly for clearing my name. An apology by Jtkiefer is not required but it would only show his caliber as a man of honor.</dd>
<dd>I would also want to remind you that Absent was blocked and that os the reados this person had to come back using another username. He had no other choice. This is not the reason to assume he was playing tricks. Sockpuppet has a negative connotation. In this case it can't be applied to him. The question to ask is why he was blocked in the first place when he was posting as Absent. He was blocked being accuse of being my sockpuppet. When he came back and commited the same mistake of agreeing with me, he was again blocked, ecah time idefinately. This seems to be abuse of power. The right thing to do is to restore one of this person's accounts and apologize to him. His only guilt is to not agree with Islamic agenda.<a href="../../../o/c/e/User%7EOceanSplash_1197.html" title="User:OceanSplash">OceanSplash</a> 7 Jan 2006 05:01

<p>I have unblocked 64.107.0.0/16 prematurely from the 48 hour block that <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> set for it upon emailed request from <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahedo_918c.html" title="User:Blahedo">Blahedo</a>, a friend of mine who I absolutely trust not to be a vandal (and who is not at the institution from which the vandalism arose).</p>
<p>Zoe blocked this rather large range after a series of vandalistic edits from 64.107.220.151, 64.107.220.155, and 64.107.220.164. While a range block may have been appropriate in this instance, the use of a /16 subnet is excessive. 64.107.220.0/24 would have been sufficient to cover the vandal range (as would several smaller ranges, such as 64.107.220.128/26). A 48 hour range block of a /24 range is also rather long given the high risk of collateral damage. Furthermore, it is my considered opinion that range blocks should be reported on this page. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 07:24, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Discourtesy" is not, iirc, part of the blocking policy (all the more, the "discourtesy" of removing a message from you placed on her user page instead of her talk page).

<dd>This is truly getting out of hand. I think that Deeceevoice is really making this situation worse for herself by not participating in dialogue, but I also think that these blocks are unjustified. Blocking for personal attacks is, according to the <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">blocking policy</a>, controversial, and DCV was not attacking Bauder himself. She took issue with his posting to her user page (not user talk page) and his blocking her for refusing to let him make that comment in that forum. I think this is at the heart of her behavior; if Bauder had posted to her talk page instead, he probably would have gotten a more positive response. Please reconsider these blocks, <i>especially</i> Sandifer's extension for what he considers "personal attacks". — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 17:14, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe I've missed some substantive something or other on some other page, since this has ranged all across WP, but hasn't DCV made her feelings on the issue pretty clear?

<p>While I think Deeceevoice has done more than enough recently to merit quite a few blocks, I think the specific rationales given for the blocks here were a little shaky, especially the "personal attacks" one (referring to someone's actions as a "hissy fit" is not particularly civil, but it's hardly "about as blatant as it comes", either). Given that, historically, doing anything "bad" to Deeceevoice ends up construed as "racism", it might be best to stick to undeniable cases of disruption before blocking. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 17:25, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Excessively long comments are routinely moved to an AfD's talk page, where they are still visible, and where discussion can still occur.

<dd>That's something, even though it's too late. I think it would help the editing process if minor infractions were somehow noted. Especially as I have a long list of similar infractions against the same person, all of which I can substantiate.

<dd>Let me see. I make a complaint against another editor, and offer to substantiate it. Your throw it back in my face, without addressing ANY of my points, and suggest that I am making "agressive editing", based on <i>someone else</i>. And, as it turns out, <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a>'s idea of "editing" is to COMPLETELY replace an entire article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intrinsic_redshift&amp;diff=33862045&amp;oldid=33749304" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intrinsic_redshift&amp;diff=33862045&amp;oldid=33749304" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> without any consultation whatsoever.

<p>Two days ago I created <b>Category:Wikipedia:Suspected sockpuppets of Superfan</b> due to the ongoing spam problems we have been experiencing with the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Simpson_3f53.html" title="Jessica Simpson">Jessica Simpson</a> article. This evening I decided to investigate things a bit further, and as it turns out, this individual (or individuals) have been spamming Wikipedia as far back as early October 2005, possibly earlier.</p>
<p>Articles targeted include: <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Simpson_3f53.html" title="Jessica Simpson">Jessica Simpson</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelina_Jolie_ff96.html" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Pitt_26bd.html" title="Brad Pitt">Brad Pitt</a>, <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gwen_Stefani_f1e7.html" title="Gwen Stefani">Gwen Stefani</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keira_Knightley_4f51.html" title="Keira Knightley">Keira Knightley</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamela_Anderson_9466.html" title="Pamela Anderson">Pamela Anderson</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reese_Witherspoon_9202.html" title="Reese Witherspoon">Reese Witherspoon</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Cruise_61a0.html" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>.</p>
<p>This spammer makes use of fallacious edit summaries, such as "rv linkspam", while inserting spam links, and in some instances has gone as far as to remove an official website and replace it with their spam link instead. I am bringing this to the attention of the Administrators' noticeboard in hopes that someone can perform a CheckUser on the accounts recently added to Category:Wikipedia:Suspected sockpuppets of Superfan which have not yet been blocked and help put an end to this problem.

<p><b>A locked out Gibraltar user comments:</b></p>
<p>I have politely explained twice to <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a> that the addresses he has blocked are part of a dynamic IP pool allocated to users of Gibtelecom, the largest of two ISP's in Gibraltar. This has been posted to the discussion part of his homepage, he deleted it without comment. He has locked out 2000 Gibraltar users unjustly.</p>
<p>He does not want to listen, and when he says "We have no one else using any of those IPs." he is simply not telling the truth, I normally use part of that IP block and I am certainly NOT the user he objects to.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a> seems to have a campaign against Gibraltarians as a whole and is unworthy of the privilige of being an administrator - I request that this block is removed quickly and that his status is reviewed.</p>
<p>I have been updating the pages on Gibraltar for some time (see record) - nobody has complained about my actions, and I have tried to deal with the Spanish user who wants to rewrite things his way politely. <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a> ignores this.--<a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibnews_d9ac.html" title="User:Gibnews">Gibnews</a> 03:01, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm alarmed that no Gibraltarian is now alowed to edit the Gibraltar page- unless he lives outside Gibraltar! While I agree user <a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibraltarian_6c70.html" title="User:Gibraltarian"><i>Gibraltarian</i></a> has been rash, he's trying to make sure that the Spanish POV isn't dominant on a foreign page. Bearing in mind the hostile attitude some Spaniards have of Gibraltarians, no bad thing. Blocking all Gibraltarians is an over-reaction. I suggest it is lifted immediately, and a fairer way found. As a newcomer to WIKI, far for me to suggest what that is, but I'm sure you have more options than barring an entire country from editing their own pages. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockeagle_a5ff.html" title="User:Rockeagle">Rockeagle</a> 20:27, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ecemaml, please don't bait me. I was trying to be a dampening influence on some of the comments made here, so was deliberately understating. I'm not saying that <a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibraltarian_6c70.html" title="User:Gibraltarian"><i>Gibraltarian</i></a> isn't being unreasonable, some of his comments are. However, some Spaniards have a very warped view of Gibraltarians, and Gibraltarians don't much like Spain, so care is needed to make sure it is a NPOV. I think we can agree on that much. Alternatively, we could try two sections: a UK/Gibraltar POV and a Spanish POV. However, I have been working on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Gibraltar_9245.html" title="History of Gibraltar">History</a> temp page, which I think is comprehensive and neutral, though maybe links to the Dispute page can be put in once we thrash out something for that page. If we can get the History page released, then perhaps we have made a start, and I can then focus on getting the dispute page into language we can both agree on, even if we don't like the points the other raises- because we probably won't. It IS a "dispute" page after all! So, are we going to edit, or just argue? <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockeagle_a5ff.html" title="User:Rockeagle">Rockeagle</a> 15:59, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There was nothing wrong with blocking that ip range for 48 hours. Gibraltarian has been constantly using ip addresses to vandalize, and this was meant to put an end to it. To claim that Woohookitty is partial to one side or the other is <i>absolutely</i> unjust—how long have you known him? Have you seen the disputes he works with? He is doing his best to be practical and deal with the situation according to policy. You are allowed to be critical of his actions, but to suggest that he is acting in bad faith is absurd, and I strongly suggest that you apologize. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a><sup><a href="../../../../es/s/p/a/Usuario%7ESpangineer_0822.html" class="extiw" title="es:Usuario:Spangineer">es</a></sup>&#160;<small><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer"><font color="brown">(háblame)</font></a></small> 17:49, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm looking at the board, not the players and stand by my comments. if you have problems with one user thats what needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>I see a problem with an administrator; I also saw "If it goes ok with no complaints, I'll make it longer." The film '48 hours' had several sequels. There have been complaints.--<a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibnews_d9ac.html" title="User:Gibnews">Gibnews</a> 23:07, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you complained. So. I didn't do another range block. I saw one complaint in my email. I looked through the discussion board and my email. You complained once, not twice as you claim. If you can find the first complaint, let me know. And you know what? After you complained, I stopped. And I'd also like an apology from you. I want to see this bias I supposedly have against Gibraltar. Look at the entire web through google. Look up either Michael Lindeen or woohookitty. And also look at all 16,000+ of my edits on here and show me my bias against Gibraltar. The real issue here Gibnews is that, as you admitted on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGibnews&amp;diff=33306246&amp;oldid=33272340" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGibnews&amp;diff=33306246&amp;oldid=33272340" rel="nofollow">your talk page</a>, you basically agree with Gibraltarian. It is you with the bias here, not me. You make a comment that unlike us, you can talk to the ISPs in Gibraltar to get him stopped. Then why haven't you? You haven't because you think G is just and correct in his attacks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another thing. Look at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Gibraltarian_Evidence_6d09.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Gibraltarian/Evidence">this page</a>. It is a list of evidence against G. Notice that the vast majority of it is not from me? I am point this out because on your talk page, you said "It seems that someone called user:Woohookitty has now locked out 95% of the users in Gibraltar as he has been upset by user:Gibraltarian calling him a fascist." Um no. He was originally blocked for the 135 offenses on the evidence page I cited. 135. After he was blocked, he starting using sockpuppets, which is completely against policy. So then I started short range blocks, which didn't stop him. So I did the longer 48 hour one. ANY ADMIN COULD HAVE REVERSED ME. Any admin. Admins get reversed by other admins every day. If what I did was so biased, why didn't others stop me? Because they knew there wasn't much else to try.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And people wonder why I'm ready to leave the project. It's because people like gibnews can make wild accusations with no basis in fact and they get away with it. If he doesn't apologize, there isn't a damn thing I or anyone else can do. I have him accusing me of abusing power when he doesn't know a goddamn thing about me or my work here. I've been here for a year now. I have 16,000 edits. I've been an admin since June. Gibnews, yours is the FIRST complaint against me on this board. Doesn't that tell you something? There's no abusal of power here. I was trying to stop someone who has violated most of our rules from posting. I did the range block for 48 hours. You complained. I stopped. How the hell this has become "Woohookitty is abusing his powers" is really beyond me. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 08:40, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no apology to someone who blocks the entire ADSL pool of Gibraltar wrongly.</p>
<p>You complain of abuse from ONE user of that pool, and slam 2000 IP's used by around 5000 users, including me.</p>
<p>I have told you the implication of a global block yet you ignore the advice.</p>
<p>I have offered to trace the user here in Gibraltar and resolve the problem locally, you do not reply to my email.</p>
<p>Despite which I have traced the user and am dealing with what you claim is a problem you cannot solve without killing everyone.</p>
<p>IF as you allege you have been subjected to repeated emails from the users, you can complain to the ISP or myself and it will be actioned but you do not.</p>

<dd>Just to clarify something I said before, my decision on whether to stay with the project is not based on just this. It's been a long series of stuff that's got me dissatisifed with the project. Since December 2nd, I've had 163 headings on my talk page. It's just overload. And I'm being told every day that I'm things I'm not. In the last 2 weeks, I've been called power hungry, racist, a censor and everything else. I have a thick skin, but it gets to you after awhile. And then you have this. Gibnews, your first email to me was on the 2nd day of the 48 hour block. You completely avoided my question. Where are these other "warnings" and "complaints". I get up at about 4 am Wikitime. You wrote me the couple of emails you wrote me while I was sleeping. By the time I woke up, the block had expired. You make it sound as though you had been warning me for weeks. it's all just ridiculous. The block is OVER. Has been for 2 days now, as evidenced by Gibraltarian's socks. And "polite"? What do you consider polite. In your very first email to me, you told me that I should take time off and contemplate my role here. On a post on your talk page, you talked about how corrupted by power I was. How the heck is that polite? You don't even know me! You know how many admin things I do a day? 10-15. I do one thing that you consider wrong and suddenly, I'm just an awful, power hungry man. Again, where is this bias? Where are all of these other abuses of power? People make mistakes, gibnews.

<dd>I've been on Wikipedia for a little while now (though less than a year, I admit), and I would like to put down a small observation on this. Woohookitty is a good admin. He has always attemped to be fair in dealing with those who would work contrary to what Wiki stands for; I've never seen Woohookitty act in a rude, condescending or otherwise inappropriate manner here. What we have is a single individual (Gibnews), who has felt apparently slighted and rushed to judgement without any thought to whether or not his accusations or demands were called for. They aren't, of course. Woohookitty did what he felt was neccesary in order to preserve the peace and sanity of everyone who contributes legitimately to the article in question. This is also why Woohoo's actions weren't overturned by higher authorities; because he acted appropriately. Gibnews has already (as was shown in this very thread) asked politely by other users to calm down and to discuss the matter rationally, but he merely seems interested in presenting his own side of things and not listening to what others have to say. It's extremely difficult to deal with an individual like that, because oftentimes rational logic will get thrown out the window in an effort to preserve "his side".</dd>
<dd>Woohookitty, please don't leave the project. Your contributions to Wikipedia have been remarkable and invaluable. I count you as one of the people that can be relied on to tirelessly, thanklessly work towards bettering the project despite seemingly constant attacks from individuals who don't get their way. I am asking you, please, don't let the small minority win. Don't leave.</dd>

<dd>Gibnews, you're right, the whole Gibraltar IP pool is blocked in <a href="../../../../es/index.html" class="extiw" title="es:">es:</a>. It's blocked in a week-by-week basis. We block for a week and wait for the new vandalizing from <a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibraltarian_6c70.html" title="User:Gibraltarian">Gibraltarian</a>. Last time it took less that a day after the expiration of the block to see the new vandalizing from him (Vandalizing? Yes, quite similar to what is currently being described in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Gibraltarian_Evidence_6d09.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Gibraltarian/Evidence">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Gibraltarian/Evidence</a>. Besides, of course without any explanation, he violates the naming policy agreed on in <a href="../../../../es/index.html" class="extiw" title="es:">es:</a> with regard to place names, for example replacing <b>Bahía de Algeciras</b> with <b>Bay of Gibraltar</b> or <b>Puerto Argentino/Stanley</b> with <b>Stanley</b>; he's even funnier when he, not being a native speaker, intends to replace perfectly valid phrasing because he doesn't like it). And as long as we haven't implement the semiprotection feature yet (it's not automatic and is being voted in <a href="../../../../es/index.html" class="extiw" title="es:">es:</a>) the blocking will continue. The other possibility was blocking Gibraltar-related articles (and Falkland Islands-related, by the way) and, sorry, but it's not fair to block a set of articles only because of the vandalizing of a proved fanatic individual like this. Unfortunately, the measures that wikipedia may put in place to fight against people like this are quite limited, and administrators have to choose. I'm not keen to get burnout like <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a> (my sympathies, by the way) only because of people that doesn't understand wikipedia, people that doesn't love wikipedia as we do, people that come here only to continue with his offensive and rude insults they've got used to in places like xsorbit (you can see his messages <a href="http://www.xsorbit3.com/users/discuss/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=viewprofile&amp;username=Gibraltarian" class="external text" title="http://www.xsorbit3.com/users/discuss/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=viewprofile&amp;username=Gibraltarian" rel="nofollow">there</a> and verify whether he was a troll after or before posting in [[:en:]]). And take it for sure, there is no possibility of removing such allegedly defamatory contents (I'd still like to know which of the current contents of the articles are "defammatory") for people that behave as <a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibraltarian_6c70.html" title="User:Gibraltarian">Gibraltarian</a> does. As far as I understand, there are only two possibilities with him: blocking the IP range (unfair) and semiprotecting all the articles he targets (more or less fine), but as long as he's publicly stated that he's determined to go on with his behaviour "for ever" I don't know what to do in the long term (semiprotection is not forever). I'd like to know whether there are other possibilities, but it doesn't seem so. --<a href="../../../e/c/e/User%7EEcemaml_a689.html" title="User:Ecemaml">Ecemaml</a> 08:41, 3 January 2006 (UTC) (administrator in <a href="../../../../es/index.html" class="extiw" title="es:">es:</a>)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that's not the place, but acording to the definition (in Spanish, see the authority on determining what things mean in Spanish <a href="http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&amp;LEMA=para%EDso" class="external text" title="http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&amp;LEMA=para%EDso" rel="nofollow">here</a>), Gibraltar is a "paraiso fiscal".

BTW, see the article here on <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_haven.html" title="Tax haven">Tax havens</a>.

<dd>Gib! The point is that <i>Gibraltarian</i> acts against the policies. I may agree with him or not but I'd never tolerate their lack of respect of policies. If the problem is about "paraíso fiscal", it would have long been sorted out (as it is done in every article). The problem is beyond that and everybody should abide by the policies, starting w/ <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. Knowing in advance about the fact that playing with a large range of IP's would cause a disruption for all Gibraltarian users like you and many others and still keeping on playing the same tricks is a clear evidence that the user just don't care.

<p>This discussion has also confirmed that the majority of Gibraltar users are locked out permenantly from editing the Spanish version of the pages on Gibraltar, and that our views don't count as we are not 'native speakers'.

<dd>Nice try, Gibnews. But you are both distorting things coarsely and unfortunaly not telling the truth. Distorting things because there is nothing against not native speakers. There are plenty of them in <a href="../../../../es/index.html" class="extiw" title="es:">es:</a>. But what a non-native speaker may not do is changing the meaning of words in Spanish. If the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_Academia_Espa%C3%B1ola_d3e2.html" title="Real Academia Española">Real Academia Española</a> (the organism that defines what every word means in Spanish) gives a meaning to "paraíso fiscal" and such definition applies to Gibraltar, it seems weird that a non-native speaker claims that such a definition does not apply (BTW you can try the following searches <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22paraiso+fiscal%22+Gibraltar&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22paraiso+fiscal%22+Gibraltar&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">"paraiso fiscal" +Gibraltar</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=rPN&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22tax+haven%22+Gibraltar&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=rPN&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22tax+haven%22+Gibraltar&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">"tax haven" +Gibraltar</a>. The first search gives 17,000 hits. The second one 64,000. Moreover, if you go here to the article on <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_haven.html" title="Tax haven">Tax havens</a>, you'll see that Gibraltar is listed as one of them. I don't see so much belligerence with regard to the article <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_haven.html" title="Tax haven">Tax haven</a>. In fact, if you take the listing of the OECD, only three territories are listed as non-cooperative tax havens. And BTW, the presence of Gibraltar in the OECD reports is appropriately described.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>And not telling the truth since the claim "the majority of Gibraltar users are locked out permenantly" is plainly wrong. At the moment, and as long as we haven't implemented semiprotection yet, blocking of the Gibraltar range is performed in a periodic basis (and we're forced to renew it once expires since it takes to <a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibraltarian_6c70.html" title="User:Gibraltarian">Gibraltarian</a> less than a day to go on with his vandalism). The problem, as you know, is your compatriot <a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibraltarian_6c70.html" title="User:Gibraltarian">Gibraltarian</a> that, according to their last editions (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Semi-protection_policy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33752464" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Semi-protection_policy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33752464" rel="nofollow">here</a>) and quite defiantly, "will NEVER give up".

</dl>
<p>Let me concisely respond.</p>
<p>1. Gibraltar is not a 'fiscal paradise' nor a 'tax haven'. The OECD is the body who determine that and your article says correctly they do not list it as such. it is not your call, nor that of a wiki or Google it is THEIR opinion which defines inclusion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, you're not right. And not in the specific case of Gibraltar, but in a wide sense. If you look to the ODCE list, you'll see that they define tax havens according to the transparency of their mechanisms and how cooperative they are. According to that, there are only three tax havens in the world! However, the article on tax havens here defines what in English language a tax haven is (regardless of being cooperative or not and not considering the definition of the ODCE). The same happens in <a href="../../../../es/index.html" class="extiw" title="es:">es:</a>. The definition of tax haven is applied. And although the precissions on what the ODCE considers a tax haven should be added (as an interesting aside to consider: sort of "legal definition"), they're not the authority to define what a tax haven is or not (by the way, the inclusion on the ODCE is described in the <a href="../../../../es/g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" class="extiw" title="es:Gibraltar">es:Gibraltar</a> article). --<a href="../../../e/c/e/User%7EEcemaml_a689.html" title="User:Ecemaml">Ecemaml</a> 07:47, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. You are blocking my normal IP with a rollover lockout on the .es site. I am not complaining about that currently just observing the fact.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, you were stating that there is a <b>permanent</b> blocking. There isn't. --<a href="../../../e/c/e/User%7EEcemaml_a689.html" title="User:Ecemaml">Ecemaml</a> 07:47, 5 January 2006 (UTC) PD: BTW, the semiprotection feature will be implemented on January 15th (once the voting ends) so that no need for further blockings will be needed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. The edits of Burgas00 amounted to vandalism, however as he had I now believe him to have been naieve rather than malevolent, so there is no further action required. if he persists he should get the treatment awarded to 'Gibraltarian' I have politely described with reasons for deletion in the appropriate place and you agree with me ... unless you really think Gibraltar is 'in Spain'&#160;:)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that I think Gibraltar is in Spain or not is irrelevant (in fact, I do think it isn't), but again, the point here is wikipedia and its rules and guidelines. Wikipedia states "assume good faith" and "don't label other people editions". I agree with you that Burgas edition might be unaccurate and even offensive, but the wikipedia way is explaining what's going on (what you actually did), rework the edition by the other side, if necessary, wait and see. Being personally offensive with a newcomer (labelling his edition as "vandalism") is not the wikipedia way. For sure. --<a href="../../../e/c/e/User%7EEcemaml_a689.html" title="User:Ecemaml">Ecemaml</a> 07:47, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lets not labour the point, its resolved and my comments on the discussion page are a model of politeness. Seeing five bad edits rang alarm bells. I'm glad you agree with me on geographical issues. Without wishing to get into that discussion, Brits died to remove the name Puerto Argentina, its not coming back. It should be treated as a historical curiosity and not given equal billing but at least we agree on the name of Gibraltar and that military intervention is not an option.--<a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibnews_d9ac.html" title="User:Gibnews">Gibnews</a> 10:17, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why shouldn't we agree on the current status of Gibraltar? In spite of what you can think about me, I'm not here to support the Spanish claims. Only to show that they exist. On the other hand, I understand that your mention to Puerto Argentino is related to the discussion that has taken place in <a href="../../../../es/index.html" class="extiw" title="es:">es:</a> (other of the usual vandalisms by <a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibraltarian_6c70.html" title="User:Gibraltarian">Gibraltarian</a>). So I'll try to explain it again in order to make it understandable. The first point is that the official toponym of a name is irrelevant in <a href="../../../../es/index.html" class="extiw" title="es:">es:</a> (well, in the same way as in any other wikipedia). That way, we have an entry named <a href="../../../../es/l/o/n/Londres.html" class="extiw" title="es:Londres">es:Londres</a> and not <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> or <a href="../../../../es/b/r/u/Bruselas.html" class="extiw" title="es:Bruselas">es:Bruselas</a> and not <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruxelles.html" title="Bruxelles">Bruxelles</a> or <a href="../../../../es/i/s/l/Islas_Malvinas_0056.html" class="extiw" title="es:Islas_Malvinas">es:Islas Malvinas</a> and not <a href="../../../../es/i/s/l/Islas_Falkland_9d33.html" class="extiw" title="es:Islas_Falkland">es:Islas Falkland</a>. The convention we follow is using the Spanish <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exonym.html" title="Exonym">exonyms</a> when available. From such a point of view, the conventions in <a href="../../../../es/index.html" class="extiw" title="es:">es:</a> were clear: the article should be under the title <a href="../../../../es/p/u/e/Puerto_Argentino_ad8b.html" class="extiw" title="es:Puerto_Argentino">es:Puerto Argentino</a>. However, there were two problems: the Spanish exonym was not "traditional" (it was created during the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falklands_War_17db.html" title="Falklands War">Falklands War</a>) and it was not unanimous in the whole Spanish-speaking countries (in some countries Stanley was used while in others Puerto Argentino was more popular). That way, it was decided, after a two-week discussion, that the convention used to name Chilean-Argentinean lakes (lakes located in the frontier): using both names with a slash between them (and using an alphabetic order). That way, the name of the article is <a href="../../../../es/p/u/e/Puerto_Argentino_Stanley_f664.html" class="extiw" title="es:Puerto_Argentino/Stanley">es:Puerto Argentino/Stanley</a>. However, <a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibraltarian_6c70.html" title="User:Gibraltarian">Gibraltarian</a>, without considering the discussion or explaining anything just removed the agreed name and replaced it with Stanley. Very similar was the replacement of <a href="../../../../es/b/a/h/Bah%C3%ADa_de_Algeciras_d0bf.html" class="extiw" title="es:Bahía_de_Algeciras">es:Bahía de Algeciras</a> with <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_of_Gibraltar_209f.html" title="Bay of Gibraltar">Bay of Gibraltar</a>, when the name in Spanish is the first one.

<dd>I am sorry to hear that people from Gibraltar are blocked permanently from editing the Spanish wiki. That's not fair at all. However, I am not in a position to intervene on that matter as I am not an admin neither a user in the Spanish wiki. Regarding here, I also can't give a judgement about the editi warring as I am not familiar w/ the political issue. All my intervention is dealing with pesonal attacks and the lack of civility. And according to my experience, I only witnessed that to come only from one user as I explained above.

<p>Hi Fayssal. In fact I don't see the personal attacks as the main problem. The main problem is his inability to understand how wikipedia works. See for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Gibraltar&amp;diff=33364969&amp;oldid=3336425" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Gibraltar&amp;diff=33364969&amp;oldid=3336425" rel="nofollow">this removal</a>. It seems that he tries to manipulate the history to support his political point of view, removing what could be against his positions. What is rather strange is that a) I can't see how such removals support or not his position b) what is removed is appropriately sourced with British sources!!! (two books, the most widely references works on the topic; one of them being allegedly pro-Spanish, the other one by a very ex-Governor of Gibraltar, a militar and professional military historian). That's the real problem, I'm afraid. --<a href="../../../e/c/e/User%7EEcemaml_a689.html" title="User:Ecemaml">Ecemaml</a> 08:04, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Admins are supposed to set an example. If the policy says X then admins should abide by it regardless of whether they think the policy is wrong. If you think a policy is wrong, you should try and change it <b>first</b>, and not go around behaving as if you are the law. --<a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">Victim of signature fascism</a> | help remove biblecruft 03:07, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't want to get into a public spat about this, but I'd like to note the background to Talrias' complaint, which I see as malicious. My first contact with him was when I objected to his engaging in a wheel war over <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">User:Marsden</a>, twice reversing an indefinite block, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AMarsden" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AMarsden" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> until Jimbo ended the dispute by blocking Marsden indefinitely himself. Shortly afterwards, on an unrelated talk page, Talrias accused me of stalking him, talked about my "absurd comments, rude remarks, and argumentative nature," <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33109763" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33109763" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> and restored the comment several times when I tried to delete it. Today, he accused me on the mailing list of "whining" because of a post I wrote about the need to improve the way we choose admins (I wonder what makes me think that), then later deleted images from my user page, called me a liar, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATalrias&amp;diff=33927075&amp;oldid=33921547" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATalrias&amp;diff=33927075&amp;oldid=33921547" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> ignorant, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33919864" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33919864" rel="nofollow">[57]</a> deleted an admin's warning about <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> from his talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Talrias&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33927449" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Talrias&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33927449" rel="nofollow">[58]</a> (in fairness, at the same time removing one of the personal attacks), proceeded to add this report here, then went to <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> and changed it from a guideline to policy as if to lend weight to the report. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Fair_use&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33934161" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Fair_use&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33934161" rel="nofollow">[59]</a> It adds up to inappropriate behavior for an admin, in my view (whether he's right or wrong about the substantive issue), and I am asking him once again to stop. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:40, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How much of that is actually related to the fact that you have fair use images on your user page, when you are not allowed them? Yet again there is a selective version of history going on here. How many times must I correct the "background" which you present? Here we go: I didn't undo an indefinite block of Marsden, I shortened it and discussed it fully at all times when I was performing admin actions (which few others were), I have also opened an RFC asking for comments on my actions; I reversed some of your actions which were specifically against policy; the email you wrote on the mailing list was actually a gross distortion of new admins in general and deserved to be criticised; you were making untruthful comments on my talk page which is why I called you a liar (a comment I later removed); and our <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Fair use</a> page is policy, as you can see by the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Fair_Use_image_injunction" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">recent comments by the Arbitration Committee</a>. I'm asking you to stop thinking I have anything other than the best interests of a free content encyclopedia at heart here, assume some good faith and stop posting "background" to all of my actions when I've refuted a number of your claims only to have my comments completely disregarded by yourself.

<dd>Per Phroziac, I find it deeply disquieting that I agree with both Ril and SPUI on this page. 'Promotional' image or not, making our user pages more attractive just doesn't seem like a sound fair use argument. That said, I hope that we can limit the amount of heated invective that this discussion generates, and I will be very disappointed if this turns into a 'pile on to SlimVirgin' thread. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 05:45, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it would be a good idea if someone could make a bot that would go around leaving nice messages for people with fair use images on their talk or user pages directing them to the relevant policy page and asking them to remove them themselves.

<dd>That's a good idea. We always need more good images taken or created by our own contributors, so perhaps a message could encourage their creation to replace the, er, borrowed images. I bet most editors have a breed of pet, variety of flower, cultural landmark, or outcropping of minerals that would be useful to have a picture of.

Legally speaking, not making it policy would make the site look like it doesn't care and will let people violate the law if they want to, which, if it ever comes to a lawsuit, means we're totally screwed. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 06:34, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fine. Propose it as a policy. First off, there's no violation of law with legitimate fair use. Second, until you propose a policy, you should be careful about whom you accuse of arguing out of their posterior. Thirdly, your previous history with Slim casts doubt on your detachment from this discussion. Finally, your statement "it's not a laughing matter" is disingenuous, since it's quite clear that the "hahaha" was in reference to my use of the word "small", not in reference to this discussion as a whole.

<dd>OBVIOUSLY there is no legal violation IF something falls under fair use, but the claims you and others have been making about fair use simply do not hold water. My "previous history with Slim"?!? Dear lord, she stopped harassing me months ago once she realized I was right about Gabrielsimon, and we haven't interacted any since then. It's pretty ridiculous to claim something from months ago has any relation to raising points now.

<dd>Regardless of wikipedia policy, fair use is a facet of copyright law. Essentially, we cannot reproduce copyrighted images unless we can claim an <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">Fair use</a> exception, such as that the image is used to illustrate or critique some specific point. This means wikipedia does not own the image in anyway, but in that specific case we are asserting that we do not have to. If someone uses that same image on their user page, it is typically NOT fair use and is a copyright violation. The exception here would be if the user page itself qualified for fair use (for instance, if i had a critique of something on my user page then the image could also be fair use there). The general point is that most users using fair use images have them just for decoration, which is a copyvio. -<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELanoitarus_7ca8.html" title="User:Lanoitarus">Lanoitarus</a> <sub><sup><a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELanoitarus_979b.html" title="User talk:Lanoitarus">(talk)</a></sup></sub> <b>.:.</b> 09:09, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>So then, the question is, since Slim is saying that the images are being used as an advertisement, whether or not the community judgment is that that claim is accurate [not sufficient, just accurate]. I haven't seen any argument here yet that indicates that anyone is even <i>thinking about</i>, much less addressing that question, which is the only relevant one in this entire discussion. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 13:22, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've deleted one of them, which did say fair use, but the second says "released for promotional purposes," and used to be tagged with a free licence, so I'm keeping it until I can find out why the tag was changed and what it should say. However, using a hypothetical example of an image we know is correctly tagged as "released for promotional purposes," what would be wrong with using that on a user page, and where on Wikipedia or elsewhere are the conditions for using images like that written down? It seems to me that an awful lot of people are jumping to conclusions about copyright law when none of us are copyright lawyers, and even if we were, we couldn't be sure because there's no case law about images in Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Also, for the record, I neither opposed nor supported the deletion of fair-use images in user boxes. I know nothing about the subject.

<dd>I have to say, well done, and kudos to Slim for her actions. I personally think the current guideline/policy (not even clear WHAT it is due to edit wars over its status) regarding fairuse images is in need of review, although it currently seems to clearly say they should not be used in userspace. Promotional images are, well, promotional and should be fair game in userspace. The infamous Firefox logo being an example. Any future commercial distribution of WP is not going to include userpages now, is it? --<a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECactus.man_4fe2.html" title="User:Cactus.man"><font color="#2B7A2B">Cactus<b>.</b>man</font></a> <a href="../../../c/a/c/User_talk%7ECactus.man_82b9.html" title="User talk:Cactus.man"><font size="4">✍</font></a> 14:41, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>{{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPromotional_2e75.html" title="Template:Promotional">promotional</a>}} is very much a fair use tag, what the firefox gang is trying to do is to re-introduce "by permission" in userspace only.

<dd>Crypto, you repeatedly have assumed that the "wikipedia community" is monolithic. Quite the contrary. I've received <i>several</i> e-mails and notes on my user page from users who agree with and support what I've done with my user page and who've applauded me for bringing the racism and intellectual bias of this website out in the open -- not to mention e-mails from two white guys who've left Wikipedia in protest over the racism at Wikipedia that it and the RfC/RfAs have exposed.

<dd>Matt Crypto claims he made a "suggestion" about simply having links on my user page. I view it as something else. He unilaterally -- while this discussion is still ongoing -- took it upon himself to delete all the images he deemed offensive, leaving the lock in effect. I view this action as entirely inappropriate, precipitous and an abuse of his admin privileges. Not only did he blank the images because <i>he</i> wanted to, but he did so without notifying me of his intent -- leaving the page without images <i>or</i> links and, with the lock still in effect, with no means of inserting them had I desired to. Crypto claims he didn't institute the lock. But he altered my user page and left the lock in effect. (What's the difference?) There was <i>no edit tab</i> for me to undo his changes. But I soon observed that he returned to remove an image that -- oops! -- presumably didn't strike him as sufficiently inappropriate/offensive (see how the slippery slope of censorship gets more and more difficult to tread?) initially -- that of the watermelon-eating, snaggle-toothed mammy. I also saw that the edit option was, all of a sudden, available. It was at that point that I took the opportunity to restore my page. Now, I don't know how any of this works -- whether it was the result of Matt Crypto's actions (not likely) or of Angr, whose assistance I sought when I realized I could not edit my own page. But, as Angr says, <i>he</i> unlocked my page.</dd>

<p>I've said it before, and I am happy to say it again, but I believe Deeceevoice should have the right to leave her userpage in that state if she so desires. Yes, it is shocking, but not more so than the harassment that she has had to endure while trying to contribute here, which is after all the point she is making. As this seems to be a recurring issue, could we try to get a definitive RFC or something to determine consensus on this rather than wheel warring and/or leaving the page in a state that even DCV can't edit? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 15:15, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes - but then her userpage becomes disruptive to prove a point. Still, I take the general point, and have overturned myself here partially - I've moved the flurry of offensive content to a user subpage, starting her userpage with the "beware" section. The point she is making is still there, but I think it's done now in a way that causes less immediate strife. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 16:47, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Given that she's in the middle of an ugly RfAr case as it is, I see no need to complicate things further; I'd suggest we let her express herself through this process as she sees fit, even if it contains offensive imagery gathered from elsewhere in Wikipedia. If people don't want to look at it--surely they can just avoid Deecee's user page? It's not as if this is our article on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Azerbaijan_7da2.html" title="History of Azerbaijan">History of Azerbaijan</a> or something. Once the Arbcom has ruled, we can take another look at her page in light of that. --<a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> 16:56, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's worth considering that the page contains so much vandalism not because Deeceevoice has been specifically targeted, but because vandals have discovered that it is a 'safe haven' for their nonsense. They've found the one page on Wikipedia that they can deface without restraint, and they're taking advantage of it. Given what Matt Crypto has has observed regarding community expectations of user pages–that is, that they not contain extraordinarily offensive and eminently non-work-safe material–perhaps a warning at the top of the page would be a minimum acceptable change?</p>
<p>We tend to govern our other pages by a 'principle of least astonishment'. If you go to <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a>, you expect to see a penis on the page. If you go to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, you don't. I would suggest that a reasonable compromise would be to have a full-page of non-vandalism content at the top of the page in question, including a visible warning/explanation of the content to follow. It reduces the likelihood that our other editors will get in trouble at work, but lets Deeceevoice maintain her vandals' playground. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 17:04, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Any further alternation of my page that is not a revert of changes unauthorized by me will be considered vandalism. And I will take appropriate steps to press a formal complaint against such action.

<dd>I think you're arguing that user pages are like web sites, where a user has the right to put whatever they want on it. This is not the case. If certain user pages obstruct or disrupt the goal of the project, then they have absolutely no right to be hosted on Wikipedia. User pages aren't spaces for unrestrained freedom of speech. Having said that, I believe criticism is healthy and we should let user pages be used to criticise, even harshly, the project (as long as they avoid personal attacks). On the other hand, I believe that a user's main page is not a good place to hold "shock" images. You say, "if you don't like it, simply don't visit it". The obvious rebuttal is that noone knows whether you like a user page <i>until</i> you (and all the kids in the public library) have already looked at it. And there's no reasonable expectation that a user page will be a shock page. I think it would be better for everyone if you either: A) moved this to a user <i>sub</i>page, linked to with a warning about what it is; or B) added long disclaimers at the top of the page warning about graphic content; or C) replaced it with diffs showing the vandalism. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 17:34, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've no objection to outspoken, textual critisism of the project. I have a <i>strong</i> objection to "shock" images on user pages. A couple of good suggestions have been made for alternatives, and another is for deeceevoice to get an off-site page to use as she wishes. User pages are <i>not</i> a user's property. You do <i>not</i> have the right to put anything you like on them. We may have developed a culture of permitting a lot of leeway on these pages, and of avoiding editing "someone else's page" (something I wish we had discouraged more strongly when it started), but the fact remains that this is not a hosting company. In my opinion, this page is not acceptable -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 17:58, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Deeceevoice didn't go out and find those images and put them there in order to shock people or disrupt Wikipedia. She put them there as a representation of what other Wikipedia users have done to her. If you're shocked and offended, perhaps it would be more productive to direct your shock and offense to the perpetrators of it, not just the person who drew your attention to it.</p>
<p>The problem here isn't Deeceevoice, it's the vandals who have engaged in a protracted campaign to silence her.

<dd>Um, I think you'll find that many of the people commenting above have a long history of fighting vandalism on this project. Most of them have no problem with Deeceevoice 'speaking the truth about the horrible conduct others have shown her'. Speaking for myself, I find it a bit rude that I would be accused of 'censuring' her for speaking her mind. It strikes me as a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_choice.html" title="False choice">false choice</a> to present our options as <i>either</i> being shocked at vandals <i>or</i> being offended by Deeceevoice's conduct; we're quite capable of doing both, thank you very much.</dd>

<dd>I don't believe it's appropriate for the bulk of our positive contributors to be hit with swastikas and other highly offensive and inflammatory images and text by surprise. Someone who in good faith wants to discuss an edit with Deeceevoice ends up with a screen full of vitriol. If Deeceevoice wants to write a long screed about the decidedly horrific behaviour of some vandals and trolls, she's more than welcome to. If she wants to keep copies of it all on a subpage in her user space, she should go for it. If she wants to complain and protest in a way that is likely to upset and possibly harm other, innocent Wikipedians, she ought to rethink that approach. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 15:23, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Everytime I see soeone try to support her it's always, oh, but what about the vandals?

Frankly i'm sick of the "well it didnt get deleted this time around... i'll wait 3 days and try again" attitude that seems to permiate *fd debates. This is a cut and dried case of a user spamming people he knows to have voted one way on a previous tfd, to come vote stack a repeat listing. I see no difference between meatpuppetry and sockpuppetry when it comes to forcing a shift in a vote. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/f/f1/Radioactive.png/18px-Radioactive.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" /></a> 17:53, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>It was three <i>months</i>, actually, which, while short, seems like a reasonable amount of time for a renomination. The attempt at votestacking is quite troublesome, however. How about reducing this to 24 hours, minus "time served"? In the meantime, please leave an explanation for this block on his talk page. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 18:00, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Frankly unless there is a SERIOUS change in an article, the deletion process decision of no consensus should not be questioned and not revisited. That is since just about every revisit leads to the exact same no consensus decision, a la GNAA. Frankly I am really not amused when people decide that they dont like the first judgement and keep relisting it, its akin to cruel and unusual punishment to the users who have contributed to the article up for debate. I know I sure as hell dont want to put multiple man hours of editing time into making something great when the shadow of deletion is continually lingering over it. I'm pretty sure very few people do. Its stuff like this that leads good users to throw up their hands and quit in disgust. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/f/f1/Radioactive.png/18px-Radioactive.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" /></a> 18:32, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, Alkivar, it's things like blocking peoplpe for no reason at all other than revenge for relisting a template for deletion that had no consensus to keep that makes good editor quit in disgust. If you want a policy on not being able to relist things, try to get a policy passed. If you do not want me letting people know about the vote on talk pages, then discuss on the talk page for the templates for deletion page removing the instructions that suggest giving notices on talk pages and actually giving a template to make the process easy. If you thikn what some editor does was not helpful, discuss it with the editor. Blocking out of spite is exactly the wrong thing, and for you to try to claim that you are one of the good editors when you pull nonsense like this is a disgrace. A good editor absolutely would not have done it, and good admins would have completely overruled you on it and blocked you as well. I guess having another admin reduce the block slightly is a tiny bit of a consolation, but, really, this is a failure for all admins to let abuses like this happen. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 09:10, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If something ends in "no consensus" that's just what it means: there <i>was no</i> decision to <i>be</i> questioned. There was no consensus to do anything, and the issue may be revisited in the future. I don't think you can take one extreme case (GNAA) and extrapolate that out to every revisited deletion decision. Revisited decisions get overturned routinely, often as the result of <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. (Of course, the opposite happens, too.)</li>

<p>Alkivar, this was a completely ridiculous block. You admit your reasoning was that you didn't want to see another vote happening. A completely in policy and reasonable revote comes up, and so you block out of spite. This was voted on three months ago, and there was no consensus to keep. The vote was actually quite close, and there were complaints that an admin in favor of keeping it then was acting outside of the rules also. There never was a consensus to create it and put it on other pages either. Even without this consensus, I found someone going around adding it to articles, and when I asked him about it, he rudely tried to suggest that it had broad support (which from the previous vote clearly showed was untrue) and that if I didn't like it I should put it up for a deletion vote. So I did. This was my first listing of something on the Templates for Deletion page, and I followed the directions that were listed there, which said to put a notice on appropriate talk pages. It even gives you template code to go do so. So the claim that this was somehow not legitimate, or beyond that a blockable offense is just nonsense. If you didn't think they were appropriate, you could have said something, or given a warning, or removed them, or whatever, but you just blocked, and blocked for an exceedingly long time. Furthermore, considering that you voted to keep this article, it's quite clear that you had a personal stake in the outcome and should not have been making such moves on your own. This "block first and rationale up some excuse later" concept has to stop. You need a real, demonstrated, actual and logical reason to block someone, not simply a block out of nowhere because they did something that annoyed you.</p>
<p>The most disgusting thing about all of this is I went and checked out your user page and here you posted essays from people on how to improve this encyclopedia by welcoming knowledgeable people and avoiding cliques and socialness and stopping bad blocks, and when an opportunity arose, here you are blocking solely to get at someone following all the rules and policies as they are written down without warning, explanation, or even common sense.</p>
<p>This is an example of an action that should immediately have blocking powers taken away from an admin. Revenge blocks are wholly inappropriate. If he would have explained why he thought what I did was wrong -- the whole putting notice on user talk pages, despite the fact that the instruction tell you to -- then we could have discussed it. But instead all I see above is him complaining that he didn't wnat another vote. Clearly, clearly a bad move on his part. If admins as a group want to have any respectability, they need to hold themselves to the same standards -- or more strict -- than other editors. If that were the case, ALKIVAR here should be strongly disciplined for abuse of his admin position. Whatever he can rationalize up as a reason is nothing compared to blocking someone out of revenge. We need to clean the rampant abuse of admin powers up and start making examples of admins when they get out of line, or else more and more examples of this are going to happen. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 09:04, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This does seem to be a little odd that an admin at whim can block another well respected editor just because he personally disapproves of his actions. A decision of non consensus is just that, and akin to a verdict of "not proven" in a legal situation, thus just as in the legal situation, the threat of a retrial/nomination is always a possibility. In this case a period of three months had elapsed, and three months in Wikipedia is a long time indeed. Can someone chow me where on wikipedia it says "spamming is strictly forbidden and and in all cases the spammer will be blocked without trial or jury ". There should be very strict definitions of what is a blockable offence and the term such a block must last. And admins should be aware of them, before being given admin status. All this rubbish about Adminship being "no big deal", with these sort of powers it should be a "hell of a big deal". <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 12:05, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It seems that <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> is pursuing a personal vendetta against those who took part in the aladin deletion review or on the aladin talk pages. He has made several accusations of sock puppetry to users and has made personal attacks on the aladin talk page., such as</p>
<p>Ox, you're a sockpuppet for Aladin, it's so transparent to everyone here it's ridiculous you're hiding behind the next facade. Give up, you've already tainted your image enough. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 12:22, 7 January 2006 (UTC)”</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>“Of course it is, Mr. Sockpuppet. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 23:49, 6 January 2006 (UTC)”</p>
<p><br />
On top of that, he accussed all users who voted keep as being sockpuppets on aladin’s <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aladin_5963.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aladin">article for deletion</a> page with commens such as</p>
<p>“I'd like to order a full sockpuppet and meatpuppet check on all people that have voted here, with an article of such a bad quality, all those "keep" votes cannot possible be the thruthful opinion of the well-educated general wikipedia public. Please do a IP-Address-Location&amp;Provider-check, not just a "numbers of good edits" check which could be faked by a determined person. Thank you. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a>”</p>
<p>He has also created the article <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aladin_5963.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aladin">aladin (London)</a>, which was a personal attack on aladin.</p>
<p><br />
As well as that, <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> is also pursuing a personal vendetta against those who took part in the aladin deletion review or on the aladin talk pages. I feel that comments such as,</p>
<p>“No disrespect, Autumnleaf, but from your history here anything you claim without proof that you can show and verify so that other people can see it doesn;t mean anything to me. You have from the very beginning been pushing Aladin's claims of notability and making unsupportable comments. Claims of having tracked down a paper doesn;t help. Photocopy and mail it to someone trustworthy if they really exist, because I would guess that you are Aladin himself under one of many accounts from your actions here. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 03:30, 7 January 2006 (UTC)”</p>
<p>“And I would agree that this is probably a sockpuppet anyway. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 03:23, 7 January 2006 (UTC)”,</p>
<p>and “The matter you quote has nothing to do with what you are talking about, and for someone who appeared out of nowhere you sure know your way around... I smell sock. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a>”</p>
<p>I feel that these comments are highly offensive to such users if they are not sockpuppets and could put them off from editing again. I feel that they should take their concerns up here rather than directly accuse them.</p>
<p>As well as that, <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> has also vandalised the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin.html" title="Aladin">aladin</a> page and turned to it to a redirect to the differently spelt Aladdin, his given reason was “redirect for typo on common and notable name instead of stub for person who fails notability tests”. I feel that this was malicious.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether original aladin the article is justified, I feel that Peter S has over-stepped the mark. (Personally I think that aladin is real and notable but was originally hyped up beyond recognition, I also question some of claims but that’s another issue). Also <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> quite rightfully asked for a check on these notice boards (<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Bad_article.2C_undisputed_because_of_big_following_-_Sockpuppets.3F_What_to_do.3F" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">See here</a>) and the response was that there were no suspicions of sock puppetry. I am all for a sock puppetry investigation (of all voters, including those who voted delete) as I have my own suspicions if it stops <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> from continuing this personal pursuit.

<dd>I did not vandalize the article, and there are very clear indications of sockpuppetry and/or meatpuppetry going on. A group of editors on that page made similar self-promotional edits on a variety of linked topics all over. Certainly the similarity in their tactics in responding to their being caught is suspicious in itself, with newly registered editors showing up to defend them when they found themselves outnumbered. This is just someone who got caught making suspicious edits trying to piggyback on another complaint. I think the real issue here is that we have yet another example of coordinated spamming and hoaxing of this encyclopedia, and it went for months without anything being done about it, with a number of other articles involved that still have not been looked into. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 07:16, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>"This is just someone who got caught making suspicious edits trying to piggyback on another complaint."</i> Despite your repeated claims, please notice that I have made <b>0</b> edits to the Aladin page and only take part in the articles for deletion discussion, please notice that some of the people you have accussed of suck-puppetry have a large amount of edits such as <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutumnleaf_9e32.html" title="User:Autumnleaf">user:autumnleaf</a>. Please check the page's history. Would you be prepared to make a public apology to those you have accussed who are not suck-puppets when the checks are made? The majority of the people who voted keep had a long history of contributions with the exception of few.</dd>
<dd><i>"did not vandalize the article"</i> Could you please varify what redirecting an article you are strongly against to another article that has nothing to do with the subject is? <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 07:53, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sockpuppet checks only trace to IPs and do not catch people across multiple IPs very easily, nor do they catch meatpuppets. Being prepared to make a public apology isn't even an issue, because there it's not like it's possible to prove a negative here. Some of these people have long editing histories, but then they also do similar odd promotional edits on other articles. There is very clear puppeting going on here with at least some of the names, regardless of whether you and some of these others are involved or not, as well as people knowingly putting false information into articles.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, "redirecting an article to another article that has nothing to do with the subject" is NOT what happened. It was redirected to the more common spelling, so clearly it was related. Please read <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> for what vandalism really is before accusing anyone of it, because none of these things you have labeled vandalism are. The more you make these bizarre accusations the more you appear to have been caught up in the hoaxing and spamming of this encyclopedia. If, as you say above, you have concerns about the edits on the article, work on stopping the people who are doing that, do not try to hassle the people who discovered the spammers and hoaxers and pointed them out. Your motives here are highly questionable, and deceptive comments and so forth certainly do not help your case at all. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 09:21, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>SlimVirgin blocked Everyking today for an infringement of his arbcom ruling. Everyking asked me to have a look at the block, feeling it was unfair. I had a look, and felt that in this case he was not targeting Snowspinner, but specifically arguing Bishonnen's block, so unblocked. I understand SlimVirgin's viewpoint on this, but see things differently in this case. SlimVirgin and I can't come to an agreement on what is best here, so it would be useful to have another opinion. Everyking cannot comment on this page, so please don't let this become a big comment fest on his behaviour, we just need an un-involved admin to review the situation and replace the block if that is appropriate (I will not under any circumstances wheel-war on this of course)</p>

<p>Here are the reasons I feel Everyking should be blocked. I blocked for 48 hours, but because there's disagreement, I'd have no objection if someone were to shorten it.</p>
<p>Everyking's been harassing Snowspinner for months, criticizing everything he does, and there have been several arbcom cases about it, which haven't changed his behavior. He invariably engages in boundary violations, finding loopholes, or claiming not to understand. As a result, the arbcom recently issued this ruling: "Everyking shall not interact with, or comment in any way (directly or indirectly) about, Snowspinner, on any page in Wikipedia. Should he do so, he may be blocked by any administrator (other than Snowspinner) for a short time, up to one week; after the fifth such violation, the maximum block length shall be one year."</p>
<p>Clarification was requested and Raul654 gave an unambiguous clarification on January 2: ""Everyking is not to mention, gesture, indicate, or gesticulate in any way that implies Snowspinner or any action taken by Snowspinner (including, but not limited, to Snowspinner's edits)." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;curid=438960&amp;diff=34216069&amp;oldid=34214208" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;curid=438960&amp;diff=34216069&amp;oldid=34214208" rel="nofollow">[64]</a></p>
<p>I warned Everyking on his talk page that I intended to help enforce the ruling. Note that I had not involved myself in this case before, but I was tired of seeing it reach the arbcom. After the warning, Everyking violated it by posting about Snowspinner, so I blocked him for 24 hours on December 29.</p>
<p>On January 3, one day after Raul's clarification, Everyking started questioning Bishonen about a block of hers against User:Hollow Wilerding, a sockpuppet account of a blocked user. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=33702600&amp;oldid=33701493" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=33702600&amp;oldid=33701493" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> He has posted so often about it that Bish has asked the arbcom for an injunction against him posting to her talk page.</p>
<p>Although Bish had blocked HW for two weeks, Snowspinner had extended the block to indefinite three hours later. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AHollow_Wilerding" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AHollow_Wilerding" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> Therefore, it is Snowspinner's block that Everyking is trying to have overturned.</p>
<p>Sannse says he didn't realize the standing block was Snowspinner's. Even if that is true (i.e. he didn't look at the block log), Bishonen explained on January 5 at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Bishonen_2b11.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Bishonen">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Bishonen</a> that Snowspinner was the final blocking admin, and again on her talk page in a response to Everyking at 12:19 January 7. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=34233664&amp;oldid=34217123" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=34233664&amp;oldid=34217123" rel="nofollow">[67]</a></p>
<p>Assuming good faith, that Everyking didn't know until 12:19 January 7 that it was Snowspinner's block he was trying to have overturned, he still continued to post about it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34247459" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34247459" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34260056" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34260056" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> I warned him at 19:02 on January 7 that he was in violation of the arbcom ruling because the block was Snowspinner's. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Everyking&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34267420" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Everyking&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34267420" rel="nofollow">[70]</a> He acknowledged seeing the warning, but continued posting about it anyway, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34269050" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34269050" rel="nofollow">[71]</a> so I blocked him. I blocked for 48 hours because the previous one had been for 24.</p>
<p>Because Everyking has violated every ruling about staying away from Snowspinner, I feel he needs to have the limits made clear (as Raul654 and the arbcom have done), told what the response will be for transgressions, and then each and every trangression should meet with that response. Otherwise this situation will continue, to Everyking's detriment as well to Snowspinner's. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:28, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I respect SlimVirgin &amp; Sannse enough to not want to get into second guessing either.

<dd>On the matter of the ArbCom ruling based block, I think that one is inncorrect, as a Reasonable Observer could fairly conclude that Snowspinner's involvement was at best, incidental, and Everyking determined that the discussion did not involve Snowspinner's actions, thus not violating the stringent standards applied. Even taking into an account accusastions of historic abuse and rulesgaming, this one, using adminstrative discretion, could've been let slide on that standard.</dd>

<p>If it wasn't noted already, Snowspinner didn't actually extend the block, though he tried to. The software actually goes by the shortest block placed, not the newest. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac">Phroziac</a> <sub>.</sub> <small>o</small> º <sup>O (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhroziac_3a1f.html" title="User talk:Phroziac">♥♥♥♥ chocolate!</a>)</sup> 05:05, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>...And, I have to uphold the block. I don't personally see any evidence that he was complaining about Snowspinner's actions, but I think his conduct to bishonen is blockworthy.

<dd><b>Proposal to unblock</b>. I also disagreed with the original Snowspinner-related block of Everyking and wanted to unblock him, but since I went to discuss it with Slim first, Sannse got in there ahead of me. I wasn't against the block because I thought EK had behaved well, but because I thought he'd been blocked for the wrong reason: I don't think he'd done enough research to have any idea Snowspinner was involved, indeed I don't think he'd done <i>any</i> research (see my messages to Slim, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34272611" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34272611" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34311411" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34311411" rel="nofollow">here</a>). That in itself, of course, violates yet another arbcom ruling: "Everyking is required to familiarize himself with the particulars of a situation before commenting on it." Since that ruling, number 5, is mentioned in the block reason, I'm OK with Tznkai's block. Also, none of what I was saying to EK on my page, or what Slim was saying, was getting through to him, so I think a block just to get his attention on the issue of harassing me was a good idea. However, I believe (from reading the IRC log) that he has now been brought round — not indeed to seeing my point of view (hollow laugh)— but to being prepared to leave me alone, however irrational and disgracefully un-adminlike he finds such a request, and go edit something instead. If he holds to that this morning, I'd like to unblock him. I'm most uncomfortable with the idea of somebody laboring under a "punishment block" for harassing me, once they're prepared to stop doing it. It should perhaps be noted also that my request for an injunction against EK posting on my page was just that, a request; the ArbCom hasn't shown any sign of issuing any injunction, so EK hasn't been violating it (the courtesy issue is still the same, of course). Though I don't understand how long the block still has to run, perhaps the matter is already moot? The block log, strangely, shows only the <i>date</i> when the block is supposed to run out — I've never seen that before — and that date is January 9th (wtf?). Anyway, I ask: if the block still has some hours to run, are there objections to my unblocking EK on the ground that the block has served its purpose? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 15:11, 8 January 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I believe that these IP addresses are open proxies for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite the fact that they are from different countries and ISPs, they all speak in the same broken English and all target the same articles for edit warring</li>
<li>I was able to configure my PC to edit through these IPs (try the usual ports: 80 or 8080)</li>
</ul>
<p>My question is: are the above sufficient evidence that those IPs are open proxies and was I justified in indefinitely blocking them? If anyone disagrees with what I did, please feel free to unblock them. Is there a kind of open proxy test that could be performed on them? Izehar 17:33, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>83.220.143.18 is in a dynamic address range, and when I just tested it it was completely closed off, so I'm guessing that this is a wandering open proxy (lovely, I hate those). Probably a compromised machine on a nonpersistent connection and a "call-home" service installed.</dd>
<dd>213.179.243.4 appears to be behind a firewall but is apparently configured (perhaps deliberately) as an open proxy. I'm going to block it. (Oddly enough, the BackOrifice port is closed instead of filtered, which suggests that it's compromised.)</dd>

<dd>El C would be unable to enforce this threat: if an admin blocked you for posting any reasonable message on Deecee's talk page, then you would very likely be <i>un</i>blocked in short order by a different admin. By convention, the user talk page is used to send messages to another user. and Deeceevoice only has the right to request, but not demand, that you do not post on her talk page.

The above was not a threat that I would unblock, veiled or otherwise. Assume good faith! It is entirely likely that another admin would unblock him, and I was pointing this out. If you'd asked first, El C, I would have told you that I would avoid getting involved if you blocked Justforasecond, both because of our history of animosity, and because, at least in the very general sense, Justforasecond and I are both "on the same side" (critics of Deeceevoice). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 13:30, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see much reason for interpreting Matt's comment as a threat - he probably meant exactly what he said. And he's right, surely we can all agree that a "don't post on this page" prohibition is not reasonably enforceable? I have <i>no</i> problem with blocks for disruption, when it's a pattern of behavior. I'm not saying El_C is wrong in keeping a close eye on this user or blocking liberally for future incivility or disruption. But if JFAS posted a polite, constructive message on another user's talk page, that's not reasonable grounds for a block. I took El_C's comment to mean "If you post on this page again <i>in a disruptive way</i>, I'll be watching and ready to block, as needed." Assuming that's what El_C meant, I don't see much to disagree about here. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:26, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whoa guys, time out. No need for this to explode into a dispute between admins over something that hasn't even happend! This discussion has, like so many others on Wikipedia, gotten away from the original issue: Whether or not an admin may block for <i>what they perceive to be</i> harassment of another user via that user's talk page (whether or not the instant case actually qualifies as harassment is something to be taken up after such a block has been issued; at this time, there is no block to argue about, because one hasn't been issued yet).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Returning to that issue, I believe the ArbCom has made it clear that when one editor asks that another user refrain from contacting them via their talk page, it is expected that the request will be honored. If that request is not honored, and the user continues to post after being warned not to, then a block for harassment is in order (and before anyone starts screaming about the blocking policy, harassment of other users is very clearly disruption, and falls within the disruption provision). Whether or not a given situation rises to the level of harassment is, like any other block situation, a matter for the descretion of the blocking admin, subject to review by the community via the normal channels for contesting a block.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, if others have comments on this issue, id est whether or not blocks for harassment are in order, please continue to discuss that here. If all that is going to go on here is continued arguing over the motives of given users, then please take it to email, RfC, or the ArbCom, or, <b><i>if at all possible,</i> get back to work.</b> -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 14:32, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In response to "the ArbCom has made it clear that when one editor asks that another user refrain from contacting them via their talk page, it is expected that the request will be honored...": that's a bad precedent. I have no intention of following it, and I hope nobody else does either. Plenty of disruptive editors are quick to say "stay off my talk page" when people express concerns over their editing behavior. Folks who give warnings like that are quite frequently problem editors themselves and should not be coddled. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:47, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is taking the decision into a completely different context. The context of the decision is for legit editors, not disruptive editors: When a legit editor requests that someone not comment to their talk page, i.e., two otherwise good users who cannot get along about anything, or when a good editor is being harassed, they have the right to be left alone. For example, I was being harassed by a problem editor who was eventually banned; I was tired of his constant nonsense on my talk page, and I told him to stop posting there, and I was upheld in doing so. I'm sorry to hear that doing so places me in the category of coddled problem editors.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A legitimate request should be honored; quite obviously, a request such as the one you describe would not be legitimate, and would quite rightly not be honored. There is a certain amount of common sense that has to be applied to any rule: When a rule or a ruling is being abused by a problem editor, it is wikilawyering and should be treated as such. It is not a bad precedent to say that editors do not have to tolerate being harassed on thier own talk page; it is a bad precedent to allow disruptive users to abuse an otherwise good ruling. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 15:01, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think anyone posting anything there needs to think about whether it will be helpful in encouraging her to attempt to stay here and contribute. I'm not sure what the arbitration committee has said in the past on unwelcome posting to talk pages. I think we are on the side of sincere efforts to communicate. However, in this case it is better to wait a bit and then try to talk to her. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 15:10, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So what if I'm Wonderfool? I've admitted all my nihilartikels (OK, to be fair, I misused the word <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilartikel.html" title="Nihilartikel">nihilartikel</a> - what I meant was "articles that I thought don't warrant an entry in Wikipedia". So all should be cleared to have me reinstated now. And I've apologized alreadt too. In various pages under various names.

<p>This situation appears to be stuck in some kind of Limbo, with Wonderfool stating that xe has apologized and named all of the nihilartikels and the Arbitration Committee stating that the ban is still in effect until an apology is forthcoming and all nihilartikels are named. Unfortunately, the two do not appear to be communicating directly with each other. <i>Please</i> resolve it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:56, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My two cents: the order of the ArbCom should stay in effect until it's otherwise lifted. If the current ArbCom doesn't lift it, we're electing a new ArbCom that will take office in less than three weeks, and they can hear an appeal if they want to revisit the case. However, we must follow the ArbCom's decision.

<dd>His message admits to being Wonderfool, by the accident of grammar in the second sentence. I've indef blocked the account. The ArbCom ban is in place until it is lifted. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 03:19, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please note that administrators just blocking yet another account does not constitute communication (between the Arbitration Committee and Wonderfool) that would <i>resolve this situation</i>. I've already encouraged Wonderfool to communicate with Jimbo and the Arbitration Committee. (And xe has <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=244179" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=244179" rel="nofollow">attempted to reach Jimbo via Jimbo's talk page on Meta</a>.) I similarly encourage <i>Jimbo and the Arbitration Committee to talk to Wonderfool</i>. (I cannot find any reply, from either Jimbo or the Arbitration Committee, to Wonderfool. There is nothing at <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimbo_Wales_9687.html#Talk_to_me.3F" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">User talk:Jimbo Wales#Talk_to_me.3F</a>.) This continual <a href="../../../w/h/a/Whac-A-Mole_e6f3.html" title="Whac-A-Mole">Whac-A-Mole</a>, with no actual communication going on, is silly. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:25, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>...and so we should be playing whack-a-mole. Did you read the diff you just posted? There is no way that block should be overturned. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 08:27, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I did. I remind you of what it says. It says "I've admitted all my nihilartikels" and "I've apologized alreadt too". Whereas the Arbitration Committee and Jimbo are stating that the ban is still in effect until an apology is forthcoming and all nihilartikels are named. <i>If they disagree with Wonderfool, they should be at the very least telling xem, and furthermore explaining why they aren't satisfied enough to lift the ban.</i> But whilst I can find Wonderfool's attempt to communicate with Jimbo, I haven't found any attempt to reply to that from either Jimbo or the Arbitration Committee. There's been no attempt to actually <i>tell</i> Wonderfool anything. So we have Wonderfool thinking that everything has come to a satisfactory conclusion, wondering why xe keeps getting blocked, and probably putting it down to administrator obtuseness; and Jimbo and the Arbitration Committee, and hence Wikipedia administrators, thinking that things have not come to a satisfactory conclusion. And, as a result, administrators end up playing Whack-A-Mole. Some communication needs to be happening, here. It isn't. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:26, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm unclear why you're posting here, Uncle G. If you want comments from Jimbo, post on his talk page; if you want comments from the arbitration committee, post on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> (perhaps under the requests for clarification). <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> is typically for discussing administrator actions and getting feedback, which is what's been occurring here. Until the arbitration committee modifies its ruling, our current direction is well-defined. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 09:45, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I <i>did</i> post on Jimbo's talk page. See the notice right at the top of this section. I posted here on the Administrators' noticeboard in part because the Arbitration Committee decision involving Wonderfool <i>was made here</i>. There's no formal ArbCom case about Wonderfool. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:43, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I would like to request a permanent block for disruptive editing, all related to a currently deleted article, <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahabone.html" title="Mahabone">Mahabone</a>. There is clear evidence on many of the diifs on <a href="../../../m/a/h/User_talk%7EMahabone_4dd7.html" title="User talk:Mahabone">User talk:Mahabone</a> that he has changed timestamps, and he has clearly resorted to namecalling based on other users' reactions to his misconceptions of provable facts. With the deletion of <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahabone.html" title="Mahabone">Mahabone</a>, said user has done no more editing anywhere on Wikipedia, which also leads me to believe he is a sockpuppet created simply to POV push an article that had no provable fact in it, and I don't see a need to have the account available for similar behavior in the future. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 07:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
