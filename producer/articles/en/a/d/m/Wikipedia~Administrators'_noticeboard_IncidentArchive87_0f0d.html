<dd>This is a lie, Kelly. After my page blanking and a reset of my modem, I made a single statement on your talk page.

<dd>I don't really care if you ban me from all projects. Really. I have no intention of ever contributing to your "encyclopedia" again, after the way I have been treated. Numerous admins have been rude, unreasonable, and unresponsive to reasonable requests. Don't act all surprised that I got pissy and went on a vandalism spree. You block my account for a month, for no reason other than that I called a few users, who happened to have made some trollish statements towards me or about me, trolls. I respond, quite upset, and eventually I'm able to negotiate an arrangement to solve the dispute. Then a single admin decides, "Oh, I'm not going to let that happen", misquotes one of <a href="../../../a/l/p/WP%7EALPHABETSOUP_c452.html" title="WP:ALPHABETSOUP">WP:ALPHABETSOUP</a>, and reverts and protects my page. I am quite pissed about this, so I take it up with the admin in question, who not only ignores my complaint, he reverts my statements and blocks the accounts. After about four or five tries, I say "fuck Wikipedia", and I <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">Special:Randompage</a> it. But why does this surprise anyone? You treat a person like you have treated me, and legitimately expect me not to bite back? (Yeah, I know some cunt is going to revert this statement and block this IP, probably for some ridiculous amount of time, but seriously, what is it going to accomplish for your wannabe "encyclopedia" to do it, other than alienating me, and possibly some other members of your community? It will accomplish the "NeedToPowerTrip", but what does that have to do with writing an "encyclopedia"?)

<dd>Nice. You make a lovely little personal attack like that and then block my IP indefinately, blocking me from responding to it. Oh, that's a dynamic IP, BTW.

<dd>An all-project ban certainly seems appropriate. Vandalism sprees are never justified, and users that engage in such activity are harmful to the project. Indefinitely blocking users who engage in petty vandalism is a long-standing practice and an appropriate action, in my opinion. Are you really asking what purpose blocking a vandal will serve the encyclopedia, Blu Aardvark? It may alienate the vandal, certainly, but will also help us fight vandalism, which is more important, in my opinion. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 06:41, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The vandalism was a foolish thing to do, granted, as were the sockpuppets, but seriously, I felt like I was being attacked and mistreated, and I fought back with the limited tools I had. When you treat a user like you have treated me, and then block all avenues of dispute resolution, you effectively escalate the dispute. I suppose the assumption was, "Well, we'll just make it so that he can't talk about it, or otherwise resolve the dispute, and maybe it will go away. Besides, there is no dispute, because he's not in the first group referred to by Raul's first law, and therefore is in the second.". I didn't vandalize until I was alienated, and all avenues of resolving the dispute had been cut off. I'm not very appreciative of the fact that, when I was actually making some progress in resolving the conflict, someone cuts the process short and says, "We don't do that here". --<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.160.73.242.html" title="User:72.160.73.242">72.160.73.242</a> 07:06, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry you felt attacked and mistreated, but if your fighting style involves damaging the encyclopedia, then I don't believe you have any place here. I am not familiar with your dispute, but forms of dispute resolution available to blocked users include e-mailing the mailing list or e-mailing administrators asking them to review the situation. Vandalizing is never appropriate. I have not treated you in any manner, as far as I recall. I don't believe we have ever encountered you before. I am sorry you felt alienated and I don't wish users to be in such a position, but if this is the way you respond to alienation, then I would ask that you find some other project of which to be a part. I don't wish to be rude, but in looking at the edits you have made, it appears you are more interested in some sort of revenge than in improving Wikipedia, and that's really not the sort of editor I'd like to see here. Your comments above imply to me that you still feel your vandalism was somehow justified. I am sorry that matters came together to such an extent to cause you to feel it was appropriate to respond in this way. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 08:45, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm afraid we never had a dispute, you and I. Primarily, my dispute was between Raul654, SlimVirgin, Jayjg, and NicholasTurnbull, and a few other users. In other words, the High Cabal, and SlimVirgin and Friends™ - admins who think that they are above the rules, because none of the policies and guidelines matter if they pretend that they are interested in the "encyclopedia". &#160;::::::::Again, I'm not really concerned if I am banned or not, which is why my mini vandalism spree doesn't greatly concern me. I cannot expect to get sufficient respect from the High Cabal so long as I contribute under the name "Blu Aardvark". If I do eventually decide to come back, it will be as my sockpuppet - the only one I haven't abused, or even used in recent weeks (which is why Raul couldn't find it in his obsessive CheckUser search). A fresh start may do wonders for myself and for the encycloblog. For now, an apology from SlimVirgin for libelling me in every damn place she could would be in order - that's where my dispute primariy lies. --<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.160.73.242.html" title="User:72.160.73.242">72.160.73.242</a> 09:01, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So do you believe then that if a block is done in poor faith (I'm not going to agree or disagree with you on that), then the user is quite justified in evading that block to vandalise wikipedia?

<p>Blu Aardvark has some good edits in the past with vandalism reversion, and I agree with him that policy is not followed enough these days. However, his <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> on DRV against SlimVirgin in particular are <i>way</i> off the rocker, and his sockpuppeteering displays a lack of sincerity. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:11, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Having read, on Wikipedia Review forum, his admissions of sock puppetry, and witnessed his vandalism on Wikipedia, I don't think the good faith that was extended by me and others towards this editor in the past was merited. He is still openly boasting about having one undetected, unblocked sock. He also boasts about four undetected socks that are blocked, which suggests that he always abused Wikipedia while using the Blu Aardvark account for legitimate edits. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 15:29, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You all went about this thing the wrong way in the first place. Are you that surprised that someone lost faith and sanity in the project when they are attacked and question from 500 different angles by a dozen different admins? His own talkpage was protected while he was blocked, effectively making him unable to defend himself, so the only way he could was through anon IPs and sockpuppets. His past messages, most of which consisted of relatively normal conversation, were erased from his talkpage by admins. Maybe you need to re-examine the way you approach these bans and blocks, because when you accuse someone of being a troll or a vandal, erase their messages, and then you don't give them the chance to defend their character, chances are they <i>will</i> become a deviant, because they have nowhere left to speak, no one to speak to, and no way left to speak. You admins are the ones who set an example for mere users like Blu and I, but in this situation, it seems like all you did was sink to his level, and when that failed, you sought to ignore his plight. Blu Aardvark really can't really be spared now, he's not what he used to be, but don't think that he, and only he, did this. Next time, you take one or two admins to straighten it out, not a mass brigade of sysops.--<tt><font color="green"><b>The</b></font></tt> <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imaginary_unit.html" title="Imaginary unit"><font color="black"><b>i</b></font></a><a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid"><font color="blue"><b>kiro</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/g/o/Ego%2C_superego%2C_and_id.html" title="Ego, superego, and id"><font color="black"><b>id</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_4fb8.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid"><small>talk/parler/hablar/paroli/说/話</small></a>) 22:14, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The entire response to this article from top to bottom has been a debacle.</p>
<p>1. In the two minutes between the time I made the first edit and gathering information for the more detailed second edit, a speedy delete tag is added.</p>
<p>2. User:Stollery twice removes warning tags from his talk page.</p>
<p>3. Both Miljoshi and Stollery break the 3RR rule. In order to cover-up their acts, they apply to have the article deleted, which they succeed in doing. This is what Miljoshi writes on user_talk:Stollery page: "Have flagged...on WP:AN/I. To avoid WP:3RR by either of us, some injection can be expected, hopefully"</p>
<p>4. There is an AfD going on, and there have been three votes: 1 for Delete, 1 for Keep, 1 for Speedy Delete. Yet these votes are ignored when this article was deleted.</p>
<p>5. On the talk page a consensus was asked for: to temporarily remove the page from wikipedia until more information can be gathered on the subject. Did <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> respond or participate in the talk page? No he deleted the article and said that nothing new can ever be added about the subject.</p>
<p>I am disappointed in wikipedia. But I demand action and the reinstatement of this article, and the enforcement of wikipedia rules. <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToysoy_9719.html" title="User:Toysoy">Toysoy</a> 13:18, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well hold your horses there mate! Give a fellow a chance. I had to attend to other matters first, like asking the other person involved not to bite the newcomers (although I now guess you aren't a newcomer at all), and I was then dealing with an unconnected vandalism report (which takes priority). Whilst you were typing this <i>I</i> was typing a message on your talk page and on the article's talk page. I <i>have</i> enforced Wikipedia rules: I speedy deleted an article on an apparently non notable person, I protected the page against recreation as an interrim measure because you weren't taking no for an answer, and I have requested review of my actions from other admins (with the possibility of overturning with no hard feelings). AFD is irrelevant if an article falls under the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion criteria</a>, which to my mind this one does (1 speedy delete, 1 borderline speedy, and you; for the record). Note that no page is deleted forever and if you provide evidence of notability on the talk page or another admin decides to restore the page it can be restored with a couple of mouse clicks! --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:25, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Excuse me toysoy but you neglected to point you that you removed the Speedy tag three times and the AfD tag four times! In doing so you twice over broke the 3RR rule. Also you'll note that <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiljoshi_730b.html" title="User:Miljoshi">Miljoshi</a>'s note to me states <i>"To avoid WP:3RR by either of us, some injection can be expected, hopefully"</i> - note the part that says <b>"avoid WP:3RR"</b> - neither of us broke it (and even if we had it does not constitute a breach if reverting vandalizm - and even if deleted admins can see the history even if you can't so you assumption we had it deleted to hide our actions is false). My warnings to you (all FOUR of them) were placed after two warnings were placed on the article talk page - all of which were ignored. Besides <b>all</b> of this your note on the Talk:Kim McGinn page states "im the author of the article. why dont you remove the article now so that i can gather more info and make a decent article? then i can make the article again. is their consensus?" which is exactly what <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> did, so what's the problem? If you believe this person is notable then simply rewrite the article and request unprotection... you are quite obviously not a new user by any means so you should know to have done this anyway right? I believe everyone acted in good faith considering you removed deletion templates at least 7 times. Good luck with the article. <sub><a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStollery_2e3f.html" title="User:Stollery">ĢĿ€Ñ §τοĿĿ€Ŗγ</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStollery_0895.html" title="User talk:Stollery">Ť</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stollery_ef7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stollery">č</a></sub> <i>13:39, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>First, on behalf of <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStollery_2e3f.html" title="User:Stollery">User:Stollery</a> and myself my apology to <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToysoy_9719.html" title="User:Toysoy">Toysoy</a> (<a href="../../../t/o/y/User_talk%7EToysoy_d773.html" title="User talk:Toysoy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Toysoy_a8f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Toysoy">contribs</a>) for any unpleasant event. To me, the reason why this matter is being discussed here is: <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToysoy_9719.html" title="User:Toysoy">User:Toysoy</a>'s reverts (an admin may see through the past <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kim_McGinn&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kim_McGinn&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>) on the said article by ignoring all rational on <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/y/User_talk%7EToysoy_d773.html" title="User talk:Toysoy">warnings</a>, and then, attempts by the user to stall User-page and talk-page of the fellow editor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AStollery&amp;diff=46587833&amp;oldid=46585448" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AStollery&amp;diff=46587833&amp;oldid=46585448" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It may be noted that subsequent to {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">db-bio</a>}}, the article was tagged {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}} - a gesture in good faith by <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStollery_2e3f.html" title="User:Stollery">User:Stollery</a> to respect the editor's view (it is a different matter that the editor chose to keep reverting everything). While I may assume in good faith that the editor is new and the subject is indeed <i>notable</i> (25 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Kim+McGinn%22+canada" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Kim+McGinn%22+canada" rel="nofollow">google hits</a>), neither of the above two cases qualifies for a pleasant situation. And I see merit in <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a>'s action and rational to size up the situation. <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToysoy_9719.html" title="User:Toysoy">User:Toysoy</a> is very much welcome to assert notability to support the claims. I have created review section on the talk page for this very purpose, content of which can be later moved to the main article subject to qualification. -- Regards. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiljoshi_730b.html" title="User:Miljoshi"><font style="color:#5A3696">ΜιĿ</font></a>ː<a href="../../../m/i/l/User_talk%7EMiljoshi_e74b.html" title="User talk:Miljoshi"><font style="color:#008000">talk</font></a> 08:23, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Those are great arguments, but really I think you guys are trying to excuse the inexcusable. You broke the rules. You can't break the rules in the name of stopping what you think is rule-breaking.</p>
<p>My rule breaking was to remove the damn tag LITERALLY 2 minutes after creating the article; as I was adding information in the first place. In your rush to gain edits on wikipedia you fail to see the consequences of your hasty actions.</p>
<p>These people were so eager to put the tags on the page that they put two on at the same time - the AfD tag and the speedy delete tag. It just doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>And the talk page had suggestions which you guys ignored. Instead you made 3RR violations twice over.</p>
<p>And then, to top it off, you conspired with each other to cover-up your acts and hide the truth.</p>
<p>Well the chickens have come home to roost. And to the wikipedia administrators, I say, punish these people and let the article run its course. We'll see how it looks in a week after some editing. <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToysoy_9719.html" title="User:Toysoy">Toysoy</a> 10:30, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>If that's not enough - The warnings themselves were unfounded, wholely without any merit <b>and</b>, in the words of an Administrator <b>"the warnings were clearly done out of harassment"</b><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AStollery&amp;diff=46799469&amp;oldid=46794156" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AStollery&amp;diff=46799469&amp;oldid=46794156" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup> They were placed simply so (someone like you) could complain about their removal. If some random person went and placed half a dozen large unfounded warnings all over your talk page and expect you to leave them there? They were there, as the admin pointed out to harrass me.</li>
<li>Wikipedia <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">policy states</a>: <i>"It is generally acceptable to remove misplaced vandalism tags, as long as the reasoning is solid."</i> <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup></li>
<li>Even though I was 100% certain the warnings were not valid, to be <b>absolutely sure</b> I checked with another administrator to confirm I could remove the harrassment from my page, which he confirmed I could. <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ChrisO&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=46390160" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ChrisO&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=46390160" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></sup></li>
<li>Regarding the warnings you left on my user page (which you vandalized as you are not permitted to deface other people's user pages) they stated "Please stop removing content from Wikipedia and kimigin <i>(sic)</i>; it is considered vandalism" <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AStollery&amp;diff=46590205&amp;oldid=46587854" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AStollery&amp;diff=46590205&amp;oldid=46587854" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></sup> - But I never <b>removed</b> any content all I did was add the speedy and AfD templates <i><b>WHICH YOU REMOVED 7 TIMES!</b></i></li>
<li>One the same basis as above (simply there as a form of harrassment so you could complain about me) I removed them as completely unfounded.</li>
<li>You claim that we have tried to "cover up the truth" again is completely unfounded. For one <b>we did not break the 3RR rule</b>. There was no colaboration. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiljoshi_730b.html" title="User:Miljoshi">Miljoshi</a>'s note to me stated <i>"To avoid WP:3RR by either of us, some injection can be expected, hopefully"</i> - note the part that says <b>"avoid WP:3RR"</b> - neither of us broke it (and even if we had it does not constitute a breach if reverting vandalizm - and even if deleted admins can see the history even if you can't so you assumption we had it deleted to hide our actions is false). My warnings to you (all FOUR of them) were placed after two warnings were placed on the article talk page - all of which were ignored.</li>
<li>You claim "My rule breaking was to remove the damn tag LITERALLY 2 minutes after creating the article". Again, <b>YOU BROKE THE DARN 3RR RULE TWICE OVER WHEN YOU REVERTED SEVEN TIMES AFTER HAVING 6 WARNINGS!</b> And, again as you can't grasp this concept Admins can still see the history of deleted articles so why would we try to hide this fact... upon reviewing they will see your breach (twice!)</li>
<li>Your call to have me "punished" is motivating me to have this looked into formally... Because I answered all your questions but you continually avoid mine. You came at me right from the start accusing me of deleting another persons warnings from my page before any of this began, and even complained to another admin wanting to know why I haven't been punished and I want to know why. Why do you even care about this? Who are you and what is your problem with me? You have come from nowhere (coincidently immediately after UNK was banned) and wrote about my citing confidential documents so are you a scientologist? Some admins suspect you are yet another sockpuppet of JimmyT/UNK (a scientologist) so please clarify why you are so motivated to bring me down.

<dd>Sockpuppet? Wouldn't surprise me, otherwise he's a very clued up newbie! I am however surprised this is still rumbling on as the article's talk page is quiet and no evidence of notability has been produced (nor I suspect will it be).

When he began to edit <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Delaware_3e25.html" title="Lord Delaware">Lord Delaware</a> and create related articles in time for the 400-th anniversary of his Governorship, he asked me, since I have access to a university library, to check out some details.</p>
<p>The three of us are under an Arbcom decision (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Ultramarine_b82c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ultramarine">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ultramarine</a>) to edit <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_peace_theory.html" title="Democratic peace theory">Democratic peace theory</a> by consensus; Ultramarine is justifying his removal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democratic_peace_theory&amp;diff=46624730&amp;oldid=46624421" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democratic_peace_theory&amp;diff=46624730&amp;oldid=46624421" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> of text which the other two of us have explicitly defended.

<dd>I am not an admin, but I fail to see anything remotely close to incivility or a personal attack. Ultramarine wrote that you are a friend or relative of Mr. West. You admit that you have known Mr. West for some time, so Ultramarine's comment appears to be accurate.

<dd>The material, as it stood, was the product of a series of rewrites by both Ultramarine, myself, and other parties not involved in the arbitration; the actual text was a condensation of an extremely verbose text of Ultramarine's, preserving the arguments.

<dd>I suppose I should speak on this -- to me, it is clear that Ultramarine intends this to be understood as a negative remark, else his dark and portentious tone makes no sense, but the point escapes me.

<p>I wonder if someone could please look into both of these accounts. Count of teh Saxcon Shore was, until recently, called Crusading Compoiser - both the name Crusading Composer and Bakewell Tart and intended as personal digs at me - I work in the town of Bakewell and, as a composer who often uses music to camnpaign for certain issues, it is an epithet which has been used to describe me. BT and CC (now CotSS)'s behaviour shows them to be rather fixated with me - initially attacking the page created by someone else about me <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Steadman_9c22.html" title="Robert Steadman">Robert Steadman</a> and then, when I began to edit on WP attacking me. I strongly believe they are stalkers from another internet forum who wage a campaign of hounding and harassment for months on there and have now transferred this to here. Despite a handful of other edits they are both clearly single issue editors who seem to be on a mission. What can be done? (By the way, despite claims to the contrary I have never edited the page about myself and the accusation of sockpuppets against me is false (I am asure this will come up) - I'm afraid that <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">user: Jayjg</a> was wrong in his actions to block me for this and I would like this recified and the claims that I used sockpuppets removed from WP as it is defamatory).

<dd>User:Bakewell Tart seems to have no interest in adding content to wikipedia - the only real reason for anyone to have an account.

<dd>User:Bakewell Tart did not conduct himself in the manner of a Wikipedian- when I was reverting his edits to User talk:Robsteadman he began to start insulting me in his edit summaries and began gaming the system by making unique edits to the page every time.

<p>The words <i><b>pot</b></i> and <i><b>kettle</b></i> spring to mind. Another over reaction from the man whose favourite word is <b>outrageous</b>. Why does he have to see everything in terms of 'cabals' 'conspiracies' 'friends' and 'foes'? Should I respond by making him the subject of a RfC - his conduct would certainly merit an investigation?</p>
<p>I'll just make a quick summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, I initially created my account with the intention of removing the gush and autiobiography from Mr Steadman's article. The original article was heavily POV and unacceptable. I also wanted to add links to Mr Steadman's activities on other internet forums.</li>
<li>I got into a lot of arguments with VHJH (later alleged to be a sockpuppet of Steadman) and some of these were not pleasant and I'm sure that I broke rules re: personal attacks, AGF and civility - but I'm not that fond of being called 'liar' and mentally ill.</li>
<li>Once the gush had been removed, I let it go. I used Wikipedia to research my interests but I didn't edit for a while.</li>
<li>Then the whole sockpuppet issue arose. Still smarting from VHJH's vicious personal attacks, I couldn't resist gloating and adding a 'Ha ha' to his userpage - although if anyone reads that, it was perfectly in context, considering VHJH's last comment to me.</li>
<li>My AfD, although, unsuccessful, was not a bad faith nomination as Mr steadman, if he was indeed editing as VHJH, would have broken policies on vanity articles and biographies.</li>
<li>I have <b>NOT</b> engaged in any further personal attacks, I have not joined in any of the <b>many</b> arguments that Mr Steadman has involved himself in. I hardly see how I can be accused of harrasing or stalking him (not in the last 2 months anyway). In fact, the only time that I involve myself with Mr steadman is when he makes attacks on me. I politely asked him to remove personal attacks from his userpage and he mocked me then ignored me. I am more than happy to have nothing more to do with him now that he has removed the offensive comments. Quite frankly, he does more to harm himself and his reputation than any of his 'enemies' ever could.Count Of The Saxon Shore 19:35, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>And again, repetitions of lies, abuse and stalking - at least here is an admission that this stalker has carried his campaign over from other web fora. <b>I did not and have not use any siockpuppets</b> - that is a lie. I do hope something can be done about this stalker. Robsteadman 19:51, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now that Robsteadman has removed the comments from his talk pages (Thanks for that), you two can try and leave each other alone, surely? Wikipedia is a big place. I suggest you simply put your differences aside, forget about each other, and move on. That's what I am attempting to do. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Darth Revert</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana"><sup>(AKA Deskana)</sup></a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">(talk)</a></small> 20:12, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If there is any justice ALL vandals and stalkers would be banned. Let's see how long before this particular stalker starts again - or will it be as another new name? Deskana, if you had been stalked by someone for a year over different net fora and involving real-life events would you be hjappy to just let it drop because they felt the heat was on them? I somehow doubt it. Robsteadman 20:15, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>.......and if he continues with the stalking I will put back the naming and ashaming on my talk page because others should be aware of this sp-called editor's behaviour. Robsteadman 20:16, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the thing is, whether or not he stalked you, if he wishes to move away from this issue and his past, and edit on Wikipedia, he is welcome. The same is true of you. He certainly does not seem to be stalking you now, at least. Quite the contrary, he has expressed that he wishes to move on from this issue. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Darth Revert</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana"><sup>(AKA Deskana)</sup></a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">(talk)</a></small> 20:22, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>He has expressed this wish months ago, and yet continues, he keeps expressing it.... what sort fo behaviour is that? Ummm... let me think! If he wanted to move on he would - as it is he doesn't and hasn't. Actrion should be taken - stalkers should NEVER be welcomed on WP or anywhere else.</p>
<p>The heat is on me? Just how, robert? This silly RfC is likely to backfire big time. Could you please stop referring to me as a 'stalker'. I am not a stalker in any sense of the word. If I was a stalker, then surely I'd be following you around. I happen to have edited on 2 sites which you have also edited, big deal. I edited an article about you because It was misleading. You have not undone any of those edits. Your article, as it stands, owes a lot to my contributions. I have had nothing to do with you on any forum for months - is that the action of a mentally unbalanced stalker? You seem far more interested in me than I am with you.Count Of The Saxon Shore 20:24, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Robsteadman, you are not letting him move on by repeatedly commenting about how he is a stalker on your user talk page. It is difficult to move on if someone keeps repeatedly calling you a stalker. If you let him move on, he might well do it. You need to try, otherwise you'll get caught in a deadlock constantly blaming each other for blaming each other (for blaming each other for blaming each other....). Count of the Saxon Shore cannot be blocked simply because you insist he is stalking you. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Darth Revert</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana"><sup>(AKA Deskana)</sup></a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">(talk)</a></small> 20:31, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I should point out - I am the one that started the delete process, by tagging the page for speedy deletion as <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_nonsense.html" title="Patent nonsense">patent nonsense</a> (which it was not, I realize, after reading the article.) No one had directed me to it - I linked from a user page I was on, and it happened to be one of the first articles I came to that I thought was un-encyclopedic after I learned about AfD's. My speedy delete tag was removed, and changed to an AfD - but NOT by <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">User:Musical Linguist</a>. When I went to vote on the article, I struck out some abusive text by <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.156.102.142.html" title="User:71.156.102.142">User:71.156.102.142</a>, not realizing he was the banned Andrew Morrow; and was hit with abusive comments on my <a href="../../../d/o/n/User_talk%7EDonaNobisPacem_d01f.html" title="User talk:DonaNobisPacem">user talk page</a> (I have since removed them - you can see them in the history, some negative comments at the AfD for Licking, and then further comments on my talk page by the same user using IP <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.141.19.94.html" title="User:71.141.19.94">User:71.141.19.94</a> (the same IP used to start this section). I had no personal vendetta when I started the delete process - I have periodically come across articles I think drastically lower the educational/professional standards of Wikipedia, and learned about AfD's in order to nominate them - this was one such article I came across shortly after learning about it. The attacks on Musical Linguist are, as near as I can see, totally unwarranted, as a number of other editors (myself included) played the primary role in tagging the article for deletion; a process Musical Linguist had nothing to do with. She simply deleted article updates/AfD vote by a banned user, something any editor, let alone administrator, is permitted to do. Hope that helps clear up any confusion as to the origins for the AfD.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 21:05, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>User SykoByte is repeatedly adding links to his own website, in violation with the guidelines on <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. Despite the efforts made by other wikipedians to make this user understand that linking to your own website is not allowed, he continues doing so. This user consider himself and his site to be above these rules, and refuses to comply with the guidelines of Wikipedia. When his spam links are removed, he adds them again, and complain about being harassed by other wikipedians. In my opinion, blocking this user and his IP would be the most suitable solution. An administrator might be able to set him straight, though, since he - despite the efforts made by other wikipedians - doesn't seem to understand that rules apply to all who publish on Wikipedia. Articles in which this user continues to link to his own website are:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>In my opinion, this matter is way beyond a simple misunderstanding. SykoByte have been made aware of the rules and policies a number of times, but dismisses that as harassment. Now he needs to be made aware that the rules and policies are real, and meant to be followed, not bent or broken.</p>

<dd>Ok, you guys are right. I read WP:EL and I will stop adding my links to the articles. I do not want to be banned from Wikipedia.

However, I do think <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> needs to be told to stop being so rude to people on here.

<p>He was requesting to be unblocked, or his talk page unprotected so he could file an RfAr against MONGO. My first suggestion was that he email an Arbitrator; he responded that he had emailed Fred Bauder, but hadn't received a reply. (I've heard from other arbitrators that most arbs (Fred included) are very good about forwarding such requests to the ArbCom list, so it's entirely likely that they are discussing/have discussed the matter.) Rather than reversing other admin's actions, particularly in a situation where I had no idea what was going on, I told him I'd raise the issue here. (Here rather than with the individual admin, since it involves several admins.) It strikes me that with so many admins involved, it is unlikely to be a mistake, but, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> and all. I'm notifying MONGO, Gator1, and Fred of this post, so they can offer thier side of the story.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate others taking a look and offering a more rounded view of the backstory, as well as thoughts on what, if anything, to do. I'm inclined to trust the judgment of the involved admins, and leave it alone unless the Arbitration Committee sees fit to get involved. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 03:27, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The following is a (not yet complete)request for de-administratorship/disciplinary action against the user MONGO.I ask Fred to please post this on my behalf alongwith the RfAr.</p>
<p><b>Statements made by MONGO to Prasi90 which seem to be uncivil/rude/unprofessional in nature when compared to the tone in which Prasi90 communicates with MONGO.These statements show that Mr.MONGO uses his blocking powers to harass Prasi90-especially with permanent and month-long blocks.</b> Urges Prasi90 to "have fun" writing Anti-American "nonsense" outside Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Urges Prasi90 to "grow up" and "be a good scout" since "this (Wikipedia) is not a playground".Also asks Prasi90 "Want to be blocked again for disruption?" in what seems to be a threatening manner.</p>
<p>Do you have anything constructive to add to Wikipedia? I am inclined to think that you do not.--MONGO 16:25, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Are you going to write an encyclopedia or do you want me to enforce a block on you for disruption. I'm about done with your uselessness. Oh, and no question mark.--MONGO 05:36, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The above comment seems to be particularly aggressive.</p>
<p>Here,in line 173 MONGO says-"Do you want a month long block...I'll be glad to give you one",seems again to be an aggressive statement</p>
<p>This editor has contributed nothing of worth to this project and in light of the incessant trolling and harassment of several editors, the one week block is quite lenient.--MONGO 09:48, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The phrase which has been highlighted by me again seems to be judgemental and uncivil.</p>

<p>Dear admin, I would like seek your help in solving an edit dispute related to several articles about the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, such as <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Security_Council_459a.html" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Court_of_Justice_d564.html" title="International Court of Justice">International Court of Justice</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council_be1a.html" title="United Nations Economic and Social Council">United Nations Economic and Social Council</a> etc. Each of those articles contains the name of the organization / department / agency in all the six official languages of the United Nations. (The six official languages of the United Nations are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish.) But <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">User:Raul654</a> is recently, unilaterally, very actively, deleting the official names except the name in English. I asked him to seek a consensus in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUnited_Nations_Commission_on_Human_Rights_c34c.html#Alternate_names" title="Talk:United Nations Commission on Human Rights">Talk:United_Nations_Commission_on_Human_Rights#Alternate_names</a> first before he delete any information from the articles. However, it seems that he is still deleting the information from the articles. I am afraid that would invoke an edit war. I hope that you can help us to stop his deletion, and encourage all Wikipedians to discuss, ask for other people's opnion, and seek a consesus, before they delete information from the article. I sincerely want to avoid an edit war, and I hope that you could solve the dispute. Thank you. - <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanmak_22a2.html" title="User:Alanmak">Alan</a> 04:52, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since this is the English Wikipedia, we try to keep foreign names down to a bare minimun. What I suggest is that you do not add the templates, but check and see if the articles in the said languages are created at AR, ZH, FR, RU and ES Wikipedias and add interwikilinks. If that is done, then just do not add the templates again. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 04:56, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your attention. In my opinion, it is already a common practice for the articles about nations or international organizations to include the name in the non-English official languages. I don't see any points for making any exceptions for the United Nations, which is one of the most important inernational organizations. Furthermore, as I pointed out in the discuss page of one of those disputed articles, I think it is especially important to include the names of the non-English official languages in the English Wikipedia. As English is becoming a common language for international communication, or even a worldwide language, nowadays. English has the importance of being a bridge between people who speak different languages to overcome the language barrier. Unlike the Wikipedia in other languages, the English Wikipedia has a lot of contributors and readers from many different countries, which includes a lot of non-English-speaking countries. It would also be helpful for English speakers who are searching information about the United Nations, if they can see the terms in official languages all in one page, rather than guessing which word is the official name in an article written in a foreign language. (Some English articles don't even have a corresponding article in some other languages.) While the Wikipedias in a lot of other languages also include the English name of the United Nations in their respective articles, it would be fair for the English Wikipedia to include the names in those languages as well. I hope you guys could understand that.</p>
<p>But no matter what, it is very important to ask for the opinions of more Wikipedians of different origins, so that the consensus would be a widely accepted one, rather than one dominated by a small number of Americans who only speaks English. I don't appreciate the fact that some user is unilaterally deleting information from the articles without seeking a consensus. - <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanmak_22a2.html" title="User:Alanmak">Alan</a> 05:15, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>(Copied from <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUnited_Nations_Commission_on_Human_Rights_c34c.html" title="Talk:United Nations Commission on Human Rights">Talk:United Nations Commission on Human Rights</a>) There are arguments for both sides of the argument. The UN has many official languages, and thus the page should contain the translations. Raul's analogy that we should not include say, an Arabic translation on <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, is not relevant, because Arabic is not an official language in China. So there is merit in adding the translations. However, I note that there are no translations on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> page, so if we wanted something to follow, that would have to be it without the translations, although you can argue it either way really... But I think more discussion should occur before a revert war starts. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 05:46, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree that the analogy "adding the Arabic name on <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>" doesn't make any sense.</li>
<li>No one is trying to add Japanese or German to the articles about United Nation. Only the six official languages are added. I have to emphasize, again, that this has been a common practice in Wikipedia.</li>
<li>The name in all the five non-English official names of the United Nations was already put in the info box (on the right hand side of the article) long time ago. It wasn't added by me. For a long time, no one suggested that we have to delete them.</li>
<li>As I said before, I would like people to discuss and seek a consensus before deleting any information from the articles.</li>

<p>Judging by the many articles he contributed to this project, <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">User:Harisingh</a> does his best to turn Wikipedia into a Sikh prayer book. I'm afraid that such statements as "fundamentalists thrust Islam by hook or by crook... by sexual harassment and forcible abductions of the daughters of Hindus and other satanic misdeeds" are liable to bring WP into disrepute. I put the article on RfC, but nobody cared to comment. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> added some necessary tags, yet Harisingh removed them within minutes.

<p>Pro-Lick began to edit war, violated 3RR several times (generally in his effort to remove "death" from the definition of abortion), and inserted extraordinarily POV edits into the abortion article. See for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion&amp;diff=45495315&amp;oldid=45494959" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion&amp;diff=45495315&amp;oldid=45494959" rel="nofollow">this</a> (which he put in after I had said on the talk page that the word "death" doesn't imply that the fetus is human, and that I had recently taken antibiotics to kill an infection, and which is probably a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=45595426" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=45595426" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<p>It's <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">impossible to believe</a> that this isn't deliberate disruption and trolling, and it is very clear that these edits either come directly from Pro-Lick or at least through him. I don't want to have to request a new user check every 24 hours, and I'd appreciate some help in dealing with this. Perhaps some other admins could keep an eye on Pro-Lick's behaviour and edits. I feel that Annalina should be blocked, for disruption and for being either a sockpuppet or a meatpuppet of Pro-Lick, but I'm heavily involved in the article myself and have the opposite POV. I do not think that those edits could be just innocent, misguided NPOV violations, especially as some are taken verbatim from Pro-Lick's blog. Any help would be appreciated.

If somebody wants to unblock him, I will not object, but I think he deserves to remain blocked until he agrees to stop the disruption. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:37, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was very tempted to block Annalina, when I saw those edits, but was a bit uncomfortable doing so, as I edit that article and hold the opposite point of view. A more recent user check has confirmed that Curettage is definitely a Pro-Lick sockpuppet. Essjay's comments concerning Annalina were: "As for Annalina, if it smells like HS/PL it probably is, but the checkuser is inconclusive. There is, however, a vandal sock farm coming off that IP, mixed in with some legitimate editing." As far as I know, Annalina is the only editor with a known or suspected connection to Pro-Lick who is not currently blocked.</dd>

<dd>And by the way, I fully endorse Zoe's block of Pro-Lick.

<dd>I fully support blocking on sight any editors who make those edits you cited above, Ann. If Annalina makes another bad-faith edit, and I see it, a book will be thrown. Zoe's block of Pro-Lick seems to me entirely appropriate, under <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Users_who_exhaust_the_community.27s_patience" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy#Users who exhaust the community's patience</a>. I've received an email from Pro-lick asking me to review that block (as, I suspect, have many admins). I replied on his/her talk page that I'm willing to support an unblock based on a convincing show of good faith - for which I'm not holding my breath. Naturally I still wouldn't unblock without input from others, including <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a>, the blocking admin. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 21:58, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I could have held my breath. Pro-Lick and I have exchanged emails, and I'm ready to support unblocking the account, and to unblock it or reduce the block myself based on our communication. I feel that Pro-Lick has expressed an understanding that hir behavior has crossed lines, a willingness to adapt and edit more cooperatively, and a desire to help with the project, evidenced by examples of better-faith editing shortly before the block. I've notified Zoe, and I'm also posting here, so if anyone has any concerns... -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 06:48, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I will state frankly that I am not at all happy at the thought of Pro-Lick being unblocked. First of all, <a href="http://shilllicker.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://shilllicker.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">his/her blog</a> still has that part encouraging people to come to Wikipedia and change the abortion definition to things like "abortion is fertilization for flowers" and to "get three reverts" every day, etc. Before I could approve of unblocking him, I would like to see some evidence that he realizes how inappropriate it was to make those edits, and I would like him to remove that section from his blog. Has he admitted to having used sockpuppets? I don't mean the Halliburton Shill = Pro-Lick, since he was entirely free to choose a new name and under no obligation to reveal that he was the same person. I don't want him to grovel, and I realize this might sound like making humiliating demands of a prisoner of war! But is there any indication at all that he sees his past behaviour as <i>wrong</i> or is he just hoping to be unblocked so that he can game the system and see how much he can get away with?</p>
<p>However, although I want to state that I'm not happy (so that it won't later be said that it was posted here and nobody objected), I will not oppose if GTBacchus really decides to unblock. I consider him to be one of the fairest of all the admins, and I have seen him treating leniently people who oppose <i>his</i> POV, so I shouldn't complain if I think he's over lenient to someone who opposes <i>mine</i>.&#160;:-) I have avoided blocking Pro-Lick and his sockpuppets myself mainly I have strong views in complete opposition to Pro-Lick's, although I try to respect NPOV. (If it weren't for that, Annalina would <i>certainly</i> be blocked by now!) So this is just my opinion. I object to the unblocking, but I support GTBacchus's right to use his own judgment, and am positive that he'll re-block if necessary. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 20:42, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Ann. I don't expect that unblocking Pro-Lick is a move that will make everyone happy, but I'm trusting what was said in our email communication - that this user understands that it's necessary to adapt and edit differently than they have previously. I think it's been made clear to Pro-Lick that just exasperating enough Wikipedians is a perfectly bannable offense, and that our <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBlock_3ef4.html" title="WP:Block">Blocking policy</a> says as much. I'm not too concerned about admissions of sock-puppetry as I am about the user's future behavior, which I'm sure will receive plenty of administrative attention. If Pro-Lick resumes being disruptive and uncivil, and doesn't display an improved editing style, then I will certainly not oppose any admin's reblocking, and may even do it myself.</dd>
<dd>I'd like to specifically address your question, "is there any indication at all that he sees his past behaviour as <i>wrong</i> or is he just hoping to be unblocked so that he can game the system and see how much he can get away with?" I'm not prepared to share the contents of any email without the sender's consent, but I'm comfortable saying that I'm satisfied that Pro-Lick sees that the editing style employed so far has been beyond "<a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a>" and across the line into "<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" class="extiw" title="m:Don't_be_a_dick">dickish</a>". Also, Pro-Lick has indicated a willingness to adapt to the community's standards, and adopt a less combative and more cooperative editing style. If it turns out I'm being overly naïve, and letting a troll back in, then it's here for everyone to see - I'll be the one who was wrong.</dd>
<dd>I request that all of us give Pro-Lick a renewed assumption of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> now, and show the same patience and helpfulness that we would anyone who is yet unfamiliar with our customs and culture. I'm eager for Pro-Lick to see how positive an experience it can be, editing Wikipedia in a spirit of cooperation and respect, but that'll take a little bit of un-learning and re-learning, which we who are more experienced can really help with. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 21:17, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your reply, GTBacchus. I see that you have now unblocked, and I'm certainly prepared to accept that and to give him (as you requested) a renewed assumption of good faith. I agree with you that admission of sockpuppetry is of far less importance than future behaviour. I do feel, however, that he should be prepared to remove from his blog the section where he encourages people to come and vandalize Wikipedia. Someone else has already made that point on his talk page, and I fully agreed; but I felt it would be counterproductive for <i>me</i> to post a message there saying the same thing! <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 23:00, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Benjamin Gatti, who has been sanctioned by arbcom for biased, tendentious editing, was recently banned from editing <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power.html" title="Nuclear power">Nuclear power</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price-Anderson_Nuclear_Industries_Indemnity_Act_cde7.html" title="Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act">Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act</a> for disruptive behavior. He has begun to edit again, this time proposing that <a href="../../../n/u/c/Category%7ENuclear_safety_26a2.html" title="Category:Nuclear safety">Category:Nuclear safety</a> be renamed to "Nuclear danger" or "Nuclear risks" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:Nuclear_safety&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46511818" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:Nuclear_safety&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46511818" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. He also seeded the intro of <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_safety.html" title="Nuclear safety">Nuclear safety</a> with a scare phrase of dubious relevance (Nuclear safety "is a term which underscores and understates the danger implicit in the use of nuclear materials") <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nuclear_safety&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46527655" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nuclear_safety&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46527655" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>.

Both of these types of edits continue a long-established pattern of biased editing to nuclear and political topics -- for which he has been placed on probation by the arbcom <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Benjamin_Gatti#Final_decision" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Benjamin_Gatti#Final_decision" rel="nofollow">Final decision</a>. I was one of the people who brought the original case against Benjamin so I don't feel it's appropriate for me to be counted in administrators voting to enforce his probation with a block, but for goodness sake, somebody else, please consider it. This has gone on long enough. Three administrators are needed to take any blocking action, and one is needed to enforce a per-article ban. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">poll</a></small> 18:56, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> the edits are sound and well sourced. "Nuclear safety" is an oxymoron as nuclear chain reactions are an inherently volatile proposition, and it is self-evident that the subject of Nuclear-safety - is a misnomer intended to convey a subconscious POV. I propose the more accurate Nuclear-risk and somebody blows a fuse. Yale did absolutely give preferential treatment to Sayed based on his association with a human-rights abusing organization - this is well reported by the Times - or is someone suggesting with a straight face that Sayed's fourth grade education made him more qualified than thousands of other applicants? - Some of which defended this country and the principles enumerated in the Constitution at the risk of their own lives?

<p>It is an archaic word denoting shock, outrage or disgust. One should be careful not to overuse it, I find. I think Wild Man Fischer is quite a good analogy: he seems a pretty neat guy. And you have to admit, Zephram <i>is</i> pretty funny. He's got JW chasing shadows all over the show. And for all JW's studied outrage, I think Wild Man Stark's essays are worth throwing 10 cents in the hat for. Are you taking anything for your editcountitis, by the way?

<dd>Agree. Medule is nothing more than an arrogant vandal with a highly biased opinion and will stop at nothing to further his Serbian propaganda and lies. This user should be banned from Wikipedia, because he has no useful edits and only makes life harder for those who try to maintain Wikipedia as a neutral encyclopaedia. --<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg_4111.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/90/Flag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg/25px-Flag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg_4111.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 01:52, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also support some kind of action. Medule and his numerous sockpuppets have been forcing the same edits for months now, even deleting or rewriting entire paragraphs in an inflammatory manner without any discussion or collaboration whatsoever. His obsession is wasting the time of many users--including my own--and that time could be better spent on actual contributions rather than on endless reverts. --<a href="../../../a/h/r/User%7EAHrvojic_06cf.html" title="User:AHrvojic">AHrvojic</a> 04:51, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, let's see. First solitary edit Feb 11 to the User page, after which there was complete silence until today when it went on a vandalism spree involving some 20 odd pages. Ample warnings on talk page unheeded. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sormtacular_herrabism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46887523" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sormtacular_herrabism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46887523" rel="nofollow">threat</a> was placed on a mainspace talk page. It may well be a joke, but there is no way to be certain. Regardless, it's a very new account that has essentially only engaged in vandalism, so certainly a ban isn't inappropriate. I would probably use {{Indefblocked-vandalism}}, but this is minor. —<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;cursor:crosshair;"><b>Encephalon</b></span></a> 20:26, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Well, he's clearly been creating a stir judging from comments on his talk page, but I think 48 hours for saying "fuck the arbcom" is a little too harsh, especially with no warning. I would probably have just reverted the edit and warned him to calm down.

<dd>Fair enough. At the point of blocking I wasn't too sure about the situation, so I thought I better block until it got cleared up.

<li>I see he has been editing a number of contentious articles but seems to have been keeping pretty cool about it, and 48hrs may be too long for a first offense. However, the "F the Arbcom" and "Whoops my bad" edits seem to be completely out of character. Could his account have been hijacked? (forgot to log out of a shared computer?) I suggest keeping blocked until he contacts you with a more substantial explanation, and unblock sooner than 48hrs if the explanation seems reasonable. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:26, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A user who has left wikipedia after intimidation by other users asked for his user and talk pages to be removed. This has been done but <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrelke_e8a2.html" title="User:Frelke">User:Frelke</a> was discovered to have copies of the talk pages archived.

<dd>The user in question User:Robsteadman had a vicious personal attack made on his page yesterday by User:Count Of The Saxon Shore which I can't show as the page has been deleted but admin Gator1 spotted it and removed it so can confirm.

<p>Sophia, I have nothing to do with Frelke. There are a <b>lot</b> of people who like playing games. Please can you not use the term <i>intimidation</i> again - it is not helpful. I cannot aplogise any more than I have already done. I'd apl;ogize personally to Rob if he would hear me out. Mr Steadman and I rub each other up the wrong way and I over reacted - but the whole issue only came to a head yesterday evening because Mr steadman made personal attacks on his user page and taunted me. I think in this case <i>intimidation</i> is a very strong word.Count Of The Saxon Shore 23:28, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I spoke to Tim Starling about this on IRC earlier.

<dd>Oh, Tim knows a lot more about a lot more of Mediawiki than most of us, I should say.:-) Has anything been done in the direction of solving the problem, GraemeL? I hail from the fiddle, save and pray school of admins, who have a proud tradition of screwing things up very nicely indeed—with the best of intentions, mind—so I shan't be going anywhere near this.

<dd>Not as yet, Tim logged out shortly after he pointed me in the direction of the two templates. I'll have a dig into the template nesting tomorrow and see if I can work out why they're used.

<dd>The same problem occurs with every page on the Whatlinkshere of those templates. That's quite a pretty collection of pages, too. I'm minded to blank the templates, and leave them blanked until they can be fixed. It seems better to have a b0rken formatting than an unloadable hundred pages or so. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:06, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>So I fixed it the semi-inelegant way. It was <a href="../../../c/u/r/Template%7ECurrent_events_box_a919.html" title="Template:Current events box">Template:Current events box</a> that was importing the problem into <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> and <a href="../../../u/t/c/Template%7EUtc_6c5e.html" title="Template:Utc">Template:utc</a> (<i><b>note: lowercase</b></i>, the uppercase 'doppelganger' has no troubles) that was b0rking that, or more likely one of the calls it makes. So I reverted the template to pre-{{<a href="../../../u/t/c/Template%7EUtc_6c5e.html" title="Template:Utc">utc</a>}} and now the associated pages load fine. This of course does not fix the <i>other</i> articles. I wonder if we just found out when to avoid meta-templates? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:16, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

This <i>has</i> to be a meta-templates issue. Some of the calls are (I think) 4 or 5 levels deep, ultimately landing at a template that is 70kb long! -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:24, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An arbcom case against Danteferno also lodged that there was never any consensus for the rewrite tag.

Danteferno has claimed that he is the consensus, even though the only other user to support his rewrite position is a user with edits only on the Gothic Metal talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As such, Danteferno has lodged this complaint against me because i removed a tag from an article as part of a project full of users that Danteferno doesnt like, and has openly lodged complaints about before, amongst vandalisng user pages (most recently my own) and threatening any admin that will not support his claim.

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I had filed a request for CheckUser for <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiMB_79fc.html" title="User:WikiMB">WikiMB</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikiMB_7139.html" title="User talk:WikiMB">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WikiMB_4cc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/WikiMB">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski">Bormalagurski</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bormalagurski_7df3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bormalagurski">contribs</a>). After <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> initially declined the request for CheckUser, I was able to gather more evidence which I submitted on <a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html#CheckUser_and_WikiMB_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">on her talk page</a>. She reopened the request and indeed confirmed that the two users are most likely the same editor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46957985" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46957985" rel="nofollow">[154]</a>.</p>
<p>I am unsure what the next step should be. I'm no admin, but blocking of the sockpuppet seems a logical step. The puppet seems to have been created to help <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski">Bormalagurski</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bormalagurski_7df3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bormalagurski">contribs</a>) in certain edit conflicts, and perhaps on his way to an <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a>. His puppet thus made minor but worthwhile additions to the Wiki, probably to pass for a real person (which initially fooled many of us inclding Kelly Martin!). However, as far as I know, no real abuse has yet taken place. After a period of several days making small additions, the puppet has only (quasi-innocently) entered a controversial discussion (<a href="../../../k/o/s/Talk%7EKosovo_3554.html" title="Talk:Kosovo">Talk:Kosovo</a>) on April 1 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kosovo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46407951" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kosovo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46407951" rel="nofollow">[155]</a>. It seems we have nipped the abuse in the bud.</p>
<p>So the question is: now what? Would it still be appropriate to start an RFAr? In that case, I am sure <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurowikiJ_d4a2.html" title="User:EurowikiJ">User:EurowikiJ</a>, who first alerted me to this question, has more to say on the topic.</p>

<dd>What worried me the most and, in fact encouraged me to proceed with this was the fact that <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski">User:Bormalagurski</a> had attempted on several occasions to become an administrator only to fail because of his highly controversial edits and inflammatory comments he has been known to leave on other people's pages. Until April 2 I had only circumstantial evidence that there was indeed a link between <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski">User:Bormalagurski</a> and the skilful and ambitious new contributor <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiMB_79fc.html" title="User:WikiMB">User:WikiMB</a> who seemed to appear out of nowhere but, admittedly, was indeed making worthwhile contributions. While <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski">User:Bormalagurski</a> continued with his edit wars, vendettas and back-handed remarks, <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiMB_79fc.html" title="User:WikiMB">User:WikiMB</a> was the complete opposite. Not only was he kind and intent on spreading good will amongst those who previously had rejected his alter-ego, he even set an ambitious goal of reaching a thousand edits per month backing this goal with a link to edit count on his user-page. Following strange events on April 2 on his user-page which caught my attention, checkuser procedure was set in motion which eventually came with the result that <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiMB_79fc.html" title="User:WikiMB">User:WikiMB</a> was indeed <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski">User:Bormalagurski</a>‘s sockpuppet.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Given the fervent wish of <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski">User:Bormalagurski</a> to become an administrator and the damaging consequences that such status would have on pages related to former Yugoslavia as well as his attempt to achieve that goal through such an elaborate scheme such as the creation of a sock-puppet that purports to be his complete opposite, I call for his sock-puppet <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiMB_79fc.html" title="User:WikiMB">User:WikiMB</a> to be blocked.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I should have said "RfAr" This user will not respond to an RfC, as has been demonstrated by his myriad of problems. Furtermore, given how close to successful he was with a very dangerous sockpuppet, an RfC will very likely just give him <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> data so as to do it better next time. However, now that you mention it, I think that Bormalagurski has exceeded my patience with this behavior and constant POV pushing, and an RfC might be more effective at establishing whether or not the community still feels a need and/or ability to tolerate his presence. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:36, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think it's more the other way around, since he is my school friend. Also, if you look at the Kosovo edit, you will see that he tried to ease tensions, and not provoke them.

<p>Also, one of the "main evidence" for sockpuppetry is that he sent my photos to Wikipedia.

<p>I didn't have any interests in sending the photos. My main priority is to edit for Serbian Wikipedia, not this one (I have 10 times more edits on sr wiki, than en wiki). WikiMB, on the other hand, wanted to send those photos because he likes them, so I sent one and he sent the others... He is even planning to send them to the Commons website... Look, I know that this is a case of "either you believe me or you don't". It's your choice.

<dd>So, you're telling me that WikiMB submitted images under false licensing statements? Because if you're not WikiMB, then his claim to be the creator of those images (which he made when submitting those images to Wikipedia) was false. We block for that, you know. Anyway, your story doesn't hold water, and actually your recent edits have served to bolster the claim against you. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 02:59, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, Kelly, your arguments are based on not trusting me, I have provided explinations for everything, and you just accused WikiMB of false licencing statements.

He wanted to talk more, so we went online, where he has said that he is very disappointed by Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg_4111.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/90/Flag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg/25px-Flag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg_4111.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 23:50, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Bormalagurski, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> doesn't mean "ignore evidence that suggests an absence of good faith, to boot". Yes, I don't believe you're being (fully) honest with us. That's because the evidence strongly suggests that it doesn't. Perhaps you'd care to provide a fuller explanation as to why all the evidence, including (but not, by any means, limited to) evidence regarding IP address usage, strongly suggests that you and WikiMB are the same person?

<p>OK, Kelly, I never ignored any of the evidence, I explained everything quite thoroughly either on this page, or on other pages where I was accused. I am being fully honest with you guys. I am just repeating myself, and you people aren't paying attention, I said that I created the account for WikiMB, he came to my place, on my computer, he lives at the same building, and I showed him how to do some stuff, even sent his first photo, he continued the rest. I'm not sure what you are refering to, when mentioning the same usage of IP adresses, probably because he made his first edits from my computer, and we use the same internet provider (but I really don't know that much about IP addresses, so I wouldn't like to comment more about that). Also, the reason why we don't communicate over Wikipedia, and we only did that once, is because <b>we have msn messenger!</b>. Why should I waste my time here, when I can get a responce from him immediately? Also, you made no comments on my proposal to go online with me and WikiMB, which proves that you have no intent in bringing justice to this absurd accusation, but the sole purpose is to ban me for making a few mistakes at the begining of my editing at Wikipedia. I have explained everything <b>several times</b>. and you accuse me of <b>IGNORING</b> "evidence"? Everything EurowikiJ wrote above is showing he is ignoring my explinations, by repeating the stuff I already explained. I, however, am willing to expleain <b>EVERYTHING</b> (which I have already done) <b>ONE MORE TIME</b>, if you really want me to. Also, EurowikiJ, thanks for calling me intelligent, it really means a lot to me, coming from you. --<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg_4111.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/90/Flag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg/25px-Flag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro.svg_4111.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 23:21, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know, I know, I've admitted that I've been behaiving very unappropriately, and have started cooperating even with some Croatian users, like Dr.Gonzo. I have apologized to everyone I may have offended. I made a lot of mistakes, but having a sockpuppet is not one of them.

<dd>If I can make a recommendation, wait a month and be a good, productive, cooperative editor in that time. Your friend WikiMB can wait a month.

<p>I can wait, if waiting is what I have to do for justice, then let justice be done. Also, WikiMB <b>has no choice</b> but to wait, considering he has already been blocked forever... Also, I think I have shown that I have ambitions to be a good editor who cooperates with people of different opinions, and it's not fair to punish me for edits I made months ago where I called Milosevic the best guy ever, and similar stuff, I've realized a lot since then, how brainwashed I was, and I really really want another chance.

I don't think that Malagurski is right when saying that he keeps repeating himself. In fact, this whole thing has become something of a soap-opera. With every additional note, there is some new aspect as well as a new twist to the connection between him and <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiMB_79fc.html" title="User:WikiMB">User:WikiMB</a>. At first they were just a couple of school-friends who discussed Wikipedia at school. Here is, however, the latest:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I said that I created the account for WikiMB, he came to my place, on my computer, he lives at the same building, and I showed him how to do some stuff, even sent his first photo, he continued the rest. I'm not sure what you are refering to, when mentioning the same usage of IP adresses, probably because he made his first edits from my computer, and we use the same internet provider (but I really don't know that much about IP addresses, so I wouldn't like to comment more about that). Also, the reason why we don't communicate over Wikipedia, and we only did that once, is because we have msn messenger!. Why should I waste my time here, when I can get a responce from him immediately?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Well this is just marvelous. Let me, for the sake of my time, just concentrate on only one apsect of this entirely new development! Didn't <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiMB_79fc.html" title="User:WikiMB">User:WikiMB</a>, in order to account for his impressive skill, make the following statement in his first post after this whole thing had started:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It is true that I'm pretty experienced, I've read a bunch of stuff on editing Wikipedia, I didn't want to start editing and screw something up.</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:WikiMB#A_note_regarding_this_account" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:WikiMB#A_note_regarding_this_account" rel="nofollow">see here</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why on earth would then a user who had already read <i>a bunch of stuff on editing Wikipedia</i> and who demonstrates such a great skill at creating templates, uploading images, editing tables, knowing Wikipedia sythax, and has been aware from the word go of the need for an edit-count link on his page (which is already telling) etc. <b>need someone else to create a Wikipedia account for him</b>?!?</p>
<p>I am sorry, I wish I could continue but I am lacking strength. Therefore, I am against any probation. The sockpuppet's account should remain indefinitely blocked.</p>

<p>MSK was blocked for a month on March 3 by El C (who was shortening a two-month block of Raul's), and on March 8, MSK started editing as <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob%2C_just_Bob_aaa2.html" title="User:Bob, just Bob">Bob, just Bob</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBob%2C_just_Bob_30a8.html" title="User talk:Bob, just Bob">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bob%2C_just_Bob_fcd1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bob, just Bob">contribs</a>). The contributions leave no doubt that it's MSK and a check-user request has confirmed that technically it is "very likely." I've added 26 days of the month block to MSK's account and blocked Bob indefinitely, though I've told him/her if s/he'd rather edit as Bob from now on, I'll swap the blocks around.

<li>Good idea. If anything, adding just 26 days to the block for this kind of sockpuppetry is lenient. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA">Cyde&#160;Weys</font></a></b> 23:23, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>That certainly sounds reasonable.

<li>Both accounts are blocked indefinitely (MSK by Dmcdevit). A sad story this, but at this point I see no other way out.

<dd>I speedy deleted the user subpage in question, added a "deleted" template to it, and protected the page; the page was User:ROGNNTUDJUU!/User against Iraq war of aggression. The reason for this is because it was a recreation of a formerly speedied userbox, Template:User against Iraq war of aggression that had been deleted by several administrators under T1, and had been recreated by this user on successive occasions. This userfied version had been transcluded on the user's page in a similar manner to the original template, and it seemed clear the intention was for the userfied version to be used transcluded in place of the mainspace template. Wikipedia is not a soapbox for the purposes of political canvassing, nor is it a place to promote judgements on whether wars were "wars of aggression" or whether politicians should stand criminal trial. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 00:49, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We have no rule against what you're calling "censorship", ROGNNTUDJUU!, and good admins will "censor" this kind of political soapboxery every time. We do have a rule against using Wikipedia resources for non-encyclopedic, inflammatory, transcluded templates. Other editors have already advised you to stay away from political userboxes; take that advice. Wikipedia is not here for you to wave political flags around; that's what the rest of the Internet is for. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 02:04, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are all kinds of political userboxes. Singling out mine because you do not like them does not speak highly of you. I however see the point of "divisiveness". That is why it has become common to userfy boxes. Deleting those is just censorship, and there is NO rule allowing this. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7EROGNNTUDJUU%21_d10f.html" title="User:ROGNNTUDJUU!">ROGNNTUDJUU!</a> 02:18, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Try pasting the code for one directly onto your user page, instead of using it as a transcluded template. I don't think the new userbox policy has really settled down yet, but you're liable to be safer with substed code than with separate pages set up for transclusion. The theory is: if you use it as a template, then it's a template, no matter what namespace it's in. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 02:42, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The talk page for that article has several posts from SlimVirgin — seven in the last few days — so I don't see that she's reverting "without adequate discussion". She doesn't seem to have violated 3RR, either. This noticeboard isn't really meant for reporting content disputes. Why not try an article RfC?

<dd>I've looked at the article in question. SlimVirgin might have an editorial disagreement regarding the animal rights page, but she hasn't violated any policies on here. Furthermore, your claim that she has "introduced her views on Isreal" doesn't seem to be supported by the diffs; the difference between the statements "<a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> bans dissections of animals" and "The State of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, meanwhile, has banned dissections of animals" only seems to have the difference of the addition of the word "State" in it. Your claim that she has "slurred" you isn't supported by any evidence as well. From my point of view, this appears to be entirely an editing conflict, with no rules violated. I suggest you seek consensus from the other editors on the Animal Rights page about which version is the most appropriate, rather than coming here. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom127_c0b1.html" title="User:Doom127">Daniel Davis</a> 08:36, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is much more than an editing conflict. She has not properly discussed my detailed points. The slur is obvious. Why does she insist on describing Israel as "the state of Israel". What about the quotes. This is a failure to consult.

In regards to the 3RR, she hasn't violated the letter of the 3RR- if you look at the edits carefully, you'll see that she spaced out her reversions to just scratch past the rule (she waited about 10 minutes past when the 3RR deadline passed before she made her fourth revert). Israel is a nation-state, which is why it is referred to as "The State of Isreal". I see a lack of discussion on the pages, but I don't see any rules broken- I do see that she has displayed a rather disturbing lack of editing tact (considering that she is an administrator). Admins should take care to maintain both the letter AND the spirit of the law, so to speak. If she reverts again, she will have committed a 3RR violation, but at the moment she hasn't. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom127_c0b1.html" title="User:Doom127">Daniel Davis</a> 08:49, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nobody else edited between 1:33, 7:09, and 7:15. The first of those was a revert, but how could the other two be, unless she was reverting herself?

<dd>Mccready has come at this page as a newish editor (signed up in June 2005, but started editing significantly in February 2006) <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Mccready&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" class="external autonumber" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Mccready&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" rel="nofollow">[156]</a> and has made substantial changes to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">Animal rights</a> without prior discussion, though the talk page cautions it's a controversial article. He has decimated the intro, which was agreed between a number of editors a few weeks ago, and has removed the criticism from it. As for 3RR, I've reverted four times in 60 hours: April 2 at 13:34, April 3 at 21:27, April 4 at 01:33, and April 5 at 01:43. It's worth noting that Mccready has previously threatened people who revert his edits: here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chiropractic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44781067" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chiropractic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44781067" rel="nofollow">[157]</a> he threatens to report Steth for vandalism and restores this POV intro to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiropractic.html" title="Chiropractic">Chiropractic</a>: "<b>Chiropractic</b> is a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> and controversial system of health care founded by the <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crank.html" title="Crank">crank</a> <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_David_Palmer_e91f.html" title="Daniel David Palmer">Daniel David Palmer</a>." He has elsewhere threatened another user with an RfC over a standard content dispute (can't find the diff right now), and threatened me with an RfC because I reverted him, labeling his own reverts "second warning," "third warning," which I must admit has not exactly endeared him to me. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:07, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> rewrites history. I was happy to accept the consensus reached on chiropractic and not put the reglious point in the lead. It remains, by consensus, in the article. Her labelling my edits as POV is unfortunate. I give good reasons for my edits, reasons which are accepted by the majority of editors I work with. In terms of WP behaviour, it should be noted that she does not defend her actions in reverting without proper discussion, she has not provided evidence that an earlier version was agreed, she has not said which particular point in the lead she believes is essential, she has not addressed my detailed points, and she now insists on referring to an earlier edit which I was happy to delete (she does not appear to have read my agreement to this). I have found many instances where she has been rude to other users but will not post them here as that would be pointless at this stage. I simply ask, for the fourth time, that she uses the discussion page properly.</p>
<p>Yes I am a new user and I apologise for not properly understanding 3RR.

<p>The admin buttons are for removing vandalism. Genuine requests for references, notability citations should not be removed using the admin privileges. Judging from the user's attitude and rudeness, I have to say that this type of behavior is a blatant abuse of admin privileges.

<dd>Anyway, administrator rollback, while there is not full consensus that it cannot ever be used on other than vandalism, does not give a useful edit summary and thus should only be used when no edit summary is needed.

My first contact with him was the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Haldane_a1d3.html" title="Elizabeth Haldane">Elizabeth Haldane</a> page, and my first message to him was a request for asserting notability of the person, the reply to which has been referenced above. In case of the 2nd article, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Pease_137b.html" title="Michael Pease">Michael Pease</a>, I added a note in the talk page of the article regarding a question on the subject's notability. I believe reverting a request for that using admin-capabilities was not the proper way to remove the tag. I looked at the article again, and I'm yet to see any references, any comments/citations or assertions of the subject's notability. Therefore, removing a tag in such a way is a blatant abuse.</dd>

Ragib, I've already asked Dunc to take care to be more civil in the future, and I <i>will</i> enforce that with blocks if necessary.

<dd>This is *after* you asked him. Look at the diff on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Pease_137b.html" title="Michael Pease">Michael Pease</a>. Dunc hasn't bothered to even comment on a legitimate request for sources, citations and notability, and rather used *again* his admin rollback privileges to revert the tag. Looking at the history of the page, it appears that the article was created by him, which makes it even more interesting. Wasn't he, as the author of the page, supposed to supply sources when requested (as per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), rather than reverting the tag? Admins are held at higher standards, but my recent encounter with Dunc makes me wonder why he's so reluctant to even respond to a request in a civil manner, and invokes his admin privileges arbitrarily.

<dd><small>(added after edit conflict)</small> Investigating further, I note that Ragib added the tag to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Pease_137b.html" title="Michael Pease">Michael Pease</a> after the complaint he posted at WP:AN was discussed. In that regard, the complaint above does address <i>one</i> new edit. I note that while Dunc's response in the Haldane case was inappropriate, Ragib should be <i>very careful</i> to avoid giving the impression that he is now deliberately trolling Duncharris by adding notability tags to Dunc's articles. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 22:47, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, would you please tell me why Dunc's behavior regarding this is acceptable, but mine is considered trolling? Also, why is adding a legitimate tag to an article considered <i>trolling</i>? I add prod or csd or notability tags to many articles one a given day. Why is 1) incivil, personal attacks tolerated in case of an admin? The response is not "inappropriate" as you say, that's <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivil</a>, and if an ordinary user made it, perhaps a block or warning would be in effect. 2) Also, In case of an ordinary user, wouldn't you consider unexplained tag reverts an act of vandalism?</dd>
<dd>Now, would you take a look at <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Pease_137b.html" title="Michael Pease">Michael Pease</a> and tell me if I am wrong to add this tag there? Wouldn't you have done the same? Or does my previous message regarding <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Haldane_a1d3.html" title="Elizabeth Haldane">Elizabeth Haldane</a> bar me from making any edits on an article started by Dunc?

<p>I have reblocked for three months. If the vandalism continues after that expires I would recommend a block of a year.

<p>I don't know if it happens to others as well, but the recent heavy activity by robots that format articles has given me a lot of extra-work spotting vandalism in the articles I <i>watch</i> by getting extensive watchlists of modified articles that have only been slightly touched by a Bot.</p>
<p>To illustrate the problem, let me show you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leopoldo_Galtieri&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46585968" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leopoldo_Galtieri&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46585968" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> that added some nonsense, but at the same time removed the chinnese interwiki link (zh:). Hours later to this vandal edit <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYurikBot_b393.html" title="User:YurikBot">YurikBot</a> restored the interwiki link, leaving the vandalism untouched. The following day I check for the last changes, and saw tha the page has been edited by YurikBot, thus thought that there's no need to check its edits, but luckily checked it anyway.</p>
<p>Since bots produce a huge number of changes in articles that might have not been otherwise modified in months (and therefore there's no need to check them for vandalism), it might be reasonable to give Bots a special status that would later allow us to ignore their edits when requesting your our watchlist. This way watchlists would be much more compact, and we would have less work doing our everyday check.</p>
<p>Another idea would be the display in the watchlists the number of edits to that page since your last log-on, or something like that. Any ideas?

<dd>That's why I clicked "hist" rather than "diff" on the watchlist, before I wrote a program to keep track of my watchlist. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 07:13, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
