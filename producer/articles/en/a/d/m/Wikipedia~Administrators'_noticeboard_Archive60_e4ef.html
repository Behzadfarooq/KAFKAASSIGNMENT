<p>Hi all. For those of you who don't know already, <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafa_Akalp_5e6f.html" title="User:Mustafa Akalp">Mustafa Akalp</a> (<a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMustafa_Akalp_6200.html" title="User talk:Mustafa Akalp">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mustafa_Akalp_c0c9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mustafa Akalp">contribs</a>) was recently blocked for <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive142_3d35.html#RfA_vote_spamming" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive142">RfA vote spamming</a>. The block was later extended to indefinite, as there was somewhat of a consensus at WP:AN/I. Although what he did was wrong, I think it was too harsh of a punishment for a first offense. Furthermore, I doubt he will do similar things in the future. Most importantly, <i>I believe that Mustafa is a good editor</i>. He has contributed positively to numerous articles, most notably <a href="../../../i/m/b/Imbros.html" title="Imbros">Imbros</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Gumuljina_3a70.html" title="Republic of Gumuljina">Republic of Gumuljina</a>. Therefore, I am requesting that we get some sort of consensus on his unblocking. I strongly support that we give him another chance. —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></span> 18:22, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Khoi, this guy tried to gun you down by the worst way possible. Don't shoot yourself in the foot, or at least give him some time off (at least a week, like) to think it over... -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 19:08, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A quick glance appears to show that Mustafa Akalp was severely and nastily distruptive... because he didn't know that isn't how we do things. Which raises an interesting question about how far <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> goes. If we AGF, then he should be unblocked. But if we work from his record, we must assume that he will break each one of Wikipedia's rules and guidelines, in ignorance, one at a time. We don't, for some reason, tend to look at whether a person's Wikipedia behaviour would be acceptable in Real Life. In this case, I don't think it would be. But this isn't Real Life, it's Wikipedia, and thus we should AGF.</dd>
<dd>And then watch his every edit, obviously. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 19:24, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem/reason for the block is that he would persistently refuse that what he did was wrong. He sincerely believes that what he did was acceptable. I had requested someone (maybe <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a>) to explain to him why it was wrong in his own language, as his level of English probably dosn't help him understand. If Mustafa understands that what he did was wrong, and apologizes, then I (and I am sure the rest of users who consented in perma-blocking him) will agree unblocking him. <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 19:39, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Support</b> that idea. If we can talk to him in a way he will understand then there's an AGF hope. If we can't, or the result isn't good for his RL thoughts, then he must remain gone.

<p>I suggested that myself first on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>. Mustafa is IMO clearly not an (overly) radical Turkist. Heck, his first edit here was to move <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalki_%28Turkish_island%29_1d44.html" title="Chalki (Turkish island)">Chalki (Turkish island)</a> to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalki_%28Greek_island%29_7bb4.html" title="Chalki (Greek island)">Chalki (Greek island)</a> — (and he screwed badly, not realizing there are two Chalki islands, leaving double redirects all over the place). Yes, his votespamming was vitriolic; but the cure is simple—block him forever if he does that <b>again</b>. We don't block users forever for the first offense, and I think Khoikhoi's vote has more weight in this case. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 07:57, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Buy that man Duja a drink! Also, have someone explain to Mustafa <i>why</i> what he did was wrong <i>in his own language</i>! Heck, I hadn't realized it myself until recently, although what I had done was a lot more in-line (InShaneee may remember that). Please don't make me regret posting that WP:ANI incident in the first place! I never meant this guy should be permabanned. Keep in mind that you have made a Turkish user be defended by a Greek pov-pushing nationalist one!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 09:34, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I believe we should be guided in this by those who have had more contact with him. He has strong opinions and can be aggressive in putting those opinions forward, but he is not a vandal or a fanatic, and some decent explanation of why edit wars are a bad idea might put him on the right road. He has acted like a bull in china shop but he could be a valuable editor. If Khoikhoi (as the offended party) is asking for his block to be lifted and somebody is willing to explain to him how things work, I can't see any reason to object - it's not as if we won't be watching him. Indef block him on the next offense. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 10:25, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Seconded. I've had previous dealings with Mustafa and have found him generally good-willing and prepared to learn, but of course quite strongly hampered in his interactions on Wikipedia by his rather poor command of English. The task of "mentoring" him should include discussing ways in which he can find useful tasks for himself on enwiki where this is less of a handicap. Trying to enforce his idea of NPOV language on ideologically sensitive issues is not really one of them. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 14:04, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having discussed issues with Mustafa quite many times as well (and though in conflict most of those times), i also have to say that i agree with those here asking for <i>giving him a second chance</i>... Future Perfect at Sunrise is right: Mustafa edits in good will and he is willing to listen and/or to understand and to collaborate on the ground of improving articles. Personally, i am sure that if he knew that he was doing something wrong, he would never had done it. Also, have in mind that he is quite a new user, so, probably he did not know what happened in Khoikhoi's previous RfA... (the similarities with this is what i think played the major role in Mustafa's permablock). Obviously, he is gonna have this on his record, so, he much be extra careful from now on... But i think he deserves this second chance. Regards <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 00:17, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Thanks for Users and Admin-users to support my unblock.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1-As I declared before,at the first moment of my action, I was not aware of the RFA rules. I stopped my messages immadiately, as soon as I red first warning message from <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMustafa_Akalp_6200.html#Campaigning_against_User:Khoikhoi.27s_RfA" title="User talk:Mustafa Akalp">Gwernol</a>.I think, this is enough to represent my good faith.</dd>
<dd>2-My account blocked in 3 hours after first alert, to prevent the RFA any further spamming.I believe that it was not a good reason to block my account, since I stopped to send any further message.It would be more logical to wait/check if there would be any further attempt from my side. In this period no body contact with me, to explain the rules (to declare any evidence in 24 hours etc) or to ask if there is any support to my alleges etc.</dd>
<dd>3-After my account blocked,I sent some mails to some admins. These mails include only explanations of my messages to some users on RFA, not include any explanations on the evidences,hints etc. So, it is not suitable to use my mails as an evidence of accusation that I continue to blacken any body without any evidence.</dd>
<dd>4-After investigation the rules for RFA voting, I see that My attempt can be seen/accepted as spamming.(However, the rules are not so strict and there are some exceptions).</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I am declaring that, <b>I withdraw my alleges for Khoikhoi</b> with all consequences.(At this moment. I have some oppinions on this matter. I will observe any further movements and I will decide&#160;;I may transfer my allege with evidences to the proper/legal place in wikipedia or not.I think this a natural user right.)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>5-Any definite crime has a definite punishment. In my case, there was a crime:"spamming" and a punishment:"block". No body/user has a right to insult,despise me, as I saw in the some User's message here.I think, I have right to require an excuse from these users for those words.</dd>

<dd>If there is generally lots of genuine CSD tagging, then obviously lots of people have decided to tag articles (check when they were created to see if it is mainly newly-created ones being nominated). If there is lots of dodgy CSD tagging, then someone might be having fun seeing if they can get lots of articles speedy deleted. If a person, or group of person, is creating lots of new articles that are then tagged with CSD, then consider investigating further and cutting the "fire" off at its source. If someone has decided to go and tag lots of articles that have been hanging around for several days or weeks, that's not really a fire that needs fighting. It doesn't matter if it takes a few more days to clear the backlog. ie. Look at who is doing the tagging, and who is doing the creation, to see if there is a pattern that would explain a surge in CSD numbers. Equally, it could just be a backlog because someone who normally does CSD stuff is away. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 21:58, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now, in the morning (US), we're still bloated like a tick, there. I suspect that we're getting a high school computer class running amok. We should take a moment to see the IP's that created the CSD's and see if we get a pattern. We had a lot coming from a British school a while ago.

<p>Have others had recent problems with the autoblock finding tool? I received a Wikipedia e-mail from an editor inquiring about an autoblock message that was received related to a vandalism only account that I blocked on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../o/c/t/October_13.html" title="October 13">10-13</a>. The e-mail message was sent at 25 Oct 2006 02:23:28 GMT, indicating that the autoblock was blocking an entire campus. When I use the autoblock tool - either entering the blockee's name or mine as blocker, search a time span of "all", I get no autoblocks back. Checking the IP addresses contributions list, I find a number of edits since the block date, up to 23 Oct. Shouldn't I be able to find the autoblock? — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) 03:21, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That shoudn't make any difference, we only have one database so the frontend refers to the same database if run it from zedler or hemlock. What has happened though is tht through trying to reload the enwiki database dump on the toolserver we have had various database problems including some downtime. As such the script which maintains the data has been down. I've restarted it now. Just for future reference if you get a problem with the tool feel free to email me on drop me a not on my talk page. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 06:23, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could I ask that some experienced folk drop by <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerrilla_News_Network_00bf.html" title="Guerrilla News Network">Guerrilla News Network</a>, which has the potential to turn into a problem fairly quickly? Some folks have added a section to the article that is (to me) quite marginally sourced, there was a slow-moving edit war over it, and now one of the top folks at GNN has dropped in to start working on the article, adding a bunch of material that I think needs some parsing. Frankly, the whole article needs work. I've expressed some concerns on the talk page after stumbling into it from someplace else, and there's been some response, but I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to approach the numerous issues involved (and lacking in personal patience just now) - so, some added viewpoints would be much appreciated. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 18:15, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Furthermore, the user in question has repeatedly tried to insert his rather biased POV into articles, adding "rogue state and a member of the axis of evil" to the article on North Korea several times, and stating on his talk page that all Muslims (With the possible exception of a lone peacenik) are out to kill innocent people. I've defended his userpage up to now mainly because there are better ways to deal with it than the mindless edit wars that were going on it; this is the better way. Let's deal with this now.

<p>I don't know much about the systems in place at wikipedia, so I'm not sure how to handle a small problem I noticed. I was looking for some basic info on mushroom and discovered a section had been replaced with an obscene line. I think I fixed the edit, but I noticed the person had made several recent changes in a similar style. I don't want to fix all of them, because I'm afraid I'll mess something up, but if someone wants to follow him around and fix things, go to the recent history for the "mushroom" article and it's the user at IP 65.96.215.5 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Raistlin212 (<a href="../../../r/a/i/User_talk%7ERaistlin212_8d58.html" title="User talk:Raistlin212">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Raistlin212_0276.html" title="Special:Contributions/Raistlin212">contribs</a>) 22:34, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

I could go through the formal undeletion process, but I think that it would be a waste since the R&amp;D 100 is very notable. Also, other articles deleted through prod have simply been undeleted upon objection. Major corporations, NASA and the U.S. DOE national laboratories often tout how many R&amp;D 100s they get, and "R&amp;D 100" gets 245,000 Google results (if you are wondering how many are unique, remember that the "unique results test" breaks down for large results and you'll only get about 400 to 800 unique results, even for words found in millions of pages, like "rock" or "computer"). The award has been around for 44 years and is one of the top awards, if not the top, for applied science breakthroughs. I wonder if the prod log is under-watched lately (I just checked and it's a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category%7EProposed_deletion_dc1f.html" title="Category:Proposed deletion">category</a> now). -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 04:26, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I am a Wiktionary admin. I've notice an increase in impostor accounts of Wikipedia admins recently. Because rumors of "single user logon" (SUL) have been increasing lately, the "regular" Wiktionary vandals are making quite a run on well-known Wikipedia sysop names. I imagine the same is true on the other sister projects as well.</p>
<p>Wikipedia admins: please take a few minutes to create your accounts on the various sister projects. Please remember to update your own <a href="../../../m/y/p/Special%7EMypage_a77e.html" title="Special:Mypage">Special:Mypage</a> here, indicating which accounts are not impostors.</p>

<p>I've been railing against this eurocentric image for a long time. And as luck would have it, the edit warrior who originally inserted this image and claimed to have done it himself (no longer on record as having done so; the file history was changed) was, apparently, not on the up and up. The image is [[Image:Prognathism.jpg]]. I've happily expunged it from the article, but it needs to be deleted from the system. I contacted A.D.A.M., the project to which this image is attributed on the image page, about the limited, blatantly eurocentrist information on that website about prognathism -- and received the unexpected response that Wikipedia has no right to publish the image. The contact also responded that he recognized that the information, which -- like the eurocentrist version of the wikipedia article that keeps getting edit-warred back in -- is unpardonably inaccurate. Prognathism is <i>not</i> inherently a pathological condition; in fact, the <i>majority</i> of the peoples (mostly non-white) of the world have some degree of prognathism. However, the eurocentric version of the wiki article treats it, first and foremost, as an abnormal condition.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. I know all this is off-point, but I decided to make my case here one more time (since it's gotten absolutely no attention above under "Race baiting"). Someone needs to intervene to stop the blatantly eurocentrist version of the article from remaining in place. The edit warriors repeatedly have been invited to weigh in on the talk page before reverting a perfectly reasoned, balanced and accurate version -- and they repeatedly have refused to do so.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a diff for the guy at A.D.A.M.'s comments about the copyright status of the eurocentric illustration.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Prognathism.jpg&amp;diff=84101217&amp;oldid=51578882" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Prognathism.jpg&amp;diff=84101217&amp;oldid=51578882" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Someone, please delete this image permanently.

<p>Yep. But I remember distinctly that when this image was first introduced, an edit-warring Wiki editor actually took credit for creating it. I don't know if that image ended up being deleted and was eventually replaced with this one -- but if so, the earlier image was a plagiarized version of this one. (Too bad there's no record of it now.)

<p>Two things, shouldn't the copyvio versions be deleted, instead of just reverting to the last sane version? Also, note that Jimbo modified the CSD:G12 criteria, now a blatant copyvio article can be tagged with {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-copyvio_e567.html" title="Template:Db-copyvio">db-copyvio</a>}} at any time, not only in its first 48 hours. We may tag them as speedy instead of sending them to CP. Unless you want to wait for Jimbo's reply.

<dd>Precisely. This bot should be thought of as a way to detect instances where Wikipedia articles and external (non-mirror, non-clone, non-GFDL) websites have identical text. It is <b>not</b> detecting copyvios, and it is <b>not</b> detecting who did the copying. That requires a human to answer the question: <i>"Did they copy from us, or did we copy from them?"</i> That was the reason for the 48-hour limit in the first place. If that 48-hour rule is being discarded, then more care needs to be taken, especially if sections of articles are being detected, rather than whole articles. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 21:04, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Removing the plagiarism so quickly was a job well done and the admins who did it deserve a pat on the back.

<dd>Direct, verbatim copying from an uncopyrighted source is not a copyright violation. The so-called "plagiarism bot" is not interested in copyright violations, but rather in plagiarism. However, direct copying from an uncopyrighted source, where attribution is lacking or inadequate, is still plagiarism. The cure in this case is to add an attribution to the article. You have plagiarism, on the one hand, and you have copyright violations on the other hand. Many times an article, or a series of sentences within an article, is guilty of both. Other times it isn't. One reason why this concept is so difficult to grasp is that Wikipedia's policies rarely mention plagiarism, and this has left editors confused. 68.91.88.245 14:33, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good point. Copying in PD text from the 1911 Britannica is not a copyright violation, but if you fail to attribute the 1911 Britannica when you first upload it, and continue to attribute the 1911 Britannica until the text is <i>significantly</i> rewritten, then that is plagiarism. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 14:46, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All the above aside... Brandt seems to have found an effective method of locating long-standing copyright problems (along with false positives) in semi-obscure seldom edited articles. This seems like a good thing which we should examine and try to apply globally. Brandt claims to have checked 15,000 articles... which equates to about 1%. His list was focused on 'biographical info of pre 1900 individuals'... which logically is going to have a higher incidence of overlooked copyvios than more current information, but the same techniques could logically be applied to any article. How plausible would it be to build a bot to perform a scan of all articles and generate a list of suspect cases for review? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 22:55, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's imposible for it to entirely be a bot, as most results returned would be false positives that would need experienced human review to sort out. We already have <a href="../../../s/c/v/WP%7ESCV_2497.html" title="WP:SCV">WP:SCV</a> which should detect any <i>new</i> copyvios (and more help is always welcome there, we've probably identified at least 1,000 copyvios through it so far) but finding old stuff returns so many false positives from mirrors, people who've pasted articles to forums, blogs, etc. that it takes a ton of human effort to comb through the results generated by any search engine comparison results of finding copyvios. Thus far, ironically, Brandt has been the only person willing to devote that many hours to such a project. Plus, I imagine actually running 1.4 million+ probably involves a breach of Google/Yahoo/whoever's TOS somehow or other, unless you want to wait 1,400 days for the results (or whatever they cap the daily searches at). So it could be done, but there are some major obstacles to it. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 23:40, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, Brandt somehow bypassed Google's '1000 per day' cap. Between that and himself violating copyright, by displaying all of the copyvios he found, Brandt really seems to have a poor grasp of the 'ethics' he ostensibly seeks to promote.</dd>
<dd>So it seems like our best bet may be to continue doing manual spot checks of suspect seeming articles. A <b>huge</b> project, on the lines of the 'missing encyclopedia articles' concept, might be a complete 'article review'. Get the list of current articles as of now and start going through them one by one for copyvios, obvious vandalism, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> problems, et cetera. Would take a long time... and likely need to be repeated periodically, but it is probably the direction we should be heading with the whole 'quality over quantity' change in focus. When stable versions are implemented (assuming they are along the lines of what has been discussed at the German Wikipedia) a project like this would be good for cleaning up all of our older articles to have a 'non vandalized version'. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:40, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>My idiot friends decided to add their phone number to the article in the title, and the Administration there found out. While the page has been reverted, the principal is still concerned that people will look at the history and find the person's phone number.

<p>I'll leave it to others to make their own judgments about whether the guy's a racist or not. I certainly have my own opinion on that. &#160;:p He certainly seems to be trying to provoke -- but he hasn't succeeded. The text he's proposed inserting into the article is outrageous on its face -- as is his "rationale." It doesn't <i>begin</i> to pass muster -- which is probably why he hasn't inserted it, despite the urging of another editor. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 18:00, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There have been some strange going-ons at the voting for the article "Trentino-South Tyrol" during the voting procedure.

<dd>Some quick background on this - Vargwilku already stated how he is a coworker of mine that accesses Wiki via my network connection. And Gryffindor and I have 'buried the hatchet' (per se) in allowing <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">User:Lar</a> to mediate the process that is ongoing with "Trentino-South Tyrol". I have not interfered one iota with you since this mediation began, Gryffindor. So you are bordering on wikistalking me in pursuing this (seeing that this entry is dated <b>today</b>). The final verdict of naming convention will be decided through the correct, consensus process with mediation by Lars. Please don't utilize any feelings of misgiving against me to cause you to continue to pursue things with me. As you can see by my contributions, I have been busy at work with various other projects and not taken the time to focus on you (as I see you have done to me). So if you would please mind doing the same and we can make positive contributing efforts, rather than waste time on administrators' noticeboards. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 21:06, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not an accusation of wiki-stalking, this is real. If you look at Gryffndor's pursuit of me, on my talk page I added an Archive. Gryffndor failed to notice this and accused me even more of removing things, when they were, in fact, on my archive page as is permittable by Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 15:07, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, how is this getting in the last word when the announcement is in AN/I as well as here, on talk pages as well as here, etc., and I only thought to try to head off further discussion on AN, where the actual firestorm that brought the case occurred. I felt that this particular case closing summary needed more detail for the AN folks who might still have raw nerves on the situation. I foolishly thought more of them would be on the "anti" side than the "pro" side, but your response shows that I was wrong. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:56, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Open letter</p>
<p>Evv, Deiz, Calton and Luna Santin I really appreciate the help and support that you were doing lately on my articles but honestly there is no need for that. I would like to advise you people to take care for articles like Ratko Mladić, Mr. Slobodan Milosevic and others like them and help the general readers know the truth about their miserable massacres that they did to kids and insistent people in Bosnia and Kosovo .</p>
<p>There is not just Mr. Abazi’s article that has been vandalized by you but all the Kosovo famous and honorable people including the history of Kosovo. It has been so clear that all the editing that you people have done about that Country is just to make a bad propaganda now that finally Serbia will lose for ever Kosovo in its final status which for sure would be Independent country as it disserves.</p>
<p>I understand your feeling because you are grown in the communism system where everything was leaded by the dictator and you were their kids doing the same they did with people from Kosovo. Even now through the internet you wana talk about us believing in your fathers lies that Kosovo is yours. 7 is the century that we accepted you in that region to work, clean for us and 7 [2007] is gona be the number that you gona say Goodbye for ever to Kosovo. Listen people Wikipedia is free and you can create any network to put adds and protected your fake ideas but please put ones your finger in your head and ask your self how can this be yours when there was never more than 10% shkije - serbs in there And what right do you have to talk about it when you may have never been there and when the whole world knows that Kosova/o is not Slavic place . Tell your fathers that All the churches and abbeys where owned by chthonic Albanians before 1200 and Vatican has the property papers for that. Accept the truth.</p>
<p>For the end. There wouldn’t be any other respond on this desiccation page or any other like this from me. I just needed to tell you this. You can take it off if you feel like some none Balkan people will read this little truth.</p>
<p>You do what you can to lie and I do what I can to tell the truth with my articles.</p>

<p>I am requesting a copy of the last version of the article on Andy Stephenson including the links, or even better, access to the article's history, if that's possible. There have been some mentions of him since the article was deleted, and the HBO documentary '"Hacking Democracy" which prominently featuring Mr. Stephenson debuts Nov. 2. This new info should be enough so that the subject of the article will pass the notability requirements of even the most stringent of editors. I will work on it on my user space.</p>

<dd>The claim that the documentary "prominently features" him was addressed on the DRV and rejected as there is no evidence of such a fact.

<dd>The Andy Stephenson page was created (by me) to relocate ongoing edit wars about him at the 'Free Republic', 'Democratic Underground', 'Conservative Underground', and a few other pages to one location. Some time after that the article apparently lost all reference to the bit that made it most notable... specifically the widespread claim for months that Stephenson wasn't really dead. Stephenson's life was certainly only borderline notable, but the massive controversy and ongoing (more than a year later) internet-war over his death have spawned numerous articles and thousands of discussions which make the 'non-notable' claim seem exceedingly odd. He is vastly more notable than Daniel Brandt for instance. In any case I suspect this page will be back eventually, or you will just see it bleeding into the pages of all of the involved sites again. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:04, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>( Has this already been discussed? ) I came across a serial spammer (reported on AIV — <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.223.66.152_18c4.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.223.66.152">63.223.66.152</a>) who was putting in links on truck and car related sites. The editor also put in a few links with the domain wikipediia.info. At first glance, it seems to be a Wikipedia link, until you note the serial double "i". It seems to be a similiar site or redirect for the same sites that were used in the commercial spam ... many ending with sm.html. At least for my connection, the pages didn't come up, but, the same frown-faced icon appeared. Does anyone have any experience with this site?</p>

<p>Hi, I'm not sure that this is the place to ask for this, if not please direct me to the proper place.

<p>I have just tagged a very large number of judo-related images with a disputed fair use tag. Unfortunately if I had realized at the <i>start</i> what a bulk operation it would be, I might have gone about it differently, but I kept finding more (with Google) and was already well into the task when I finally found others <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Kyuzo_Mifune" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Kyuzo_Mifune" rel="nofollow">here</a> and saw how many there were. If I'd have known, I might have created a temporary template/category to group all these disputes together. So sorry that you don't have that. I don't know what now happens about actually discussing deleting them, whether they all need to be taken to <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a>. I'll leave them now entirely in the hands of you more knowledgeable people. But what does seem very clear to me from the examples of what is and isn't allowed under fair use (at <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>) is that using these images in articles about things <i>contained</i> in the film rather than the film itself doesn't count as fair use. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbitrary_username_eb13.html" title="User:Arbitrary username">Arbitrary username</a> 20:28, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If they stay tagged and there's no discussion, then sooner or later, FairuseBot is going to remove them from any articles they're in, and FritzBot or Roomba will then tag them for deletion as orphaned fairuse. This takes about a month to get the images deleted, but also usually generates the least amount of fuss. To get images deleted faster, tag them as {{<a href="../../../r/e/p/Template%7EReplaceable_fair_use_fbaf.html" title="Template:Replaceable fair use">Replaceable fair use</a>}}, or if the violation is blatent enough, {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-copyvio_e567.html" title="Template:Db-copyvio">db-copyvio</a>}}. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 06:15, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the info. Frankly I <i>do</i> think that it is blatant enough to warrant {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-copyvio_e567.html" title="Template:Db-copyvio">db-copyvio</a>}}, but as I say, I'm leaving them for others to deal with now, as I'm certainly not going through them all re-tagging them. I really don't see the point in creating unnecessary work for ourselves, as the speedy deletion templates are presumably only ultimately for the purpose of drawing them to the attention to administrators anyway, which I've now done by posting this message here. If an administrator agrees with me that they no way qualify for fair use as described in our policy on the matter, and is prepared to take responsibility for speedy-deleting them, then he/she is presumably able to do that without anyone having to go through retagging them all. Now that I've tagged them already, they are in fact very easily found just by looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Arbitrary_username&amp;namespace=6" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Arbitrary_username&amp;namespace=6" rel="nofollow">my contributions in the Image namespace</a>: they all start "Image:Ej km" and there's not much else in there.

<p>Saber's Beads article appears to be created by someone who claims to have discovered a "new" lunar phenomenon. I've asked for sources, but none were provided and the citation templates on the page were removed. I think it meets <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> A7 criteria, but I'd like someone else to take a look. It certainly seems like a neologism since if this effect is real, it probably has another name, because lunar observation has been going on for centuries. Primary sources for the article are the creators personal Geocities web page. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 22:55, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not an A7, as it's about a scientific phenomenon, not a person or group of persons or a website. I'd suggest AfD; a Geocities page is not, in the great majority of cases, a reliable source. Stuff like this is what <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> was invented for, and if he can't produce a significantly better source then AfD will take a dim view.

<dd>It doesn't seem as clear-cut as I first thought when I looked at it. The phenomenon is real and distinct from <a href="../../../b/a/i/Baily%27s_beads.html" title="Baily's beads">Baily's beads</a>, and it's just obscure enough (pun not intended) that I wouldn't be completely surprised if it didn't have an established name yet. Nor is the name a pure vanity case; it was coined on a discussion board, but <i>not</i> by its namesake, and there's some evidence that it's spread. Indeed, it may be riding on the crescent-spotting meme that seems to be popular in some amateur astronomy circles, in which case it may be spreading quite fast.

<p>yes that was what i was reffering to. it does not apply to any of the categories mentioned. its not spam. its just a server that hosts several of my sites that, like i said before, contain unique content that expands the articles - once an article was even deleted because it stole ("copied") content from one of my sites. and like i said before, the admin i complain about ONLY removed to my sites, NOT to other ones (of which some are unimportant indeed). --<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho-am-i_7845.html" title="User:Who-am-i">who-am-i</a> 23:26, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just for the record, for those who are not familiar with the case: "Winona" is a formerly productive contributor who has withdrewn from actual editing for several months now and seems to have been only trolling, and there has been strong indication of his/her account being used by several people - that's what makes all those now deleted pages so confusing, they are constantly talking to each other or themselves, or talking about themselves in the 3rd person, etc. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 13:01, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Having reviewed all the deleted sections I am convinced that a group of people have been using the page and possibly Wikipedia as an experiment of some sort.

<p>No, he wasn't trying to con me—it was actually I who asked Tony about him being unblocked. I guess there isn't much hope in that anymore... The reason why I suggested it was that, as Fut.Perf. said: Winona was formerly a productive contributor, and I was hoping that by unblocking him he would go back to encyclopedia-building. He wasn't really given much of a chance, though. I don't think that he would start making death threats again (the reason he was blocked in the first place). <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 23:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And the only death threat that she/he/they made was in an edit summary on User talk:Winona Gone Shopping. The threat consisted of a dare: out of nowhere, it stated that it could kill anyone who permanently banned it. There was no prior talk of banning the user. As the user explained later, it issued this challenge because it wanted to get itself blocked ASAP, and it used this ruse. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a> decided to indulge its/their game, and he indefinitely blocked the user.

<dd>The non-specific death threat was a ploy. I don't think it called for an indefinite block. And if the User were to be unblocked I'm pretty sure it would have no use for any more threats because it would not want to get itself banned again. 69.228.52.2 01:10, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello? I don't want to be accused of writing a blog (if I'm writing a blog here, then so are the editors above) but I can explain more. It seems like the entire dare shows how stupid some processes are. After all, the "threat" would have been meaningless unless someone came along and indefinitely blocked it. And besides that threat and one other offensive edit summary, there was nothing in its activity that called for any type of block. Basically, the affair was silly and it called for some months of banning at most (a disruptive game, more than a threat), and those months (since July) were served. 69.228.52.2 01:31, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I don't think the prank that this user pulled called for an indefinite ban. If the user is unbanned, what will it do? Blow up Wikipedia? Probably it won't even edit much, if at all. Obviously, a preemptive threat is a threat in most contexts ("If you take my car, I will kill you John", or "I will kill the diplomat if he comes to my town"), but when somebody just comes out of nowhere, when there is no talk at all of a block, and says that it will kill whoever permanently blocks it, then someone comes and blocks it, that affair is obviously stupid on both sides. 69.228.52.2 01:46, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(to RadioKirk) Yes, but if we give users like <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreekWarrior_b736.html" title="User:GreekWarrior">GreekWarrior</a> (whose contributions <i>mostly</i> consisted of threats and trolling) <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_GreekWarrior_6f60.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/GreekWarrior">second chances</a>, I think we should apply the same rules towards Winona. Alright, I agree that Wikipedia is not a blog, but indef blocking for a single threat doens't seem right to me. All that would've been necessary is to give the user a stern warning, and tell him/her not to use Wikipedia inappropriately.

<p>With the explosive growth of YouTube in the past year I’ve noticed an increasing trend. Many people are linking to YouTube as a source. In <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Doolittle_12ec.html" title="John Doolittle">John Doolittle</a> someone added a link to a debate that Doolittle was part of.</p>
<p>My initial reaction was that YouTube, due to it’s very nature, made a very suspect source. <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> has a few things to say about linking to “A page that violates the copyrights of others...“ (does reproducing an entire program in sixteen 10 min segments count as fair use?). But beyond that, YouTube is basically a free host with anonymous uploads and only rudimentary control over its content and no fact checking. I could easily see a situation where someone would upload modified videos for the express purpose of supporting bias material here.</p>
<p>We probably have 1000s of links to YouTube at this point… perhaps it’s time to blacklist it? I think it would be a very rare situation where YouTube would be acceptable… Can we whitelist for a particular article?

<p>IMO YouTube does have some valid use, such as linking up to game trailers. External links only though. If YouTube is notable, newspaper articles should have already covered it.

It takes very little effort to modify a video clip, change words, spoof it, etc. Only very little useful content (for WP, I mean) is uploaded by news organizations as NBC, as well as some studios that have arrangements with YouTube. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 23:34, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fair enough. I'm sufficiantly convinced there are deffinatly some good uses for it, but theres still a problem with how it's being abused. Frankly, YouTube gets more hits daily then almost any print mag has subscriptions. We must look at YouTube as generaly having the same reliabibilty as a personal website on geocities. The only cases it can be trusted is when the uploader is verifiably known. (for instance, a band who creates a profile, uploads some of there own music videos and links to it from there own website.) 00:34, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would say that linking to it is mostly going to be bogus ("see LordViperScorpions pwned video dude!"), but linking as a source can be good/bad. It's reliable in that you can say, "This is where this information came from," but because YouTube allows mash ups and does not check on the integrity of primary documents, it's not assured in any way that even the video of the speech of the congressman is whole. On the other hand, when people want to pull down their video documents quickly, YouTube and Smoking Gun are going to be the only places they can be found. I.e. it can be a legitimate source, but it can't be reliable by itself nor unreliable by itself. It's a wharehouse. Some things in there are spurious, some not. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:41, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The point is, YouTube is, simply, <i>not</i> a source. <a href="../../../y/o/u/Template%7EYouTube_788c.html" title="Template:YouTube">Template:YouTube</a> should be deleted - there's no need for something like that at all, unless we want to make templates that let you search for a particular topic in lots of places, which, frankly, people can do themselves. The question of whether individual YouTube videos can be sources is a different matter. I think they should be viewed with skepticism, and if anyone makes the claim that a piece of video found on YouTube is not authentic, I don't see how that claim can be rebuffed easily. Even if the video is constant video of the president speaking, it could be spliced together to distort things. We should absolutely not be linking to YouTube copyright violations: people post lots and lots of, for instance, <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a> clips, and we should <i>never</i> link to that to help people download copyrighted content for free. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:54, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most of us in this discussion are word-oriented - that's what encyclopedias have historically been, with a few pictures. The world is changing. With inexpensive camcorders and YouTube, it's going to be trivial to (say) do a 15-minute mini-documentary on a historical building and upload it, or even combine a bunch of videos from a bunch of sources of an event. Would such videos meet the current <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> criteria? Probably not. Would they be useful? In many cases, thousands of words wouldn't approach the usefulness of a video.

<dd>So the issue, it seems to me, is how to take advantage of YouTube and what will certainly be a world getting constantly richer in video resources, without encouraging a massive violation of copyright law or linking to videos which are less than useful (fraudulent, commericial links, etc.) With all due respect, I don't think that's something that a randomly selected group of editors (that's us, here on this page) can solve. I'm not arguing against a temporary solution (although I don't see much of an <i>urgent</i> problem), but it seems to me that this is something that should be given a bit of upper-level, more structured consideration. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 13:33, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't get this "the world is changing" argument; YouTube is Geocities with video. A YouTube video not a reliable source even when someone is posting clearly unaltered content that is itself from a reliable source any more than a Geocities site that copies and pastes from the Times is a reliable source. The vast, vast majority of the time YouTube is either going to be dubious self-published content (and thus not much of a reliable source) or a somewhat useful external link when it isn't copyvio. All of the examples about "documentaries" don't explain why those documentaries or diaries or other <i>self-published</i> content meet any sorts of reasonable standards for reliability; they're just some thing some guy posted on the internet, just in a different medium.</p>
<p>YouTube isn't a source. It's a medium. Whenever considering a YouTube video, you need to consider <i>whoever posted it</i> as the source; if the answer is "just some guy," then it's not a source.</p>
<p>That said, there are lots of good reasons not to blacklist YouTube; it can make for useful external links occasionally, and there is the rare exception of YouTube video that is itself published on YouTube by a reliable source. (To abuse my analogy from above, if the Times' online edition was on Geocities, it'd be a reliable source despite the general uselessness of other Geocities sites, for obvious reasons.) - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:00, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

The world is changing, and yet we are at the vanguard people say, as we are one of the instruments of that change at Wikipedia -- the site that made YouTube seem viable, the site that argued that a hundred monkeys with a hundred typewriters could tell the truth straight off the bat. That said, Wikipedia is forever saying, "We are not definitive. We are not the last word. We do not promise to be correct." YouTube should be understood as a mix of us and Geocities, as AMB says. It is not a source, but rather a location. On it will be useful documents of ongoing news events, much teen moaning, more moaning, much mooning, some "humor," and all of the copyright violations a person could wish. Also, though, is a corporate structure that wishes to cooperate with other commercial ventures, and so some things will be <i>hosted</i> there that are "authentic" (e.g. NBC deciding to hop in bed with YouTube and snuggle up). Authentic is not definitive. In general, YouTube is a place, not a document. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:14, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi admins--I heard a news report last night about a thing called "Google bombing" where political activists have organized plans to flood the searchable web with their particular points of view right before the election. Youtube would be one way to accomplish this. I imagine yall are already on top of the need to freeze certain political pages but thought the concept of Google bombing was worth bringing up in case there are any extra measures you can take, given that Wiki is open and anyone can edit it. Thanks for all the good works yall do.<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarborsparrow_113b.html" title="User:Harborsparrow">Harborsparrow</a> 14:41, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I had no idea this was back up at DRV, and it shouldn't be. As I've noted there, the existence of Notable YouTube memes played no part in my original decision, was never cited as such, and therefore there is no basis to reconsider the decision. I did suggest after the deletion that Notable YouTube memes was an alternative possibility for a redirect, but never a reason to delete the page. That this has been described as an "emergency", and that no-one pointed out to me this process was happening (we don't all monitor DRV, I happened across this by total chance) leaves me a little stunned.

<p>IPs should not be indef-blocked anyway. For most persons, they simply need to disconnect their modem and reconnect to get a new IP address.

<dd>Well, I hate to be picky (but this wouldn't be Wikipedia if <i>someone</i> wasn't) but there are two legal flaws and an ethos problem with this.</dd>
<dd>First, whilst I don't speak for the Wikimedia Foundation, I'm sure they'd like the operators of the site to cease and desist from using a copyrighted service mark of theirs for a service they are not providing and do not endorse.</dd>
<dd>Second, I'd be sure that Google feels the same about the derivative version of their trademarked logo.</dd>
<dd>Third, the spirit of Wikipedia and the GFDL aren't exactly being met with the prominent copyright message. In what way is it copyright? Google technology + Wikipedia content =/= any claim for copyright control. And besides, many of us are here because we don't like such claims of copyright and want to set information free.</dd>
<dd>On that basis, I think I'll keep using the direct <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;as_sitesearch=en.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;as_sitesearch=en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">site search method</a>.

<dd>I only brought it up here because I wasn't familiar with the rules concerning that. I know it's not vandalism, but I didn't know what it classified as. I just thought it'd be easier if an admin looked at it. Personally, I don't care either way, but I thought it might have violated something.

<p>I would like this to be revied because I believe it was incorrectly removed from WIKI. It is not a promotional tool used by this band, but information on the band. In the DFW area the band is know and this was a serious article for WIKI. The phrasing of the opening sentence will be worded as it is the offical bio for Valentino. It is also used in promotional items used by the band, this is why the article seems like an advertisement. The article wording will be changed to reflect information. This article never has and never will be used as an advertising tool but rather an informative way to learn more about the band "Valentino"</p>

<p>This was discussed, at length, at the <a href="../../../p/c/p/WP%7EPCP_c57f.html" title="WP:PCP">Pokémon Wikproject</a>. (It turned out the only points of contention were whether to use images or not and whether to keep a handful of episodes important to the anime, and these points have been resolved.) The AFD was brought in the middle of the ongoing merges, and I even asked Luna to close the AFD (which was clearly no consensus) so the agreed-upon merges could continue. It's sort of unfortunate that an anon merged many of them poorly and without referencing the project very effectively in edit summaries, but the fact remains that there really is a consensus to merge. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 18:59, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the problem here is the forging of <i>comments</i> and not so much of awards. While it is sleazy and dishonest to give oneself barnstars, it's a more serious problem to attribute the associated comments with users who didn't actually make them.

<dd>I would have suggested a few days for the incivility, plus a strong warning from an admin to immediately delete and not to restore the plagiarized barnstars. Three months is a long time in Wiki-time. Having said that, I'm not shedding any tears for this ill-mannered, uncivil user.

<dd>I think 3 months is quite severe. I was one of the users that had my words falsely atributed to his actions. Yet in my case no retaliation was given for there removal. Because of this I think the user might be reasoned with. Considering that the vandalism (pertaining to the userboxes) was <u>generally</u> contained to his/her own userpage. I would say that 3 months should only be used if a shorter block did not work. Such a long block should only be used for worse case scenarios. Knowing that he/she is on notice might help. Also I believe that only the forged Barn Stars should be removed and not the UserBox, I don't see them as causing any harm. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 21:34, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did know about this. This action is the main reason I believe the user should be blocked. It was rude and uncalled for. Yet I do not believe that it should be for 3 months. The main problems were on the user page and the refusal to remove them. I think that a shorter period would be more apt. A users own page is unique inside of wikipedia. The user did take those liberties a bit far, but he/she might have been under the impression that it was ok. I would think that 7 days might be more appropriate as a max. If the user does not take the warnings seriously then the 3 month ban would be justified. Asside from all this, how about re-introducting content that is ok like the userboxes? -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 22:02, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>At a minimum the block should be for one month. Seven days is just a wikibreak. Let the user <i>know</i> what it means to lose editing privileges.

<dd>Well this one is a bit difference only because the forged info was on the users own page. The user should have known better especialy when people removed them. I would say that the Ban should be for the vandalizing of your page and a warning for the content inapropriatly added. Another user suggested 4 weeks when I suggested only 1. Either one I think would be better than the 3 months the user currently has. This user might eventually be completely blocked, but I like to give users a chance. Who knows it might change the users perspective on others in wikipedia if someone tries to help out in this situation. I am also going to return the userboxes removed unless there are any objections. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 03:42, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Please also see <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html#Kann_adfu_cker.C2.A0.28talk.C2.A0.C2.B7.C2.A0contribs.29" title="WP:ANI">this</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html#Sarvagnya.3DGnanapiti" title="WP:ANI">this</a> - two related posts on ANI. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 19:58, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I wonder why sarvagnya is not blocked when arya and his sockpuppet were blocked. sarvagnya is bullying and harrasing me and using his socks for concession of 3RR rule.See his some action at <a href="../../../b/e/l/Talk%7EBelgaum_f0a0.html" title="Talk:Belgaum">Talk:Belgaum</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Talk%7EBelgaum_border_dispute_f27f.html" title="Talk:Belgaum border dispute">talk:Belgaum_border_dispute</a>.

<dd>If Redvers thinks that my RfC was frivolous, I am prepared to apologise to him unconditionally. But I can assure to everybody here that I and Gnanapiti are not sockpuppets. I request a recheck and I am sure results will be different. If there is <b>anything at all</b> that I can do to prove that Gnanapiti is not my sockpuppet, I am prepared to do that. Please do not take any hasty decisions. Gnanapiti may have shared my views on certain subjects, but surely that doesnt mean he is my sockpuppet. Two different individuals can certainly share the same views - Arya and Mahawiki are themselves examples of this.</dd>

<dd>Depends, idealy you may want to give them an hour or so to make sure they have read the message and gotten a chance to either make a fair use claim or pick a better license (people seem to often tag self made material as "permission to use on Wikipedia", wich is unfortunate, if it looks self made I sometimes change the tag to "no license" and drop them a note to make sure they have a chance to fix it). Also if the image is <i>obviously</i> fair use (like a logo or albumcover) you may want to just fix the tagging rater than delete too. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 11:27, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

Unfortunately, he has been around a <i>long</i> time now and a lot of people -- myself included -- have spent a lot of time trying to guide him toward an understanding of what Wikipedia is, and what it isn't. With no noticeable results that I can tell. The majority of his talk-page edits are irrelevant to an encyclopedia, often just general topic discussion. The vast majority of his article edits are downright harmful -- very often involving the addition of (frequently malformed) external links to unreliable, commercial, and just plain bad paranormal sites. That said, he edits in perfect good-faith, I believe: he just doesn't understand Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I believe this case is too obvious and straightforward to take up ArbCom's time with. A brief look at his contributions (pretty much any of them) should be enough to convince any reasonable observer that the following restrictions are reasonable in his case. I propose:</p>
<ol>
<li>Martial Law is banned from adding any external links to articles for a period of one year.</li>
<li>Martial Law is placed on talk-page probation: any administrator may ban him for up to a year from any talk page he disruptively edits, or repeatedly edits in a non-constructive manner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ban violations may be met with short blocks of up to a week. All talk-page bans to be logged at User:Martial Law/Talk page bans.</p>

<dd>I agree; he is very earnest, friendly, and has utterly the best of intentions. I would <i>not</i> support a ban for talk page edits; however a moratorium on link adding would meet with my full support. Perhaps an editor with the time could <i>officially</i>, as opposed to <i>unofficially</i> mentor him? I agree, BoG and many others have given advice, and good advice, on how to benefit rather than disrupt Wikipedia; but it was not followed, perhaps because it was not <i>official</i> adivice. Were he to be told he had an official mentor, that might give added weight to any constructive criticism received.

<dd>If you'd prefer to couch it in slightly different terms to make it more palatable from a semantics standpoint, you're welcome to. As admins, we regularly intervene where editors – even good-faith ones – engage in behaviour that's detrimental to the encyclopedia or disruptive to our work. Where polite requests, patient guidance, and thorough instruction fail to ameliorate an editor's particular difficulties, there has to come a point where we say "enough". Eventually, we say, "I know you mean well and have the best interests of Wikipedia at heart, but these specific aspects of your work are disruptive, and you're going to have to stop doing them. We'd rather not have to, but if necessary we'll block you to make that point clear."</dd>
<dd>I strongly suspect that if Martial Law were to add a constructive, useful, beneficial, on-point external link to an article, nobody would get upset or block him—unfotunately Martial Law apparently hasn't acculturated to the point where he is capable of making that judgement for himself. (Suggesting an external link on an article talk page might be an appropriate compromise.) Anyway, I suppose my point is that we regularly impose such prohibitions on editors with even less process than presented here. This discussion represents – or ought to represent – a middle ground of process somewhere between the summary judgement of a single admin in a clear-cut case of abuse, and the long, drawn-out, kill-a-mosquito-with-a-cannon route of Arbitration. For the sake of completeness, I note that the ArbCom is obviously entitled to review the situation and its handling, and to revise any remedies we impose here—as well as to sanction any admins who might start a reign of terror while drunk on the awesome power of blocking disruptive editors after extensive warning and this long discussion.... <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 16:51, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the wise input, Ten. I totally agree with what you say, except for the matter of having Martial Law suggest external links on an article talk page instead of adding them directly. It <i>sounds</i> good, but the terrain is a surprisingly poor fit for your map in this case. ML does do exactly that on <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a>—I don't know if somebody at some point told him he should, or why he does it there in particular—and it wastes much more time for other editors that way. He suggests <i>lots</i> of links, indiscrimate ones—possibly he's going through the google hitlist for Bigfoot and suggesting them in bursts of five or so. Need I mention that the google hitlist for Bigfoot is a horror story? I thought not. My point is that explaining to ML on the talkpage what's wrong with the links is a lot more trouble than just reverting the far fewer links he will add directly to an article. It may sound cynical to say so, as it's obviously a good thing to keep inappropriate material out of articles, where readers will see it—but he seems to take the talkpage business as more of a carte blanche for proposing any amount of stuff.&#160;:-( And that's why I do believe that a moratorium on link addition needs to be supplemented by talkpage probation, just as a good fork needs at least two prongs. Please note that Bunchofgrapes is by no means suggesting "a ban for talkpage edits" as the puppy put it, but only the possibility for admins to page-ban ML <a href="../../../i/f/f/Iff.html" title="Iff">iff</a> he persistently disrupts a page—is it possible that puppy thought a more draconian measure was being proposed? Anyway, her eagerness to act as a mentor for Martial Law, which shines through in several of her posts above, really does her credit. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:33, 30 October 2006 (UTC).

<dd>Just to play devil's advocate.. is any editor worth this much babysitting? What's the best outcome, that he becomes genuinely useful as an editor, or merely that he does no harm? If we're after harm prevention, I see a much simpler way to accomplish that. I've no previous familiarity with this person, but if the situation is as bad as people are suggesting maybe a probation is useless- I think of probation as a way to try to reform a problematic editor, but it sounds like people don't even think that's possible in this case. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For what it's worth, I find his links disruptive, but oftentimes much less so than some POV pushing that goes on. At least he does try to discuss things. I used to try and converse with him about what is and what isn't acceptable as links for articles and asked him to stop adding links to suspect websites (which he did usually do only on discussion pages), but he hasn't gotten the point. I support a link and unconstructive editing ban on a progressive scale, start with a a few days and if needed, then a month and then longer if he persists.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 20:51, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think Fred should have blocked Jaakko in this dispute, but neither blocking Fred was fair and I would welcome unblocking. We should distinguish oranges from apples. In this dispute, Fred defends WP naming guidelines against an uncompromising revert warrior. I would like to hear arguments from those who think that Jaakko is here to improve Wikipedia. To the best of my knowledge, his edits are limited to frivolous POV-pushing reverts, accompanied by incessant accusations of vandalism against his opponents. I don't see why 1,000+ admins that we have in the project allow some serious trolling plague a certain segment of WP and then, when a fellow sysop ventures to sort it out, would readily block him for having erred. This is a wrong message for nationalist trolls. I believe a community block of Jaakko is in order. His behaviour does not differ materially from that of <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">User:Molobo</a>, who has been community blocked for a year. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 07:56, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>His behavior <i>is</i> a lot like Molobo, though the one difference I see is the track record: Molobo had a dozen blocks and thousands of edits before he was banned. Which was, of course, stupid, since there was no reason to think he'd change. The difference here both that we don't necessarily have reason to think Jaako is incorigible, but also that early on. I recommend an <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">arbitration request</a> for this case, so we don't end up wasting our time with a dozen blocks, especially with the pretty clear misuse of administrator tools involved here as well. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 08:51, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Jakko went into a pretty annoying crusade of changing historical Swedish name in the historical articles into the modern Finnish ones. Particular moving of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Fredrikshamn_fa53.html" title="Treaty of Fredrikshamn">Treaty of Fredrikshamn</a> were very close to a simple vandalism. Thus, while I am second that Fred probably should ask somebody to do the admin work for him, I think blocking him is a way to strong a measure. Besides Fred did the second best thing for this he reported it on this board for the review. Please unblock him if possible. If you need a formal endorsement of Fred's administrative actions (the block and move protection) - I have reviewed them and think they were right although it would be better if they were performed by an uninvolved admin <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 09:24, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>If</i> Fred is unblocked, both should be unblocked in his case. If a reblock of Jaakko is wanted after that, it should be performed by a different admin. I certainly hope everyone agrees that no admin should use blocking to solve a content dispute. Fred found his way to AN here after he blocked Jaakko. He should have come here <i>instead</i> of blocking. If other people would have agreed with Fred, another admin could have blocked Jaakko.

<dd>The number of times these editors reverted each other is irrelevant, since another editor was engaged in reverting against Jaakko before Fred joined in. He should not have taken over this job and then block the opposing party. And mind you, blocks for edit warring are <i>always</i> punitive, since they happen after the fact (and yes they <i>might</i> be preventive, but we'll never know for sure). If a block for edit warring is truely ment to be preventive, <i>both</i> sides involved should be blocked. Still, the fact that he understands that he was out of line, however, <i>is</i> a reason to unblock Fred. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<dd>After undoing Fred's block on Jaakko I did block both of them, each for 24 hours, to prevent further move-warring, not to punish either of them for anything.

<p>Honestly, the way this things have evolved leaves me pretty puzzled. What is this thing about equal or unequal? This Jaakko has a pretty obvious Molobo-like behaviour, as Dmc said, so I honestly don't understand why reverting his moves should be considered as being in content dispute with someone. You don't block someone unblanking a page four times in a row, do you? Well, it would seem that in this case, the circumstances are pretty similar. So Reinoutr, you're pretty heavily mistaken, this is not content dispute but pure and simple cleaning up after a quite disruptive user. I support an immediate unblock of Fred...</p>
<p>As for the ArbCom stuff, I believe that Dmc advices inappropriate measures. If admins can take a consensual decision about this guy without taking the stuff to the ArbCom, which is a lengthy and tiresome procedure. Molobo was not blocked so long because of quite controversial circumstances, including several questionable unblocks. One more reason to not repeat the same mistakes... -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 21:31, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"<i>If admins can take a consensual decision about this guy without taking the stuff to the ArbCom</i>" Yes, of course, but my point is that that isn't going to happen to an editor with only a few hundred edits and one prior block.

I think that wikipedia is not letting those who wish to speak speak so if you agree please help me on’’’ November 5th’’’ change as many sites as you can mess them up completely! and we will blow up wik's credibility like V would have wanted. Randomly post this message on pages before the 5th to spread he word they must be popular pages because they'll get deleted soon - Hackers on nov 5th they might lock all the pages if our numbers are great enough so you'll have to <b>unlock</b> them. - - - <b>Remember remember the 5th on November the typing and plot. I know of no reason the typing treason ever should be forgot</b> - - remember don't wreck the pages until November 5th so as not to ruin wik's surprize!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>TheronJ has repeatedly been vandalizing the <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clint_Curtis_8254.html" title="Clint Curtis">Clint Curtis</a> page, including the deletion of well cited sentences, paragraphs, the insertion of obvious bias (including the summary of a Wired news article that was completly skewed in libel to Curtis's biography). This includes the deletion of a well cited paragraph with quotes and citations from the Orlando Sentinel.</p>
<p>If you do an intestigation, he is a political activist that vandalizes negativly the profiles of Democrats by deleting information that can be considered positive and adds negative content and does exactly the opposite to Republican profiles. TheronJ insists that this is "balance." If you look on the Curtis page, you will see that Tom Feeney's response to Curtis's allegations has been twice as long as the section that describes the allegations. Under a campaign issues section, he adds Feeney's response to Curtis. It is wrong because the issues do not mention Feeney at all. Not only do these NOT reflect balance, it is a serious violation of Wikipedia's standards that requires action.</p>
<p>TheronJ is abusing his power as a Wiki manager and has had repeated warnings in the discussion page of Clint Curtis and now his user talk page. These flagerant abuses deligitimize Wikipedia and places it in a difficult position of dealing with slander against a living person.</p>
<p>In his last edit, he completly vandalized the "links" section. (Edit: this single part has been resolved).</p>
<p>Please take whatever action you can to take see that these abuses no longer continue.</p>
<p>Thank you. Rememberkigali 22:52, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With regard to that last edit "vandalizing the links section", TheronJ certainly did not vandalize the article, he accidently messed up with some of the references, causing the layout to be severely damaged.

<li>I'm glad you found the error for the last edit, however, that mistake would not have occured had the abuses not taken place.</li>
<li>Please look into this. There is no place in Wikipedia for these kinds of abuses. Libel is a very serious problem and every effort should be made to ensure that the content does not abuse a biography.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, Rememberkigali 01:54, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Please watch for any future edits by TheornJ, especially ones that can be considered Libel against Curtis according to Wikipedia standards.</li>
<li>There have been some good faith edits by TheornJ but only after intense debate concerning libel coments.</li>
<li>It is your responsibility as administrators to investigate this. I am doing my part and all that I can because I care about Wikipedia and its future. May it be a bright one for all of its people. Thank you. Rememberkigali 15:21, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sorry, I'm not sure how to use this page. I feel strongly that a particular individual (who I think might be an administrator) has been using his powers to bully and press his own opinions. Despite a well-argued and even-handed approach from me (in my own point of view...) user Yandman has been placing warning signs all over my talk page. I want to remove all of that discussion from my talk page and this user is now putting amber and red signs and warning me that I'll be blocked if I continue. From my point of view I have operated very strictly within Wiki norms and sought an amicable discussion, I find the use of these signs patronising (and incorrect, as he therey alleges that my 'behaviour' is unacceptable) and the threat of blocking unbelieveable. Please help? JamesAVD 16:10, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, please Kingboyk. The proper place for that discussion is elsewhere and I feel strongly that the user in question is seeking to bully not gain consensus.

<p>Thanks Kingboyk. But I do feel that the discussion which is necessary needs to be broadly supported. The individuals involved are (in my view) trying to impose a solution based on (very thin) discussion in a page which had not been seen by the broad base of contributors to the talk pages of the various countries involved. I may be a newbie but my actions were entirely justifiable. I still feel that the user I name above was using his administrator powers to bully and I would like to know how to complain about this. Thanks again. JamesAVD 16:25, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thankyou, both. I strongly dispute that I have been spamming. A change has been made to the infoboxes of EU member states which is non-standard and potentially POV. Some users tried to claim that this had been discussed on some ill-used page (Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Countries) and that this was sufficient. I have raised the issue on the talk pages of each of the relevant countries - this cannot be spamming. The users who are 'under the impression' that I'm here to cause trouble are the same users which have strong point of view on whether the change should be made or not, and instead of addressing the argument are using admin powers to imply that my actions are outside of Wiki norms. This is unacceptable. Specifically, user Yandman sought to use warning signs on my own talk page to bully and, ultimately (in my view), enforce his own point of view. It is I who have sought to generate a discussion about this issue; I have not been 'going against what multiple editors are telling me' whilst these three are not representative of the very broad range of contributors who have added to the Wikipedia pages on major European countries. And of the admins who have written here only one has addressed the concerns I had, the others have been verging on patronising, patting me on the head and telling me that I should listen to users who I have (cogently, calmly) alleged are seeking to bully me. Please, will someone tell me what can be done about this? JamesAVD 16:44, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I promise you James that I was not "seeking to bully" you, merely pointing out how consensus works here. Please try to assume good faith and not take it personally. You are right that I disagree with you on the content issue, but I have not (so far) used my admin powers at all, just given you some friendly advice which you may take or ignore, it's entirely up to you. However, ignoring what several other editors have said including me about the merits of centralised discussion may well get you into trouble. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 16:49, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>At the risk of running around in circles here, and I would rather not have to comment again, this is precisely an example of what I mean. First Guinnog suggests that I was not assuming good faith, which if you read my talk page you'll see I did (unlike Guinog and others who assumed I was spamming or vandalising), then the threat: 'igorning what several other editors have said [subtext: admins] ... may well get you into trouble'. How can I get into trouble if I work closely within Wikipedia norms, unless the threat is that if I annoy certain admins (and go agains the opinions they hold), I 'get into trouble'. The only sort of trouble he can mean is, what, blocking? It is my belief that these admins are using their powers (and threats of using their powers) to intimidate contributors to Wikipedia, in particular to get their own way on points of discussion. This is surely an issue which needs some attention from more senior administrators or Wikipedia controllers? I would like someone to address my complaint that one user in particular tried to bully me by use of 'warning signs'. I would like Wikipedia to prevent, as a matter of policy, all use of these signs by users who might seek to use them to bully. JamesAVD 16:59, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>James, you've got to be careful when you make accusations. You'll notice that I've never been part of the debate on the new maps, nor have I ever made changes relating to the maps: therefore I don't see how you can divine that I have a PoV on the issue. Secondly, the reason I and others noticed you (in my case, RC patrol) was that you took it upon yourself to change the maps on every single EU member state page, and then remove any reference to the EU from the relevant infoboxes. I, along with 3 other users, asked you to stop doing this. Only then did you start spamming messages on talk pages, accusing us of having a PoV and then of trying to hide your comments. You then blanked the various warnings from your talk page (less than 30 minutes after they'd been posted), before simultaneously trying to open a RfC on my actions. I apologise to you if you felt offended by my actions, and maybe the warnings I gave you for page blanking were a little harsh, but you've got to learn to be patient and wait for consensus. People who are discussing something rarely appreciate it if you go and change it on your own. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 17:01, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree. I saw a problem with the infoboxes which was non-standard and potentially POV (giving EU borders and EU accession a weighting in the infobox which would be a clear matter of dispute); I sought discussion on the relevant talk pages; finding none I made changes to each of the pages with a problem; three users began a discussion on my talk page which very rapidly descended (on their part) into accusations of bad behaviour; I disputed their actions; I raised the issue on each of the talk pages (which can be the &lt;only&gt; way in which the broader base of users can know there is even a discussion taking place); I sought to remove the aggressive comments from my talk page and was met with 'warning signs' from a user, patronising in tone and ultimately threatening blocking with no case for un-Wiki behaviour. I feel strongly that this user was seeking to bully me. I believe that these signs are open to misuse and that the discussion here raises serious issues about the use of admin priveleges. JamesAVD 17:10, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You knew there was a discussion, you even took part in it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Countries&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85246760" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Countries&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85246760" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>. And this wasn't the first time you'd made these edits. Going through your contribs, one notices that you've already been on an EU-removal spree and have already been reverted by other editors. I'm finding it harder and harder to believe your innocence here, James. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 17:16, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, you made me aware of it, Yandman. I note you didn't seek to make contributors to country pages aware of it, but still proposed it as a consensus. I in no way engaged on an 'EU removal spree': I'm personally strongly in favour of the effect of the EU on politics in Europe. This does not mean that an encyclopedia can be misleading. It was me who raised this for debate and it is those who want to deviate from Wikipedia best practice and avoidance of potential POV statements to justify a new map for each of these countries; this is a discussion for elsewhere, but the bullying which you attempted on my talk page should not be acceptable. I hope Wikipedia can do something about the problem of using these 'warning signs' and threats of banning. JamesAVD 17:35, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This issue has been discussed before on other talk pages also and the consensus is that scripts should be used in alphabetical order. And alphabetically <b>K</b>annada comes before <b>M</b>arathi. This is what is being followed on Carnatic music page, Dravidian languages page etc., also, if I am right. The issue, if any, on Belgaum page regarding scripts is not about the order in which they have to be written but is infact, whether Marathi script is even needed or justified on that page. For now, editors are maintaining status quo by having both scripts on that page. And obviously it should be in alphabetical order, nothing else. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 21:01, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of while ur misdeeds of sock-puppetry are exposed I would not like to share space with u.

<p>Hi I hope I am doing this the right way. I just thought I would bring to your attention the abuse going on in James Hetfield's article. He is seen as quoting that he uses his penis on stage to perform homosexual acts to members of his band and also fans. There is also a mention of him giving oral sex to Lars Ulrich earlier on in the article. I would say that this article needs to be locked to protect it from further vandalism or at least to be deleted (the abusive statements) and the vandal(s) to be warned.

<dd>I got used to these types of personal userpagaes. As far as it concerns the owner of those kind of pages, the userpage in question does somehow respect civility i believe, though not ethically. However, there are other cases where they don't. Just because it happens that i sometimes edit Islam-related articles and because of my Arabic name i used to receive some hate speeches <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:FayssalF&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=82895210" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:FayssalF&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=82895210" rel="nofollow"><i>suck it u camel jockey cunt islam is wrong</i></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:FayssalF&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=80716556" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:FayssalF&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=80716556" rel="nofollow"><i>Fayssal, how can you keep defending the outlaw gang called the Muslims&#160;?</i></a>, etc...</dd>

<p>In my opinion offensive and xenophobic material should be deleted from his userpage. He is using wikipedia to express hatred towards people of a certain religion. This is surely contrary to wikipedia rules. I would also like to point out that most of Cerebrals edits on wikipedia involve hate-speech towards muslims.

I found him to be a thoroughly unpleasant editor, making personal attacks for which I warned him <a href="../../../c/e/r/User_talk%7ECerebral_Warrior_c374.html#Repeated_personal_attacks" title="User talk:Cerebral Warrior">here</a>. This is when I noticed his userboxes (he hadn't yet added the quote), which I suggested he remove. After he added the quote, I asked him <a href="../../../c/e/r/User_talk%7ECerebral_Warrior_c374.html#Your_userpage" title="User talk:Cerebral Warrior">again</a> to remove the stuff. Later on, someone made a complaint with Konstable, who immediately blocked CW and deleted his userpage. However, Konstable later backed down, explaining his actions <a href="../../../c/e/r/User_talk%7ECerebral_Warrior_c374.html#Blocked_and_user_page_deleted" title="User talk:Cerebral Warrior">here</a>. Barely a few minutes later, CW made yet another trollish comment on the Al-Qaeda talk page. Not wanting to have to start an RfC, I decided to give CW a <a href="../../../c/e/r/User_talk%7ECerebral_Warrior_c374.html#Last_chance" title="User talk:Cerebral Warrior">last warning</a>, in which I asked him (among other things) to remove the hate speech from his user page. I asked the other users present to endorse this statement, which they did. However, two users voiced the opinion that we should not censor user pages, so I decided to put a slightly tailored warning up and let things lie, seeing as there is no <b>policy</b> about offensive userpages. I thought it would be better just to ignore CW, as did ThatGuy (see <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThat_Guy%2C_From_That_Show%21_c65a.html#Please_suggest" title="User talk:That Guy, From That Show!">here</a>). However, more and more people have come across this page, and CW has defended himself by implying that I had given him permission to keep the silly comments. This is not quite true: I stated that I would come down on any users who blanked his talk page without having discussed the matter first, as there's no strict policy about this. In my opinion, the best thing to do is to refrain from censoring userpages. There are no legal problems here (As far as I know, America doesn't have laws against "inciting religious hatred", or else half of FOX would be in prison by now...), and if we start removing content from userpages (I'm not talking about talk pages here), where do we draw the line? If a Turkish user puts a box up saying he believes the Armenian Genocide is a myth, do we blank it? If someone puts a box up saying they don't agree with US imperialism, do we blank it? The only viable solution would be to outlaw any opinions whatsoever on userpages, which would never work. If people have a page on which they can vent their frustration, maybe they'll stop venting it on the articles. I've been keeping a close eye on CW, and he seems to be making an effort. I think that the best possible solution is to not feed the troll. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 18:31, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nonsense. Policy pages are descriptive not prescriptive, not having a page which says "policy" at the top doesn't mean that no policy exists, just that it hasn't been written yet. As noted below the block of Rookie helps define our practice and therefore out policy and similarly the situation sometime back with <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice's</a> userpage. But if you want something which does say "policy" at the top of the page try <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what wikipedia is not</a> with such as "Many of the policies listed here apply to your user page as well. Your user page is not a personal homepage..." and "Wikipedians have their own user pages, but they may be used only to present information relevant to working on the encyclopedia." --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 20:11, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I consider Rookiee's blocking to have been out-of-line and reactionary since there were no ongoing behavioural problems aside from the userpage, which was itself borderline. But it does make a convenient piece of psuedo-case law here. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_tjstrf_12ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/tjstrf">Now on editor review!</a></small> 20:26, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well "helps to define" doesn't mean it is a literal definition, as with anything there is a certain amount of interpretion involved. You could very narrowly interpret that situation and anyone repeating it "word for word" should be blocked, or you can look at it in a more general sense concerning appropriate use of userpages. I certainly hope we aren't in an all or nothing situation where your userpage is acceptable - carry on, or your userpage is unacceptable - never darken our doors again. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 20:37, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Precedents are not good to have. Just because a certain decision applies in one situation does not mean that it should apply in another. The context of the decision is just as important, if not more important, than the decision itself. These decisions should be made individually, and not count as precedents. Also, when making a decision, sometimes it is more important to look at what is best for the community of Wikipedians then what is the consensus. Due to him offending some people, and his page becoming more and more controversial, I feel that the user boxes should be allowed to stay, where as the quotes and comments should be removed. I also think his page should be monitored so that he doesn't post comments like that in a userbox. It is one thing to tell people what POV you hold; it is another to purposely insult someone who holds another POV. This user's comments have shown that was indeed his purpose in posting those things, and that should not be tolerated; not now, not ever! It is best for the community, in my opinion, to remove the comments from the page because it is a very broad attack that many people can, and a few have, taken personally. -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">T</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">H</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">L</font></a></b> 00:33, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would just like to point out that there is a difference between "I'm Christian" and "I hate Muslims". The former is perhaps not the best idea, unless you are editing subjects related to Christianity, but is not inherently offensive. The latter is offensive. Just saying this in case anyone thinks that all political / religious statements should be strictly banned from user pages. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 00:57, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, but I think that this should also be a cue to write a precise policy on the matter, so as to avoid wasting so much time on this in future. The guideline says that <i>"using userpages to (...) campaign for or against anything or anyone is a bad idea"</i>, but we all know that there are myriad userpages out there that don't respect this. The policy about user pages says that only material relevant to collaborating should be included, which practically no-one respects.

<p>All i see is an ethical problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is a universal project where anyone can edit in order to spread and share knowledge. Of course freedom of expression should be protected but provocation should be avoided. <b>So why couldn't users avoid provocation and be positive</b>?</li>
<li>If Wikipedia guidelines are "considered a standard that all users should follow... should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception..." than common sense here can be that users can easily understand that their actions cause problems w/in the community. If not than <b>common sense would mean</b> that this user is trying to <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a>.

<dd>Szves, he started the provocation by calling Muslims murderers. That is the tip of the iceberg by the way, I am not even quoting the things he has said outside his talk page (for example accusing a Muslim editor personally of being a genocidal Nazi). But he has agreed to tone this down already, and it seems to have been resolved to some extent - so I have not even brought it up here. (And just saying it now to emphasise that he was the one who started the provocation, and no one else.) --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konst.able</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/n/User_talk%7EKonstable_e0b7.html" title="User talk:Konstable">Talk</a></sup> 11:52, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree Konstable that he had insulted Muslims. I am a Muslim myself and think it is not tolerable to accept such behaviour in this place; be it against Muslims or animals. The thing is that if he insulted a user as he did than he surely should have been blocked for personal attacks like i did when i blocked the one i mentioned above at my first comment of yesterday.</dd>
<dd>Re provocation. Actually i was refering to WC's provocation and not users/admins who tried to get the trash out of his userpage. What i meant is that at the absence of a policy re those matters than common sense is for the provocator (in this case WC) to ask themselves if it is possible to be rationale and avoid slurring. Instead of insulting they could have had a userbox stating that they disagree w/ Islam. The case is simple. Hiding behind "freedom of expression" while abusing what does that mean and insulting others arguing that Muslims do not constitute a race is <i>garbage</i>. Insulting is insulting and while there are no policies the ball has been at their camp. They should have listened to reseanable calls and concensus made out of this story and remove the stuff instead of playing games. Again, he could also have been blocked for <b>disruption</b> instead. But anyway, the best solution was to ignore that except in the case of preaching hatred. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Szvest</a> 12:28, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</i> <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small></dd>

<p>I'm posting this here based on the response to the RFArb case I filed. Someone assuming the name of H. Elwood Gilliland has used over 20 named sockpuppets and innumerable anonymous accounts to insert vanity references to "himself" and his projects in many articles. He has been most active in the Online creation and now-deleted NiMUD article, but was active elsewhere as well. In the course of doing this, he has used multiple (proven by checkuser) sockpuppets to cast multiple votes on AfD comments, some of which influenced the outcome of the discussion. When his articles of choice are un-semiprotected, he edits them from anonymous IP addresses, some of which edits have left dispositive evidence as to the identity of the editor. When the articles are semi-protected, he uses registered accounts and avails himself of resources such as WP:RFPP and WP:PAIN to make the case that I am oppressing him. Applying my discretion, I had indicated to this user that while he is free to edit, he is not free to act disruptively and insert improperly sourced vanity references to himself, and have applied blocks until he indicates that he will stop. Since I have now substantively edited the Online creation article, where previously I was only acting in an administrative capacity, I'm no longer comfortable continuing in that manner under my own authority, and would like to see if others agree that this should become a general community ban.

Please keep an eye on the page for when that happens. &#160; <i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th</font><font color="blue">e Tr</font><font color="#9ACD32">ans</font><font color="#FFCC00">hu</font><font color="orange">man</font><font color="red">ist</font> &#160;</a></b></i> 12:52, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Admin coaching was horribly bottlenecked, with a very long wait and very long waiting line. I am merely trying to accomodate users in not having to wait so long to get their questions answered. &#160; <i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th</font><font color="blue">e Tr</font><font color="#9ACD32">ans</font><font color="#FFCC00">hu</font><font color="orange">man</font><font color="red">ist</font> &#160;</a></b></i> 03:28, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"If you are a beginner, you have come to the wrong page". Gosh, that's a friendly, non-elitist, and totally agreeable message to give out. Entirely in line with what Wikipedia is about. And a huge list of exclusive and ridiculous prerequisites. I certainly will be making a note of how impressed I am with this when this page's creator goes to RFA. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 13:06, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's all subject to editing. If it presents the wrong impressions, then that's what feedback is for. I'll gladly modify the page to accomodate your concerns. As for the prerequisites, what would you think would be more appropriate?

<p>I would add that, with all respect to The Transhumanist's commitment to Wikipedia, that an admin school should be designed by admins, otherwise the "next generation" of admins will end up with values that could clash with the previous generation. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:18, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is an open forum, whereas admin coaching is one-on-one, and therefore very limited. A forum keeps the discussions out in the open, provides the opportunity for admins to comment on each issue or question that is posed by admin hopefuls, and allows each participant to easily read and contribute to the other discussions/coachings going on. It is intended as a supportive help desk. &#160; <i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th</font><font color="blue">e Tr</font><font color="#9ACD32">ans</font><font color="#FFCC00">hu</font><font color="orange">man</font><font color="red">ist</font> &#160;</a></b></i> 03:28, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I posted notice here, so that the page would have guidance and support of admins. I did not expect such a hostile reaction. If there is an admin monoculture or an elitist group, I may have discovered it right here on this page! But please consider this: if admins are actively involved in the coaching and question answering in the forum, then they would be helping, on a larger scale than the admin coaching page, to prepare the next generation of admins. Safety is built-in to the system. There is no danger of a mono-culture developing because the forum is available to all. Also, I've found that teaching is one of the best ways to learn, and so encouraging everyone to teach each other, would benefit all. Sincerely, &#160; <i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th</font><font color="blue">e Tr</font><font color="#9ACD32">ans</font><font color="#FFCC00">hu</font><font color="orange">man</font><font color="red">ist</font> &#160;</a></b></i> 03:35, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Currently, admin coaching discussions between coaches and their coachees are tucked away on subpages all over user namespace. I've tried to bring these together in an archive, but I haven't come close to tracking them all down. Some of them may even have been deleted. I don't know yet. It just seems more appropriate to have a forum which is out in the open and therefore available for feedback from all who would be interested in participating. I have done my best to keep this as open and supportive as possible. &#160; <i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th</font><font color="blue">e Tr</font><font color="#9ACD32">ans</font><font color="#FFCC00">hu</font><font color="orange">man</font><font color="red">ist</font> &#160;</a></b></i> 03:42, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In addition to posting notice here, I planned on personally contacting admins to get them involved in answering users' questions as the volume of posts increased. I already have contacted one admin for this very purpose, because I didn't know how fast the volume of posts would grow. &#160; <i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th</font><font color="blue">e Tr</font><font color="#9ACD32">ans</font><font color="#FFCC00">hu</font><font color="orange">man</font><font color="red">ist</font> &#160;</a></b></i> 04:04, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First note that I am not a fan of 9/11 conspiracy cruft., and second I'm probably going to get slapped for not listing this at DRV inistead. However the DVD is available and seems to be doing well, so I have undeleted the article on the basis that it probably meets notability guidelines for films. (call it SNOW/IAR if you want; there was nothing wrong with the initial deletion, just the circumstances have changed) When editing the article, please stick to reliable third party sources—reviews, criticism and rebuttal in reliable magazines and newspapers and so forth. This should really not be the venue to refight the 911 conspiracy battle all over again, please. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:26, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note that the DVD was released on 10/31 which probably explains its high Amazon sales. By comparison the 19th highest seller is season five of Northern Exposure which will be released next week.

<dd><i>Please unblock me!! To tell you the truth, I was a wonderful contributor to articles in Wikipedia "Yu-Gi-OH and Pokemon". The story began when a user named Mitsumasa began creating and upload Pokemon images and articles. After about 5 months after the start of the articles the PCP began merging the articles (A Man in Black, Ryulong, Interrobamf) i tried talking to them, and the PCP but they did'nt listen. I gave up until recently students at my school "The Learning Community School" began bullying me, they knew that I was a contributor at the site "Wikipedia", so they told my teacher that they logged in some accounts and began vandalizing the articles that I personattly was currently having problems with you. My teacher Mrs. Lisa Mercato talked to the students Jene', Jessica, Aaron and restricted them from using the school computer. To tell you that I'm not some of those user names I merged some of the articles that i clamied I did. I'm very sorry May you please unblock me and my IP address 72.177.68.38."</i></dd>

I countered that on the FAC page,and was in the process of acquiring expert help to explain and/or suggest what could be done. And Raul shut it, as I was addressing objections, after I had spent days trying to coax responses from people whose opposes I had dealt with. The issue here is not the article, (which I do believe is FA standard or I would not have nominated it), but the fact that Raul has persistently refused to reply to my messages to explain his actions, which I find, frankly, to be an abuse of power. Wikipedia is about collaboration, not control, why will Raul not work with me?

<dd>This isn't an admin matter, and doesn't belong on this noticeboard. Wikipedia admins can block people, protect pages, move pages over redirects, delete pages, and merge histories. None of these apply in this case. All we can do is, to a limited degree, enforce policy. It seems there <i>is no</i> policy regarding the FAC process - the community has, in essence, appointed Raul as a benign dictator in that regard. As far as I can tell he can promote or demote any article he wants to, for whatever arbitrary reason he desires. It's not up to admins to tell him how to operate the FAC process; it's not our business. If you don't like that, you need to get the community to agree to a policy for us to enforce. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 13:16, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I currently have some ignored messages on a blocking issue. I'm waiting a few days for a response before bringing it here.

<p>I think you're overreacting, Dev920. Raul654 not answering you is a minor slight. While that may be impolite, you should probably just get over it. It's really <i>not</i> a world-shattering "abuse of power" nor a "terrible" instance of malevolent dictatorship. Raul has a reputation for doing a good job with FAC.

<dd>But Benign Dictator is the term used by admin in this very thread and I'm guessing that's where she has taken that term from. Lots of people use FA status as a guide to writing their articles, I'm not sure I like how it's explained here - that's it's the kingdom of one person and if editors don't like how they run it - tough.

In this case, there are objections that haven't been addressed.

<dl>
<dd>That's exactly my point. People had raised valid objections, and I was addressing them. They did not reply as rapidly as I did and so the process was delayed. In any case, Raul shut the FAC after just 4 days. How does that give me any time to address objections?
<dl>
<dd>Additionally, how can I be overreacting when there is no process for redress if Raul does something I strongly feel is out step with procedure? There is no proportion because there is no procedure. Maybe you don't think that Raul making an autocratic unaccountable decision an abuse of power, but I do, and you have no right to be condescending to me because you are an admin and I am not. Excuse me for troubling "the adminship" with a valid concern, but "users seeking help will often turn to an administrator for advice and information. In general, administrators acting in this role are neutral", and I somewhat expected people to weigh up what I was saying rather than come down on Raul's side because he's "has a reputation". So did Ed Poor. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMini_Talkpage_Template_64eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Mini Talkpage Template">check out this proposal</a>) 18:06, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think you are missing the point though. Although Raul does make the final decision, the people you have to convince are the people commenting at <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>. It probably would be best for Raul to use an edit summary when removing articles from the candidate list, and when adding them to the archive for that month. But if every editor involved in an article nominated at WP:FAC questioned his decisions, then the process would stall. You can safely assume, without asking him, that he removed it because, based on the comments received so far, the article's nomination was not going to be successful. Do carry on improving this article, or try improving other articles, and try again. Or work on implementing the proposal you are working on. That will be more productive than pursuing this complaint. Finally, as the admins in this thread have said (and I'm not an admin), this is not really a matter for the administators' noticeboard. Try <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EFeatured_article_candidates_f596.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates">Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates</a> next time, if you still feel aggrieved. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 18:39, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But I <i>was</i> convincing them. I was in the process of convincing them, editing to their objections etc. The article was progressing smoothly, and after 4 days, the FAC was shut. Are you seriously saying that 4 days is enough time? You said a week was sufficient above! Maybe the process would stall if Raul had to explain himself to everyone, but not everyone would question his decision. You have given me good suggestions on that FAC which I will use, but I'm still going to file that RfC, and I sincerely hope that this is the final time Raul does this (because he did in fact do it with <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_Gyllenhaal_907c.html" title="Jake Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>'s first FAC as well - which I nominated three days later and it passed with 100% support).

<dd>Absolutely.

<dd>Only 2-0?

You might be pushing it to try the same thing with <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bereishit_%28parsha%29.html" title="Bereishit (parsha)">Bereishit (parsha)</a>. I'd concentrate on keeping <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_Gyllenhaal_907c.html" title="Jake Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> at the level it is at, or even trying to improve it, rather than kick up a fuss about <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bereishit_%28parsha%29.html" title="Bereishit (parsha)">Bereishit (parsha)</a>. The other thing is not to obsess about process. Articles <i>do</i> pass <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> if enough work is done on them.

<dd>It is generally not allowed to remove other people's comments from talk pages, unless they violate specific guidelines. First, if they are chat or personal communications, they can be removed (kids talking to each other on their school's mandatory article page). Second, if the comments are wholly unrelated to the article the talk page accompanies, they can be removed, with some warning (usually by an administrator, usually after mentioning it on AN or AN/I to get some agreement among the community). Finally, <i>some people</i> believe that one can remove personal attacks, but this is <b>not policy,</b> and even the suggested guideline says that any removed comment needs to be archived and a link left in its place. If you believe that your talk page comments were removed inappropriately, you really should first give the one who removed them a chance to explain. If there were no legitimate grounds, then the person who did the removal was in error, if not actually vandalizing. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:50, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p><b>Dear Angela</b>, Please accept my apology in advance if this is not the place to share this information. The rules of Wikipedia are such that I am personally lost with regarding to correct forums for various purposes. That being said, please forgive me, and take a few minutes to read the following:</p>
<p><b>Linda Christas</b>, as school of over 4000 online students and over 300 faculty and counselors has been damaged by gossip spread by Wikipedia Volunteers. Our parents, faculty and students have attempted on several occasions to add Linda Christas to Wikipedia. We are a recognized effort to reform Western public and private schools. We do that by taking the aptitudes, skill levels, interests and learning style of each student PRIOR to adopting curriculum. In other words, we believe that much of the alienation found in classrooms throughout the West is a result of the West adopting the system of klaxons, bells and whistles, as well as one size fits all curricula for children as if children all matured at the same time and in the same way, such as we might find with carrots.</p>
<p>We feel financially damaged since one of our celebrity board members, Alison Jiear, resigned from our board as a result of Wikipedia sharing with her gossip that a true racist shared with her, gossip incidently which was just that. But, Alison's management didn't seem to care if the material was true or not. They recommended that she resign and she did.</p>
<p>Over and over again, we have been deleted from Wikipedia, even though Pat Boone, Efrem Zimbalist Jr, and Sue Grafton, along with pioneering surgeons, Naval officers and Fulbright scholars have endorsed the school.</p>
<p>We really do not wish to involve ourselves in any type of litigation. We simply want to be treated fairly with a permanent entry on Wikipedia. Surely this isn't asking too much given the treatment our students, faculty and parents have been subject to thus far from Wikipedia volunteers.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that Linda Christas is oppposing a one size fits all monolith supported by hundreds of billions of education dollars each year. We do not collect any public money, and it is safe to say that we are outmatched by public sector power. If we cannot even be recognized by a liberal organization such as Wikipedia, we certainly are doomed.</p>

The following was the note I received from a Wikipedia volunteer after my protest of the latest deletion.
</pre>
<p>Dear Ronald Bernard, Thank you for your mail. Ronald Bernard &lt;rbernard@lindas.com&gt; wrote:</p>

&gt; 
&gt; *Dear Wikipedia,
&gt;
&gt; It has been brought to our attention by Alison Jiear that someone at
&gt; Wikipedia has been reading IP addresses and misinterpreting them as
&gt; coming from the same computer9s).
&gt;
&gt; Our servers process e-mails from over 4,000 students and their families
&gt; daily.
&gt;
&gt; One of the things we ask of all our students and faculty is they use the
&gt; school's servers so we will have a record of daily activities at the
&gt; school similar to a brick and mortar institution.
&gt; 
&gt; That means, of course that the IP addresses will be similar for all
&gt; e-mails processed through the school's servers.
&gt;
&gt; So many people believe that they are computer literate and most are, but
&gt; reading  IP addresses to uncover dishonesty is not demonstrative of very
&gt; much.
&gt;
&gt; That Linda Christas must continually fight for any recognition is a
&gt; mystery to our faculty and our students.
&gt;
&gt; I see that once again, Linda Christas International School has been
&gt; eliminated from Wikipedia, when brick and mortar kindergartens with
&gt; enrollments of as few as 25 are maintained.
&gt;
&gt; With over 4,000 students world wide and 312 licensed counselors and
&gt; credentialed teachers, someone or some-many are not being fair with our
&gt; School.
&gt;
&gt; And, we do not know what to do about that.
&gt;
&gt; Any counsel you may wish to share with us regarding how we can maintain
&gt; a listing for Linda Christas would be very much appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Our best,
&gt;

<p>I'm sorry to hear your experience with Wikipedia has been frustrating.Articles on Wikipedia are deleted according to our Deletion Policy:&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a>&gt;.

If your article was deleted after a debate on "articles for deletion"(&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion</a>&gt;), it isbecause members of the community decided that your article was for some reasonunsuitable for inclusion; possible reasons include being not verifiable fromoutside sources, or because it was a page on a person, group, or idea that isnot sufficiently well-known for an encyclopedia article. If you believe after reading the deletion policy that your article wasunfairly deleted, you can ask the administrator who deleted the article for afuller explanation. (You can find out which admin deleted the article bysearching for your article title in the deletion log at&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/delete" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/delete" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/delete</a>&gt;.)

<p>The AfD was full of spa's and sockpuppetting, with several of the spas having been proven to be from the same IP address. There were <i><b>zero</b></i> independent sources for any of the claims, including that the named individuals are really members of the board. Despite repeated requests for verification, none was forthcoming.

<p>I'm somewhat confused by the claims in this. It seems to assert being damaged by gossip and "result of Wikipedia sharing with her gossip that a true racist shared with her". Yet I'd woukd have thought that gossip would be pointed to, so it could be sorted out. Instead it just stays as just vague claim, the fact that their isn't an article means this "gossip" can't be there, nor does the AFD appear to contain "gossip". The second sentence makes no sense, who was it who told the gossip Wikipedia or this "true racist"? Or is the suggestion that this "true racist" said that wikipedia contained gossip? Regardless of that I can't see how Wikipedia containing an article on the subject would solve this problem. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 09:57, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

They describe these 'off-Wikipedia' comments as negative/biased against them, but don't provide any actual links that I saw. In any case, the <i>extreme</i> 'ranting quotient' in all of this does make it rather hard to follow. I'd expect an educational group to be capable of presenting a better / more coherent case... and thus find the whole thing rather questionable. There continues to be no evidence that this group has ever been mentioned in a reliable third party source... or even that it IS a 'group' rather than a web-page set up by one person. Maybe they exist and do something noteworthy... but if that were the case you'd expect to be able to easily find evidence of it - or that they would be able to provide such. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:34, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Rich Fife here with a question about &lt;listed board member&gt;.</p>
<p>I am doing some work investigating an organization called "Linda Christas" and I am trying to determine if &lt;listed board member&gt; is in fact on their board. Here is their page:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lindachristas.org/board.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.lindachristas.org/board.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lindachristas.org/board.htm</a></p>
<p>Are they a member of their board? If so, what is their role? Thanks!</p>
<p>-- Rich Fife --</p>
<hr />
<p>I feel it's a fair and neutral email. They replied in a non-committal way, and I replied as follows:</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm working on an article about the Linda Christas organization for the Wikipedia online encyclopedia here:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</a></p>

<p>There's considerable question as to their legitimacy, and one of their claims is that you are a member of their advisory board of directors per this website here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lindachristas.org/board.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.lindachristas.org/board.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lindachristas.org/board.htm</a></p>
<p>All I really need is a quick "Yes, that's me. I've been working with them to do &lt;X&gt;" and it will help the discussion out quite a bit.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>-- Rich Fife --</p>
<hr />
<p>The member in question replied that they had been contacted by them after seeing a performance and asked if they wanted to be a board member. They said sure, why not? And that is pretty much the last they heard about it. They asked me if there were any issues they should be aware of. I explained as follows:</p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>The answer is, as most things in life are, complex. The question I've been working on is "Is Linda Christas of sufficient profile to be listed on Wikipedia?" The answer is seems to be no.</p>
<p>Operative word "seems".</p>
<p>You have my permission to stop reading this as soon is it gets too arcane. Wikipedia isn't your problem, I realize.</p>
<p>The weird thing about Wikipedia is that anyone can add anything to it, but then the other contributors ("editors") can then change it or decide to remove it. An article on Linda Christas was added, then removed after a discussion here:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Linda_Christas" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Linda_Christas" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Linda_Christas</a></p>
<p><br />
The author put it back, then it was removed and banned from reinstatement. The author put it back under a different name here:</p>

I, naive person that I am, stumble in late while this is going on. Here's a point you should be aware of: Wikipedia has a way of determining whether a particular contribution has come from the same computer as another contribution (all computers have addresses on the internet just like houses have adresses on the street). All of the contributions to the discussion in favor of keeping the article save one (from TruthBringerToronto) have come from the same computer, but they are signed as if they come from more than ten different people. One person is pretending to be many people in order to swing the discussion in their favor. As you can imagine, this is a major faux pas.</p>
<p>Anyway, oddly enough, that's not the real issue. The real issue is that Linda Christas makes many claims that SHOULD have easily accessible means of verification, but no verification is forthcoming. They claim to have schools in China and Poland, but refuse to disclose where they are or how to get in touch with them. How can they possibly have any students? The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the high mucky mucks (I'm just a plebe with pretensions) finally decided they'd had enough and banned any newbie users from participating in the discussion, which shut the discussion down.</p>
<p>And that's the story as far as Wikipedia goes. Sorry you asked?</p>
<p>Here's a blog entry about another man's strange encounter:</p>

I'd like to mention this email exchange on the discussion page, but I don't want to name you without your permission. There is a possibility that bringing your name into the discussion will cause the whole thing to pop up when people enter your name into Google (Google really likes Wikipedia for some reason). I can refer to you indirectly or simply as "someone on the list".</p>

<p>It turns out they are quite internet savvy and knew exactly what a IP addresses and sockpuppets are. They contacted Christas directly and received all manner of replies from different email accounts coming from the same IP address, which did not leave a good impression. Either they were being astroturfed or Christas was sharing their email address with lots of people. They asked to have their name removed. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 21:22, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>THERE IS NO GOSSIP BEING SPREAD BY WIKIPEDIA VOLUNTEERS!!!! Dear Angela, Having just removed myself as a board member at Linda Christas, I hoped that I could forget about the school, but I am angered to find that I am now being grossely misquoted, and I am not going to remain silent.</p>
<p>I would very much like to elaborate on what Mr. Bernard has said below regarding my resignation as a board member of Linda Christas. Firstly, the truth of the matter is that I received a perfectly polite email from someone, on behalf of Wikipedia, asking me if I would kindly verify that I was on the board of Linda Christas. Simple, straightforward. I replied saying that yes, I was on the board, and that was the end of that. It was at this point however that I did wonder why I was being asked to verify my involvement, &amp; realised that although I had accepted the Mr Bernard's invitation to be on the board (only months earlier), I really knew very little about the school. This I felt in hindsight was irresponsible on my part, and so decided to do a little digging and just make sure that I was happy with my decision to remain on the board. Unfortunately, I discovered various "chats / articles" about the school, which were not exactly complimentary. I also came across information that indicated that various contributions to Wikipedia all came from the same i.p.address, but under different contributors names. It all started to unsettle me. As a Patron for a very well respected charity in the UK, in which I actively participate in fundraising, I was angry with myself for not seeking this information earlier, before agreeing to "put my name" to it, and I considered contacting Mr Bernard to discuss removing myself as a board member. It is true that after putting feelers out, I received 2 private "comments" on my website from someone who was obviously not a supporter of the Linda Christas school, but this person was not from Wikipedia, and I NEVER told Mr. Bernard that they were. Mr Bernard states that "Wikipedia shared with her gossip that a true racist shared with her".... ALL LIES. Wikipedia only contacted me to verify that I was a board member, and that was all.</p>
<p>For him to say that a "racist" had shared information with me is incorrect. How curious then, to receive two emails, post resignation from two other persons I'd never heard of who were "connected" to the school( though strangely they came from the Dean's ip address, and it appears the same computer also ) suggesting that "if you really don't care about inter-racial harmony or children, then you will follow the path of least resistance" and resign. As a mother, and a supporter of various causes, I was deeply insulted, and their emails only confirmed that I did not wish to have anything further to do with these people, and to find that I am now being misquoted, just enfuriates me. They are trying to use my resignation as "fuel on their Wikipedia fire"... How the school can say that they have suffered financially from having me remove myself from their "school" is a joke, and beyond my comprehension. I was on the board for less than two months. Critereia for becoming a board member... all the school did was email me and invite me to be on the board, I said yes without looking into it, they stuck my photo and name on their list of board members, and I never heard from them again, until I emailed them asking to be removed, and now the mud is flying. For all I know the school may be completely above board... I will never know, but if the way I have been treated is any indication of their ethics and christian ways, I regret ever having been involed with this organisation.

<p>. . .specifically, before I start using my admin powers for anything more than deleting a bunch of my old subpages. I stopped paying attention to all the behind-the-scenes goings-on in April or May of this year; since that time, have there been any significant technical modifications made to the admin buttons? Have there been any significant changes in the mores and customs surrounding the use of those buttons? Any landmark incidents or decisions I ought to review? The policies are their usual bureaucratic selves, and delving through six months of history on multiple heavily-edited pages to figure out what's a significant shift and what's a narrow agenda would be a nightmare, so any brief summaries or pointers would be appreciated. thanks in advance. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles P._</a><small><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">(Mirv)</a></small> 07:08, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not mind pornography (although I think sadism (deriving pleasure from the suffering of others) is the worst possible trait/paraphilia/disorder that someone can have), but this picture is racier/more offensive than it has to be. A topless woman is not necessary for an image on the subject of BDSM dungeons and the gag and diaper are really over the top. As an example, the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operating_theatre.html" title="Operating theatre">operating theatre</a> could have a picture of a gunshot victim with blood and tissue all over the place, but such a picture is not necessary for the subject. I think that a picture of a dungeon with various equipment would best, but a picture of a clothed person would be an improvement. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 17:27, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And a picture of a bound person doesn't need to show any nudity either. It could be from behind; it could be in a position with naughty bits concealed; whatever. By the way, that gal isn't "suffering"; she's restrained, but isn't being harmed or hurt in any way. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 17:36, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>See also <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogtie_bondage.html" title="Hogtie bondage">Hogtie bondage</a>.

<dd>If the images in the article are bothering you, you can be bold, and remove one. The article does not need two images to illustrate the subject. I would suggest removing the image with the gag on, as this one seems to be more offensive than the one without. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Th</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_Esperanza_d8f6.html" title="User:The Halo/Esperanza"><font color="green">ε</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Halo</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Halo_8994.html" title="User talk:The Halo"><b>Θ</b></a></sup> 17:59, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just because someone has a moral opposition to pornography doesn't mean they're not curious about what's going on in the world. I could easily see someone clicking on the BDSM link from "Dungeon (disambiguation)" just to see what BDSM is. But the reason I brought this article to people's attention is because I think the pictures are pornography, which I happen to enjoy on other places of the Internet, but which I don't think belongs on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonemerson_b0c9.html" title="User:Jonemerson">Jonemerson</a> 23:21, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>After about 5 months after the start of the articles the PCP began merging the articles (A Man in Black, Ryulong, Interrobamf) i tried talking to them, and the PCP but they did'nt listen. I even tried to leave a committ on their usertalk pages but A Man in Black is the only one that responds to my commi! tt. I gave up until recently students at my school "xxxxx" began bullying me, they knew that I was a contributor at the site "Wikipedia", so they told my teacher that they logged in some accounts and began vandalizing the articles that I personattly was currently having problems with you. My teacher Mrs. xxxxxx xxxxxx talked to the students xxxxx xxxxx and restricted them from using the school computer.</dd>

<p>I've been looking at image talk edits by anon users and I've come to the conclusion that about 90% of them consist of either: 1) An edit to an image of a non-existent image, or an image on commons (hence the comments should be moved to the commons talk page, and the wikipedia version should be deleted, by my understanding) 2) tests or vandalism or 3) Comments not relating to the image that need to be removed. Take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&amp;hidemyself=0&amp;limit=500&amp;hideliu=1&amp;namespace=7" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&amp;hidemyself=0&amp;limit=500&amp;hideliu=1&amp;namespace=7" rel="nofollow">these</a> and see if your findings are different. I've cleaned up/tagged for deletion a lot of the most recent ones but there are still tons to deal with. Also, should image talk pages that consist only of vandalism be tagged with <a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-vandalism_f34b.html" title="Template:Db-vandalism">Template:db-vandalism</a> or simply blanked?

<p>A number of templates are in use (apparently by the CVU) stating that removing talk page warnings is uncivil and disruptive and grounds for blocking and having your talk page protected. I believe the wording of these is way too harsh (WP:BITE). I'd like to hear some thoughts on the matter. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 00:08, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As an occasional rc patroller and nonmember of the CVU, I think that although it is helpful for vandalism-warning templates to be left in place (for the sake of sanely progressing in the warnings system, ie 1-2-3-4-5, or 2-4-5 in extreme cases), it shouldn't be required to leave them, and definitely shouldn't be a blockable/page protectable offense.</dd>
<dd>After all, blocks are preventative, not punitive, and this seems a lot more like punishment than prevention of harm to the encyclopedia. (However, I'm not a sysop - therefore incapable of blocking users - so my opinion should be taken with the knowledge that I might be completely ignorant of the situation.) <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon9288</a> 00:27, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>These should be nuked. Yes, on occasions the immediate removal of warnings needs preventing, and admins have digression to take the appropriate action. But the effect of these templates is to create a new policy and encourage people to enforce it. There is no set policy here (nor should there be).--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 00:34, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agree these templates are not helpful. There is not agreement that warning templates must stay on a users page after the user has read them. Warning templates placed in error by newbies are often removed quickly by experienced users. These templates promote the idea that removal is wrong and escalate problems between new and experienced users. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 00:46, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As someone who has fallen headlong into reverting the outrageous amount of vandalism, I don't want to report a user unless they've "achieved" the requisite number of warnings. There is no easy way to tell if it's constant, repetitive, etc., if the user simply removes the warnings after reading them or regularly blanks the talk page.

<p>It's time to get some feedback about how I've handled a situation. On 31 October <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibutt</a> posted a complaint to <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> about <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">User:M.K</a>. I judged that the problem was a content dispute and referred the matter to <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>. Halibutt wasn't satisfied with that decision and I wasn't satisfied with Halibutt's subsequent behavior.

<p>The way I view this, I'm dealing with a disgruntled editor who has been attempting to bait me. I consider my actions lenient because I haven't endorsed the RfC and I haven't blocked this editor. I <i>have</i> issued two block warnings and written an outside view at the RfC, which Halibutt and a couple of other editors think is too much. So, given my reputation as a softie, have I treated another troublesome editor with kid gloves?

<dd>Thanks for posting a link to my reply there. In short, I had two questions from someone from the WP:PAIN. Before Durova replied to any of them, I was accused of WP:POINT just in case, without any apparent reason. But then again, I received all I asked for, but was again accused, this time of even worse offences. And when I reported to Durova that certain user started calling me names, Durova explained to the community that it was me to offend myself... His/hers comment at my RfC (<i>Halibutt has returned to my user page to insult me again. Highlights from his latest post include dick, fuckhead, and I'll think twice before I trust your judgement in the future, given your recent trigger-happiness.</i>) was extremely misleading and one-sided, given that I merely <b>reported</b> to her. He/she did not mention that my <i>I'll think twice before I trust your judgement</i> was merely a response to his/hers <i>I could no longer extend an assumption of good faith toward claims you might make in some future dispute</i> and that the offensive language was actually a request for clarification on the rules (<i>But still, I wonder how would you qualify the recent action in which one of your fellows suggested I'm a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Halibutt&amp;diff=85824022&amp;oldid=85823734" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Halibutt&amp;diff=85824022&amp;oldid=85823734" rel="nofollow">dick or fuckhead</a>? A friendly euphemism perhaps?</i>). So, it was not me to offend Durova, but it was Ghirlandajo to offend me and me to ask him/her for help. A help I did not get so far.</dd>

<dd>I'm not a newbie and don't really care for wiki that much, but just imagine how would a newbie feel if treated that way by a wiki administrator: first presented with a fancy interpretation of WP:POINT, then accused of fancy things, in the end warned that using his/her talk page might get him/her blocked... and that should someone offend you and call you names, you are responsible for that. I'm extremely dissatisfied with Durova's accusations, but at the same time I'm quite happy with how she/he handled my requests for clarification of the scope of WP:PAIN. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 07:09, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm fairly certain that this isn't the most correct place to be pursuing this, but it's the best place I've been able to find (newbie, sorry). The Wikipedia logo has an error in it. It is impossible that the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devanagari.html" title="Devanagari">Devanagari</a> on the left side of the logo could be constructed in such a way, as the "i" vowel is written before the consonant with which it is paired.

<p>Since taking the name of a famous living person who is not yourself is against the policy for account names, typically when an account appearing to be a famous person appears, an administrator will get hold of the person through non-Wikipedian channels (e.g. if they are affiliated with an organization, someone will contact them through the organization). For example, I did this recently with <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedeabenjamin_c743.html" title="User:Medeabenjamin">User:Medeabenjamin</a> after her first edits. I cannot say for sure that this is <i>always</i> appropriately verified, but I can certainly say that it usually is. If there is an individual about whom you have doubts, I suggest that you specifically raise those doubts, rather than raising possibly offensive questions about the identity of many people whose identities have been confirmed. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 23:03, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know if what I am asking is allowed, though I have seen precedents for it, but I wonder if the Talk:NPA personality theory page could be, at least temporarily, undeleted?</p>
<p>At present there is still controversy about this article including a blog entry off Wiki <a href="http://daveydweeb.com/2006/11/05/long-term-wikipedia-vandalism-exposed/" class="external autonumber" title="http://daveydweeb.com/2006/11/05/long-term-wikipedia-vandalism-exposed/" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> and the wildly inaccurate slashdot piece<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/06/11/06/0334249.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://slashdot.org/articles/06/11/06/0334249.shtml" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>. I already see one edit completely misrepresenting the position I actually took on the article's discussion page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psychonaut&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85998165" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psychonaut&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85998165" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>. It seems to me that, particularly with a related RFM still pending, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/User:Psychonaut/User_watchlist" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/User:Psychonaut/User_watchlist" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Psychonaut/User watchlist</a> it might solve and prevent a lot of unecessary problems if Talk:NPA personality theory were undeleted to prevent further misunderstandings of this kind? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 11:14, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I doubt if that is appropriate because <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a> is concerned with reviewing article deletions and it is just the talk page that may need undeleting to avoid further misunderstandings about what was said on it. Of course it is clearly visible to any admin, but with all this unfortunate and rather inaccurate off Wiki publicity it might save a lot of trouble to undelete the talk page for a while. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> (<a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZeraeph_54cd.html" title="User talk:Zeraeph">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zeraeph_6832.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zeraeph">contribs</a>) 18:35, 6 November 2006 (UTC).</small>

<dd>No, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a> is not concerned solely with reviewing article deletions.

<dd>Thank you for expressing your opinion but <a href="../../../u/n/d/Wikipedia%7EUndeletion_policy_6fe1.html" title="Wikipedia:Undeletion policy">Wikipedia:Undeletion policy</a> refers specifically to articles and media not talk pages, so I really need to know what an Admin thinks, particularly as an Admin can actually view the Talk:NPA personality theory as deleted and make an impartial, informed, decision on whether undeleting would solve or cause problems, or maybe can suggest an alternative that will avoid the possibility of further mistaken statements being made about the contents, under the circumstances.

<dd>For future reference, if the talk page in question concerns debate about whether the article should be deleted (a not uncommon occurence with controversial topics), you may have some luck with an inverse application of CSD G8, which says that orphaned talk pages can be deleted unless "they contain deletion discussion that isn't logged elsewhere". This seems to imply to me that deletion discussion that isn't logged elsewhere shouldn't be deleted, and if it has been deleted, it should be undeleted so that it can be archived somewhere appropriate. Now, talk pages should, in theory, be just about article issues and how to write the article, but they often contain discussion relevant to deletion debates, so I can understand why accessing them can help with deletion reviews. But this is all academic in this case now. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 23:03, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I read WP:SPP, too, and two thoughts came to mind. First, the words <b>should almost never</b>, which implies that there are times when it <b>is</b> appropriate to protect. An article on a controversial subject is going to attract vandals, whether it's FA of the day or just a run of the mill article. Some articles need protection no matter where they are or what their status. Secondly, I think FAD articles shouold be protected from editing, since many newbies do see them as their first wikipedia experience. So we really want newcomers to see all sorts of random crap thrown into what we implicitly say is the best of Wikipedia? Just my thoughts. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 00:01, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>At some point, entries were created for almost every Ozzy Osbourne song. See eg <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ultimate_Sin_e95c.html" title="The Ultimate Sin">The Ultimate Sin</a>'s track listing. As a test case, I proposed deletion for the article on the song "Thank God for the Bomb," which simply consisted of the text <i><b>"Thank God for the Bomb"</b> is the fourth song on the 1986 <a href="../../../o/z/z/Ozzy_Osbourne_4e24.html" title="Ozzy Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal.html" title="Heavy metal">heavy metal</a> album <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ultimate_Sin_e95c.html" title="The Ultimate Sin">The Ultimate Sin</a></i> as well as the {{rock-song-stub}} and {{Ozzy Osbourne}} boxes. The deletion criteria was that the song was not notable and that the article contained no new information with regard what could already be found on the album's main page. Deletion occurred without incident. Anyway, I think that now the rest of the songs which have no need for their own article should also be deleted. Is there any way to do this all at once or does it have to be done individually?—<a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasabe3543_9ffe.html" title="User:Wasabe3543">Wasabe3543</a> 22:57, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
