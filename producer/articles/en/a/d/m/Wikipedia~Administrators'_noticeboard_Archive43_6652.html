<p>For <a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">User:Pgk</a>: The page - after undeletion - was regulary moved to the user space. So its a simple <b>redirect page</b>.

Because the user demanding initially the speedy deletion <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Martin_3e92.html" title="User talk:Paul Martin">recontacted me after undeletion</a>, I moved the page.

<dd>Friend, 'twas I who redeleted the link from talk-space to your subpage. I have no problem restoring it, actually; I had assumed, given your userfication, that the redirect was useless, and I redeleted per R2. This is a cross-space redirect, and we need a good reason to leave it in place, as those are generally frowned upon. When I had originally processed the DRV debate, I was expecting the subpage to remain, and not to be userified. It was the change in circumstances of the userfication that made R2 applicable. There's no "farce" in the redeletion, as the content was saved and transferred in the interim. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 20:16, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Finally, I decided to move back the page to its original place. And so I will corrige the back-links to the user page within the next days.<br />
I understand the motivations of user Xoloz, even if I prefered a new advise. I also hope that everyone can live with the solution I choised.<br />

<p>A very interesting developement just occured. A user (which never edited no articles even near the Balcans thematics) contacted me complaining that he can't login because of my block of User:Da Croatian Sensation (he stepped on an auto-blocked IP, obviously). I appologised and asked him to wait for 24 hours so the block expires. He agreed and pointed out that this already happened when another user got blocked. I took a look at the user he mentioned and was puzzled to discover the user which obviously shared the same IP with User:Da Croatian Sensation is, in fact, Serbian editor currently blocked for a limited period of time. I think we could have a case of sockpuppetry (where Serbian editor got blocked, then got annoyed at being blocked and then engaged in sockpuppetry trying to discredit the Croatian side) and I think that it would be appropriate to reset this user's block. I myself wouldn't like to do that since I'm from Croatia and would probably be accused of making all of this up, but if some other admin wishes to investigate this case, I'll provide username of the guy which contacted me complaining about the auto-block so somebody can contact him... --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 14:11, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's come to my attention that <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski">User:Bormalagurski</a> is an administrator on the Serbian Wikipedia (<a href="http://sr.wikipedia.org" class="external free" title="http://sr.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">http://sr.wikipedia.org</a>). I seriously wonder whether this is a good idea, given his extremely poor conduct on the English Wikipedia (see my comments under <a href="#User:ChrisO.27s_blocking_of_User:Bormalagurski" title="">#User:ChrisO's blocking of User:Bormalagurski</a> above) and his continuous pushing of a hardline nationalist POV despite repeated requests to abide by <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. It's absolutely not the sort of behaviour one should expect of an administrator. If he was an administrator on this wiki he would certainly have been desysopped. But should administrator misconduct on one wiki result in desysopping in another, or do we treat each wiki as a separate realm insulated from all of the others? -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 22:28, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately we do have a problem with some users - many of them emigrés, not actual residents of the countries involved - using Wikipedia to push ultranationalist POVs, casting their side as victims and the other side as villains. This is true of users representing all sides in the Balkan conflicts, in my experience. Because of this, many of our articles on the Balkans are very badly written, unreferenced and full of POV commentary. I think it's highly likely that this is a multi-wiki problem due to the users involved being active on several wikis. However, I'm not aware of any mechanisms for dealing with multi-wiki problems, hence my question above. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 23:47, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I still don't see why this is an enwiki admin's problem. He's not an admin here, and never will be. He cannot possibly have exhibited administrator misconduct here having never been one, and we most certainly have no authority to desysop someone on another wiki by mincing about it on this page. If you have some problem with the user, as evidently you do, then use our dispute resolution procedures. If you're not asking for admin intervention, then don't use up time on the admin noticeboard with it. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 02:45, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you, Splash. I can't see how I can lose my admin priviledges on sr wiki, if I do something bad on en wiki. It just doesn't make sense. I have contributed a great deal to sr wiki, with over 6000 edits, and many new articles. ChrisO's goal of spreading his own POV, and his hate of me, has went too far, with him trying to ban me from a different Wikipedia, even though he has never seen what kind of edits I have made there. And anyways, for a user to lose his admin priviledges, a vote must be organized, and I doubt that the sr wiki admins will vote to expell me for misbehaiving on en wiki, and contributing greatly to sr wiki. Also, note that I've never made a single vandalist act on sr wiki, so think about who's the source of the problem here.

It is not a job that can be done in five minutes, nor is it one that brings rewards of any kind; it earns you near constant abuse, including legal and death threats. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 08:42, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have been the only one running checks on RfCU for the last several weeks (Mackensen was running some as well before that, but I believe he is on break at the moment). Right now, I'm not running any checks, pending improvement of some issues at RfCU. If other checkusers would like to pick up where I've left off, they of course can, but if I'm going to go back to running them all, I need some clerks and some admins to back me up; those interested are welcome to ask how here or on my talk page. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 08:01, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd prefer that non-checkusers didn't reject requests; sometimes something looks too small for checkuser, but there is something going on underneath that needs investigating. Also, people tend to get upset when their requests are rejected by checkusers; I imagine this would only be more so if it was done by a non-checkuser. Most of the work I need help with is clerk-type work, so I've set up a clerk system to help keep things running.

<p><a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_1384.html" title="User:HighwayCello">User:HighwayCello</a> keeps interfiering with all edits. Its like hes using me.</p>
<ul>

<li>It just <i>happens</i> to be articles I edit, he edits.</li>
<li>It just <i>happens</i> that HighwayCello looks at every page I edit.</li>

<p>He seems to be following me around Wikipedia.</p>
<p>He might be checking my contributions to see what articles I edit, and then edit them (even though I don't know if that part is true)</p>
<p>Every time I make a talk comment in any of the talk pages withing the Pokémon portal, he tries to interfiere.

<p>The last time I asked this question, I was blocked. I would like to know if one can really use a comicbook as a source for an article about the same comicbook. The same goes for movies: can someone use a particular movie - say Pulp Fiction - to write an article about Pulp Fiction and use only the movie as a source? Another admin whom I corrosponded with said that in the Plot Section, there should be a third-party reference and I agree; elsewise, it's the author that must interpret the plot and then the article falls under Original Research and reads as a review, instead of an encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 19:34, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

The same thing is going on at the concert article, except that the 2424 account is recommending deletion and insulting people rather than Mrozinski. I think the articles should be deleted quickly so that he can go on his way as soon as possible. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 02:07, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are categories for <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">speedy deletion</a>. When articles don't meet them, they go to AfD, so the community has the chance to debate. Things can sometimes change radically during the course of this. Mrozinski asserts notability with a no. 1 hit in Italy. I suggest you tell the relevant editor about <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">Verifiability</a> and ask them to provide a reference. It's worth trying to communicate. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:49, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm aware of procedure, but a speedy close is done in some situations, albeit rarely. This isn't of great importance and it's not that big of a deal if they run their course, but I thought that it would be a good thing to do. About your suggestion, the editor is not trying to argue that he is notable, he is arguing for deletion. I had already read his comments on the AfD nominations, his user talk pages and the article talk pages and I doubted any further communication with the editor would have been fruitful. He did not understand what Wikipedia was about and he tried to use the articles as personal pages. He got upset when other people edited the articles (he seemed to have no idea that this would be done, somehow) and told them not to change anything. At some point he went crazy and started making personal attacks and went on rants about how terrible the idea of an encyclopedia that anyone can edit is. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 03:16, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Dear Administrator:
</pre>
<p>I, like you, am an editor; I create articles and make edits. But, many, I am sure many other people out there, are tired, frustrated and angry with the behavior of many Administrators. I am certain that it is appallingly easy to revert and article, that someone has undoubtedly spent allot of time and effort writing. I have, in the past spent hours, researching, planning, writing, checking and revising an addition to an article only to have the whole lot deleted forever three minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>I know that deletion of material is essential in a free-to-edit encyclopedia, but if you see an article that someone has anonymously devoted their time to writing, why could you not revise it, change it or give a reason for you action? They deserve one.</p>
<p>I know all Administrators are not all Drunk-With- Power-Trigger-Happy-Nazis, many of you do an excellent job and you know who you are.</p>
<p>In closing: Create, don’t Destroy. Make a distinction between “what is right, and what is easy”. Be enriched and enrich others with the knowledge of other people.</p>
<p>And keep that finger off the trigger.</p>

<p>Well, here we are again. This is a continuation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=55572123&amp;oldid=55564458" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=55572123&amp;oldid=55564458" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which I alerted everyone to a few days ago. I had blocked SuperDeng and <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurt_Leyman_1ee7.html" title="User:Kurt Leyman">Kurt Leyman</a> for 72 hours for this continuing fight of theirs. Specifically, Deng had reverted 40 of Kurt's edits in a 3 hour period (which you can see in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=100&amp;target=SuperDeng" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=100&amp;target=SuperDeng" rel="nofollow">Deng's contribs</a>. Well the block expired and Deng went right back at Leyman, as he has been doing for 2 months now. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Battle_of_the_Atlantic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56488324" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Battle_of_the_Atlantic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56488324" rel="nofollow">This</a> is the edit that is causing the problem. Deng has been accusing Kurt of vandalism all along. Well. The edit I just cited is not vandalism. In fact, Kurt's edit is better than Deng's. And it's more than just the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_the_Atlantic_190a.html" title="Second Battle of the Atlantic">Second Battle of the Atlantic</a> article. We also have <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Netherlands_ea1d.html" title="Battle of the Netherlands">Battle of the Netherlands</a>, where Deng has reverted Kurt by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Netherlands&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56471684" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Netherlands&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56471684" rel="nofollow">changing "wounded or missing" to "missing or wounded"</a>. And he's done this twice. And I and others have tried reasoning with Deng. We've pointed out policies. We encouraged a RfC and then a RfAr (to which he responded with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASuperDeng&amp;diff=55747375&amp;oldid=55714503|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASuperDeng&amp;diff=55747375&amp;oldid=55714503|" rel="nofollow">"arbitration are back logged and from them time I make a request which I will untill someone actually looks at it he will have vandalized hundreds if not thousands of articles")</a>. So he won't even follow basic dispute resolution. Yes, he tried a request for comment but that's been it. So, because of all of this, I've blocked Deng for 1 week. If someone disagrees, let me know. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 14:42, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Strike that. :) Kurt was also in violation of 3RR. So I blocked him for 5 1/2 days. It's for a lesser time because Kurt has one less 3RR vio and he hasn't been stalking anyone.

<p>It is my impression that although hotheaded, arrogant and disruptive, Deng is still an asset to wikipedia. He made a great number of very good edits related to the Eastern Front during the World War II and in his vendetta with Kurt in quite a number of cases he indeed is fixing some subtle vandalism. As a matter of fact me and Irpen had been planing to give him a barnstar on the V-Day for his editing, then delayed this because of his disruptive behavior.</p>
<p><a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">User:Irpen</a> has agreed to be his mentor, I never tried mentorship before, but I could try my chanses as a co-mentor if it is needed. Please give him a second chance, if it works, it would be worth the nervous energy spent due to his scandalous behavior. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 04:31, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's a shame that Kurt, with his pesky pro-Nazi trolling and no valuable contributions at all, has not been permabanned as yet. I support the idea of mentorship for Deng, however. Deng is a potentially valuable contributor, but his editing needs to be supervised by a team of more experienced wikipedians. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 07:18, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

As to the 'socks', I'm not sure the term really applies since he has asked for the prior account to be shut down and openly declared the change... it's not like he is hiding anything.

<p>I am putting this here so admins will see it more easily. This is a continuation of the discussion up above. I just protected Deng's user talk page. He had manipulated his talk page by moving my comments to places they shouldn't have been. And at this point, he's just using his talk page to attack Kurt. And besides, I think he's made all of his points. At this point, we need another admin (not me or NSLE but someone else) to respond to his unblock request. I think I made all of my points on his talk page so I don't think I need to add anything else. I will say that this did not just start. He's been stalking Kurt for 2 months now and I've been dealing with him on and off since the beginning of the year. He seems to think that he was indefinitely blocked just based on the discussion here. Please look at his talk page. You will see that that's just not so. Plus, be aware that he has removed block notices and warnings, especially in the last month or so. Thanks. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 06:37, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Couple of problems with that. First of all, I've been basically mentoring him for months with no effect. The vast majority of my posts to his page has been trying to teach him how Wikipedia works and that's right up to the last few days. His response is to call me incorrect or to simply refuse to follow the direction. An example is recently when I told him that he should open a RfAr against Kurt. His response was basically that the arbcom is too backed up so by the time they act, Kurt will have vandalized hundreds of pages. So basically he was saying he was a one man revert squad and he was quite alright with that. Of all of the advice I've given him, the only 2 he followed was filing an RfC (and that took prodding) and also putting up the unblock template, though he only did that after he was blocked indefinitely by someone else. He's followed little else, including my pleas that he be civil. Just in the last few days, he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SuperDeng&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56641664" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SuperDeng&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56641664" rel="nofollow">lectured me on what Wikipedia is</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SuperDeng&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56626150" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SuperDeng&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56626150" rel="nofollow">defined sneaky vandalism for me</a> and also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SuperDeng&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56615956" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SuperDeng&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56615956" rel="nofollow">made a sarcastic comment</a> about how I was watching Kurt's edits...and mind you, this was AFTER Kurt had been blocked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another problem is that neither of you 2 are admins. So if Deng strays, there is no ability to block him. As I said, I've been dealing with him for 6 months. I think I know him pretty well. I can almost guarantee that if he's unblocked, the first thing he's going to do is to go back to stalking Kurt. All you have to do is the read the last several entries in his talk page to see that. He has this fear that Kurt will be reverting sourcing unchecked, even though I told him I'd be watching Kurt's edits. I just don't think that more mentoring is the solution here. He just doesn't listen to others.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And he also doesn't take responsibility for his actions. You can't mentor someone like that. You have to have someone who can say "I'm wrong" occasionally, but Deng never does. Everything is Kurt's fault or my fault or the procedure's fault or another admin's fault. It's never Deng's fault.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So. Mentoring sounds like a good idea but I've been doing it informally for months and Deng hasn't improved one iota. He's still being uncivil. He's still ignoring all advice. And he's still being disruptive. And he's not exactly a new user. He should know better. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 17:08, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>May I also add that deng has made many personal attacks against other users. This latest series of conflicts with Kurt is simply one example of his pattern. He has had numerous short blocks, with specific reasons given for each, yet he comes back and repeats the same types of actions. I also question the notion that he is a valuable contributor. He has made some good edits, but has also made others that are nonsense and push a POV, often against the consensus of other editors. <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDMorpheus_f8a6.html" title="User:DMorpheus">DMorpheus</a> 17:22, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Francis, I replied to you, you missed it. I also said that here earlier. I agree to try co-mentoring Deng. Others would have to deal with Kurt. Also, to address Woohookitty's consern, Alex Bakharev is an admin and expressed his willingness to co-mentor Deng as well. With Alex, Francis and myself, he would be enough supervised. I believe Woohookitty tried his best with Deng, but perhaps Deng percieved him not even handed and too forgiving to Kurt. No offence. Woo gets all my respect, but of these two, Kurt is definetely a bigger problem. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 17:35, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, regarding NSLE's entry above sayng: <i>"I have no opinion on it, I only decided on an indef block after stumbling over this case."</i> (It was NSLE who blocked Deng) I wish the editors that strict monitored more cases of abuse at this page and at ANI. I mean it is OK to trigger-happily ban abusive users, but we should apply the same standards if we are to be harsh. I have actually no problem with faster blocking of problem users than the leaway they <i>mostly</i> get around here. That would save a lot of time for the ArbCom and a lot of user's time currently spent uselessly at RfC's or admin boards better spent on adding content to Wikipedia. But with users like Molobo and a <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Appalling_profanity.2C_ethnic_slurs.2C_threats_by_blocked_user_on_his_talk_page" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">a recent case of AlexPU from ANI</a> getting away with only one month for by far worse incivility and Deng getting indef, the system seems uneven and broken. One month may be exactly appropriate for AlexPU (some suggested indef though, but even one month may be harsh enough.) Deng getting an indef is something I don't understand, especially when Kurt, who really engage in lots of sneaky vandalism, gets away with 5 days. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 18:00, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Deng is only doing this so he can get back on here and stalk Kurt and apparently, Irpen has no problem with that. "Kurt's the bigger problem". No he isn't. You are ok with a user reverting another user 40 times in 3 hours? You are ok with someone who not only violated 3RR, but actually reverted EIGHT TIMES in 2 hours? Deng is disruptive. Period. That's why he got the longer block. Deng's block was increased because he was extremely uncivil with me and he refused to take any responsibility. My original block of Deng was 7 days. For Kurt it was 5 1/2. Kurt's block was shorter because Deng's history of disruption is more extensive and he had one more 3RR vio. Kurt is not a saint and I bet that within a week or two, he will be blocked indefinitely as well. I have no doubt about that. But it doesn't absolve Deng. It doesn't give him the right to revert one user on sight, even when the edit is not vandalism. As he tried to resolve it? Sort of. He opened the RfC. Even on his talk page, he says that others have tried to talk to Kurt on Kurt's talk page to get him to stop. Others. Not Deng. Others. That is the most basic part of dispute resolution. And he hasn't tried it. All of his posts to Kurt's page have been of the "what is wrong with you?" variety. He did a request for investigation, but again, that's not really dispute resolution. That's trying to get another user blocked. That's what that is. He refused to follow a correct procedure on RfM. He outright refused an RfAr. Instead he's decided to follow Kurt all over the site and revert on sight, though he's been blocked for it several times and he's been told how to resolve the issues numerous times. To me, that is just as bad as what Kurt has done, if not worse.</dd>

<dd>And all 3 of the perspective mentors either support Deng's case or in the case of Alex Bakharev, believe in "ignore all rules". That is not going to work with Deng. We need totally neutral admins on this. Non-Russian. Non-WWII experts. People with absolutely no opinion on Deng. Just ordinary admins who don't have a stake in Deng. And you know, that was me 6 months ago. It's been said that he deserves a 2nd chance. 2nd? No. Try about 6th. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 22:42, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, then we can find some other mentors. Unfortunately, mentoring is generally thought to be a tough job, so I'm not sure that you will find any admins to mentor him who don't support his case. I'd like to point out that I'm certainly not pro-Russian and I'm not an expert on the second world war in any respect. You were mentoring him? I think it will be quite easy to tell if he is stalking Kurt, and if he does, under mentorship conditions, he will be blocked. I'm quite happy for him to have a more stringent set of rules to follow, 1RR or something, for a trial period of say a month or two... - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 22:54, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well it said so in <a href="../../../m/e/n/Wikipedia%7EMentorship_190c.html" title="Wikipedia:Mentorship">Wikipedia:Mentorship</a> - <i>When mentorship arises as an outcome of the dispute resolution process, the mentor has formal supervisory powers over the protégé.</i> I propose the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The behavior of Deng was indeed egregious. I think we all agree that he deserved a one month block</li>
<li>The month is enough time to prepare an arbcom case against him, we could ask to put him under <i>Involuntary mentorship</i>. Then his behavior will be monitored not only by his mentors but also by the whole <a href="../../../m/e/n/Wikipedia%7EMentorship_Committee_9b60.html" title="Wikipedia:Mentorship Committee">Wikipedia:Mentorship Committee</a>. It should be enough to stop him <i>before</i> he would make 8 reversions. I think if the both sides agree on the Involuntary mentorship, it could be pushed through really fast (even at the start of the arbcom proceedings as a preliminary action)</li>
<li>If you need an administrator to be his mentor, I volunteer to be his co-mentor. If you think somebody else is suited better, then it is fine with me. BTW could you, <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a>, name any of my administrative actions that may be seen as the <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> or encouraging of violations of 3RR or stalking? I might even deserve an apology.</li>
<li>I think that permablocking a user for his good faith edits, who did not commited gross acts of inivility, etc. is to strong a punishment. Permablocking by an act of an admin is allowed only if all the admins agree with it. I disagree and I am an admin</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are no other proposal, I will set the block to one month <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 00:56, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've left him a note, because he seems under the impression (judging by his userpage) that he is Sir Richard. Naturally I'm skeptical. If he is, he needs to directly say so (but the account will still need to be monitored, of course, until we know definitively).

</div>
<p>Here is evidence to support the theory that this user is in violation of the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username</a> policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>This user's activity began June 5, and has been largely focused on the external links sections of the Richard Branson article and related articles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A previous user, operating under three known usernames and three known IP addresses, was also intensely interested in the external links sections of the Richard Branson article and related articles. The three usernames have now all been indefinitely blocked. Two of them were indefinitely blocked on June 3, two days prior to the creation of the Richard Branson username.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One of the edits under the Richard Branson username is a removal of a deceptively named external link in one article; an identical removal of the identical link in a different article was performed within two hours of the edit under the Richard Branson username, but was done by one of the known IP address sock puppets of the three-time indefinitely blocked user. (Notice that this user <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERichard_Branson_c3c6.html#Do_you_mean...." title="User talk:Richard Branson">claims credit for removing linkspam</a> from the article, a perverse claim since that is actually what the rest of us were doing while the eventually blocked sock puppets kept reverting back to the linkspam, up to 8 times.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The new Richard Branson user has explicitly referred to himself as if he were Richard Branson. The three-time blocked user's histories are riddled with per se deceptive edits, including describing linkspam sites as being officially related to Richard Branson or Virgin, and going so far as to register deceptive URL's and post them the same day as stealth linkspam. Needless to say, the severally blocked user also has an established predilection for evading indefinite blocks by creating more new sock puppets, like <a href="../../../l/e/r/Lernaean_Hydra_9774.html" title="Lernaean Hydra">hydra</a> heads. Also needless to say, the three previous usernames were indefinitely blocked with good reason.</li>

<dd>I don't think the templates will do any harm, nor am I aware of any confusion surrounding the guideline. Obviously it is frequently mis-cited, but so is just about every guideline, by those cholerics among us who when in dispute will throw anything remotely applicable at all at their nemesis. human nature. I think it is unlikely that the templates will see a lot of use, however, since POINT-violators are typically experienced wikipedians who are well aware of the guideline, so that a link to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> (or even mere unwikified mention of POINT) will suffice; there is also no "5PR" (five POINT rule) prescribing that a user must be warned four times before a block.

<dd>Thanks dab, the different levels weren't really meant as a 5 point rule but were meant more to correspond to a given level of POINT violation. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 16:58, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I think that someone who disrupted Wikipedia to make a point would probably be blocked immediately if the behavior was disruptive enough. For instance, if someone who didn't like his favorite articles being tagged for deletion went ahead and started tagging all articles linked from the main page for deletion, this would be sufficiently disruptive to merit an immediate preventive block.</dd>

<dd>Also I'd deprecate the use of templates for all but the most routine problems such as vandalism. Even in those cases it may be better to make personal contact and write a message in English. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 17:02, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Generally, experienced Wikipedians find template warnings to be very insulting. That's usually not a problem with the testx and spamx templates because most recipients of these are inexperienced or chronic vandals/spammers. <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violations may come from both experienced and inexperienced users, but usually the more experienced ones, so I don't see these being used very often. {{<a href="../../../p/o/i/Template%7EPoint_c8bc.html" title="Template:Point">point</a>}} might see some use to the less experienced, but that's about it. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 17:45, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes as I created them, I figured that {{<a href="../../../p/o/i/Template%7EPoint_c8bc.html" title="Template:Point">point</a>}} (corresponding to Deathphoenix's words) and {{<a href="../../../p/o/i/Template%7EPoint5_9fcb.html" title="Template:Point5">point5</a>}} (corresponding to Tony Sidaway's words) would be the most viable in terms of general usage. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 18:09, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well of course one can be bold and change the text to be less patronizing (something I honestly don't see) but on the other hand there is the TfD option.

<dd>I really don't like the edit-warring, and RFCU confirms they are the same user (as if the identical edit patterns were not enough). However, <a href="../../../t/c/s/User%7ETcsh_48e4.html" title="User:Tcsh">Tcsh</a> has been engaging in the same pattern of edit-warring from the other direction (and his main aim seems to be to keep a link to a parody of Kamm's blog in the article about Chomsky, which seems to me to be completely irrelevant). I'd feel happier if you'd blocked Tcsh too, because I can't see any difference at all, other than the fact that they sit on different sides of the political fence.

<dd>First off, Batman2005's userpage contains no personal attacks. Paul is refering to linking John Kerry to the word <i>douche</i>, which doesn't violate NPA. NPA refers to editors, not real-life people like John Kerry. If Batman2005 feels like linking John Kerry to his userpage, I see no reason why he shouldn't be able too. And, I know my conduct isn't very nice, it's who I am. ;-) <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoe_Epsilon_7345.html" title="User:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#CD2626">The King</font></a> <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#CD2626">of Kings</font></a> 05:10, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>NPA says no personal attack anywhere. It doesn't say "but it's ok if they aren't a Wikipedia user". If it's not okay to make personal attacks to other users, why is it okay to make them to general people? Personal attacks are inappropriate, regardless who they are addressed towards. And you admit that your conduct is mean, even though that would mean you see nothing wrong with violating <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7Ecivil_f2e5.html" title="WP:civil">WP:civil</a>? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a> 05:14, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The reason we have the NPA rule is that personal attacks prevent good collaborative editing, and that is bad for Wikipedia. John kerry doesn't edit wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 05:20, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>No you're missing the point!</i> Let's keep the pointless comments to ourselves okay? I think the point Theresa knott is making is that if it is not disruptive to Wikipedia, it's okay to do. However the fact that we have a {{defwarn}} tag would seem to support that any personal attacks are not allowed, which is what NPA literally says. If it's fine and appropriate for Wikipedia, why do we have the defamation warning and a policy that supports the position in the first line? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a> 05:31, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Three problems with that:
<ol>
<li>It's a double standard; why is it okay to insult someone in one case but not another? How can you not say that attacking someone should never be allowed.</li>
<li>If, by chance, John Kerry were to sign up on Wikipedia, are people going to chase down everyone who previously was allowed to attack him and now remove their insults?</li>
<li>What if I knew (or was perhaps friends with) one of the people attacked. Do you not see a conflict there?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Lastly, I would still like you to show me where NPA says it does not apply to people outside of Wikipedia. It explicitly says no attack anywhere, so can you find where it explicitly says unless they aren't a wikipedia editor? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a> 05:59, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My two cents is that attacking/insulting someone who isn't a Wikipedia editor isn't <i>per se</i> prohibited, though (in my opinion), the less the person is a public figure the less the leeway for it. However, attacking/insulting someone who isn't a Wikipedia editor <b>with the intent to provoke a reaction from Wikipedia editors</b> is intentionally disruptive and intended to degrade the editing process, and is, as far as I'm concerned, subject to admin review and (if necessary) sanctions. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:51, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe, but since I haven't actually seen Batman2005's contribution to the polity nor was my general comment on the (in my opinion) overly narrow interpretation of NPA policy being floated in any way addressing Batman2005's contribution to the polity, I fail to see the relevance of the question. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 06:09, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I guess if Kerry had an account on Wikipedia, then we should take down personal attacks against him, but thats a one and ten billion chance of him joining this site.

<li>My thoughts on this issue: <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> is fairly clearly directed at Wikipedia contributors, therefore I do not believe Batman2005's user page to be in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. However, in the interests of harmonious editing, and remembering that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">not a soapbox</a>, I suggest that Batman2005 tones it down. I also think Moe giving a blatant vandal warning template to Paul wasn't very tactful, as there was discussion ongoing and a more personal message along the lines of editing other people's userpages often isn't the best think to do in situations like these. Finally, instead of arguing about what exactly is a personal attack, why not go and edit something that will contribute to building an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 20:20, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Gosh that was a lot, in fact I did tone it down, quite a bit...you should have seen it before, gosh was it inflammatory.

I'm not attacking anyone, except maybe SAE's but at the school I went to they really were gay, as in....they were men liking men, so its true. If there was a link to the specific chapter I would have linked that! Gosh, Petros is right, lets all go edit other pages, i'm sure there are plenty of arguments that we could start elsewhere! Additionally, i think that I read somewhere that wikipedia was not censored and then something about the protection of free speech. Sure i can be punished for it, but as far as i know..John Kerry, Freddy Adu and Stanley Williams haven't complained about it.

<p>Comment: I feel this is an bad time to ban Zeq from <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Apartheid (disambiguation)">Apartheid (disambiguation)</a>. First, the article is protected anyway right now. Second, he's recently started, on the Talk page, to agree with some compromise wording. Nobody else in the edit war has been at all enthusiastic about compromise since the page was protected. If you're going to ban him from the article, please do so after or shortly before unprotecting the page. I don't know enough about the history of Zeq's editing to comment on the other articles. <a href="../../../s/u/-/User%7ESu-laine.yeo_5d6d.html" title="User:Su-laine.yeo">Su-laine.yeo</a> 15:08, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I know he can still use the talk page.

<p>I've examined Zeq's contributions to that article and still don't think they were constructive. I don't feel able to lift the ban.</p>
<p>This ban has generated a very large amount of material on my talk page, most of it from Zeq himself, and much of it based on the proposal that Homeontherange (<span class="plainlinks">talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Homeontherange_caa2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Homeontherange"><span title="Contributions: Homeontherange">contribs</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Homeontherange" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Homeontherange" rel="nofollow"><span title="Page moves: Homeontherange"><font color="#002BB8">page moves</font></span></a> • <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Homeontherange_f239.html" title="Special:Blockip/Homeontherange"><span title="Block User:Homeontherange">block user</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" rel="nofollow"><span title="Blocklog: Homeontherange"><font color="#002BB8">block log</font></span></a></span>) (aka Homey) is a major abuser. My feeling on this is that the presence of an abusive editor does not excuse abusive edits by other editors. In the interests of sanity I am now removing all edits by Zeq from my talk page; he is flooding the page with indigestible volumes of counter-argumentation that in no way mitigates his abuse of his probation. The removed edits by Zeq and others are in the history:</p>

<p>Hi Tony - I want to add my voice to the people opposed to your banning of Zeq from <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a>. ....I agree that the phrase "Hafrada Wall" is not a common usage term and, barring it appearing in very limited circumstances, does not warrant elevation to the status of 'sometimes used', and as such, is not notable enough to include in the article in question. I agree that Zeq was correct to remove it, and in any case, do not find this particular edit enough grounds to ban him from the article. About 69 percent of those editing articles about Israel and Palestine would have to be banned if a simple edit such as this was cause to be banned. I hope you will understand.

<p>Tony, could I ask you to reconsider the ban of Zeq from <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_Barrier_21bc.html" title="West Bank Barrier">West Bank Barrier</a>? It's true that Zeq edits from a strong POV (he believes that articles about Israel are biased against Israel), but it's also true that he regularly faces editors on the other "side" who hold equally strong POVs. In the case of the edit that seems to have triggered the ban, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli_West_Bank_barrier&amp;diff=57045132&amp;oldid=57040975" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli_West_Bank_barrier&amp;diff=57045132&amp;oldid=57040975" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> it looks to me as though the link was added for the sole purpose of including some anti-Barrier material. The barrier is not called the <i>Hafrada</i> fence or wall "in English," as the edit states, because <i>Hafrada</i> is a Hebrew word, and the previous sentence explains its usage. The link that was added, supposedly to support the edit, did not explain the use of the term <i>Hafrada</i>, but was just another biased article from a group of anti-Barrier campaigners called the Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center. I think Zeq was arguably right to remove it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:51, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>*Homey: Regardless of the fact that you may have had good reasons, it is VERY bad form for an admin to block anyone when they are having a dispute with, when they (the admin) is involved in writing the article (besides I have <i>never</i> heard of a "3 minute block" -- is that meant to frighten and intimidate?) The correct thing would be to call on a one or two NEUTRAL admins, not involved with this article, and ask them for their input. If they feel that someone is overstepping the rules then <i>they</i> should give a warning to the person they feel is wrong and then if he disregards that warning take the needed action, by all means, as long as <i>they</i> can justify themselves.

<p>I am not vandalising. A bot is accusing me of vandalising. And we all know how wrong computers can be. 203.158.34.114 12:55, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>he is trolling, not vandalising. His edits are slightly substandard, but not straightforward vandalism (<i>Christians have a history of forcing their beliefs by the sword. Christians flourished like grass as they <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman.html" title="Roman">Roman</a> army forced Christianity on the people they conquered which mainly were <a href="../../../p/a/g/Pagan.html" title="Pagan">Pagans</a></i>). I am not even completely sure this is a troll, we might just be looking at a genuinely clueless individual, or a kid. On Wikipedia, cluelessness paired with aggression equals waste of time for everybody, so point the editor to some introductory reading but block if he persists shouting nonsense all over the place :) <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:07, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<p><small>Moved from WP:AN talk page</small></p>
<p>I am currently in somewhat of a edit war with BrianZ over at <a href="../../../a/t/k/Atkins_diet.html" title="Atkins diet">atkins diet</a>. Basically the situation is :</p>
<p><b>1)</b> BrianZ added his website to Wikipedia</p>
<p><b>2)</b> GraemeL removed it and slapped his wrist for self promition</p>
<p><b>3)</b> BrianZ underhandedly removed all of the External Links and has basically stated that if his link isnt allowed then none should be</p>
<p><b>4)</b> BrianZ has been deleting any external links that are being posted to the site regardless of if they are relevant.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>BrianZ is trying to use the third revert rule to block me from reverting the external links section back to what it was before making the change.</p>
<p>This issue is currently in mediation. at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-06-04_Atkins_Diet" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-06-04_Atkins_Diet" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-06-04_Atkins_Diet</a></p>
<p>I have been trying to work this out with him. But it seems that he is not interested in working things out.</p>
<p>He has been very devious and often resorts to smoke screen tactics when trying to resolve the issue. Please read the mediation.</p>
<p>I would suggest a few of the following solutions:</p>
<p>1) Some admin or other unbiased person step in and help us mediate this at : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-06-04_Atkins_Diet" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-06-04_Atkins_Diet" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-06-04_Atkins_Diet</a></p>
<p>2) Some admin step in and make a clear decision on the issue at hand.</p>
<p>3) Pleae do not blindly follow BrianZs request for three R suspention. I did revert to undo his reverts. I consider his acts vandalism. I personally feel that he should be suspended until the issue is resolved or I would even say just suspend us both.</p>
<p>Any help would be very appreciative. Thank you, Tom --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommac2_146e.html" title="User:Tommac2">Tommac2</a> 15:21, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
