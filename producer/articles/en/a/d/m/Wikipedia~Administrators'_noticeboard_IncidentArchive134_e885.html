<dd>I don't know if my view on this is welcome here - if not it is easily removed - but to me that does seem to start off honestly/legitimately and develop into somewhat of a lengthy tirade against <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">SandyGeorgia</a> herself. There are certainly one or two reasonably clear personal attacks in there, and only an admin would be best placed to take a stance on those given the limited severity, but I'm particularly concerned that the articles talk page may not be the place to talk about a given editor of that article in such a way and almost as if he or she is not there. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 21:37, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have replaced the salient and unresolved points. There is nothing to be gained by brushing this issue under the carpet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do have the advantage of all of you in knowing exactly who <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">User:SandyGeorgia</a> is and have years of experience of what she is capable of in terms, not only of abusing Wikipedia for her own ends, but also damaging any editor with whom she associates.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Strangely I had arrived at exactly the same conclusions before I even guessed her identity...and was just as alarmed by her behaviors.</dd>

<dd>Enough. Your stalking, allegations, and accusations of meatpuppetry, sockpuppetry, personal attacks, etc. at User:SandyGeorgia end here. This is your only warning.

<dd>There is no "reluctance" you only have to look at her actual behaviors with an open mind, particularly towards, for example <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperFlanker_20c7.html" title="User:SuperFlanker">User:SuperFlanker</a>.

<dd>I have a life, I don't have 18 hours a day to track back every convoluted little strategy for ARBCOM (thus satisfying the rather sick needs of this individual who has stalked me for years with JUST that in mind). I will not enable her by silence either. I feel it is the responsibility of admins (that goes with the power) to actually OBSERVE a situation like this for themselves, with an open mind, not to try and brush it under the carpet.</dd>

<dd>Joel is not just some user. He is an administrator - the final decision makers here at Wikipedia. He didn't tell you that you had no basis, and he explicitly told you how to pursue this through channels. It is scarcely <b>"evidence"</b> to tell someone that Sandy posts from home (AOL) as well as work (and on the road for work and vacation - hotel access) and therefore is to be found post with many many IP addresses since she stated all these things last Friday when you used Wiki to do some phishing on 3 different users.

<p>Erm, or you could have just followed protocol for editing articles and instead of removing it, you could have reworded part of it to take out the indentifying info if that's what you feel you must do. At least it would appear as cooperation. As said many ties, that disscussion does not belong on the articles talk page. It can be found via the diffs if you need to use it as evidence. ARBCOM is the place for that kind of discussion if it's truly nessecary, and it's up to you whether you wish to take it there or not - the fact is that it's where it belongs, not on the articles talk page.

<dd>To be honest I would rather leave him the freedom to do his own rewording as there really isn't an obvious way to take the ID out of the existing wording without considerable alteration of meaning, and, as an admin, he should really have had a BIT more sense than to identify the person I was referring to.

<dd>OH I know THAT...but my point is more that when the editors who raised the issue return it would be nicer for them if it hadn't just been dismissed, as though they, and their point of view didn't matter. I reaqlise that a lot of the time, when people raise the same issues on Wikipedia it's a little bit stage managed, but not in this instance. I do not even know the editors who raised it, and I don't agree with all the changes they wished to make, but what I DO support is their right to make them without permission of <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">User:SandyGeorgia</a>,and their right to query a situation where that is not the case.</dd>

<p><b>Belated response from SG.</b> As I announced in several places on Wiki many days ago, I am away from home and have limited internet access. It is interesting that yet another campaign against me has been launched in my relative absence.</p>
<p>I am very active at <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">WP:FAR</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>; this campaign against me has continued for almost two months, since I happened to cross paths with Zeraeph on the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_review_Asperger_syndrome_086a.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article review/Asperger syndrome">Asperger syndrome FARC.</a> She has now smeared my name on three ANIs, three mediations (in which she refuses to participate), and across multiple talk pages, but has yet to present a single example of the "abuse" she alleges. She has now moved on to claiming I'm someone I'm not, although I have had no interaction with the articles she edits since shortly after the AS FARC.</p>
<p>While I appreciate any and all attempts to help stop the unfounded smear, innuendo, and ongoing personal attacks against me, three refusals to mediate and a CheckUser which exonerated me have convinced me that no amount of reason is going to convince Zeraeph that I am not who she thinks I am.</p>
<p>After the CheckUser showed her wrong, she made the unfounded and libelous attack on me: "User:SandyGeorgia is actually an erotomanic stalker who attached herself to both myself and one other person since February 1999. If I had realised THAT I would never have requested a 'checkuser', because it was a waste of time, she's just too practised at sockpuppetry and meatpuppetry to get caught that easily." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-08-29_Talk:Asperger_Syndrome&amp;diff=73174387&amp;oldid=73170100" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-08-29_Talk:Asperger_Syndrome&amp;diff=73174387&amp;oldid=73170100" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> She has also removed past warnings about this behavior from her talk page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zeraeph&amp;diff=64042933&amp;oldid=64040782" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zeraeph&amp;diff=64042933&amp;oldid=64040782" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></p>
<p>I hold little hope that mediation or ArbCom will have any effect on this escalating pattern of attack, as it appears that no amount of reason or evidence will effect Zeraeph's imagination. I hope that admins will enforce that she stop accusing me of being someone I'm not, and attacking me across many article pages, and I respectfully wish that the many AOL users who have followed her from an off-Wiki dispute to Wikipedia would 1) stop e-mailing me about the problem (I'm not interested in the drama), and 2) stop bringing that dispute to Wiki: Wiki admins are able to deal with this. Since there has yet to be a shred of evidence to back up a single claim made by Zeraeph, I believe the wisest course of action for me is to ignore the rants.

<dd>This looks like some CVU political thing. Silly, in my opinion, but that's not grounds for deletion. It was deleted for personal attacks, but I don't see where there are personal attacks.

<p>Reading it, it's somewhat offensive but not really a personal attack. On the other hand, I'm having a hard time figuring out what <i>use</i> it is. One does get tired of petty wiki-politics.

<dd>The "principal of least drama" is what led to WWII, by the way. If you keep letting people do what they want because stopping them would cause a little bit of trouble, eventually it grows to become such a large problem that when you <i>must</i> deal with it, it becomes a <i>huge</i> amount of trouble. Do you honestly think that this userbox was okay? If not, don't fight against its justifiable deletion. If we start letting things like this survive we're going to be slipping backwards again in the whole userbox mess and eventually we'll be back to the "This user is a pedophile" ones again. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 18:43, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am uninterested in the "drama". And this has nothing to do with pedophiles. The userbox does not in any way imply political affilation/beliefs to anything. It merely suggests I dislike one action taken against me by an unspesified user. The implications of that action is present.</dd>

<dd>Firstly <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. I'd have deleted that userbox any day and from any user. It has nothing to do with DENY or CVU - so cut the paranoid victim bit. Secondly, don't wikilawyer. It didn't concern an 'unspecified user' - the user may not have been named, but he was specified - you identified the subject as the one who 'took CVU from you'. Basically, if you want to criticise Essjay that's fine by me, I've no idea what your dispute is about and no interest in taking sides. But community is built either by discussion or <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute mechanisms</a> to settle differences, not be carrying on polemics by userbox.

<dd>Needle essjay? His name wasnt even mentioned. Your average stranger would not even know who or what was this about had you not mentioned his username.

<dd>In this case, the concern is not about what the 'average stranger' would see, feel, or understand about the userbox in question. Rather, it is about what the dozens (perhaps hundreds) of admins and other editors familiar with the involved parties would see. Moreover, <i>Essjay</i> would certainly have recognized who you were referring to. If you feel that you have an unresolved dispute with Essjay, deal with it through formal channels or write the matter off and put it behind you. <i>Don't</i> create userboxes to attempt any sort of dispute resolution—they won't work and they <i>will</i> be deleted. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 20:49, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am appealing my recent 3RR block on the grounds that the following three questions are not answered by somebody--I don’t expect them to be answered because to the best of my knowledge the accusation that I violated 3RR is not true, and therefore there are no answers to these questions. But if somebody can answer these questions than I will not pursue this matter any further. Thank you for your consideration.</p>
<p>The sole definition of a “Revert” - as stated at <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">WP:REVERT</a> is “To revert is to undo all changes made after a certain time in the past. The result will be that the page becomes identical to how it used to be at some previous time”</p>
<p>The accusation made towards me is that I reverted the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vic_Grimes_a384.html" title="Vic Grimes">Vic Grimes</a> page more than 3 times over the course of 24 hours. The following were the edits I made to the page on September 5:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73877744" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73877744" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73877744</a> (3:20) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73874225" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73874225" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73874225</a> (2:54) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73872499" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73872499" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73872499</a> (2:42) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73871536" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73871536" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73871536</a> (2:35) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73871187" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73871187" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73871187</a> (2:33) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73870424" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73870424" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Grimes&amp;oldid=73870424</a> (2:27)</p>
<p>If my edits meet the criterion for constituting three or more reverts, then somebody is obligated to provide me with AT LEAST FOUR links to past versions of the Vic Grimes page (PRIOR to September 5) where the page is “identical to how it used to be at some previous time.” In this case, “some previous time” refers to - as I said just a few lines above - “past versions of the Vic Grimes page (PRIOR to September 5). I am not asking for four links that make the page look NEARLY identical to how it used to be; that is NOT the definition of a revert. I want somebody to provide me with AT LEAST FOUR links where the page is EXACTLY, 110% the SAME as it was at any of the following times on September 4:</p>
<p>3:20 2:54 2:42 2:35 2:33 2:27</p>
<p>If AT LEAST FOUR links cannot be produced, I will continue to pursue this matter because that will indicate to me that my account was wrongfully suspended for <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> despite my not violating the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> policy.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

<dd>I'm not an admin, and have no view on this dispute, and agree that it should be addressed in the context of the prior discussion identified by AMIB. However, I think I understand the source of this user's (actual or feigned) confusion: I just noticed that the definition of "revert" or "reversion" contained in <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">WP:REVERT</a> is <i>not the same</i> as the one provided in <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. This is because WP:REVERT deals primarily with how to accomplish a complete reversion (e.g. to deal with vandalism) whereas WP:3RR deals with prevention of edit-warring. JB196, if you read <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> I think you will see that edits can be a violation of the letter and the spirit of 3RR even if there aren't four <i>identical</i> versions over the course of 24 hours.</dd>
<dd>(after edit conflict) I see JB196 just picked up the same thing. I don't think the definition in WP:REVERT is "outdated" so much as that the two articles are discussing different, though related, concepts. Still, some clarification might be in order. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 19:54, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yeah, good point.

<dd>Jpgordon - that works for me. Although do NOT accuse me again of "wikilawyering" when I did nothing of the sort. You do not correctly understand what "Wikilawyering" means if you believe that pointing out a valid discrepancy between two official policy pages (which has been proven to exist) is "wikilawyering." So anyway, what will be done about this discrepancy. One can obviously be suspended for 3RR without reverting to an "identical" version. The word "identical" needs to be replaced with something else.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 20:05, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, not really. The language in <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> needs to not refer to <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">WP:REVERT</a>, that's all; they're two completely different critters. WP:REVERT is about fixing vandalism, and is actually the sole exception to WP:3RR. You were busily attempting to show that your misbehaviour (edit warring) was justified by your interpretation of Wikipedia policies.

<dd>JPgordon, your definition of "wikilawyering" leaves little or no room for discussing whether a policy was enforced right. If I were "Wikilawyering" I would not have asked for clarification from the very beginning; I would have simply said this is why you are wrong. My edits did not constitute a revert as defined by <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">WP:REVERT</a>, but that is beyond the issue. I am willing to forgive whoever put the suspension in place, and I am also willing to accept that my edits may have constituted a suspension, but CERTAINLY not on the basis of violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> which I did not do. It is not a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> to say that A Man in Black did not read my full first post which addresses all this and instead just said that yes, I did violate <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. JPgordon, which specific part of the article do you think my post falls under? (violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> can't be an answer because I did anything but tring to "disrupt Wikipedia by illustrating a point"; on the other hand I expressed a concern that has since been backed up my several other Wikipedians, so don't try that)<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 23:19, 6 September 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilawyering_a5b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilawyering">Wikipedia:Wikilawyering</a>?

<dd>JB196, read <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. You violated it. You did not violate the letter of <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">WP:REVERT</a>, but that is no argument to say that you did not violate <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. Now, what exception, as listed on the 3RR page, do you claim covers your edits? None. You made the same or very similar edits six times in a row, removing lots of material and making the article noticealy poorer in content. That they were not complete reverts as described in <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7ERevert_be8e.html" title="WP:Revert">WP:Revert</a> is irrelevant as that is explicitly not the definition as used on <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:43, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It would be good to sign up for a Wikipedia account to facilitate things (it's free and doesn't require any personal identification associated with it). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 20:26, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

His IP address left a message on my talk page calling me an asshole. I left a warning, but I thought I'd bring it up here.

<p>Someone using IP [216.148.248.31 wrongly "corrected" the equation for thick cylinder (second row in the table) on September 5th. I restored the original formula the same day. Yesterday 9-6th the same IP 216.148.248.31 started again.</p>
<p>If this was a registered user, I could explain why the original formula is correct (I am a former physics teacher).</p>
<p>I think WP should restore to the 19:03, 22 August 2006 SwiftBot version, and block the page for a few days.</p>
<p>I do not understand why this page is stigmatized with the "quality standards" label. I think that this page is OK and does not need any clean up.</p>

<p>I need an admin to step in here please. I have a user constantly attempting to bully me from participating in an article and basically telling me they do not need to provide a source, and can violate WP:OR. Part of this is a content issue, but the user has now gone on to attempt to attack me and my credibility to push their point, including bringing up past incidents I have had with people RfC/ArbCom/Cabal cases in an attempt to discredit me. If you view the page you will see that its for a straw poll and two users are constantly barraging me with attacks. I have asked them simply to provide a source stating the US has commited a terrorist attack in the context of the SOA. Instead the post a source stating that SOA graduates commit terrorist attacks, I explain to them that if the source is not accusing the US directly, its WP:OR to state that the US has commited those acts by then taking another source that says the US funded them, but does not accuse the US of terrorism.</p>
<p>It has gone to the point where one user Travb has gone on to tell otehr not to respond to me when I attempting to address the issue <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stone_put_to_sky&amp;diff=74266610&amp;oldid=74266482" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stone_put_to_sky&amp;diff=74266610&amp;oldid=74266482" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> They have attempted to gather people to get me banned or blocked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America/strawpolls&amp;diff=74308302&amp;oldid=74307785" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America/strawpolls&amp;diff=74308302&amp;oldid=74307785" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> Only after I pointed out the results of the past RfC's did Travb then state they shouldnt keep threatening me. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America/strawpolls&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74310652" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America/strawpolls&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74310652" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> The user has even gone as far as to create a whole section on the straw poll page for the article specifically bringing up my past encounters. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America/strawpolls#Oppose_part_2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America/strawpolls#Oppose_part_2" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> I am asking that either the long attack on me personally be removed from the straw poll page, or Travb be forced to make a dispute resolution attempt in the form of an RfC or ArbCom case as he is making a case just in the public to discredit me, without the supervision that would normally accompany an RfC or Arbcom case.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>My two cents: This has been a prolonged month long battle after the AfD. Everyone has strong opinions, but myself and User:Zer0faults have been at the center of the debate. Twice before there has been other users, the person who initiated the AfD, and rootolgy (I believe) who posted comments here asking for assistance.</dd>
<dd>I am sorry that User:Zer0faults involved an admin. He has been threatening me for weeks that he will call a <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a> etc.</dd>
<dd>"I have a user constantly attempting to bully me from participating in an article" I actively encourage your participation in the article User:Zer0faults. Where do you get the idea that I do not want you to participate in building consensus and helping build a great wikipedia article?</dd>
<dd>"basically telling me they do not need to provide a source"---"Basically" is the key word. For one long month we have provided ample sources for all of the comments on the talk page. There has been a prolonged battle about wikipedia policy, which User:Zer0faults and other wikiusers have initiated. No sources are accpetable to User:Zer0faults, repeatedly we have provided the sources, and User:Zer0faults refuses them. It has gotten to a point were myself and another user have given up. User:Zer0faults makes several claims on the talk page, but refuses to source his sources. User:Zer0faults has never added a single source to the entire article, he has never provided one source for his claims on the talk page, and yet he expects other wikiusers to continue to provide sources, User:Seabhcan and myself have provided over ten sources on the talk page, none met User:Zer0faults unrealistic standards. In addition, the article has 60 referenced sources. User:Zer0faults has repeatedly said when the article would be unprotected, he would delete referenced sections. This is what initiated the page to be protected in the first place. I ask for page protection to avoid an edit war. I also requested a mediator, who is now mediating the case, started a RfC, and I started a crude straw poll, then actively supported the new official straw poll which User:Zer0faults suggested.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I just want to point out as what Travb is discussing above is a content issue, the article has many many sources that state an event took place. However in regards to many of the events not a single source makes an allegation of state terrorism by the US, hence the opposition. I guess the root of this problem is that Travb wants to be able to connect the dots and I have been telling him he cannot, this angers him and results in the whoel section I linked above which is bringing up past RfC's?Arbcom/Cabal cases etc in an attempt to discredit me, painting me as someone who cannot be worked with, as his quote calls me. I have also been labeled a deletionist for removing unsourced information. I want to keep this AN/I issue which is the attempted bullying and bringing up past incidents to give other editors a negative view of me and my opinions seperate from the content issue. So I am simpyl asking an admin to look at the sections posted above and make a decision if its appopriate to drudge up a users past conflicts in an attempt to discredit them. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 12:57, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We have addressed the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> argument at length, in fact, we have argued every single one of User:Zer0faults policy arguments at length. In one month the wikipage has created two huge archives, a huge talk page, and a large straw poll.</dd>
<dd>"I have also been labeled a deletionist for removing unsourced information" I apologized for this statment, I still await your apology for saying that I was "lying", which you made just today, and that I wasn't assuming good faith, which you stated clear back during the AfD, in fact--Myself and others have repeatedly apologized, and yet you repeatedly refuse to apologize for anything you have said. (more comments in a second---<b>please</b> let me finish.)</dd>
<dd>"not a single source makes an allegation of state terrorism by the US" This is an an untrue claim. Unfortunatly this is the kind of claim which User:Zer0faults continues to recycle.</dd>
<dd>Just today after apologizing several times for allegedly misquoting User:Zer0faults, I wrote:
<dl>
<dd>"I will gladly remove any content you find offensive User:Zer0faults all I ask in return is a simple apology for saying that I was lying. Heck, I will remove any content even without an apology. Please let me know what you find so offensive."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>User:Zer0faults ignored this offer of comprimise, as he has ignored all offers to comprimise.</dd>
<dd>User:Zer0faults has threatened me repeatedly, on his talk page, on the article talk page, on the strawpoll. He has demanded that comments be moved to his talk page. I obliged, grudgingly, and then he threatens me with the admin, archives the comments, and wrote on his page: "<a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Note_to_Posters" title="User talk:Zer0faults">Do not restart discussions here, all discussions moved to archive are considered closed and will be ignored</a>." When User:Seabhcan agreed with me, and then suggested a <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a> (which I later discouraged: "I would ask User:Seabhcan not to threaten Zer0faults with <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a>. Lets all try to build a consensus and stop threatening each other." ) User:Zer0faults responded to User:Seabhcan saying: "Dont talk about it do it. I would love to see the results and your evidence you present." User:Zer0faults has threated a <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a> for weeks. I continue to ask him to stop threatening me, that it does not help to build consensus. He ignores these requests. I brought up his past <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a> past history only after User:Zer0faults refused to stop threatening me. User:Zer0faults is very effective at using wikipedia policy against other wikiusers, instead of attempting to build a consensus, he builds contention and <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a>'s and mediations, as he is doing right now.

<dd>The bold part highlites what they attempted to use as proof of US terrorism in their source they provided. They however left off end portion that states the subject is in fact "the Democractic elements of the Nicaraguan insurgency". Which is quite misleading. You can further see that the source is stating its unclear of the manuals influence and the article itself never makes an accusations of terrorism by the US. However Travb argues that since the Nicaraguan vs. US court case says the US funded them, that the two sources together prove the US funded terrorists, just to point out the court case says specifically that the US did not order these people, that they were not acting on behalf of the US. So as you see selective quoting has also become an issue, apparently now again being used to discredit me. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 13:26, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will abide by User:Feydey's and User:Ngb's assessment, and keep the content dispute on the page, I apologize for draging editors into this argument, I wanted to avoid all of this, but User:Zer0faults continued to threaten me today that he was going to involve an admin. Again, as I wrote on the disputed strawpoll page, before User:Zer0faults started this <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a>:</dd>
<dd>"I will gladly remove any content you find offensive User:Zer0faults all I ask in return is a simple apology for saying that I was lying. Heck, I will remove any content even without an apology. Please let me know what you find so offensive."</dd>
<dd>In fact, I will take the extraodinary step, and say: User:Zer0faults '<b>please</b> delete all of the comments you find offensive on the talk page and the strawpoll page.</dd>
<dd><b>User:Zer0faults: I apologize for offending you.</b></dd>
<dd>As I wrote on the same talk page:</dd>

Till yesterday the template as quite logical, included only <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/d/Tadjikistan.html" title="Tadjikistan">Tadjikistan</a>; but yesterday a new editor, <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZandweb_51b9.html" title="User:Zandweb">User:Zandweb</a>, has started a massive overhaul of the template, reverting as "vandalism" all opposition, and sending messages to users in which he accuses them of pov-pushing.

Zandweb is also blanking some articles, like <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turko-Iranian_8ff5.html" title="Turko-Iranian">Turko-Iranian</a> and when I restored it (my only intervention in the Zandweb-connected disputes), he blanked it again.

<dd>CBD, the most interesting part of the recent events is that you have almost invariably labeled anything an admin has said to Tobias as a personal attack while excusing his most outrageous behavior. That, and your interpretation of policy does not appear to match the community consensus. If you feel that we should redefine the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, we should work it out in the appropriate venue. For this specific instance, the appropriate venue is not in the user talk of a blocked, disruptive, abusive user while undermining appropriate use of admin tools by your colleagues. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 22:50, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Chairboy, most of what you have just said is clearly untrue. I have not labeled the <i>vast majority</i> of things said to Tobias by admins as personal attacks (go ahead, count 'em&#160;:]), I have <i>never</i> excused his behaviour, <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">WP:STUB</a> <i>already</i> conform to what I am saying and indeed would need to be rewritten to countenance A1 deletion of those articles, and the actions of my colleagues in this case have been <b>far</b> from appropriate - as evidenced by the fact that most of those nasty comments above are <i>from</i> admins. You may have a point about venue, but as my primary focus here is on whether policy really 'does not apply to admins' (as seems to me the argument made) I thought this was the best spot for it. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 23:06, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>CBD, I agree that stubs like "The Gaelic script should not be confused with Ogham (ISO code Ogam)," which was one you cited above, should be deleted.

<dd>Amusingly that's the one stub which actually <i>wasn't</i> deleted. I agree <b>that one</b> lacked context, but I can't agree that it was better to leave 'Gaelic script' as a redirect to 'Ogham' given the fact that they ARE different. The user didn't say more than that, because that's all he knew.

<dd>It's not a content dispute. All of those stubs are now healthy articles. I'm disputing the claim that it is "entirely appropriate" for admins to say that users are "being a ridiculous petulant child", "almost pathological", "utterly ignorant", et cetera. Personally, I think that's abuse and harassment. That the same admins were deleting and belittling the user's valid contributions is a related problem. But hey, whatever... apparently it's all good.

<dd>For what it's worth, some of the respect you seem to be wanting from fellow admins may have been lost because of your own past actions. You have a little bit of a reputation of siding with trolls against fellow admins. If you want support from your fellow admins, maybe you should support them a bit more too. Now obviously what Evertype was doing was wrong (and he should probably be blocked for it) ... I just thought you might want to understand that what you're going through right now, with admins siding with this obvious abuser against you, is exactly what a lot of us feel like when you side with someone like Massiveego, just to pick a recent example. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 23:59, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Cyde, what you're suggesting is a great example of pathologically harmful behavior - the idea that we should support each other's actions on the you-scratch-my-back principle. This is detrimental to producing a quality encyclopedia- we should judge each situation on its own merits, nto on the basis of which side our friends are on. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 00:01, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not "pathologically harmful", it's a sensible corollary of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. Presumably administrators have good sense or else they wouldn't have passed RFA. There's no such barrier to entry on regular users. So in a conflict between a regular user (<i>especially</i> when the user is acting trollish) and an administrator, it doesn't make sense to automatically assume that the admin is guilty of admin abuse. I still haven't heard a good explanation of CBD on why he jumped all over the admins who were dealing with that Massiveego RFA troll. And by the way, "You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours" is actually a primate evolutionary explanation of <i>altruism</i>. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 00:20, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because... <i>calling</i> him a "troll" is a personal attack, he was never warned as strongly urged by blocking policy, his block was for a week rather than 24 hours as suggested by blocking policy for a first block, and the actual 'disruption' caused by the action was neglible in comparison to... for example, unprotecting the main page, making silly changes to user pages, et cetera after receiving numerous warnings not to... things which garnered much shorter blocks <i>despite</i> prior warnings, repeated violations, and considerably greater disruption. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 00:25, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But he was warned. He was warned many times, both in responses to individual votes on his RFA, by communication on <a href="../../../b/n/_/WP%7EBN_7f9b.html" title="WP:BN">WP:BN</a> from a bureaucrat, and from me on his talk page, when I urged him to stop being disruptive regarding his RFA activities. And even if he hadn't been warned, which he very much was, I don't agree with the idea that we always have to warn someone before taking action against them, even in especially obvious or egregious cases of trolling, disruption, vandalism, etc. To use a real-life analogy ... "Ohh I'm sorry officer, I was speeding but you didn't give me a warning first" doesn't work.

<dd>Cyde, you're the second admin today I've seen compare admins to cops. I thoguht we were janitors, not cops, and there's the whole thing about blocks being preventative, not punitive.

<dd>On second reading, I can see how you might interpret that as an analogy between admins and police officers, but rest assured that I do not think in those terms. The analogy I was making was with the person who is breaking the rules, not with the person enforcing them. The analogy could just as easily work this way: "Oh, I'm sorry for smearing shit all over the bathroom walls Mr. Janitor, you didn't first give me a warning not to though." Better analogy? --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 01:23, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Like I said, second one today, so it struck me. I know of very little excuse for bypassing warnings, and none at all for forgoing respect, courtesy, and treating people with dignity. Treating someone like a criminal is <i>the most effective way</i> to get them to act like a criminal. (This is CBD's point below.) It's really just about setting up expectations - expecting people to rise to the good, mature, level-headed example you set is a much better approach than expecting them to screw up and "earn a block". (I used to work in criminal corrections in the US, so I know a little bit about what doesn't work.) -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 01:30, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>&lt;sigh&gt; I'm sorry, but it is obvious that most of you are not even reading the passage above / clicking on the links. While there have been a few nasty comments aimed my way that is not at all what I am on about. I am not 'looking for support/respect from my fellow admins'. I'm quite egotistical enough without feeding that by having people <i>respect</i> me. What I am looking for is my fellow admins to stand up and say they really believe that it is appropriate for <i>them</i> (not Evertype) to do these things. People have said that the above comments are "obnoxious", "rather rude", from an "obvious abuser", and "should probably be blocked"... always attributing them to Evertype. What you are missing is that only two of those links are from Evertype. The people writing the nasty 'blockworthy' comments <b>ARE</b> the admins. And they insist that THEY aren't doing anything wrong. That's my point. Nevermind... people agree the comments were wrong. I'll just start blocking my 'fellow admins' when they act in ways that get regular users blocked. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 00:09, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

That's what leads to admin strife and burnouts ... admins get the feeling that trolls are being given more respect than they are, that some people would rather try to perpetually rehabilitate banned problem users than keep their good users around by keeping the problem users <i>out</i>.

<dd>Cyde, are you saying I'm not <b>gentle</b> enough with the 'tough enough to survive' the "tough environment" folks? I must be <i>much</i> more of an ogre than I thought.&#160;:] Seriously though, I take the point... nobody likes criticism. But I disagree very much with the view that we should be 'defining problem users' and then 'working to keep them "out"'. Entirely the wrong mindset. That's what leads to <i>treating</i> them badly and, IMO, often causing them to <i>be</i> 'problem users'. If a user is treated well and goes into meltdown / acts disruptive I have no problems booting them. If they get nasty comments and other questionable treatment it seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy where we the admins have created our own enemy to fight where there needn't have been one. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 01:16, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

I'd like you to read that again, and go back and look at <i>your own edits</i>, and look at them objectively. Because, to be perfectly frank, I think that's a fairly accurate description.

<dd>CBD I am getting a strong impression of you as someone who is getting single-mindedly obsessed with the alleged faults and mistakes of fellow admins. You're losing your sense of proportion here. Sure, we may sometimes speak more harshly than would be perfect or impose a block that should have been shorter, or impose a block that another reasonable person might not impose.

<dd>The other point that is getting lost here is that this noticeboard is a place where admins discuss incidents frankly with each other. Policies such as NPA are not meant to stop that happening. They are primarily meant to stop editors provoking each other when addressing each other in discussions of the actual content of the encyclopedia. Once a matter of conduct gets here, or is being discussed between admins in their talk pages, i.e. when we are trying to sort out problematic conduct in discussions amongst ourselves, I don't think those policies should apply in the same way. There is still good reason to be moderate in our language, of course, but I think we should call a troll a troll. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 02:53, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Ok... Nandesuka, I have said <i>ad nauseum</i> that I do <b>not</b> support/excuse/whatever Tobias's incivility. I have spent considerable time pointing out these problems to him <i>politely</i> (that would be <i>without</i> calling his good faith efforts "inserting nonsense"), citing the applicale policies, et cetera. I'm sorry, but to me that all seems to be 'if someone says I am wrong then they must be saying the other person is right'. No. Incomprehensible to me. Both are wrong. I <i>will</i> acknowledge that I have been stronger in my criticism of the admins than of Tobias... that's true, but does not mean what you seem to take it for. Only that I feel Tobias was already <i>getting</i> MORE than enough criticism. Metamagician3000, when the people 'doing a good job in trying circumstances' are outright denying that Wikipedia's civility and personal attack policies apply to them I disagree that they <i>are</i> 'doing a good job'. I believe that, while well intentioned, they are making matters worse. Anyone who can add two and two knows that badgering and belittling a user who responds badly to <i>normal</i> criticism is going to cause them to explode... so why <i>do</i> it? To <b>make</b> them explode? <i>Cause</i> disruption and then block for it and 'get rid of the bad user'? No. Not kosher. It inevitably turns people against Wikipedia when they didn't need to be. It directly contravenes our policies and just flies against common sense. We shouldn't be creating enemies out of friends. I'm sorry that this upsets some admins, but I feel their efforts <i>need</i> to be undermined when they are <i>clearly</i> leading to turning a well-intentioned contributor into one with a seething hatred of Wikipedia. We are slowly building the ranks at 'Wikipedia Review' and the like for no good purpose. As to 'calling a troll a troll'... great, so when someone decides you are a troll, a 'ridiculous petulant child', or whatever else... they get to call you that, right? Or only admins get to decide that someone is a troll and call them that? Because being nasty like that is <i>good</i> for Wikipedia. Helps to settle arguments. Prevents the user from feeling that people are unfairly insulting them. Just better all around for everyone.

<dd>CBD, when you write "I will acknowledge that I have been stronger in my criticism of the admins than of Tobias." and "I'm sorry that this upsets some admins, but I feel their efforts need to be undermined (snip)", I feel myself frustrated because I can't see how your actions are designed to strengthen the project. Also, you said that you jumped in to defend him BECAUSE there was a group of people that was disagreeing with him. If you examine the history, you'll find that he personally escalated it until there were a bunch of people involved. Just because there is clear consensus against the actions of one person does not mean he has been "ganged up" against, sometimes it actually means that the person in question is wrong. This is what happened here, and you decided to back the "underdog" without regard as to whether his behavior was appropriate or not. You say so yourself in the quotes above. This is not kosher. Perhaps you have "lost it", as the title of this section asks, but "it" is defined as "a sense of perspective and an understanding of what does and doesn't help the project". Please reconsider your position on these matters. There appears to be a clear consensus against your actions so far. If you feel that the policies that have led to this are improper, then perhaps it's time to suggest change, but that will happen in Village Pump and other appropriate venues, not the talk pages of a blocked, disruptive, abusive user (as I said earlier). - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 03:58, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

But seriously... give me <i>any</i> explanation for why Wikipedia was better off without that. Because I cannot see one at all. As to 'consensus'... you have now told me that there is a 'clear consensus' against defending civility, insults made by admins <i>being</i> incivil, and in favor of deleting valid stubs. I came here to check whether that was accurate and... in direct contrast to what you say... I think I've seen a clear concensus that it is <b>not</b>.

Let's take a minute and assume that everything you're saying about everyone else is true. Forget about our edits. Forget about whether what you did and wrote was "justified".

<dd>After reading this back and forth it sounds like Nandesuka just wants CB to acknowledge he too has done wrong, which he has and apologized for, not just those specific words, but basically anything he said out of line. He is now asking admins to be more civil, to obide by the same policies that guide the standard users. It seems others agree that troll has become overused, is not very civil and not very specific. I really do not see why an admin would feel the need to become uncivil to a user, oddly if a user is uncivil to me and I lash back at them, then an admin will not excuse me, but take us both as being uncivil. That same policy or rule or general idea is what should stop admins from then behaving the same way. I really dont see how anyone can argue that admins should be allowed to be uncivil toward standard users here. Its almost like advocating politicians being allowed to walk around spitting on the public. Admins are made admins by the votes of the many, they are here to protect the encyclopedia, not insult the people who participate on it.</dd>
<dd>I really cannot see any benefit to insulting a user before kicking them out basically, are you not just stoking the flame to make them want to vandalize more at that point? making them want to continue their fight to get the last word to have the final say.

<dd>Nandesuka, do you want me to say that I have been harshly criticizing some of my fellow admins? I have and I apologize for that... again. However, assumption of good faith prevents me from believing that you <i>really</i> can't see the difference between strongly arguing with someone with the intent of convincing them that their actions are wrong... and making statements which cannot have <i>any</i> result except to make the person they are about feel bad. Yes, <i>criticizing</i> people can and usually does make them feel bad... but it differs from <i>insulting</i> them in that is not its <b>only</b> purpose. I could certainly have been much 'gentler' in my criticism, and I think <i>have</i> been over the past many months. However, it has come to the point where some admins now say that insulting users is not merely an 'acceptable lapse', but actually "appropriate" and not "incivil at all"... and I'm sorry for my <i>intensely</i> negative reaction to that, but I believe that it absolutely must be resisted in the strongest terms possible. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:42, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I want you to recognize that when you act a certain way, you describe it as "harsh criticism," and when another admin acts the exact same way, you describe it as "abuse."

<dd>And when you can show that I have acted "the exact same way" I will recognize that. But you can't. Because I <i>haven't</i> called anyone a troll, or a ridiculous petulant child, or a bad editor, or <i>any</i> of the numerous personal attacks which <i>some</i> other admins make on a regular basis.

<p>Omg! After repeatedly being called a liar for many days for doing something nice for Tobias while he ignored all my explanations, and though I had ignored his previous gross incivility, I finally said something blunt (though true). Yes indeed, after the continual harassment I endured from him, and the constant defense of his actions by CBD (who never once told him to stop the accusations), I did indeed make one statement that was not sugar coated and sticky sweet. Am I perfect? No. Have I been harrassing and abusing this poor editor? Hardly. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 03:23, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, CBD, but I think it's obvious that admins naturally have a degree of latitude when they are discussing the conduct of problem users among themselves. Of course we have to do so in good faith and to exercise a degree of commonsense moderation. But it is a completely different situation from when a user (who may happen to be an admin) insults someone over a matter of content and thereby escalates a content dispute into personal animosity. To deny this is getting very close to wiki-lawyering IMHO. It's putting the letter of policy over what policy is all about. So I'm not impressed by such examples as an admin referring to Massive ego as a troll during frank discussion of his conduct among admins right here on this very board. Such frank discussion of conduct will always take place here. That's not to excuse everything ever done by any admin, but if you keep using that sort of thing as an example I'll keep thinking that you're losing your sense of perspective. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 03:31, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Woudl this permit me when posting a AN/I report to call the target of the report a troll and petulant child etc.? This seemed like a formal place where complaints are gonig to be addressed and I would think everyone would attempt to remain civil here. Oddly it paints a bad picture if this is all a front and admins are behind the scenes on IRC or whereever calling users trolls etc. The idea that admins should be able to insult users amongst themselves is quite offensive. There is this running joke about their being no cabal, but Cyde talks about admins sticking together and you talk about admins being able to violate NPA when talking to eachother about other users. I am not saying there is a cabal, but its obvious you are almsot advocating that you can insult people simply because you do not agree with their actions. I agree with the post further down the word troll has lost most meaning and really should be used by an admin anyway even for the sake of clarity. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 11:47, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree because this is actually something that affects many users here, and many of them are not taking part in this admin dominated discussion because of its location. There have been many times when suers have complained about admins actions and the reaction is just that the admin was "overzealous". However users maknig similar comments would face a block or repeated action would call for a ban. I actually think this discussion should be opened to a larger group of people that participate here. I have been insulted myself by admins many times. Its almost like baiting people, you call them a troll, they tell you to F off, then you block or ban them for being uncivil, the admin gets told they were overzealous but the user was violating WP:NPA. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 12:09, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Afterword: It would sit more easily if the criticism were of the action rather than the person. "Repeated provocation" is preferable to labelling the individual as a "troll". This also conforms to <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, so sets a good example to other editors. "Trolling" is a word that can be used for any action that someone finds disagreeable and has become debased. More precision would be useful. This is a general observation and not directed at any particular individual. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 09:37, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>CBD, this is a straw man. The right question is not is incivility OK, because it's not! The right question is, do admins have to be perfect in order for you to be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and not act in ways that undercut admins when they are trying to deal with disruptive users? Because I think a number of people are saying that you give the appearance of not doing that, and that while it is a good thing to acknowledge imperfection, that you sometimes do so in a way that makes it a lot more difficult for other admins to do what is needful. No one is perfect. Long time contributors sometimes lose it. Even admins lose it, sometimes... heck, I myself lost it for no good reason yesterday and undercut the work of another admin (out of view, for the most part, of most disruptive users but still). But that does not give vandals and trolls a free pass and it does not make it wrong to call a vandal a vandal, a troll a troll or a POV warrior a POV warrior. Please, reconsider your approach. Because to a certain extent, it IS us against them. Without disregarding the need to assume good faith barring other evidence, sometimes it is. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 13:52, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is more then a personal issue. If you read above admins are basically advocating that they can be incivil under certain circumstances. The problem I think you are glossing over is, a troll is a very subjective comment, and does not help to call a user you feel is being disruptive a troll. The very idea you call them that makes you feel they are just that, however that stands for any personal insult, they are often given under the idea the person feels they are just that. Further it is never admins against users and perpetuating this is just further driving a rift between what admins feel they can do and cannot. Cases are to be evaluated on a case by case basis, not an admin vs user basis. Its quite commical to hear admins joke about an admin cabal against users, but you are basically advocating there is a user cabal against admins. Also I dont think CB is advocating to let people vandalise Wikipedia, just simply that instead of insulting them, you state the events and let it be. Personally insulting people just brings you to their level and if anything is just going to anger them. If someone is a vandal do you think insulting them is going to make them walk away or just use a proxy? Since there is no good in insulting people, perhaps the idea should be that noone can insult anyone else, and that users and admins should be equally understood to sometimes "lose it" --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:36, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I concur. When I have moderated forums in the past, we were always very careful to be a paragon of civility. It sets a dangerous example for anyone to be incivil towards another. Matters are not helped by wikipedia's 'soft security', which favours people viewing all policies as being not that important and open for debate. This makes statements such as 'troll' (defined as encouraging others to be uncivil and to do personal attacks) hard to accurately define within the wikipedia system. But yes, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> are supposed to apply to everybody, with no exceptions. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 14:52, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, it is sadly <i>not</i> a straw man. Indeed, you just made the very claim I described... 'it is not wrong to call a troll a troll'. I'm saying <i>it is</i> wrong. Further, the <i>policy</i> says it is. So... if consensus has really changed such that we believe this ISN'T wrong, as multiple admins keep saying, let's update the policy to explain why it is a good thing. Instead of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">"Accusatory comments such as "George is a troll", or "Laura is a bad editor" can be considered personal attacks if said repeatedly"</a> we could have, "Accusatory comments such as 'George is a troll', or 'Laura is a bad editor' can be considered personal attacks if said repeatedly - UNLESS they are being said by an admin, in which case they are merely the truth and will no doubt serve to increase harmony and productive editing." Or whatever wording you prefer. But if you can't actually make a case for <b>why</b> 'it isn't wrong' then I think it would be a <b>very</b> good thing for Wikipedia if admins stopped <i>doing it</i> and saying <i>it is perfectly acceptable</i>. I'm all for 'people are human and make mistakes which should be forgiven'... but that <i>isn't</i> the claim you are all making. You are saying, 'this is not wrong'. I have no problem with, 'oops I messed up, sorry'. I <b>do</b> have one with 'it is perfectly acceptable for me to call a user a ridiculous petulant child'. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 14:31, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No it IS a straw man because you're on a tangent. This NEEDS to be about your taking this to the point where it undercuts admins trying to make improvements by removing disruptive users. If policy needs to be changed to clarify that it's OK to say "you are acting like a ridiculous petulant child" when the user is in fact acting that way (is there any reasonable person here who does not think Tobias has acted that way in the past) then I suggest policy be changed. Policy lags practice anyway. But your own actions in these matters are starting to themselves verge on disruption. I sent you am mail pointing out furtehr things that Tobias was doing, asking you (pursuant to our agreement) that you speak to him about it, and what I got back was that I was being naughty in describing what he was doing. I suspect you're far from the norm now, CBD. Please reconsider your actions. A spade sometimes IS a spade and it is not useful to circumlocute TOO much. A disruptive user sometimes IS an adversary of the encyclopedia and it is not useful to deny that. Given everything else equal, you should presume that the Admin is acting in good faith, and the user acting in disruptive ways ... is not. Or perhaps one of us misunderstands how adminship works. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:51, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How is someone suppose to assume an admin is acting in good faith when they are running around breaking policy in the process? Further the issue is still the same, are you stating admins can insult people and violate WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA as long as they are doing it in a good faith effort to stop a user from being disruptive? Can a user then take this action since WP:NPA and WP:CIVIL do not point out this case of admin exclusion. I still do not see the point in calling someone you feel to be a troll, a "troll", what purprose does it serve other then to insult and probably infuriate the user in question? --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 15:00, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What Lar said. Besides, I'm getting sick of what seems more and more like obsessive wikilawyering. Yes, we do want a very high standard of civility to prevail when people are discussing encyclopedia content. Admins should be exemplary in that respect. Yes, we'd like that high standard to apply everywhere on the site as far as possible. Yes, as admins, we should be as gentle and polite to other users as we can. After all, we were chosen partly because we showed some ability to be civil when involved in difficult situations (at least that is a criterion that I felt I had to meet). But as admins we <i>also</i> have to be able to make decisions not just about encyclopedic content but about <i>users</i>. We should always be as polite as we reasonably can, but there are some places/situations where we need to be able to discuss other users frankly, because we just do have the responsibility to make, test, and sometimes defend judgments about them. In those situations it is best to call a troll a troll or state frankly that someone seems to be behaving like a petulant child. Part of what is required of us is the good judgment to know when such frankness is appropriate and when it is not, but this board is one place where it is more likely to be appropriate than other places on the site. CBD can complain about this forever, but it won't change as long as we have those responsibilities, and we could not carry out our responsibilities properly without that degree of leeway. Any written policy has to be interpreted and applied with regard to that reality. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 15:09, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>In many circumstances giving warning messages to admins or other users after they understandably express frustration at incorrigible editors both a) undermines the admins and b) helps contribute to user-burn out. Furthermore, in a few cases telling a user precisely what they are acting like has helped get them to stop. This does not of course make such messages entirely acceptable. What I do when I wish to remind an admin or long-term user of NPA in these circumstances is send them a politely worded email. This seems to have most of the benefits of formal warnings without the associated problems. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:14, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be honest, I think such things are entirely unacceptable to be said publically.

<p>I have no problem with people helping me be a better admin and a better contributor, if the message is delivered in the right place, and I think CBD's civility campaign is fine enough, here. In fact I've complained about lack of civility in others here before myself. Where I have a problem is when an uninvolved admin comes in to the middle of an administrative action, and by complaining about the civility of the admins trying to handle the situation, undercuts those admins, giving the user reason to continue to act like a prat. (Yes, that's right, users sometimes actually do act like prats). CBD, please stop inserting yourself into administrative actions and undercutting the admins on the front line. If you must give advice, do so in a way that doesn't undercut the admin who is in the middle of trying to fix things. It would be <b>greatly</b> appreciated by myself, and I suspect others. And Zer0faults, I'm not really seeing your contributions to this thread as in any way useful, I am afraid. Paraphrasing: "Don't annoy the easily annoyed"&#160;???

<dd>The idea is not insult people at all, but if you feel someone is being a petulant child, then you are acknowledging they are easily annoyed and so insulting them really doesnt seem very smart does it? Perhaps you dont think I am helping because you rather keep this limited to CB, but its really a bigger issue as admins are stating they have a right to insult non-admin contributors, or anyone for that matter. There are no exceptions in the policy for admins that need to insult people so they do not get burn out, however that works. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 15:35, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Lar, when an admin reaches the point of, as you say, 'trying to remove a user' I believe that admin <i>needs</i> to be 'undercut'... because they are actively working for the detriment of Wikipedia. We should <i>never</i> be "trying" to remove a user. We should either be working to help a user or removing them when it becomes apparent that there is no way to get them to contribute positively. There is no 'trying to remove' stage. When you badger a user who you know is prone to reacting badly to criticism you are not making the situation better. You are working to remove them... by goading them into disruptive behaviour. The fact that it <i>works</i> and you can then get rid of the user does not change the fact that what you have 'accomplished' is the transformation of a long-time positive contributor with a civility problem into someone with a reason to hate Wikipedia. To me, that just doesn't seem like a good plan. As to your comments about the e-mail... apparently my sense of humor... and the smiley... did not translate well. Sorry, I'd have thought that, "BTW... 'prat'... personal attack. Bad Lar. Naughty. Mean.&#160;:]", was fairly obviously a joke poking fun at my own 'hyper-sensitivity' on this issue. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 15:52, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Such disruption as trolling or vandalism (for example) is incivil in itself. Giving such incivility a name that specifies its type is not incivil. Perhaps it is incivil to say that "MemberX is a troll", but it is not civil to make a factual statement such as "I consider MemberX to be trolling because...", or "MemberX has a reputation/history of trolling".

<dd>There is truth in that. Even someone as "warped and oversensitive" as myself doesn't object to calling a user with nothing but clear vandalism edits a "vandal"... but calling a user with positive contributions (even a handful, let alone thousands) a "troll" or "bad editor" is to me a clearly different matter. I suppose it's an 'assume good faith' issue. If there is any reason to give the person the benefit of the doubt you should... and name calling is wholely inappropriate. If they've never done a single good thing... well heck just block them and don't bother putting a name on what they are.&#160;:] --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:12, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CBD, I'm not sure I ever used the phrase "trying to remove a user" in this context. At least not on this page that I could find. Or if I did, I didn't mean it as being out to get a user or bait them into a blockable offense. I did say "trying to fix things", though. And thats where your well meaning but ultimately misguided insertions are causing breakage of the fixing process. Please stop undercutting other admins. It's really that simple. Because, when you carry it too far, you're acting in a disruptive manner. Well intentioned or not. Contradicting an admin who is giving a civility warning to a user, good contributor or not, who has a history of ACTING like a petulant child, because the admin wants that user to settle down and fly straight... just is not good. Please stop undercutting other admins.

<dd>There is nothing to show that it is a "he" (except for the male pic).

<p>I have permabanned Plautus Satire and protected his talk page. Plautus has twice sat out year bans, come back, and clearly flagged that he intends to be his usual self. Truth be told, there were grounds for a community ban last time, but the arbcom inexplicably laid down a year ban overwriting a clear consensus for a community ban. There's no reason to deal with this a third time. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 04:34, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>MONGO, I feel that you are also frequently guilty of POV pushing, and appear to me to often be unwilling to be civil and polite.

<p>In defense of MONGO here, his opinion that the subject of the AfD is <i>conspiracy theory nonsense POV cruftist</i> is, as one other editor put it "Bang on the money" and is the emerging consensus in the debate.

<p>I'm a fairly experienced editor, ~4000 edits now, on a number of topics. I've run into a major issue though on one sensitive article dealing with racism against Jews: <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-Semitism_dc04.html" title="New anti-Semitism">New anti-Semitism</a>. The problem is that I can't edit the article in the least. When I do, I am reverted instantly and then a series of accusations of various sorts are made against me. The problem is I am not doing what these accusations say but the accusations are effective in making sure I can't edit the article.</p>
<p>Here is the before and after of the change I made yesterday. I change the bold phrase:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In September 2006, the British parliament released a report after a 10-month inquiry by prominent MPs from all three major political parties into anti-Semitism in Britain, chaired by the former Europe Minister <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_MacShane_b216.html" title="Denis MacShane">Denis MacShane</a>. The report concludes that verbal abuse, harassment, and violence against Jews and their institutions in the UK has reached 'worrying levels,' <b>and accuses left-wing activists and Muslim extremists of using criticism of Israel as a 'pretext'</b> for spreading anti-Semitism. McShane described what he called a 'witch's brew' of anti-Semitism involving the far left and 'ultra-Islamist' extremists."</dd>

The report concludes that verbal abuse, harassment, and violence against Jews and their institutions in the UK has reached "worrying levels." <b>The report, while it emphasized the right to criticize or protest against Israeli government actions, states that criticism of Israel sometimes 'provided a pretext'</b> for spreading anti-Semitism. McShane described what he called a "witch's brew" of anti-Semitism involving the far left and 'ultra-Islamist' extremists."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I made that change based on this sentence from the original source:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Though emphasising the right of people to criticise or protest against Israeli government actions, it says 'rage' over Israeli policies has sometimes 'provided a pretext' for anti-semitism."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Because of my change above, SlimVirgin and Jayjg accused me of trying to remove the various key points <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74093822" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74093822" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74096761" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74096761" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, of whitewashing and POV <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74098586" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74098586" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, and of distorting thing with my own opinion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74181543" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74181543" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>. The only way accusation that some could have made sense was if one stopped reading through the paragraph half way. The problem is that none of these accusations by SlimVirgin or Jayjg are true, but it doesn't seem to matter. It's really quite strange, over the top and frustrating. Is my change really such a distortion of the original that I deserve such accusations and to be marginalized so effectively?</p>
<p>There is the related issue of whether SlimVirgin is exerting ownership (see <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>) over this article via these types of over the top threats. Here are the current edit counts for this article for the top six editors&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>SlimVirgin - 642 edits</li>
<li>Jayjg - 158 edits</li>
<li>CJCurrie - 147 edits</li>
<li>Homeontherange - 67 edits</li>
<li>Viriditas - 66 edits</li>
<li>Jmabel - 66 edits</li>
</ul>
<p>I have 10 edits (most of which were reverted by either SV or Jayjg) of the content of the article, although more to the discussion page.</p>
<p>This is the same article that SlimVirgin warned me not to edit and threatened that "there would be consequences" if I did. I reported that incident to this page back in July here <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive124_64b2.html#SlimVirgin_requested_me_to_not_edit_article" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive124">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive124#SlimVirgin_requested_me_to_not_edit_article</a>. From my perspective, I can't help but connect this incident of over the top reaction to a minor and fairly accurate change to that past warning not to edit the article.</p>
<p>Suggestions on how best to deal with this is appreciated. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 15:03, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bhouston was the one who added his own nuance to what was a very close paraphrase of the article.

<dd>I'm not sure exactly what Bhouston is objecting to. SlimVirgin has spent a great deal of effort turning something that was fairly unfocussed and used variable quality sources into an encyclopedic article that makes use of literally dozens of high-quality sources. I was an earlier editor of the article, and have also tried to help out with the cleanup, though obviously to a lesser extent. Are these edit counts now to be held against us? As regards the quotation, Wikipedia articles aren't quote repositories; the report itself is 66 pages long, do you plan to quote all of it? I hope you're not planning to turn it into an unreadable mess like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_lobby_in_the_United_States" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_lobby_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">this article you wrote</a>.

<dd>As mentioned in the above comment, there is little wrong with this particlar edit. It is indeed a positive contribution and takes an element of <i>potentionally</i> questionable POV on the source, replacing it with something that is far more closely connected to the source itself, thus making it far more neutral. Nobody will deny the good work that anybody has done to an article, but neither should those who have done such good work prevent others from making a valid, worthy, good faith contribution. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 20:17, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Recently I have made a change in the article Commitment ordering. After logging in I was returned to the article without clicking the return. At the article I was NOT logged in. I refreshed, logged in again, but the same.</p>
<p>Then I noticed that when I edit, I'm logged in again. I edited, saved, and was returned to the article. Again I was NOT logged in. I could not see the latest change in the article. However it appeared in History, and in Diff.</p>
<p>I sent a message</p>

<p>Subject: Am I blocked?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>My user name is Comps.</p>
<p>I recall that a couple of months ago I got a message about somebody using my IP (Some user name with "Horse" was mentioned, I think), and I had trouble to log in. But after several attemps it was OK. Today I wrote an update, and after returning to the article (Commitment Ordering) I was not logged in, I did not see the change, but it appeared in History and Last.</p>
<p>This is not the normal behaviour of Wikipedia. Is something wrong, or it means that I'm blocked? Why? I'm not aware of any violations.</p>
<p>Pls advise.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<hr />
<p>Death Phoenix kindly answered to my mail, and advised me as things developed.</p>
<p>Later I noticed the following:</p>
<p>1. This happened only with the Commitment ordering article, NOT with other articles, so it was clear I was NOT blocked.</p>
<p>2. Though the discussion tab was red, I entered, considering to put some comment, and then I saw a note, saying that Wikipedia is not for self advertising, or advertising a friend, and that the article would be removed as spam.</p>
<p>3. I answered, and immediately after this the note disappeared. I also could access the article normally, logged in, and see the last changes.</p>
<p><br />
Somebody was playing with me. This should be prevented. It is extremely important that the fantastic concept and org of Wikipedia keep clean, and keep clean from abuses as much as possible.</p>
<p>I hope the hacker can be traced and disciplined. Death Phoenix followed the event, but unfortunately could not see by himself what I have seen. He just read my descriptions of what happened, step by step. Unfortunately I did not copy the abusive note, and later I was not able to retrieve it from my browser history. I'm still trying.</p>

<p>Hi, I can confirm that I received these emails from Comps regarding the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commitment_ordering.html" title="Commitment ordering">Commitment ordering</a> article. He first thought that he was blocked because he couldn't see his changes. However, he wasn't blocked and the "Horse" autoblock he describes was probably from a long time ago. Looking at article history, I could see that his changes were in the article and that they weren't reverted. He said that he noticed a note in the article talk page, as described above, that someone had a spam warning. However, I could not see any such warning in the article <a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7ECommitment_ordering_d0df.html" title="Talk:Commitment ordering">talk page</a>, and looking at the histories of both the article and its talk page yields no deleted edits. I wonder if it's an oversight deletion, but I don't think so since oversight deletions are only for the deletion of personal information and similar illegal edits. Any idea what's going on? I couldn't see what Comps was talking about, and he says these things he saw disappeared. He (and I) are both mystified by this.

<dd>This sounds very much like a caching issue.

<dd>That was one of my suggestions as well, at least with regards to his changes in the article. It doesn't quite explain the spam warning in the article talk page, however.

<p>That message indeed. Seems to be a combination of two distinct "strange" issues that led me to a far-reaching conclusion... Being enoyed and paranoiac by the first, I overreacted on the second. Looks to me now quite silly-amusing and resolved. Thanks to all, especially to deathphoenix.</p>
<p>Comment: A strange place, discussion, to post such a notice, even for red. A new article, I would understand. However, if a rule for initiating any red case, I can also understand... So, I must have encountered it several times in the past. Pity I have not remembered...</p>

<p>Eight days ago, <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> blocked me for a week, saying <i>"Date formatting idiocy; has been persistently warned."</i> In subsequent discussions it emerged that views among admins differed as to how a paragraph in the MoS should be interpreted. I have begun seeking input on the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html#Date_quality_initiative" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">relevant talk page</a> as to how best to reword it so as to avoid any future problems.</p>
<p>My first action on block expiry was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sean_Black&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74160251" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sean_Black&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74160251" rel="nofollow">ask Sean</a> for clarification, as to which edits he found the most idiotic. He ceased editing for the day at that point, but as he has since resumed and no answer is forthcoming, I assume that he has no answer for me, and I invite the wider community of admins to explain why a stiff initial block was imposed, along with what a reasonable person would regard as an incivil comment.</p>
<p>Given that we are a volunteer workforce, perhaps it is too much to ask for consistency and professional behaviour amongst admins. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 21:20, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

For some reason, you inserted your request for an explanation into another editor's comment in the middle of his talk page. He may not have even realized that you asked him a question.</dd>
<dd>Second, several editors informed you on your talk page <i>why</i> a campaign to reformat dates (from U.S. to European style, or <i>vice versa</i>) in articles was both misguided and disruptive.

<p>There appears to be only one admin who agrees with your actions, and rather exaggeratedly. You have been told by at least three admins, including Raul, that mass date changing is unacceptable. You have been told by two ArbCom members—that is, the people who wrote these decisions you cite so lawyerly, and who are the authority in applying them—to stop making these changes. You were then blocked and had your unblock requests reviewed by three totally different admins not previously involved in the matter. Your interpretation of the ArbCom decisions flatly contradicts the plain words in them. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 22:28, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Although the actual blocking of this editor was the correct thing to do, I'd like to point out that this is not the only brief-discussion block Sean Black has implemented of late.

I was and remain baffled by the accusations of trolling, and the unblocking admin seemed similarly baffled. I wonder whether perhaps Sean Black's blocking behavior should be looked at more closely to help him come to a fuller understanding of <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">blocking policy</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 02:18, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was away from WP for a few hours so missed all this going down. I had asked to be left to try to manage this and committed I'd hand out blocks if needed, and am disappointed that others felt this matter so urgent it couldn't wait... In reviewing, I agree that there is significant trolling here. However I don't see it as so pernicious that it couldn't wait a few hours, really. Nevertheless what is done is done and I support an indef and consider the mentorship over, never really got through to this user despite multiple tries. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 04:28, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry about that, Lar—no, of course it wasn't that urgent. (My name isn't "others", don't be such a stuffed shirt.) I merely didn't remember you'd asked to be the one to block, or I would have left it. Although it would admittedly have been interesting to just report it here and see how many seconds she remained unblocked after I hit "Save". Not a significant number, I guess, judging by Zscout's remark and the way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Courtney+Akins" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Courtney+Akins" rel="nofollow">people tripped over their own feet</a> after I reported I'd blocked for a week. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 07:21, 8 September 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>A stuffed shirt? Moi? I guess maybe I am... I just said "others" because it was late and I was too lazy to rattle off all the people that sprained their fingers on the block button. But this is no big deal, really, I'm not mad or anything or about to go ranting off on someone's talk page calling them <i>stupid</i> or <i>incompetent</i> or anything, I just would have liked to have been able to finish the mentorship out. I may go give a ceremonial indef myself just to get closure, dunno. You're right, once reported HERE, a block would be swift, but BunchOfGrapes had reported her on my talk page and I definitely would have acted. STILL. it matters not.

<p>From time to time, people tend to export flame wars to AN/i looking for an admin to take sides, and these sort of posts tend to degenerate fast. What do you think of this idea: Every time someone exports a flame war to AN/i, all involved parties that continue the flame war here on AN/i get a 15 minute "cool off" block to calm them down, along with a notice telling them to go somewhere else? The key being to block <b>all</b> parties, to avoid taking sides, similar to 3RR, only shorter, and as an AN/i cool off? Thoughts...?--172.162.88.163 17:22, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>First, I fully respect not only the literal meaning, but also the spirit of the rules, the spirit of discussion and arguments. Unfortunately the rules in Wikipedia not always enforced enough and some users feel they can freely broke the rules if their opponent has long blocking history.</li>
<li>Next as you can see, most of blocks of me were done by involved admins, which supported their own versions. I always invite other party to discuss the changes. I can even present cases were I asked other user to explain his opinion either in the revert summary, article's talk page and his own talk page - and still no answer did I got.</li>

<dd>About twenty different administrators were involved in your blocks (I think I may have double-counted once or twice, but around that number), and the fact that you have been a block sheet longer than a perpetually misbehaving bot (even discounting duplicates and unblock/reblocks to lengthen block timers) is telling (I'm actually rather shocked/impressed that you'd managed to get away with it for so long). The fact that, at least for now, you need an "abusive sockpuppets" tag to warn other contributors is also telling. For that matter, getting a barnstar is something you don't expect or whine about not getting - it's something you occasionally get as a reward, and your history of aggressive editing places you in a position of mistrust with respect to the community. You've gotten a reprieve by the graciousness of the community, which is willing to place its trust in Alex Bakharev's mentorship. I would suggest making use of it; a couple months or so of high-quality editing should get you what you want. In the meantime, an aggressive defense of yourself isn't likely to get you anywhere; I would recommend dropping it, hitting <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">Special:Randompage</a>, and finding an article to edit. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 20:08, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe Jon Awbrey may have exhausted the community's patience. I'm not aware of any useful edits he makes, and efforts to discuss the frequency of his posts to policy talk pages (226 posts to NOR talk in just a few weeks) are rebuffed. It's difficult to know what the point of most of his posts are, and he reverts when people try to refactor or move issues to subpages. He engaged in the same behavior on wikiEN-l.

<dd>Jon's had plenty of warnings and opportunities to not disrupt the project and contribute quietly. And he's recently just off a fairly long block for similar activities.

<dd>Actually I agree here: although he is disputatious and often includes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, he also does make sound and valid contributions. I don't have a problme with blocking him while we think about what to do, but I do think that we should do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>As a community, ban him from Project space (other than to enter a comment of reasonable length in any debate related to an article on which he is active or has expert knowledge)</li>
<li>Take the case to ArbCom and ask them to come up with a solution</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I am reluctant to trouble ArbCom if there is an unambiguous and obvious consensus to do what we believe ArbCom would do anyway. We could start an RFC, but the idea of an RFC with Jon fills me with horror - we'd need to add more storage to the servers to acommodate all the argumentation and justificaitons why (as always) he is the only one marching in step.</dd>
<dd>So my reluctance aside, ArbCom may be the best course. Do nothing is not really an option. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 11:18, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Guy, can you give some examples of Jon's good editing in article space? My own preference is the indefinite block, but if we're to limit him only from the project space, it would have to be absolute with no exceptions.

<dd>I have not checked every edit by JA. However, every edit I have sen (to an article) was trivial, pedantic, or just poorly-worded. I think perhaps he just likesbeing ableto read himselfon the internet. I have seen noevidence of his making positivecontributionsand on tlak pages he has a clear patern of disruption and obfuscation. He makes endless series of comments that make no sense or are so abstracxt that they must be referring to something else though who knows what. The effect of his adding allthis mishmash is so that he can then say "obviously discussion is ongoing so there is no consensus yet; people have to respond to each of my comments before we can say this discussion is over." Killer Chihuahu and others have already pointed out the destructive effects of this tactic. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 18:13, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>His behavior in article space is almost always positive so far as I can see. His behavior in nonarticle space is too disruptive and nonproductive to be tolerated anymore. His intelligence is an asset so long as we can trust him to make positive contributions and in article space he appears to care about his reputation. In talk venues he prefers unproductive behavior (and for those who can't make heads or tails of it; it boils down to "I'm smarter than you; nah nah na nah nah"; which <i>really</i> pushed some people's buttons) when he can't immediately get his way. A total ban throws out the baby with the bathwater. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 02:16, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't normally say such things, but since JA is being defended as a valid article contributor, I must respectfully disagree. JA drove me away from the Solipsism article I was once interested in due to his heavy-handed demeanor. JA aggressively reverted all changes he did not find to his liking and was a poor communicator on the talk page- longish, detailed requests for information would be answered with an unclear tangent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, his writing was, frankly, crap. JA did have useful thoughts, but he absolutely refused to write <i>well</i>, a rather critical requirement for a WP editor who claims "English at a professional level" in his userbox. JA chose to write in neither an accessible general audience style that Wikipedia generally seeks, nor in the precise if occasionally non-obvious statements of a careful philosopher or scientist. Instead, at least to my humble opinion, JA wrote in the pretentious blather of a college student who covers for the fact he didn't actually read the works with a haze of unclear statements. Now, this is just how some people write (and they are bad writers, which is unfortunate when they have insight to communicate), but it's also how good writers can cover for a lack of knowledge. Which was it? Beats me. He seemed smart enough, but I'm still not sure on some of his stances.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's a sample of the cutting prose JA has introduced to Wikipedia:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Solipsism is sometimes said to be unfalsifiable, but this confuses a question of logic, namely, the logical contingency of the solipsistic thesis by virtue of its logical form, with a question of rhetoric, namely, the practical difficulties of persuading a particular person, with a particular psychological constitution, of the contingency thereof. But the normative science of logic is quite distinct from the descriptive science of psychology, and has nothing to do with the peculiarites of an individual person's thought process.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Aside from this logic being false (at least IMHO- it sets up a bizarre straw man involving pscyhology and persuasion, which was not in the original passage even a little bit), the reasoning given for <i>why</i> this makes any sense is... opaque, at best. Plus, it's presented as fact. This was put right near the top of the article, too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fairness, for those who bother to check the Solipsism talk page history, I am not completely blameless either- I restarted the debate two months later after JA had long since stopped responding to my requests for clarification on the talk page with an actual edit to the main page (I'd stopped editing before to try and avoid an edit war), but I hadn't noticed that someone had already come in and mostly cleaned up the writing. Still, my biggest complaint with JA is stylistic; I can deal with opposing viewpoints in an article, and even opposing viewpoints presented as fact, but not obfuscated writing. It took another editor, Mglg, to make clear JA's intentions (I think).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've seen the occasional JA edit to other articles as well, albeit with less first-hand experience, and I have not been impressed. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 04:03, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>He can be obscure. He delights in mindnumbing logical precision. But in reviewing his last edit to the article and most of ita talk page, I don't find that your abouve quote does him justice. the below quote from him on the talk page is perhaps more typical. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 07:08, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First off, we agree that psychological arguments are irrelevant. That is just my point. All of the arguments that I've seen for the claim "Solipsism is unfalsifiable" are based on psychological arguments and betray a confusion of — whatever you want to call them — pragmatic, psychological, or rhetorical arguments with logical arguments. But when someone introduces a psychological argument, you have to meet it on those grounds and try to explain how it differs from a logical argument.</dd>
<dd>Second off, the old statement said "Solipsism is logically coherent, but not falsifiable, so it is not testable by the scientific method". There was nothing about "unknowable", whatever that means, so let's stick to one claim at a time. Terms like "logically coherent" and "falsfiable" do have definitions in logic. Unknowable? — Who knows?</dd>
<dd>Third off, unfalsifiable is not the same as unprovable or undecidable. Those terms also have definitions in logic and they are not the same concept as unfalsifiable. The typical indefeasible is really just a tautology whose syntactic form makes it difficult to recognize it as a tautology. Many strings of characters are simply not meaningful enough to qualify as a proposition that can be judged true or false. But the name for that is "meaningless", not "unfalsifiable". Jon Awbrey 02:44, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but what does that show? The claim that solipsism is unfalsifiable is a game. Jon is taking it seriously, and then trying to argue against it, and does so in way that shows he hasn't grasped what it means or understood the meanings of the terms he's using. This is what he did all the time on talk pages, at great length and to Wikipedia's detriment. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:27, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I disagree completely. I know <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> is a model Wikipedian, is an asset to Wikipedia, is better able to spot trolls than I can. I also know Jon Awbrey is very bright, focused on logic to the detriment of his ability to interact productively, and worth keeping as an editor of articles if that is possible. And that is not possible given his recent behavior on <i>non-article</i> pages. Enough background. On to solipsism. A debate was had in an amatuer forum (wikipedia) on a complicated philosophical subject that the professsionals disagree about. The subject (solipsism) was not given an agreed on definition. The terms used in the debate (eg falsifiable) were not given agreed on definitions. One party (Jon) assumes the definitions of the terms are the ones used in the logic circles he frequents while his debating partners assume otherwise. Semantic misunderstandings get in the way of adequate communication. I see nothing there that has anything to do with Jon's childish response to being told by people that he was a troll and to just go away because he was trying to revert longstanding text that Jon was able to show was not longstanding at all. Jon's behavior has warrented some kind of severe response. I hope in the end that response does not include his inability to edit article space. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 11:13, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If JA was an extremely opinionated sort who occasionally edits in cloudy writing, I wouldn't be here. That would qualify as quite a lot of Wikipedians. My problem is that even on the talk page, he couldn't explain himself very well, even to "Do you think this: Yes/No" type queries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't even call that excerpted statement a particularly enlightening one from JA. He still doesn't make clear his stance; I could have told you before that he thought the claim "Solipsism is unfalsifiable" has to do with psychology, but he doesn't explain <i>why</i> that rather non-obvious statement would be true. The second statement he is picking on the fact that I used a different word once because I was searching for a way to get through to him, and assuming I was changing my stance when I was actually trying to better explain it. The third statement, he never makes clear what definitions he actually <i>is</i> using, and later references Wikipedia articles that... support "my" definition? I was confused. It took the other editor mgmg to figure out what definitions JA was using.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For an analogy, a fiercely opinionated conservative posting on the "American conservatism" article is fine. However, they should be able to clearly explain the <i>reasons</i> behind their views and the definitions they use of words- Clinton coddled terror, the Democrats are protectionists and opportunists, "liberal" means "Aggressive mommy state statist" in this usage, etc. Somebody who seemingly takes all conservative positions as pure fact and refuses to explain themselves- or explain themselves, but badly- is very hard to work with on an article, even if they do in fact have wonderful, great reasons behind their edits (and it becomes other editors jobs to figure out what they meant and qualify it properly).</dd>

<dd>As another comment, Wikipedia should be <i>accessible</i> to a general audience when possible. I don't normally invoke <a href="../../../o/s/t/WP%7EOSTRICH_1864.html" title="WP:OSTRICH">WP:OSTRICH</a>, but if I'm having trouble understanding his statements, when I have a fair amount of experience at this kind of thing, what are the chances of random passerby?

<dd>I'm not going to comment on the issue at hand, but <i>As another comment, Wikipedia should be <b>accessible</b> to a general audience when possible</i> is something I strongly believe in, and is something I believe wikipedia should encourage.

<p>Some subjects lend themselves to lack of clarity. Physics and math subjects can be unreadable due to necessary prerequisites. Philosophy can be <i>conceptually</i> obscure. Using words that require definitions that have subjective meaning in order to discuss philosophical issues related to subjective experience lends itself to semantic misunderstanding. For example, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"There is considerable infelicity in Fodor's choice of terms. He is able to offer a cogent account of why methodological individualism counts as a methodological constraint. He argues that the desire to align terminological distinctions with objects having different causal powers is “one which follows simply from the scientist's goal of causal explanation and which, therefore, all scientific taxonomies must obey” (1987, 42). Thus it is a methodological precept. (Although one can see clearly here the stark contrast between Fodor's use of the term and that of Weber or Hayek, for whom the ability of the social scientist to provide something beyond merely causal explanation was what imposed the methodological commitment to the action-theoretic level of analysis.) It is simply unclear why Fodor chooses to call it individualism. With methodological solipsism, on the other hand, one can see why he calls it solipsism, but it is unclear what makes it methodological. Indeed, Fodor goes on to state that “solipsism (construed as prohibiting the relational taxonomy of mental states) is unlike individualism in that it couldn't conceivably follow from any general considerations about scientific goals and practices. ‘Methodological solipsism’ is, in fact, an empirical theory about the mind.”(1987, 43). Thus in Fodor's use of the terms, “methodological individualism” is not really individualistic, and “methodological solipsism” is not really methodological."<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/montaigne/" class="external autonumber" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/montaigne/" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 22:27, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First and foremost, the comments on rootology's userpage which led MONGO to file this <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a> was a notification to rootology that I would no longer be editing <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_MONGO_Workshop_cd7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/MONGO/Workshop">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/MONGO/Workshop</a>:</p>

<p>I felt like I had made my points, and that continuing to argue with MONGO was more harmful than beneficial. In addition, I know MONGO's past edit history, and his behavior towards others, since we are both interested in politics. <i>(See MONGOs CONDUCT below)</i> I had even predicted:</p>

<p>Sure enough, as soon as MONGO saw the opportunity, he called this <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a>.

<p>I explained this in detail to MONGO on MONGO's arbritation page, which I will expand here:</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> First of all, there is no "retalitory effort against" MONDO. All this is speculation on MONGO's part:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"in what appears to be some retalitory effort against me since rootology filed an arbcom case against me that isn't going according to his plan."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The key word is "appears". Like the allegations on the MONGO arbitration that others have filed against MONGO. MONGO has no evidence supporting his statments. MONGO, please minimize your speculation and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.</p>
<p>I got involved with MONGOs arbitration, because rootology messaged me.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATravb&amp;diff=74349514&amp;oldid=74343400" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATravb&amp;diff=74349514&amp;oldid=74343400" rel="nofollow">[82]</a> That is what got me involved with MONGOs arbitration. I have known about MONGOs arbitration for weeks, and added no comments.

<dd>How is quoting a admins wikisite insulting? How is quoting his profession, which is brought up on his own talk page, insulting? I was asking a pointed question about the neutrality of the Arbitration. Your past behavior and inability to work with other wikiusers is written off as "excessive zeal" and other wikiusers, who happen to be your ideological opposites are severly criticized. As I wrote before, all I am asking for is a level playing field from a neutral non-political admin. How is this insulting? For having a rich history of saying some really nasty things to other editors, you seem to take criticism rather badly yourself.
<dl>
<dd>No, I simply don't like it when you show up and try to dsirupt the arbcom because an obvious troll is probably going to be banned. Besides, the manner in which you quoted him and the sneering attitude is simply uncalled for.

<dd>Mongo, can I go to bed already? I was just about to finish up, and say: "I will deal User:MONGO's" accusations later. And now this....sigh....I am not a "right winger", I am a definate left winger. I push my POV, but I do it differently then others. Wait, why are we on this subject? Aren't we talking about Fred? FYI, I just apologized to Fred on his user talk page. I hope this helps diffuse the situation. I don't know what this means on my talk page:</dd>

<dd>But if you recall, I was finished with the MONDO arbcom, I had told rootology I was going to unwatch the page, and I was willing to let others gather the evidence against you in the MONGO arbcom. Then you initiated this <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a>. Why do you continue to threaten me? How does this help to diffuse the situation? IMHO, and please correct me if I am wrong, your tone is very negative and threatening.

<p>Since Mongo has brought up edit history's and my user behavior, I would like to address MONGOs behavior and where all of this happened today.</p>
<p>This entire grievance happened on <a href="../../../m/o/n/MONGO_02e3.html" title="MONGO">MONGOs</a> arbitration page, which several users have brought up because of <a href="../../../m/o/n/MONGO_02e3.html" title="MONGO">MONGO</a> past and current behavior and violations of wikipedia policy.

<p>MONGOs two supporters Tbeatty, Zer0faults, are active editors of <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America_9a2f.html" title="Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America">Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America</a>.

<dd>MONGO, I am simply pointing out Tbeatty, Zer0faults past association with you, and I pointed out that: I could line up just as many editors to <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America_9a2f.html" title="Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America">Allegations of state terrorism by United States of America</a> who would support my version of events.

<dd>I believe I've edited that article twice, one day apart. Three weeks ago. I would not call myself an active editor. I commented on the talk page I believe but that, too, was weeks ago. I would also not say I have a "relationship" with MONGO though I have seen his edits. My impression is that he was a fair and productive editor. I don't even think you could classify my comment here as supporting MONGO. Rather, I comment on my interaction with you, when you accused another editor falsely of being a sockpuppet. You misinterpreted a diff log and I pointed out where you made a mistake in your interpretation. You called me a liar on more than one occasion on the sock accusation page. You later apologized. That is not supporting MONGO, but pointint out my experience which seems to mirror what we see here. Agressive personal attack followed by passive apology. I believe that your apologies are sincere but your behavior is a pattern and your behavior is disruptive. I do think that you and wikipedia would benefit if you had a mentor and if you refrained from editing articles that invoke a strong emotional response until you understand more about the process and comport your behavior to the process.--<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 09:39, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Moving a discussion having nothing whatsover to do with edit warring to a page about lame edit wars isn't 'POV' so much as just... odd.

<dd>There has been a certain amount of "complaining" about admins issuing civility warnings. That said, I gave Mike one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMike18xx&amp;diff=74207333&amp;oldid=74101364" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMike18xx&amp;diff=74207333&amp;oldid=74101364" rel="nofollow">yesterday</a> and was planning to see if it "took" with an eye for going for a much longer block. I think Mike has a point when he alleges Aminz isn't quite perfect revert war wise but Mike's style of editing (with partial reversion happening in successive edits, with some changes thrown in so the article never returns to <i>exactly</i> the same state) makes it very hard to tell. Personally I think this user isn't going to reform but I could be wrong.

<p>As Lar requested, I am posting this here for everyone to review. Regarding the situation at hand, please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both users <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHauke_e201.html" title="User:Hauke">Hauke</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisjj2_5c2a.html" title="User:Chrisjj2">Chrisjj2</a> were permablocked as sockpuppets of <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a>. As the links provided by CBD above attest, the person who requested the CU agreed that the accounts were not sockpuppets, but meatpuppets.</li>
<li>According to <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html#Meatpuppets" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK#Meatpuppets</a>, the meatpuppets issue <i>occurs when multiple individuals create brand new accounts specifically to participate in, or influence, a particular vote or area of discussion</i>.</li>
<li>A look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hauke" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hauke" rel="nofollow">Hauke's</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Chrisjj2" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Chrisjj2" rel="nofollow">Chrisjj2's</a> contributions is sufficient to see that neither user <i>specifically participated in or influenced a particular vote or area of discussion</i>, hence they don't meet the sockpuppet/meatpuppet criteria.</li>
<li>By Lar's logic above (<i>if users are acting like sock or meatpuppets... it doesn't matter *what( the CU results are... the other users are blockable as well</i>), as applied to the edits of users in question, if I were to edit tango-related articles around the time of Tobias's block, I would have been blockable as well, because, even though I am not him, I am a friend of his, am associated with him, and would be acting like him (by editing the articles on the same topic he is interested in).</li>
<li>According to Lar, the purpose of these two users' edits were to circumvent Tobias's block. I find this accusation a bit strange considering the nature of the contributions of said users. Furthermore, as these users were clearly identified not to be Tobias by the RFCU, the sockpuppetry allegation is inapplicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I would certainly appeciate a review of my actions (i.e., unblocking the accounts of both Hauke and Chrisjj2) by the community of administrators.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#160;•&#160;(<a href="../../../e/z/h/User_talk%7EEzhiki_95fa.html" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 16:04, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>[after edit conflict] These two users are friends of Tobias; no one ever denied that. Both edited Wikipedia in the past anonymously. Chris was asked by Tobias to ask the questions he asked, because Tobias was blocked and his talk page was protected (in my view, injustly, but why and how that happened is not the topic of this particular thread), leaving him no other means of communications. Is asking a question on someone's behalf a crime now somehow? How can you say that Chrisjj2's account was created <i>with one agenda</i> (a quote from <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html#Meatpuppets" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK#Meatpuppets</a>) if only a few hours passed between the first edit from this account and the permablock? What happened to AGF? Innocent until proved guilty? What kind of harm was done when the question was asked? What's more important, why insist on keeping the permablock <i>now</i>? What purpose would it serve? In what way would it benefit Wikipedia?—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#160;•&#160;(<a href="../../../e/z/h/User_talk%7EEzhiki_95fa.html" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 16:36, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your thorough writeup <a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki</a> While I think we can't tar with the meatpuppet brush TOO broadly, (or else all people that ever edit bridge articles are meatpuppets of each other!) Tobias has said these are personal friends of his, and they turned up during rather suspicious times. SO I think the block was a good one and the meatpuppet charge warranted.</p>
<p>THAT said, the desired outcome here is that we get constructive edits from peacable users... how exactly that happens isn't the main thing. so with this now well documented, I'm not as sussed, although I still think it wasn't a warranted unblock. (Rather, I'd posit it as evidence of CBD taking the wrong side again) BUT... I just want to put in that if either of these users increases frequency of edits primarily while Tobias is blocked, as they did in the past, and aren't around much the rest of the time, or if they are editing basically to do things related to Tobias while he's blocked, I will not hesitate to reblock. On the other hand if they edit constructively they have nothing to worry about. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:29, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Given that the RFCU discussion linked above found, "everyone involved is of the opinion that these are different people" I don't see grounds for a sock-puppet accusation. Lar suggests that 'meatpuppets may also be indef blocked', but that is not actually how the policy reads... what it allows is that if there is confusion as to whether someone is a 'sock' vs 'meat' puppet <b>then</b> they may be blocked. However, we cannot just block a <i>known</i> 'meat puppet' indefinitely... if a blocked user were to ask me to make a comment to an AfD discussion for them and I did so I would be 'acting as a meat puppet' on their behalf... but so long as I identified the source of the view and why they didn't give it themself I can't imagine that being a 'blockable offense' at all. In this case another person spoke in defense of the user while they were blocked and their talk page protected... if that was a 'sock' then it should be indefinitely blocked. But a 'meat' puppet doing the same should not be... and as even the original complainant/blocker at the time acknowledged that this account WAS a different person this seems like a proper unblock to me - indeed I had asked Pschemp to reverse it and was considering doing so myself. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:33, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a point. The checkuser did not prove that these users were not sockpuppets. It simply didn't prove that they were.

<dd>Innocent until proven guilty makes sense when the cost of error, e.g. putting an innocent person in prison, is high. The greatest cost in this case is possibly discouraging persons who could be productive future contributors, which is less likely in this case if they were created accounts only because they were summoned to defend their friend. But they are still free to become productive contributors, at most they couldn't edit for 24 hours and lost their favorite nicknames. And the fact remains that, if not all having the same IP, they could all be the same person using various shell accounts. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 21:35, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>[edit conflict] Nandesuka, I sincerely hope this same line of reasoning is not applied to you if you ever have an unfortune of landing in court in real life (which I by no means want to happen to you). I can partially justify your logic as applied to Wikipedia, but refusing a review of a situation <i>post factum</i> is something no good admin can afford.

<dd>Thank you, Lar, you've just pretty much voiced a good chunk of my point of view. Considering the limited information available and emotions running high at the time of the block, the block was within the limits of policies—the users were blocked as alleged sockpuppets/meatpuppets. However, considering the information that came into light <i>later</i> and the nature of these users' contributions (as described above), it should be pretty clear that the block was only marginally justified, and should not have been (kept) indefinite. If we agree on that, I propose to close this thread for good, leave both Hauke and Chrisjj2 alone, and give them a chance to participate in this fine encyclopedia project where we are having so much fun. I stand by that my unblocking them was justified and the right thing to do. I stand by that the users should be re-blocked if all they do from this point onward is to continue serving as Tobias's meatpuppets. If you disagree with my actions and my line of thinking, I invite you to explain in details (preferrably at my talk page) why I am wrong and what I should have done instead.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#160;•&#160;(<a href="../../../e/z/h/User_talk%7EEzhiki_95fa.html" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 18:01, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Innocent until proven guilty applies to the legal system, not the court of public opinion. Furthermore, since admins are judge, jury, and executioner, the concept is effectively meaningless. Arbcom has upheld the principle that users who edit in a manner indistinguisable from other users may be held to the same restrictions regardless of actual IP-based sockpuppetry. After all, the use of (now blocked) open proxies can make edit tracking a tricky proposition. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 21:54, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wiki needs a policy on hate speech--in this case quoting the hate speech of dead politicians in order to ridicule minorities in 2006. use of Wiki to post hate speech should be off limits, The quotations were selected from many thousands by one person (User 70.16.248.128) (that is OR) for the purpose of "exposing" Johnson's racism. The editor did not put it in context and does not use any of the many expert studies that have analyzed LBJ's language and his attitude toward blacks and hispanics. (The editor involved is very poorly informed about black voting, so he clearly has not beed reading.) For example the transcripts use "nigra" which most readers will read (incorrectly) as "nigger". <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 17:24, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am concerned with some Usernames that seem to be clear variations of my own Username. Because I am the party directly interested, I will not affect any action on this myself.

<dd>Now that doesn't sound at all like my "meatpuppet" (as Davkal calls you - among his less obscene comments). While I would have liked to see another administrator pounce on him for attacking you for doing your job, your argument makes sense, mostly. Allowing occassional steam venting is a good way to avoid even worse disruption. It's much easier to ignore an angry outburst than to have to cope with an editor's calculated and vengeful disruption caused by pent-up anger. However, may I suggest that this turning-the-other-cheek policy be restricted to only one cheek? If Davkal continues his outrageous personal attacks, this latest vulgar attack should be remembered and considered in deciding how long he will be blocked.</dd>
<dd>A review of Davkal's record of contributions shows that he has contributed next to nothing to Wiki articles. However, he has caused an enormous amount of disruption and made others waste a great deal of their time responding to his disruptive behavior. He's only worked on a few articles. When his changes are resisted by other editors, he launches an escallating campaign of disruption to force them to accept his edits. So far, blocks have not persuaded him to adopt less destructive methods of persuasion. And this latest block has only made him more furious. I don't think a week will be a long enough time out for him to decide to change his ways.

<dd>Yes technically should go to the above mentioned page, but this doesn't look like a case where protection is called for. Vandalism on this article is light, 4 in the past week. Generally semi-protection (stops anons/new users from editting) is used when vandalism is more like 4 vandal edits an hour. When the vandalism is moderate to low, it's best just to revert it. And this is pretty much they'd say at the other page, sorry. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 05:41, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>there is no need to refer to the plural. although there are many people using that ip, i (the 89 guy user) was the one who tried unsuccesfully to change my account to "raja flattery" and "raja lon flattery". my original intetion was not to create sockpuppets. however, as a resolution for this dispute <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">nfitz</a> cares so much for, i will cease using any of these accounts, which should be either deleted or blocked indefinitely. once again, my account was "the 89 guy" and, attempting to move pages, i accidentally created accounts "raja flattery" and "raja lon flattery". my intention was neither to practice sockpuppetry nor to encourage it. that's why i propose the deletion or indefinite blocking of these accounts so that no one can use them. as for me, i will try to register for a new one as soon as the above mentioned accounts are rendered useless.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_89_guy_98ba.html" title="User:The 89 guy">The 89 guy</a> 12:19, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>I opened an account on Wikipedia <b>today</b> (9/9/2006 U.S. EST) and shortly afterwards was accused of being a sockpuppet of some other individual(s) -- who evidently is/are malfeasants of some sort -- by one <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">User:Demiurge</a>, who has taken it on him/herself to delete all my edits (except one, see below re Robin Livingstone).</p>
<p>I used the (helpme) function and received this reply:</p>
<p>"Well since I have no way of verifying the truth of otherwise of if you really only started today (From my perspective someone who genuinely started today would say that, but so would someone who is trying to pretend they only started today). I suggest you discuss it with the person who believes you are a sockpuppet, I have no magic wand to make them believe differently." -- <a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">User:pgk</a> 15:31, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I contacted the individual (User:Demiurge) making the charges against me explaining that I was not who he evidently is mistaking me for, but as of the last time I checked I have not heard back from him/her - evidently he/she does not deign to communicate with me.</p>
<p>This boils down to some unfortunate coincidence:</p>
<p>a) My ISP is similar to some malfeasants, but all I can say, not being a computer systems expert, is that I live in Manhattan, NY, in a building filled with people with computers, some of whom undoubtedly use Wikipedia.</p>
<p>b) My new page edit (Robin Livingstone) was not deleted or recommended for deletion, and a former editor of that exact same page was none other than <a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">User:pgk</a> -- talk about coincidences!! And why did not <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">User:Demiurge</a> recommend that page for deletion, perhaps he liked its contents, which would indicate extreme subjectivity and abuse of power (although what power he has as a non-administrator is not clear to me, as a first time user).</p>
<p>c) <a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">User:pgk</a> referred to my "apparent familiarity with Wikipedia" as a point which denigrates my credibility. This is absurd. I have friends who use Wikipedia and the basics of editing are not hard to grasp, although obviously not everyone has the proper temperament. As to the voluminous rules and regulations of Wikipedia, I am afriad I have barely made a dent in such lengthy reading material. I have a relatively short attention span.</p>
<p>In sum, I do not believe my edits should be vandalized by someone who simply suspects something, and I believe that there should be a checks and balances system to force him to reverse his destructive ways and desist until he is authorized to do what he/she is doing (he is not an administrator, which I have discerned from his/her own userpage).</p>
<p>Thanks for your help in this matter.</p>
