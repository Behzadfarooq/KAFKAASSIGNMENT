Greetings!

Because licensing has been an active topic in the community, the Board
has discussed the issue at its recent meetings; thank you to those
whose thoughtful input furthered the discussions.

A formal declaration in the form of a Board resolution has not yet
been made and will be forthcoming; however, we hope that this longer
message will provide the explanation behind the resolution. The
resolution will seek to clarify something that has been true for some
time but may not have been stated in a clear enough form as guidance
for the various communities to follow.

The mission of the Wikimedia Foundation is to develop educational
content under a free content license or in the public domain. For
content to be "free content", it must have no significant legal
restriction on people's freedom to use, redistribute, or modify the
content for any purpose.

It is therefore vital that all projects under the Foundation umbrella
use these standards, not only because of our desire to enable the
creation of free reference works, but also because of our commitment
to allow those works to benefit everyone who wishes to use and reuse
them. Because of this, all media we allow on our projects must be free
for all users and all purposes, including non-Wikimedia use,
commercial use, and derivative works. (Some media may be subject to
restrictions other than copyright in some jurisdictions, but are still
considered free work.)

There are many different licenses that allow these freedoms. The
licensing page on the Wikimedia Commons,
&lt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing&gt;, discusses some
of these license terms and gives links to the many licenses that are
acceptable to use.

While we appreciate the goodwill of those who give special permissions
for Wikimedia to display a work, this does not fulfill our greater
purpose of giving others the freedom to use the content as well, and
so we cannot accept media with permission for use on Wikimedia only.
Derivative uses are also important. The value of allowing
modifications becomes clear to anyone who edits the projects, as new
work builds on the work of others, and work you cannot change to meet
your needs and purposes is not free.

Commercial and non-commercial use is more controversial, as many
people are concerned that allowing commercial uses allows others to
abuse their generosity. But ultimately Wikimedia's longstanding and
carefully considered position is, as with many other organizations
devoted to free content, that disallowing commercial use does not
provide significant benefit to the content creator or to the public.
Non-commercial licensing stops many valuable uses that help distribute
and support free works, and hence does not further our mission. Where
commercial use spreads the works without taking away others' rights to
use and distribute them for free, it helps our purpose of making the
content as widely available as possible. This is a long enough message
without going deeply into detail, but Erik Moeller's essay at
&lt;http://www.intelligentdesigns.net/Licenses/NC&gt; is a thorough and
clear explanation of the reasons why the harm is more than the
benefit, and so why non-commercial content is not something we use.

It is for these reasons, which we have long supported, that all media
on Wikimedia sites which are used under terms that specify
non-commercial use only, no-derivatives only, or permission for
Wikimedia only, need to be be phased out and replaced with media that
does not have these restrictions.

Some Wikimedia projects use media that is not free at all, under a
doctrine of "fair use" or "fair dealing". There are some works,
primarily historically important photographs and significant modern
artworks, that we can not realistically expect to be released under a
free content license, but that are hard to discuss in an educational
context without including the media itself. Because the inability to
include these works limits scholarship and criticism, in many
jurisdictions people may use such works under limited conditions
without having license or permission. Some works that are under
licenses we do not accept (such as non-derivative) may meet these
conditions. Because of our commitment to free content, this non-free
media should not be used when it is reasonably possible to replace
with free media that would serve the same educational purpose.

Since individual projects have differing community standards and there
are potentially legal issues in different jurisdictions, individual
projects may choose to be more restrictive than Foundation policy
requires, such as the many projects that do not allow "fair use" media
at all. However, no project may have content policies less restricive,
or that allow licenses other than those allowed on Wikimedia Commons
and limited fair use.

We hope this clears up some of the uncertainty about what types of
material may be uploaded to and used on the projects as well as why we
take this position.

Thanks to everyone for your input and hard work.

For the Wikimedia Foundation,
Kat Walsh

<dd>Fair use should <i>only</i> be used for images that are necessary for readers to understand the text. A photograph of a piece of copyrighted art is useful when discussing symbolism in the art. However, most pictures hosted under fair use serve no such educational purpose; they only make articles prettier. Notably, photographs of people or characters are often unnecessary because they don't make it easier to understand the content (unless the content addresses their appearance, for example). —<small>{<a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">admin</a>} <a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPathoschild_s_8ed0.html" title="User talk:Pathoschild/s">Pathoschild</a> 03:02:06, 08 February 2007 (UTC)</small>

<dd>And most notably is those silly screenshots of television episodes that you see on all sorts of episode articles and in fair use galleries on episodes by season articles.

<li>If this changes anything - and it should - the most key thing will be developing a way to certify fair use on en.

<li>Most "pop culture" stuff, which makes up the bulk of FU on en is irreplaceable; but the fact it is irreplaceable does not make it fair in the majority of cases (tv episode screen shots anyone?). There is stuff that should be removed, but someone decided what needs to go and gives someone the approval to do it; or they'll find themselves in a KM user box scale mess. --<a href="../../../p/d/h/User%7EPDH_bc7b.html" title="User:PDH">Peta</a> 04:29, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>Am I correct in my interpretation of this that the foundation no longer considers "identification" to be a legitimate cause for using a fair use image? In other words, consider every single article about a company. 99.9% of them display the company's logo. They are displayed purely to identify the company in question, but you can discuss any or all of them without showing the corporate logo. The same goes, as Teke pointed out, for album covers or, as Cyde pointed out, for screenshots that are used in infoboxes or episode lists. Is this a correct interpretation of the directive - kill all fair use images that are used purely to <i>identify</i> the subject? --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 05:06, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Shouldn't we wait until the Foundation releases their formal declaration before we start taking these drastic steps and deleting 90% of the FU images on Wikipedia? I see both sides of the argument. I do enjoy seeing the cover of a book of an article I'm reading as it can help be identify the book when I go into a bookstore (same of album covers, DVD covers, etc). But I also see the point that the author and title should be able to replace the image and still get the point across. Also, I see the point that having "unfree" content goes against what the GFDL stands for. So in the end, I can argue for the deletion of these FU images but I think we should wait for a formal declaration from the Foundation especially since they said one is "forthcoming."↔<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmajdan_9130.html" title="User:Nmajdan"><font style="font-size:11px; font-weight:bold; font-family:verdana, sans-serif;">NMajdan</font></a>•<a href="../../../n/m/a/User_talk%7ENmajdan_5041.html" title="User talk:Nmajdan"><font style="font-size:9px; font-family:verdana, sans-serif; color:#000000;">talk</font></a> 14:54, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since one was asked for above, here's a summary:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Commons only takes "free content"</b> (which is defined as any licence that has "no significant legal restriction on people's freedom to use, redistribute, or modify the content for any purpose" - so <b>no</b> non-commercial, <b>no</b> no-derivatives, <b>no</b> permission-only);</li>
<li><b>no project may have less restrictive media rules than Commons</b>, although they may have more restrictive rules;</li>
<li><b>individual projects may also allow unfree media</b> (including not-free-enough media) under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_dealing.html" title="Fair dealing">fair dealing</a> doctrines, if they want to; but:
<ol>
<li>the use of unfree media is <b>only justified because not using it would unreasonably limit scholarship and criticism</b>;</li>
<li>unfree media should not be used when it is reasonably possible to replace it with free content that would serve the same educational purpose.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think those are the key points.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Summary ends here! The rest is my commentary:</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>As to what this means for en: policy; the universal definition on what is "free content" shouldn't affect us because we already operate (or should operate) by it, that is we already prohibit non-commercial, permission-only etc. However, I think this should serve as a basis for a rethink in the direction of our fair use policy, centred around the idea that we <i>only</i> ever use unfree media for one fundamental reason, that it would limit scholarship and criticism. The examples Kat gives are historically significant photographs (eg. <a href="../../../t/r/a/Image%7ETrangBang.jpg_c49e.html" title="Image:TrangBang.jpg">this</a>), and images of recent significant artworks that are still in copyright (eg. <a href="../../../w/a/r/Image%7EWarhol-Campbell_Soup-1-screenprint-1968.jpg_95e3.html" title="Image:Warhol-Campbell Soup-1-screenprint-1968.jpg">this</a>).</p>
<p>I think that we should dispose of the current fair use system, develop a range of clear, limited categories such as these, and eliminate all other unfree media. The question of whether disallowing unfree media would unreasonably limit scholarship and criticism must be the central part of the policy. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 05:14, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with that summary as I read it. I have no problem removing the fair use images in book covers, TV images, dvd covers, album covers, etc. They're nice to look at, but really they don't contribute to the GFDL and if that's what the goal is, I'll listen to the foundation above all else (hey, they have the purse strings). A nice OFFICE or foundation policy page would be nice outlining the proper use and removal of such images. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 05:57, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>

<dd>To me, it's still unclear the extent to which the fair use policy is truly being tightened up. Most important, is the eye candy pop culture stuff that is now 95% of fair use set to go? These often (when done right) have a fair use justification that would be sufficient for a respectable newspaper (publicity photo or screenshot), but that would not apply if we're restricting fair use to scholarship purposes only.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 06:02, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm pretty sure it's the latter of which you said.

<dl>
<dt>Or, "What does this actually mean?"</dt>
</dl>
<p>Well, as an editor and admin who's spent a lot of time and energy on "pop culture" articles, including a <i>lot</i> of time providing fair use rationales for images that it seems will no longer be allowed on Wikipedia, I have to say that I'm disappointed by this (if it means what it seems to). If limited fair use for identification — as had been common practice for book covers, album covers and TV episode screenshots — is no longer acceptable, a <b>lot</b> of useful content is going to be deleted. Of course, the Foundation has the right to make policy, and I won't argue with it. But I would like some clarification of how restrictive the interpretation is going to be. For example, consider the featured article <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalek.html" title="Dalek">Dalek</a>, which recently passed FAR. Would <i>all</i> images have to be removed from that article? Is it possible to get a freely licensed photograph or image of a copyrighted character, or are <i>all</i> images of such characters now <i>verboten</i> as derivatives of copyrighted images? (Note that even images of toys and the like are considered <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Derivative_images" class="extiw" title="commons:Derivative_images">derivative images</a> on Commons, and if we're now as restricted as they are, then the same restrictions presumably apply.)</p>
<p>The only loophole I can see is in Pathoschild's comment above, where he says that "photographs of people or characters are often unnecessary because they don't make it easier to understand the content (unless the content addresses their appearance, for example)." If this interpretation is correct, then an argument could be made for some of the images in <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalek.html" title="Dalek">Dalek</a>, because the section <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalek.html#Physical_characteristics" title="Dalek">Dalek#Physical characteristics</a> <i>does</i> describe a Dalek's appearance, in some detail. The article <i>would</i> be significantly more difficult to understand without any images.</p>
<p>But I don't see that loophole in Kat's letter. Indeed, it looks to me as if fair use is going to be restricted to "historically significant photographs" and "significant modern artworks". Although I could make a case for saying that <i>Doctor Who</i> is a "significant modern artwork" (it was, for instance, selected as an "<a href="http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/doctor-who" class="external text" title="http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/doctor-who" rel="nofollow">Icon of England</a>" by an organization <a href="http://www.icons.org.uk/about-us" class="external text" title="http://www.icons.org.uk/about-us" rel="nofollow">sponsored by</a> by the British government's <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_for_Culture%2C_Media_and_Sport_e9eb.html" title="Department for Culture, Media and Sport">Department for Culture, Media and Sport</a>), I'm not sure that's going to be good enough.</p>
<p>As for the implementation of this edict: may I recommend that a deadline be set — perhaps the end of May? — by which fair use media must be removed and/or replaced with free media? This would give users time to find replacements, and (since so many fair use images are in "fan" subjects) to move content that will be deleted from Wikipedia to fan wikis like those hosted by Wikia (which I assume will not adopt these restrictions — otherwise <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_Alpha_f337.html" title="Memory Alpha">Memory Alpha</a> and its ilk will be <i>very</i> unhappy, and probably try to find hosting elsewhere). A lot of the "pop culture" content might be better suited for fan wikis anyway — but it would be good if we allowed contributors time to make that transfer before engaging in mass deletions. Remember that a <i>lot</i> of Wikipedians contribute <i>both</i> to "fan" subjects and academic ones. If we make this transition more abrupt than it needs to be, we'll lose a lot of good contributors. If we give people time to get used to this, and make the transition gently, we won't lose as many. Of course, there <b>will</b> be much hue and cry, but we have the ability to ameliorate or exacerbate it. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 08:00, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When I said "quickly", I meant better a month or two from now, rather than next year, which would leave the boil on way too long. I do suspect that in the future we will see more user-created Dalek diagrams (BTW, how far could copyright let us go in that direction?).--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 08:17, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As far as I know, drawing your own version doesn't help for many current fair use images. Drawing your own <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Smurfs_8109.html" title="The Smurfs">Smurf</a> is still a copyright violation: either you show a oublished copyrighted Smurf drawing (or licensed figurine or some such), or you show nothing at all: recreating copyrighted art in your own hand is a) still copyrighted and b) misleading and probably uglier than the original one. A main problem I see is that for many people, a cover is much more recognisable than a title, so that while they perhaps don't remember if they have read something called <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Black_Island_763a.html" title="The Black Island">The Black Island</a></i>, they would immediately recognize the cover and make the connection. Removing all coverart (unless explicitly described) would make some parts of the encyclopedia (like the comics section) much less accessible and useful. Of course, one can argue if the same argument is valid for e.g. <i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch-22.html" title="Catch-22">Catch-22</a></i>, which has had many different editions with mùany different covers, and where the artwork is not an integral part of the subject of the article. In short, I can see the reasons behind and the necessity of the removal of many fair use images, but please try to weigh the benefits of doing so in individual cases or per category of work, and keep images of art where the visual aspect is a defining factor. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:19, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not sure why you'd think it could apply to wikia. Wikia is a commercial enterprise and separate from the Wikimedia foundation.

<dd>I agree that trans-wikiing images would be a nice idea if we can do that. It would be ironic if that made the wikia wikis look nicer than Wikipedia.

<dd>this is the human readable version of foundation policy. We can't really start activly doing stuff untill we see the legalistic version.

<p>Could someone explain to me it's so important that people be able to use Wikipedia's contents commercially that we can't use fair-use images in the way for which they're intended (i.e., fair use)?

<dd>Well it does go into that aspect and points to the essay on it. But you seem to be making an assumption that everybody worldwide is able to rely on a fair use privelege. You also seem to be assuming that the use by a for profit organsation will not be in keeping with our aims. Say for instance a commercial organisation is distributing computers to schools at low or no profit, would you like them to be prohibited from distributing a copy of wikipedia with that? --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 13:08, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Many fair-use images (for example, photos of actors, musicians, etc.) are designed to be used in commercial magazines — that's the point of them. The notion that they can't be used by us is bizarre. (And if a company provide a free copy of Wikipedia, I agree that that would be in keeping with our aims — as well as with fair-use.</dd>
<dd>As to the international point, I have been assuming that; is there anywhere that an image distributed by its copyright-holder as fair-use <i>isn't</i> fair use? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 14:01, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Fair-use == unlicensed. Most images used in magazines etc. are not being used under the fair-use doctrine, they are licensed for use by the magazine, even if that license often doesn't require any royalty or other fee to be paid by the copyright holder. This is one of many common misunderstandings regarding images, people obtain them from a magazine and assume it is being used to promote that person/thing and therefore tag it as {{promotional}} this is often incorrect as the image hasn't be given a general release for promotional purposes but specific permission for the individual publications.</dd>
<dd>"image distributed by its copyright-holder as fair-use". That makes no sense. Copyright holders do not distribute images as fair use. Fair use is a doctrine from copyright law which enables you to use images without any license or permission from the copyright holder in certain circumstances. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 14:17, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not talking about images taken from magazines; I have, on a number of occasions, approached a PR firm or artist with a request for an image that can be used by us under fair-use conditions, and they've been happy to co0mply; that's what press packs are for. I've now found that those images are being stripped from Wikipedia on the grounds that they're fair-use images which coyuld (in some bizarre lawyer's, non-real-world sense of "could") be replaced by a non-fair-use image. That's the sort of thing that I'm talking about. If you're saying that they shouldn't be labelled "fair use", and that we <i>can</i> use them, then someone tell the handful of obsessives who devote their Wikipedia editing to removing and deleting such images. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 16:28, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think we're getting tied up in terminology here (You'd be better asking them for an image licensed under the GFDL or suitable CC license). Asking them for a fair-use image as above makes no sense as any image can be used for fair use without their permission provide the correct rationale can be met. An image supplied to you by them may be released elsewhere as part of a press pack in which case the promotional tagging maybe correct. If on the other hand they are releasing an image to you "with permission" for use only on wikipedia, then we haven't permitted those since mid-2005. Even in the case of with permission or not from a press pack, there maybe a reasonable fair use rationale for the images (notwithstanding replaceable issues). To me this discussion typifies one of the problems of fair use and our image policies, a general lack of understanding (or difference in understanding) and confusion on terminology. Now this is just my understanding of some of the fair use issues here and maybe someone else will chime in and disagree (or agree with one or both of us in whole or part), and this also is part of the problem, anyone wanting to reuse those images (even if just republishing wikipedia verbatim) has to be confident that there own usage is reasonable under the fair use doctrine, and it to go through and evaluate all the images, all the fair use claims checking all the sources is a huge job --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 17:41, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The second image there includes a 'with permission' disclaimer. Since Britannica doesn't allow <i>itself</i> to be copied / reprinted / alterred they include most of their copyrighted images (and text) simply by asking the owner for permission to display them for that book/website only. We'd have to ask the owners for permission for <i>anyone</i> to use the image/text in <i>any way</i> they chose... essentially to release the material into the 'public domain'... which they usually are not going to do. To date we have gotten around this disparity by allowing 'limited permission' and 'fair use' criteria at the expense of 'easy re-usability' of pages on which they appeared. The statement by Kat doesn't actually say <b>anything</b> about removing some of the currently permitted forms of fair use... but if her statement about fair use "primarily" applying to historic images is taken to mean, 'will henceforth <i>only</i> apply to historic images' (as some people seem to interpret) then we would in the future be showing considerably fewer copyrighted images than Britannica and the like can. Which strikes me as odd... because if we keep ANY sort of fair use then the 'easy re-usability' of Wikipedia is still compromised (and indeed it will be easier for people to mistakenly think that an image is 'free use' if 'fair use' becomes seldom allowed), and we would then provide <i>less</i> visual content than paper encyclopedias despite the online environment being <i>more</i> suitable for such. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 15:06, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the replies. This means that comparing our fair use policy and use to Britannica is a bit disingineous (sorry Cyde!), even if it was not intended that way. They don't have to use fair use because they can show images that are copyrighted with a rather easy "with permission" statement. Since we can't do that (because we have to be freely redistributable etcetera), we shouldn't base our policies or the need for fair use images on what Britannica does or doesn't. On the other hand, you could easily argue that even Britannica feels the need to show copyrighted images, so they think the "decoration" is important as well. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:26, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Quoting from Kat: "no project may have content policies less restricive, or that allow licenses other than those allowed on Wikimedia Commons and <i>limited fair use</i>." The emphasis is mine - we already have severely limited fair use, way beyond the size and scope of anything reasonable. The final statement on the matter would be the thing to look toward, but I think we could avoid a shitstorm by actually reading what's being said - I'd assume Kat deliberated considerably on the statement. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:13, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes. The problem is, people interpret <i>limited fair use</i> very liberally. That has always been a problem. Kat's statement means that the policy is likely to be enforced more strictly than it has been. That will bring a shitstorm (to use your word) with it, absolutely inevitably, because long experience shows that every new user has to have fair use explained to them several times before they finally get it, if they ever do. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 15:33, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This whole thing looks like it may become a huge disaster (if it isn't already - Cyde is already deleting images with no warning or discussion that I can see), while I can see the appeal of wanting all free media it certainly makes "free" the higher priority than "good". As far as I'm concerned, this is a huge blow for wikipedia and instantly eliminates any possibility of wikipedia being as good as the top commercial encyclopedias. It simply isn't possible for wikipedia to display the same images that "real" encyclopedias do, and wikipedia will suffer for it. Wikipedia will have virtually no photos other than "homemade" ones and ones taken before 1920 or so. Additionally, this edict is extremely vague and the criteria listed are so widely open to interpretation to be almost meaningless. "historically important photographs and significant modern artworks" basically means there's no criteria to judge photos beyond endless arguments that will mostly be "seems historical/significant to me". I'd second the question about whether text is included, if it is it would likely mean no quotes from any copyrighted literature of any kind, regardless of how short. I think this has the potential to cause a major shift, with content about virtually all pop culture (really any article about any copyrighted material) getting relegated to second class status and editors interested in those topics moving to other more specific wikis. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 17:53, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed, I wouldn't be upset either. Quuxplusone is trying to make the point that de-wiki is somehow too "bland" by linking articles that contain lots of fair use images on en-wiki but none on de-wiki. I just find those images decorative and unnecessary. If an image isn't available under a free content license there had better be a good damn reason for using it (the classic example being <a href="../../../w/w/2/Image%7EWW2_Iwo_Jima_flag_raising.jpg_2705.html" title="Image:WW2 Iwo Jima flag raising.jpg">this image</a>).

<p>Is this meant to apply only to photographs that are themselves notable and the subject of substantial scholarship (e.g. <i><a href="../../../r/a/i/Raising_the_Flag_on_Iwo_Jima_30fb.html" title="Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima">Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima</a></i>), or does it extend to not-particulary-noteworthy historical photographs used for purposes of identification and illustration as well?</p>
<p>(The specific issue I'm thinking of here are Nazi-produced WWII photos. Most of them are tagged with some sort of fair-use claim because nobody's really sure what their legal status is; are things like, say, <a href="../../../l/s/s/Image%7ELSSAH_-_Kursk_POW.jpg_ef61.html" title="Image:LSSAH - Kursk POW.jpg">this</a> going to fall under a permitted class of fair use now?) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 14:13, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>My reading is that historical importance refers to the <i>image itself</i> being historically important, rather than the image depicting a historically important event. The image at <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Keeler_7ff3.html" title="Christine Keeler">Christine Keeler</a> is unquestionably copyright but of historical importance. Specific pictures from the war? Tough call. We know the copyright status of <i>Iwo Jima</i>, but we don't know the status of many others, and in some cases the fair use rationale is stretched. What we really need is for the German Government to publish these photos as a free-content archive. Oh, and free beer for all.

<p>I still think there's a world of difference between images showing historically important events (even if the images themselves may not be famous, like these Nazi-produced WWII photos) and most of the fair use crap we have on Wikipedia, such as screengrabs of TV shows, album covers, movie posters, etc. Let's take out the blatant unnecessary fair use first and maybe work out some sort of a policy on historically important events afterwards? --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 17:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

</dd>
<dd>True, but let's take the chance to explain how things <i>should</i> have worked all along! As for the German WWII photos, the main problem is that they are "orphan works": in most cases, we don't know who the photographer is and so we don't know who the copyright holder is. They are <b>not</b> German government copyright, that would make life a whole lot simpler... However, as Germany has a life+70 copyright term, we know they are still under copyright. Kat's message implies of a criterion of whether "the inability to include these works limits scholarship and criticism": on that basis, the portrait photos would have to go. This fits with other comments that fair use for identification is not possible. Photos of ships and planes are also tricky, as they could conceivably be replaced by free use drawings. The photos we have of battlefield scenes seem more like justifiable fair use to me. Just my opinion, based on what I saw of the German wartime photos when I was working on cleaning up the old {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-GermanGov_c50b.html" title="Template:PD-GermanGov">PD-GermanGov</a>}}. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhyschim62_05f3.html" title="User talk:Physchim62">(talk)</a> 18:39, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>They are (or can be) fair use according to US law. It's just that they aren't (or won't be) acceptable examples of the limited, restricted cases of fair use which will be permissible on Wikipedia under the new (or newly clarified) rules. We might want to find a new term for this, so as to avoid confusion between what's legal under the US doctrine of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> and the much smaller set of media which will be permitted under this policy.</dd>
<dd>Cyde, even if this is interpreted as "the way things were supposed to be all along", it changes the landscape because we now have Foundation-level guidance on what the policy should be. We didn't have that before, and all previous conversations were held in ignorance. Many Wikipedians interpreted the rules differently, in good faith. Now, we know for certain what the Foundation's position is, and we need to adjust our policies accordingly. This does <i>not</i> mean that everyone who was on the "wrong" side of this issue should now be ignored.</dd>
<dd>It's like when a Supreme Court decision comes down. Everyone's obliged to follow the Court's ruling. But until the ruling is put into practice, you don't know how it's going to be interpreted. And just because the Court rules in favor of one party, that doesn't give that party sole jurisdiction for interpreting the ruling.</dd>

<p>I'd like to raise three points here that I haven't seen mentioned yet. First, Kat Walsh's letter sounds much less apocalyptic than most people (on either side) are making it out to be. Sounds to me like her problem is less with <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> and more with licenses that specify non-commercial use (such as some <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_95b5.html" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> licenses), or criminalize use by anyone except Wikipedia. I think that's a reasonable position; I'd rather see Wikipedia that much more free, at least. And in practice, most of the images licensed with CC or special-permission licenses are things like Flickr photos, contributed by Wikipedia editors or their friends, and it won't be very hard to find the creators and get them to agree to change the licenses.</p>
<p>Second, since each image page already comes with tags specifying its license(s), it's trivially easy for anyone to strip out non-commercial images from their commercial version of Wikipedia (call it Commercipedia). Most Wikipedia mirrors strip out at least a subset of our images already. So the goal should not be to <i>delete</i> any images at all — that would only decrease the quality of our encyclopedia, without providing any benefit to our commercial masters. The goal should be to <i>replace</i> images with public-domain or GFDL images wherever possible. And that's already being done, albeit slowly.</p>
<p>Third, fair-use images <i>can</i> be used in commercial publications, no problem. This debate shouldn't be about removing screenshots of <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i>, since a dozen books, magazines, and TV news programs are published every year containing <i>Seinfeld</i> screenshots. We're not on shaky legal ground there. Again: Walsh's letter seems to agree; it's more concerned with making life easier for commercial publishers of Wikipedia derivatives.</p>
<p>That said, if Wikipedia turns into <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_und_Struppi" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_und_Struppi" rel="nofollow">the</a> <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Baby_One_More_Time" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Baby_One_More_Time" rel="nofollow">German</a> <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>, I'll say a sad farewell, too. --<a href="../../../q/u/u/User%7EQuuxplusone_9b50.html" title="User:Quuxplusone">Quuxplusone</a> 17:55, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a world of difference between an article that says something like "The camera angle in this shot shows the director's intent to depersonalise the character[ref] [low res screenshot]" and what we do, which is to decorate lists of episodes with random screenshots, put them in big infoboxes, and dress up what's basically an unofficial online guide to a television program. Perhaps one could say that we're not competing with the website that the copyright holder has put up, and presumably wants to drive traffic to through attractive use of decorative screenshots from their property. Regardless, we don't need to do this, it is not best practice, and we can either clean up or just keep waiting to be told to clean it up. The bottom line on this point is, as usual, don't upload unfree content to Wikimedia projects with the idea that it won't be deleted without a lot of explanation, compromise and you personally receiving a compelling explanation. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 21:51, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cburnett, you forgot to quote the sentence immediately preceding that: <i>Because the inability to include these works limits scholarship and criticism, in many jurisdictions people may use such works under limited conditions without having license or permission. Some works that are under licenses we do not accept (such as non-derivative) may meet these conditions.</i> It seems clear to me that screenshots (in this specific example) have to be used for "scholarship and criticism", not in galleries like Jkelly has pointed out. <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C;">howcheng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 22:10, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think the image has to be <i>directly</i> next to the descriptive text. In Guernica, the article describes the symbolism etc in the painting, all of which can by seen by scrolling up to the other image; heck, the best way to see what the article is talking about is probably to open the image in another window/tab, and flip between the two, thus completely removing the image from the text itself. However, now that I look at how <a href="../../../p/i/c/Image%7EPicassoGuernica.jpg_1ac7.html" title="Image:PicassoGuernica.jpg">Image:PicassoGuernica.jpg</a> is being used, it probably has to be removed from some other pages... <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C;">howcheng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 23:06, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>When images used in encyclopædias and other reference works, it's to illustrate articles; calling this "decoration" seems only to have the purpose of trivialising it, making it sound frivolous, whenit's actually none of those things. The silliness of the position adopted by some editors with regard to this can be seen when at least one editor removed an image of the subject of an article on the grounds that it merely(!) illustrates the article, responding to objections with the usual claim that it was only decorative, and immediately placed a template on the talk page asking for an illustration to be added because it would improve the article...

<dd>Especially while we're waiting for the formal statement from the Foundation. The main point of Kat's email is that images "which are used under terms that specify non-commercial use only, no-derivatives only, or permission for Wikimedia only, need to be be phased out and replaced with media that does not have these restrictions."

<dd>I don't see that we can justify any change in <i>procedure</i> just on the basis of Kat's message. If the Board want admins to cut the number of fair use images through speedy deletion, they should say so. Personally, I would be in favor, but insofar as I am doing image deletions at the moment they have to be on current CSDs. We should probably apply a tighter test than at present on IFD and in editing (maybe based on non-use "limits scholarship and criticism"). The Board is hardly going to all this trouble simply to say that current practice on Englsih Wikipedia is fine. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhyschim62_05f3.html" title="User talk:Physchim62">(talk)</a> 10:49, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think we can really make any policy changes or take any actions based on the limited info we have so far.

<dd>Interesting points and thanks for the examples. Is it necessary that people have written about the image, or is it sufficient that people have written about the thing/event shown in the image? And would the article have to be about the image, or could it be about the event/thing pictured? Much of the talk has been about tv screencaps, but this has the potential to apply to images of products, logos, news events, scientific/nature images.

<dd>My opinion, due to the new information presented here, is that <i>if an image of the subject of the article has not been shown to the general public worldwide</i>, then a fair use image should be fine. For example, President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> is pretty much well known around the world, and his face has been seen on the internet, news, and TV. An FU image of him would <b>not</b> be needed, since any person seeking such an image can simply go on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> images. If it was however, the Head of State of some 3rd world country that not much people care about that someone would like to see a picture of, then I guess an FU picture would be acceptable, since that person's face isn't even well known. Milo H Minderbinder, in your case about the rare bird, such images are available throughout the Internet, and anyone who <i>really</i> wants to research said topic would not just look at Wikipedia. With enough common sense, they would go to a library, or a database, etc.--<i><b><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_06df.html" title="User:Ed"><font color="blue" face="comic sans ms">Ed</font></a></b></i> <sup><a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_8c3a.html" title="User talk:Ed"><font color="maroon" face="comic sans ms">¿Cómo estás?</font></a></sup><small><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Ed_8b99.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Ed">Reviews?</a></small> 01:57, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, but Wikipedia is discouraged among many schools as a reference for research, so many people just come to Wikipedia for basic information. As a student, I do <i>not</i> use Wikipedia for my research; I use the databases that my school provides.

<dd>I'd say, if you can <i>link</i> to an image (an external link, that is), then that is sometimes enough. But make sure to link to an official website, and not a random website hosting a copyvio pic. The official Coca-cola gallery someone mentioned earlier is a good example. I'm going through old astronomy articles at the moment. Some of those link to online scans of 19th century obituaries in online databases of huge numbers of articles. See at the bottom of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_William_Webb_e8c9.html" title="Thomas William Webb">this article</a>. As that sort of thing becomes more common, linking to official collections of copyright text or images might be the best way of balancing things out. Remember that the big thing about Wikipedia is that we create and edit the content, linking out to sources that confirm what we write. Fair-use images go against that. They constrain how we can edit and change things. Free material you can mercilessly edit and improve. Fair use content, you can't do that. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 02:35, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

External links are good for further, more detailed discussion, but not for providing images necessary or at least very useful for the comprehension of the article. An article on <a href="../../../l/i/g/Ligne_claire.html" title="Ligne claire">Ligne claire</a> without a picture from a Hergé comic (and preferable a better one than the current one) is useless. An article on <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piet_Mondrian_742b.html" title="Piet Mondrian">Piet Mondrian</a> without at least one picture of his late works is difficult to understand for people who don't know how a Mondrian looks. I don't want to have an encyclopedia where I can't fully understand the information without browsing external sites as well. Yes, there are way too many fair use images on Wikipedia, but there are on the other hand many irreplaceable copyrighted images (mainly of artworks) which are necessary to show what the article is talking about. And the argument that you can't edit fair use images is frankly a bit ridiculous. Why would you <i>want</i> to edit them? We show what the artist created, and that is factual info, not something to toy with and to edit as we like. Applying that argument means that we have to remove all fair use pictures, even the Iwo Jima pic, the Ché photo, the Guernica: no more exceptions. Our articles both on 20th century art and 20th century news events would become much much poorer and harder to understand, while I can't see on the other hand any benefits for Wikipedia by doing this. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:23, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then we should make it harder for people to edit such fair-use images, making the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provenance.html" title="Provenance">provenance</a> crystal-clear and even documenting whether an old historical image has been 'cleaned up' by a Wikipedia editor. I agree that there are many, many legitimate uses of fair-use, but it is equally clear that a discussion <i>with examples</i> is needed. Your examples are excellent. This really will help people understand the difference between this and an episode screenshot. Of course, providing examples of 'purely decorative' use will be difficult once such images are deleted. But episode lists are probably a good example. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 10:25, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, we agree more than I thought (I thought you took a more extreme position). I agree that provenance, origin of the image has to be very clear, and that the image must really add information to the article which would be much harder to give through text. Bad examples of fair use are e.g. book covers (like the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch-22.html" title="Catch-22">Catch-22</a> example I gave, which usually add no information, are not discussed in the article, and are even hardly recognisable since many books (certainly bestsellers and classics) have had many different covers. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure the example of third world leaders really holds water. As I understand it, the image of the leader would have to be important to the article for something more than simple identification. <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viktor_Yushchenko_fcb8.html" title="Viktor Yushchenko">Viktor Yushchenko</a> seems to be a clear cut case where fair use <i>is</i> justified, as any biography would have to discuss the changes in his physical appearance, but otherwise there would seem to have to be something particular about the persons appearance to make the use of the image fair. We can always link to sites where copyrighted photos are available, after all, our use will only be fair if the image has to be near the text for the text to make sense. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhyschim62_05f3.html" title="User talk:Physchim62">(talk)</a> 11:00, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is an aspect to replacing “unfree media” — and here I am referring strictly to “fair use” media — that is often casually overlooked in these discussions. As <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> notes in the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#Executive_summary" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">Executive summary</a> above, “unfree media should not be used <b>when it is reasonably possible to replace it with free content</b> that would serve the same educational purpose.” (Emphasis added.) All too often it seems to be glibly assumed that “free content” material is widely available, especially when the subject is has been widely photographed. Those assuming this and insisting on the removal of otherwise proper “fair use” material rarely, if ever, assume for themselves the due diligence of attempting to determine whether or not this is actually the case. In fact, if they did, we might have less of a problem with fair use images.</p>
<p>To see how widespread this assumption is, one need only look above to see proposals above that a deadline be set for the removal of all fair use materials by May (more or less) — and this for a policy that has not yet even been publicly and officially promulgated (and the implementation of which is still quite unclear by the postings here). Either the scope of the effort required to replace “fair use” images with “free use” images is grossly underestimated, or there’s so little of it that “fair use” isn’t really that much of a problem since there’s so little of it.</p>
<p>While Kat Walsh has made the <i>rationale</i> for this policy change clear, I would like to recommend further consideration and clarification of the <i>standards</i> to and the process by which this policy is to be implemented, and that a more realistic timeframe is embraced. — <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 16:20, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A person uploading a fair-use image is already responsible to provide sufficient reason to believe it can not be replaced. Do you have a significant number of examples of images which were provided with such a reason but which were deleted anyway as replaceable? Remember, our current policy does not require that a replaceable free image <i>already exists</i>, only that it could be created. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 16:30, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How does one prove a negative? Some editors seem to interpret the phrase as whether it's theoretically possible to replace a picture, even if in practice it's impossible for us. Is that really the case? Just because someone is alive doesn't mean we could get access to them to take a picture. We can only know that a picture <i>is</i> replaceable, and we know that by the existence of a free picture. Many persons, places, and things are inaccessable to those willing to give photo rights to the public domain. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 17:23, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a>, I think "our current policy does not require that a replaceable free image already exists, only that it could be created" is a rather liberal interpretation of the quote I highlighted above. Moreover, taken at face value, it would mean a fair use image could <i>never</i> be used because no editor could ever assure that there could never be a situation where a free use image could not come to exist ... even if not until a thousand years hence. As <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> observed, you cannot prove a negative. In any case, I was addressing any particular past removals but rather the quite frequently encountered attitude that if a "fair use" image exists, a "free use" example <i>must</i> be "out there" — which, when combined with the impending policy change, means that even fair use images already uploaded with a reasonable assertion of fair use will now also be targets for removal. While there may indeed be a need to tighten up restrictions on their (mis)use, there is neither standard nor mechanism for gaining consensus on the <b>appropriateness</b> of the use of a "fair use" image; on the other hand, there need be only a bland, self-assured assertion that "surely <i>somewhere</i>, <i>someday</i>, <i>somehow</i> there will be a suitable free use image" to reject it. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 22:13, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been looking over this line for a while:</p>
<pre>
Some Wikimedia projects use media that is not free at all, under a
doctrine of "fair use" or "fair dealing". <b>There are some works,</b>
<b>primarily</b> historically important photographs and <b>significant modern</b>
<b>artworks, that we can not realistically expect to be released under a</b>
<b>free content license, but that are hard to discuss in an educational</b>
<b>context without including the media itself.</b>
</pre>
<p>The words "significant modern artworks" are really the key words for the whole discussion. "Significant" is completely open to interpretation and is where our fair use rationales come into play. "Artworks" seems to mean any copyrighted material. "Modern" appears to mean anything that is not old enough to be in the public domain (or in the case of places which do not recognize public domain, "modern" is entirely meaningless). So, "significant modern artworks" seems to be a catch-all for whatever can be interpreted as fair use. Therefore, it appears she is just saying "fair use media can be used when it is fair use". No shit, really? If this is a sign of things to come, I don't see how any future foundation resolution is going to help to clarify the situation. Unless they explicitly say "fair use is not allowed", nothing is going to change. We all know (or at least I know) that this isn't going to happen any time soon. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 21:58, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

I'm sure that would be a surprise to the people who designed and/or photographed those images. Just because an artistic creation also serves a commercial purpose doesn't mean that it isn't art. If it has been discussed <i>as art</i> by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and our article includes references to those sources, it should be possible to include the images according to the standards put forth by Kat. Of course, many — perhaps even most — fair use images currently in use in Wikipedia articles don't meet that standard. But a blanket statement that something "isn't art by any stretch of the imagination" is contrary to the spirit of Wikipedia — because reliable sources <b>have</b> said that it is, or can be, art.

<dd>Films are often argued to be works of art, television as well. The statement certainly didn't say that only paintings are art. Nobody is arguing that a screenshot is a work of art, it's how we visually represent the art (same as a photo of a painting or sculpture) since we can't actually put an excerpt of a film directly into an article. I wouldn't agree that art covers all copyrighted material, but it certainly includes things people would consider "pop culture" like it or not. The issue is that art is allowed, not arguing over "good art" versus "pop art". --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 13:37, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Interesting interpretation, but without anything in WP policy or case law to support it, it's nothing more than your personal opinion. Based on your logic it almost sounds like you're saying we should start using short film clips instead of stills. Or what about audio clips? There's certainly an argument that could be made in that direction, but I doubt that would make the Board happy. I think the absurdity of this entire situation is exemplified by the simulatneous arguments that a screen shot is too much and not enough. The still isn't mean to <i>be</i> art, it's meant to illustrate it. Do you oppose photos of sculptures as well, since they can't represent the whole work? Photos of a close-up of a section of a painting? And speaking of text, do we know if text quotes are one of the forms of fair use media disallowed by this? For the record, currently WP:FU specifically mentions screenshots/stills and corporate logos as allowed if used appropriately. As Kat said, the intent of this isn't to change policy but just to enforce it better. That implies that they're not banning stills or logos, they just want to make sure they're not used without proper fair use justification. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 14:19, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Anyone care to take a stab at how this can be interpreted? Most of the content on Wikipedia already has this <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">wall of text</a> legal restriction. In my opinion, any legal restriction is a significant one. The use of the word "significant" seems to indicate that it is better for us to have content under a license that people can violate the conditions of without much risk of consequence (GFDL licensed text), rather than have content under a "license" that increases a risk of consequence if used improperly (fair use images). Any legal restriction is a legal restriction. We should not concern ourselves if some legal restriction on content here is more "significant" than another legal restriction on different content. Our goal should be to make an encyclopedia that can <i>reasonably</i> be redistributed and modified (if care is taken to follow the legal restrictions of the content being used). We are not in the business of making a truly "free" encyclopedia.

<p>Several people have pointed me at this thread asking for further elaboration and clarification. Really, I don't have much to say beyond what is in the message, but there are a few points I would like to make more clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is absolutely not going to be a detailed fair use policy handed down that says "you can use this kind, you can't use that kind". I know this is an unsatisfying answer, but the scope and fuzziness of the task makes it near to impossible; that the Foundation isn't micromanaging doesn't mean that we don't care whether or not it is being done appropriately. It is up to the informed and responsible members of the community to draw up the exact limits of the policy within the scope of our free-content mission. As to how the images deemed not to be fairly used are to be deleted—that's up to individual projects.</li>
<li>The "free content" part is the primary concern, even if some articles would look a lot nicer with images we should not use; to note a comment higher in the thread "free" <i>is</i> a higher priority than "good". While there are plenty of reference works available online at no cost, this one is special in being free content, and part of our purpose is to encourage the development of more free content. A lower-quality free picture existing means that it is possible to have one. We are a project for the long term, and waiting for a free image that is reasonably possible but takes a bit longer to get, is in the end more in line with our goals than never getting a free image at all.</li>
<li>This is not a change in Foundation policy (as Haukur stated above, "sky still blue, water still wet"). It is simply the case that some people on the projects are unaware of the extent of the Foundation's commitment to free content.</li>
<li>Treat each other with courtesy and understanding even if it kills you.</li>
</ol>
<p>I note that this is not a Board-approved statement, but I would not expect the others to disagree. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Kat Walsh</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill your mind?)</a> 22:55, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You know, we have too many fair use images. Clearly consensus is not sorting this out. I fail to see why the board can't make more clear guidelines on the use of "fair use". Given that it's a legal issue, why are we taking any sort of risk here? - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 07:51, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I respect the reasons why the Board would not want to micromanage the policies of fair use images because of the size and scope of what is currently on here. But I would still prefer a little more specific input from the top, especially since this is more or less a <i>legal</i> issue. Over the past couple of years, I have seen discussions on fair use policies spill over into intense debates, conflicts, edit wars and 3RRs, and blocks. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Sceptre_531c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Sceptre">This</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Kelly_Martin2_5709.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Kelly Martin2">this</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Ta_bu_shi_da_yu_2_1765.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Ta bu shi da yu 2">this</a> come to my mind.

<dd>I too, understand that a detailed policy may not be called for from up top, but I think three or four "rules of thumb" would be extremely helpful. Kat, you just suggested one above: "A free image is better than an unfree image, even when the unfree image is of higher quality." But what would be our rule of thumb on eye candy like album covers (presuming the design is not discussed in the text.) Would the rule be "An unfree image may be used just for the sake of having an image, if a free image is impossible and fair use is followed." Or: "An unfree image should not be used just for the sake of having an image, even if it meets fair use criteria and a free image is impossible." This is a very basic aspect of image policy. If we adopted some rules of thumb, there would still be plenty to argue over, with the specific merits of various fair use claims. But where Foundation policy differs from what's legal under fair use should be clearer.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 21:25, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still feel that if the Foundation actually wanted no fair use images on Wikipedia, they <i>would</i> come out and say it. They are allowing us to make our own determination on what should be allowed and what should not. Because of this liberty, some are taking it as permission to push force their own draconian interpretation. I feel that images that have <i>no free equivalents</i>, such as the album covers, CD covers, logos, etc should be allowed to remain. Basically any picture of a living individual that is fair use probably does not fall under this criteria unless the individual is a fictional character. I just don't want to see en.wiki go the same route as de.wiki.↔<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmajdan_9130.html" title="User:Nmajdan"><font style="font-size:11px; font-weight:bold; font-family:verdana, sans-serif;">NMajdan</font></a>•<a href="../../../n/m/a/User_talk%7ENmajdan_5041.html" title="User talk:Nmajdan"><font style="font-size:9px; font-family:verdana, sans-serif; color:#000000;">talk</font></a> 16:40, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since this message from the board was posted, pretty much every front page Featured Article has included some (if not all) fair use images, some theoretically replacable and some arguably decorative. Don't these provide an example of the Right Way to do an article? Based on the actual deletions that have happened over the last few days, it looks like the statement is just being used to selectively enforce <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> while conveniently ignoring "serious" articles that use images in the exact same ways. Wikipedia needs to reach a consensus what this means and how it should be enforced - in the meantime as far as I'm concerned any admins going on unilateral deletion sprees in the meantime using the board message instead of WP policy are just being disruptive. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 14:26, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am new to this disucssion so I apologize if I am merely repeating something already said. Wikipedia already takes advantage of "fair use" when including quotations in articles. The decision whether or not to use quotations is made on an article by article basis; if something can be paraphrased it will be; if something should be left as fair use it is. The only "reasonable" way I can see Wikipedia getting around the idea of fair use for images is to either ban it outright, or to allow the decisions to be decentralized for each article. I have read some of the rejected policies, and while I agree with their intents, it is obvious that trying to define what is reasonable or not is a near impossible task, and enforcement would be a nightmare. Why shouldn't this decision be left to a consensus on each talk page? After all, wouldn't it be the editors who could make the best judgement on whether an image is necessary, replaceable, etc.? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshdboz_c913.html" title="User:Joshdboz">Joshdboz</a> 14:19, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Most of the discussion so far has had to do with copyright fair use. I think there have been some misinterpretations about trademark fair use (such as, for example the Coca-cola(R) logo in the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-cola.html" title="Coca-cola">Coca-cola</a> article (although the one actually appearing looks like a picture of a case, rather than an official logo). Obviously, it's not "free". Obviously, it's fair use under trademark law (a trademark used to refer to the trademarked concept) in all jurisdictions which recognize trademarks. Obviously, we don't have an guidance about whether it should be used. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 02:04, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>One day, Wikipedia attracted a retired sports reporter, a golf history buff who lived through a lot of that history. He was very excited!</p>
<p>So he proceeded to go through biographies on some of golf's greats. He started with <b><a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Nicklaus_bf8c.html" title="Jack Nicklaus">Jack Nicklaus</a></b>, a living person.</p>
<p>So he wrote a fantastic introduction to <b>Jack Nicklaus</b> and decided that now might be the time to place a nice photo into his work. So he did.</p>
<p>He placed in <a href="http://www.carltonwoods.com/images/JackNicklaus.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.carltonwoods.com/images/JackNicklaus.jpg" rel="nofollow">a photo of Jack from his promotional pack</a>, and then sat back and sipped some tea while he admired his great start. But soon, something happened.</p>
<p>"Woops! Sorry. Can't use that!" the retired sports reporter was suddenly told.</p>
<p>"Huh? Why???" he replied back.</p>
<p>"Well, because there is a 'free' photo available of Jack. See, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:JackNicklaus.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:JackNicklaus.jpg" rel="nofollow">its right here</a>. You gotta use a 'free' photo."</p>
<p>"But that photo is <i>miserable</i>, surely a complete embarrassment to Jack! The most prominent feature in it is - it's his GUT! - something he lost not too long after someone snapped that photo of him without him even knowing it. And that horrible shot will show up all over the whole Internet in weeks!"</p>
<p>"Well, it already is all over the Internet through Wikipedia's mirrors and stuff. ;-) But Sorry. We have to remain 'free'."</p>
<p>"But I am <i>donating</i> my time and expertise here to write this article, and plan on doing scores more. I thought no was ever going to be charged to read these articles. You know, that it was <i>free</i>."</p>
<p>"Ah! No, that is a common misunderstanding. We mean 'free' as in <i>libre</i>, not 'free' as in <i>beer</i>."</p>
<p>"I'm confused. And I thought this was about 'free' as in <i>education</i>."</p>
<p>"Well, one thing you can do is approach Jack to see if he will release a great photo of himself for 'free'."</p>
<p>"But this photo <i>is</i> free! Jack provides it in his press packet without charge. I know he'd be <i>more than</i> happy to have it used for educational purposes."</p>
<p>"Yes, you are indeed confused. What you have to do is get him to release a photo <i>that anyone anywhere can use for any for-profit or derivable purpose</i>."</p>
<p>"Are you saying I just need to get Jack to give explicit permission to use this promotional photo in Wikipedia?"</p>
<p>"No, no, no. We <i>cannot</i> use photos like that."</p>
<p>"Ugh! Now I think I really <i>am</i> confused! And look, these people have reputations to maintain, and their image is a big part of that. Real lives can be harmed by putting horrible photos of living people like that in <i>an encyclopedia</i> article."</p>
<p>"Well that's <i>Jack's</i> problem, not ours. But let me make it real plain how you and he can solve it. You have to get Jack to release a great photo of himself <i>to the whole world</i>, one that <i>anyone anywhere can sell, or change around in all sorts of ways</i>."</p>
<p>"Um, you're kidding, right?"</p>
<p>"No, not at all."</p>
<p>"Well what about <a href="http://www.championsretreat.net/images/80.JPG" class="external text" title="http://www.championsretreat.net/images/80.JPG" rel="nofollow">this photo</a>? That's from when Jack was just making it big, back in the early 1960s. I was planning to write a <i>biography</i> article of him, after all. It really has to include his golf career <i>in more than just words</i>."</p>
<p>"Wow, nice shot! Can you get Jack to release it under a 'free' license?"</p>
<p>"Do you mean, <i>Can you get Jack to release that photo to the whole world so that anyone anywhere can sell it or change it around in all sorts of ways?</i>"</p>
<p>"Hey, you're catching on now! And yes, that is what I mean."</p>
<p>"Are you serious? You <i>really</i> do gotta be kidding now, right?"</p>
<p>"No, I assure you I am not."</p>
<p>"So, let me get this straight. You want me to donate my time to write articles that anyone anywhere can then turn and use to make money. And on top of that you want me to get photos for these articles - photos that anyone anywhere can then turn and use to make money, as well as alter and change around as they deem fit?"</p>
<p>"Exactly! Look, 'free" is a <i>wonderful</i> goal. We need your help to change how the rest of the world operates. <i>They</i> should be <i>like us</i>, not the other way around." The change is quite clearly inevitable, in fact. Erik Möller even said so.<a href="http://freedomdefined.org/index.php?title=Talk:Licenses/NC&amp;diff=2904&amp;oldid=2886" class="external autonumber" title="http://freedomdefined.org/index.php?title=Talk:Licenses/NC&amp;diff=2904&amp;oldid=2886" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>"Gosh, I am beginning to think I have wasted a lot of time here. These things you are asking me to do - they are just completely unrealistic. Not to mention the gall !"</p>
<p>"Or, you can just write the articles."</p>
<p>"Waddaya mean?"</p>
<p>Well, they don't <i>need</i> photos, after all. 'Free' <i>is</i> more important than quality, ya know. Kat Walsh even said so."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Kat_Walsh%27s_statement&amp;diff=107180556&amp;oldid=107059971" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Kat_Walsh%27s_statement&amp;diff=107180556&amp;oldid=107059971" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>"Please tell me you really are kidding this time."</p>
<p>"Sorry, I am not."</p>
<p>"Well, I am afraid I must bid you good luck - you're gonna need it - and adieu."</p>
<p>And so the retired sports reporter reverted his edits, buried them under a bunch of trivial minor ones, and was never heard from again.</p>

<dd>For the benefit of other users, I shall summarise the above overly long post. (I think this is one of those times an American attempts irony, which as usual resembles a giraffe attempting the limbo.) "Jack Nicklaus has a bit of a tummy, unlike every other 66-year-old man on the planet, so we should use only photos which show him from the neck up, like this professional one. Unfortunately, people who spend the time, money and effort to create professional, posed photographs understandably don't want to release them under free licenses. Therefore, Wikipedia is @#%$ed". I'm missing something here. "The fair use provision of United States law allows Wikipedia to use copyrighted photos in limited contexts" means nothing more than "We should use other people's work because we can get away with it". That isn't good enough for a free-content encyclopaedia. We don't have the resources to take professional photographs, I fail to see how this is a problem except for the extreme minority of people who can't even bear to look at their real selves, and God knows how they shave in the morning without a mirror. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 11:51, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the benefit of other users, I shalll summarize Sam's analysis: Sam completely and totally misses the point of the essay, and Sam's summary is the poorer for it. The essay (now at <a href="../../../a/d/i/WP%7EADIEU_9d31.html" title="WP:ADIEU">WP:ADIEU</a>) is actually quite readable, quite enjoyable, very funny, and perfectly illustrates the various follies and fallacies of the current interpretation of our fair use policy. Media professionals, who have been dealing with fair use issues, successfully, for many years, are often shocked at the literalness and vigor with which many non-media-professional editors interpret Wikipedia's draconian fair use guidelines, all at the altar of "free/libre." There are, of course, limits to what libre can accomplish in a copyright-encrusted world, but asking a libre absolutist to bend or change or compromise is a bit like asking a Flat Earther to stop worrying about falling off end of the earth. No matter what the evidence is, they'll never be convinced the world isn't headed toward a libre utopia... So why bother? Instead, embrace the limits of libre! Own them! Go "German," and reject fair use as an evil conspiracy ("I don't trust fair use..." I saw an editor write the other day, as though it were something to be feared)... And it's important to note that if the board values "free" above "quality," then they've really tied their own hands in a wide variety of issues. Because I would guess that most people come to Wikipedia because it's an excellent encyclopedia, not because it's an excellent "free." <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenolen_a9f9.html" title="User:Jenolen"><font color="blue">Jenolen</font></a> <a href="../../../j/e/n/User_talk%7EJenolen_d50e.html" title="User talk:Jenolen"><font color="red"><b><sup>speak it!</sup></b></font></a> 19:15, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Also, I don't appreciate Sam's joke at the expense of Americans. It is in poor taste. What that essay is failing to mention is you can still create a great encyclopedia entry without images.
