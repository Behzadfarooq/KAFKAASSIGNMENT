<p>Three editors including myself have called attention to the dire need for improvement of the article <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">Hippie</a> at <a href="../../../h/i/p/Talk%7EHippie_fac1.html" title="Talk:Hippie">Talk:Hippie</a> on account of its US-centrism in discussing what was and is a phenomenon in many other countries including Europe and Australasia. Unfortunately, all three of us have been "overruled" by a single proprietary editor who insists that because he can't see what the fuss is about, therefore it does not exist -- and for many days now he has been unilaterally removing the &lt;&lt;globalize&gt;&gt; tag as soon as any of us add it, or the &lt;&lt;NPOV&gt;&gt; tag. He or she does not seem to be aware of the policy for disputes, he thinks he alone is authorized to dismiss the other 3 editors' objections out of hand. A 5th editor, Apostle, has tried to find a compromise by agreeing with us that globalization is needed, but siding with the other editor on the need for a tag to that effect. However the purpose of the tag is not as the other editor says, to "push a pov", butactually only to invite more editors to fix the problem that he denies exists, at least in the meantime until the problem IS fixed. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 00:25, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm. This isn't a very rounded view of that discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We have a classic Wikipedia dispute here: the article is slanted to US-centrism because that's the slant of the available sources. Codex and a couple others want to add more about hippies elsewhere in the world, but the sources for their claims aren't terribly good, and so Viriditas is removing the poorly cited material. Add in some accusations of "vandalism" on both sides, a little bit of edit warring, and some gratuitous bold text on the talk page, and you have a mess.</dd>

<dd>Its a classic editorial dispute. The article was dreadfully US centric and the problem arose when one editor was uncomfortable with the globalize tag and would remove it, which being the globalize issue was clearly dfisputed was then then replaced with an NPOV tag which the same editor then removed. Its locked and there is discussion on the talk page that may lead to a resolution but the basic problem started because the article read like an American encyclopedia article, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 23:18, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Er, Iamunknown, it's all in the post. I'm not quite sure what you're getting at with your responses. As to the situation, I don't really see a problem in the context of the situation.

<dd>"In the corridor the Jews were driven into the chambers by some Ukrainians. There were five chambers on either side." (M.)</dd>
<dd>"On both sides of the corridor were 5 gas chambers" (Rum)</dd>
<dd>The verdict of the Duesseldorf Treblinka trial, however, stated:</dd>
<dd>"Darüber welche Masse wirklich zutreffen, hat die Beweisaufnahme ebensowenig eine eindeutige Klärung ergeben wie über die wirkliche Anzahl der neuen Kammern, die von den Angeklagten übereinstimmend und von Anfang an mit 6, von den jüdischen Zeugen jedoch durchweg mit 10 angegeben werden."</dd>
<dd>Which means, in English, that the German defendants testified about six gas chambers, not ten, and only Jewish witnesses testified about ten gas chambers.

<p>Admins:</p>
<p>Rather than deal in the "ANECDOTAL" Statements and blog posting by Sergey Romanov lets deal in verifiable facts. Do we all agree that ICANN and WHOIS.net are valid authorities in web site registraion? Also the US &amp; EU laws that govern websites and enclosed materials??</p>
<p>Ok good. Now please Check WHOIS.net for www.deathcamps.org then do the same for www.death-camps.org</p>
<p>Note the dates, 2002 for deathcamps.org and 2006 for the fake death-camps.org</p>
<p>Then go back and look at all the original links here on wiki, all the deathcamps.org links, go back to the very first versions, were they deathcamps.org or the counterfeit death-camps org??</p>
<p>Now, this is all facts validated by legitimate authorities and including wiki's own history.</p>
<p>Against these facts you have wacky blog accusations, hearsay, anecdotal statements, some downright lies, and a blatant smear campaign by Sergey Romanov.</p>
<p>Sergey Romanov can attempt to rebut this all he wishes.</p>
<p>But as admins of what is an ENCYCLOPEDIA should be excercising better judgement.</p>

<dd>Maybe you should settle this through legal channels and come back to our wiki once the outstanding issues have been resolved. At this point, we are inclined to remove both sites until you (site owners) sort this out.

<dl>
<dd>The pseudo-"Genuine ARC Team" is trying to pull a fast one: once again, copyrights are not established by WHOIS. As for removing both sites, I don't see why the legitimate site should be removed along with the unreliable one. But that's probably "GAT"'s purpose. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESergey_Romanov_b541.html" title="User:Sergey Romanov">Sergey Romanov</a> 20:22, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No you are not a court but Wiki does have a charter and regulations. We are not asking Wiki to take our word for it. There is verifiable evidence on <a href="http://www.whois.net/whois_new.cgi?d=deathcamps&amp;tld=org" class="external free" title="http://www.whois.net/whois_new.cgi?d=deathcamps&amp;tld=org" rel="nofollow">http://www.whois.net/whois_new.cgi?d=deathcamps&amp;tld=org</a> or ICANN.</p>
<p>This is as straightforward and as simple as it gets.</p>
<p>Copyrights are backed up by valid dates of registration. www.deathcamps.org and all the material contained within are legimately registred copyrights in both the US and the EU.</p>
<p>Sorry Sergey Romanov be we've legally registerd the site, all and all the material we've created there in both geographical regions. Any questions on that please contact the US Copyright office, and the EU registrar.</p>

<p>EL. Agreed, Wiki has that right. However if you look back to the very first Wiki links for www.deathcamps.org they predate the inception of the fake hyphenated version that appeared in October 2006. Some of them have been here for years without issue. This upstart comes in and begins changing all of our links and now the real website has to suffer for it?</p>
<p>Is there any justice in that??</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As explained on my user page, most links have been changed back in the autumn of 2006, because the deathcamps.org site has been down.

<p>I don't see how death-camps.org doesn't "seem to contribute that much useful information".It is chockful of useful information on the Holocaust. And is obviously legit.

<p>Shadow1 I understand your concern. I would ask that the legitimate www.deathcamps.org links be allowed to remain as they have been here for years. These counterfiet links pointing to www.death-camps.org have only started in October of 2006. We are only seeking to retain our status quo as a legitimate website.</p>

<dd>My concern is that the links aren't entirely relevant to the articles, in my opinion.

<dd>And since we do not know who owns the true version of the website, we should try to be fair and remove both links instead of featuring one over the other. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 20:47, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One who owns the true site doesn't need to make false statements, like current deathcamps.org owner does (I've given examples on my user page). Also, someone representing the true pages doesn't need to make fake blogs like the one here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASergey_Romanov&amp;diff=105571739&amp;oldid=89670383" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASergey_Romanov&amp;diff=105571739&amp;oldid=89670383" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASergey_Romanov&amp;diff=105571739&amp;oldid=89670383</a> (you can see that this is the same person who writes here as "Genuine ARC Team" by observing the changes he made to wiki articles).--<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESergey_Romanov_b541.html" title="User:Sergey Romanov">Sergey Romanov</a> 21:23, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Netscott no one from the ARC team had anything to do with Michael Richards page... We are only interested in keeping our links point to our site that we started in 2002 and have had links here on Wiki for many years. We have been under constant vandal attacks and link reversion since Oct 2006... why are we being made to suffer with the vandals?</p>
<p><br />
Shadow1 any link that isn't relevant to the article should be removed on any page where it isn't relevant. When we at the www.deathcamps.org began posting and contributing to articles over the years we posted links in good faith.</p>
<p>We only seek to have the promotion of this counterfeit website stopped.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's no "accrediation" for either site. Deathcamps.org is registered to someone with a yahoo.co.uk e-mail address?

All these users are doing is changing one site for the other, and I simply don't see the benefit to wikipedia in fighting over what? A link!!!. Leave things the way they were, and engage in discussion before doing any drastic action. (changing one link for the other). Put simply this is getting silly, from all the link swapping I'm seeing on IRC. Talk first, then take action, once there is a consensus on what to do.

<p>ARC was created in 2002. We registered our website in September of 2002. We have maintained our website since that time. We have also registered for formal copyrights in the USA and EU both back in October when the counterfeit website www.death-camps.org first appeared. Both registrations are in process, but the registration process can be verified with the US copy right office and EU registrar.</p>
<p>The fake website is an identical copy of www.deathcamps.org their site was registered in October 2006 the ICANN and WHOIS validate this.</p>
<p>www.death-camps.org is counterfeit and in violation of the geniune ARC www.deathcamps.org copyright.</p>

<dd>I just noticed one of these links was removed from the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porajmos.html" title="Porajmos">Porajmos</a> article, and after reading this whole discussion I now understand why the removal happened, and agree with the action. I was wondering, however, if the decision could be summarized somewhere so others like me who edit the many pages linking to these websites can easily understand what has happened. The websites were pretty good sources of information, so it's no small blow to have them removed (though, again, I understand why it was done, and agree with the removal).

<dd>I wish I had thought of that and added the link to my edit summaries. Perhaps, when this discussion is archived (in the next few days), I can make another run and also go back to all of the talk pages and post a brief note directing editors to this discussion and asking that they not post links to either domain. It's unfortunate but the situation is too tricky and should not be dealt with on-wiki. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 03:22, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, it looks like I’m being drug into this mess by the anon styling himself as <i>The Genuine ARC team</i>, and I have three particular complaints: 1) editing a post not by him on my talk page, 2) adding hidden-text spam to same, and 3) making not-so-veiled threats should I not <i>cease and desist</i> – from behavior I have not participated in!</p>
<p>My participation in this is very indirect. I responded to a post by another user on <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon’s</a> talk page back in January. That user, <a href="../../../r/r/b/User%7ERrburke_948e.html" title="User:Rrburke">Rrburke</a> had noted serial changes of links to the <i>dash</i> site to the <i>non-dash</i> to the article <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einsatzgruppen.html" title="Einsatzgruppen">Einsatzgruppen</a> and several others. Since I am knowledgeable about the subject of the death camps, I took it upon myself to do what <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a> had stated he hadn’t the time to do – examine what the difference between the two sites were and to try to figure out what was going on. What I learned and confirmed to <a href="../../../r/r/b/User%7ERrburke_948e.html" title="User:Rrburke">Rrburke</a> was that it was indeed as he surmised, <i>inside baseball</i>.</p>
<p>I’d forgotten about it until the <i>ARC</i> guy (as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.243.84.163_f03c.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.243.84.163">71.243.84.163</a>) apparently went trolling on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_17.html" title="March 17">17 March</a> for <i>dash</i> links, found one on my talk page ([[User talk:Askari Mark#deathcamps.org vs. death-camps.org in <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einsatzgruppen.html" title="Einsatzgruppen">Einsatzgruppen</a>) – the last exchange <a href="../../../r/r/b/User%7ERrburke_948e.html" title="User:Rrburke">Rrburke</a> and I had on the subject, and deleted the dash in the latter link name (making it nonsensical). I reverted it, rebuked the anon, and let <a href="../../../r/r/b/User%7ERrburke_948e.html" title="User:Rrburke">Rrburke</a> know this in case he was still following the issue. He had forgotten about it too, and asked me to <a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html#death-camps.org_v._deathcamps.org" title="User talk:Askari Mark">remind him</a> what it was about.</p>
<p>At this point <i>ARC</i> (now as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_141.157.161.15_855b.html" title="Special:Contributions/141.157.161.15">141.157.161.15</a>) began chiming, accusing me of promoting fraudulent websites, and also returned to the <i>January</i> posting (the one he’d originally vandalized) and added the following hidden text: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Askari_Mark&amp;diff=116065349&amp;oldid=115994769" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Askari_Mark&amp;diff=116065349&amp;oldid=115994769" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> which vandalism I also reverted. Ignoring my point-by-point rebuttal of his accusations in the <a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html#death-camps.org_v._deathcamps.org" title="User talk:Askari Mark">March 17 post</a>, he started a new thread, <a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html#Promotion_of_Counterfeit_ARC_website" title="User talk:Askari Mark">Promotion of Counterfeit ARC website</a>, which has descended into threats (which <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_Knott_a4ea.html" title="User:Theresa Knott">Theresa Knott</a> rebuked him on today).</p>
<p>To date I’ve not edited dashes in or out of links to either of these websites in any article. As best I can tell, this anon’s edits are only to redirect links to his website and push his monomania on any editor he comes across to accuse them (in Wikipedia’s name) of promoting copyright violations. I haven’t gone through all his sockpuppets’ contributions, but it looks to me like he has made no other constructive edits. Inasmuch as he seems intent on stirring up more controversy than he’s worth, I wouldn’t mind seeing him banned just so he doesn’t continue to inflict himself on other editors; however, considering how monomaniacal this anon is about his personal issue, I do expect him to continue vandalizing under other IPs as they become available to him (fortunately, his MO is easy to discern). I would also recommend that some admins explore his other edits to remove the hidden text he placed on my talk page, which I suspect he has placed elsewhere. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 01:05, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Between the two successive paragraphs there were two blank row lines, with the second being where the text had been inserted.

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>(B) G2bambino hates the 2 Wiki users Magonaritus and Jonawiki. There is a concern that G2bambino is engaging in wikistalking and his accusation of sockpuppetry (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive217#Jonawiki_and_sockpuppetry" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive217#Jonawiki_and_sockpuppetry" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive217#Jonawiki_and_sockpuppetry</a>) is just another way to game the system in order to intimidate his victims.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(1) G2bambino has been warned by an admin of violating 3RR in an edit war against Magonaritus (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:G2bambino#UCC_Revert_War" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:G2bambino#UCC_Revert_War" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:G2bambino#UCC_Revert_War</a>).</dd>

Dealing with you is a waste of anyone's time". Obviously G2bambino hates both Magonaritus and Jonawiki for their disagreement with him on the POV issues of the UCC article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(3) Per <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, when reporting Magonaritus and Jonawiki as suspected sockpuppets at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive217#Jonawiki_and_sockpuppetry" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive217#Jonawiki_and_sockpuppetry" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive217#Jonawiki_and_sockpuppetry</a>, G2bambino did not have the "courtesy... [to]... inform other users and editors if they are mentioned in a posting, or if their actions are being discussed." A check on the discussion pages of both Jonawiki and Magonaritus will demonstrate that G2bambino is attempting to get them blocked with as little notice as possible.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(C) The 2 users Jonawiki and Magonaritus were making edits to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Galaxies_aef1.html" title="Star Wars Galaxies">Star Wars Galaxies</a>. G2bambino unequivocally engaged in an act of wikistalking (his edits can be viewed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Star_Wars_Galaxies&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Star_Wars_Galaxies&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Star_Wars_Galaxies&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history</a>) as a retaliatory act against Jonawiki and Magonaritus.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(1) Reviewing several thousand contributions from G2bambino, <b>there were no contributions to any articles on gaming or Star Wars</b> previous to his most recent contributions to the article on the Star Wars Galaxies game. The vast majority deal with monarchy, Canadiana and sexuality.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(2) His contributions <b>displayed no knowledge of the Star Wars Galaxies game</b>, just very generic edits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(3) It seems his sole interest in the Star Wars Galaxies article was because of the presence of Jonawiki and Magonaritus. <b>He even admits as much</b> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BaronJuJu#SWG_edits" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BaronJuJu#SWG_edits" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BaronJuJu#SWG_edits</a>: "<b>I was merely drawn to the issue as I've had to deal with Jonawiki (talk • contribs) and Magonaritus</b> (talk • contribs) inserting POV and highly baised edits at Upper Canada College, and noted "they"'re doing the same at SWG."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(4) This seems a possible case of wikistalking per <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHAR_a671.html#Wikistalking" title="WP:HAR">WP:HAR#Wikistalking</a>. Because of the past history of edit wars between Jonawiki/Magonaritus versus G2bambino, it seems per <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHAR_a671.html" title="WP:HAR">WP:HAR</a> that G2bambino's edits in the Star Wars Galaxies article and his accusation of sockpuppetry have the "<b>purpose of causing negative emotions in a targeted person... for the purpose of intimidating the primary target... to make editing Wikipedia unpleasant for the target, to undermine them, to frighten them, or to encourage them to stop editing entirely</b>." G2bambino's edits in Star Wars Galaxies seemed only for the purpose of inciting and harrassing Jonawiki and Magonaritus. Per <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHAR_a671.html#Types_of_harassment" title="WP:HAR">WP:HAR#Types_of_harassment</a>, his behavior fits wikistalking: <b>"The term "wiki-stalking" has been coined to describe following a contributor around the wiki, editing the same articles as the target, with the intent of causing annoyance or distress to another contributor."</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To further quote from <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHAR_a671.html#Wikistalking" title="WP:HAR">WP:HAR#Wikistalking</a>, you can see how G2bambino's behavior fits the classic behavior of a wikistalker:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Wikistalking has been a subject in at least two Arbitration Committee proceeding.... both cases below, the action of "following someone around" was not the only offense, but rather compounded the harm that the stalker was causing to the project."</li>
<li>"The matter of The Recycling Troll (TRT) occurred from February to March 2005. The incident involved an editor who was banned for an overall pattern of trolling, including stalking of one administrator. User:Jimbo Wales wrote in his final decision: Going around pestering RickK pointlessly and writing inane messages to the mailing list are clearly not attempts to help us do that, but are rather just someone disrupting wikipedia to illustrate a point. So I'm blocking User:The Recycling Troll indefinitely."</li>
<li>"In the matter of Skyring — a separate case decided August 12, 2005 — a user was found by the Arbitration Committee to have committed "wikistalking". The committee voted 5-0 that: The term "wiki-stalking" has been coined to describe following a contributor around the wiki, editing the same articles as the target, with the intent of causing annoyance or distress to another contributor. ...User:Skyring is banned from Wikipedia for one year for wiki-stalking and acting in bad faith towards other contributors, as demonstrated in evidence" 21:43, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Durova, I've had a look through Gbambino, Gbambino6, G2bambino's edits. He's changed usernames a couple times, but seems to have documented these events, and doesn't seem to be hiding anything. The editor seems to be a typical <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikignome_a9a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikignome">wikignome</a>, generally helpful and productive. He can be mildly snarky at times, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Izanbardprince&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=92981113" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Izanbardprince&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=92981113" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:RMS_Empress_of_Australia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89919235" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:RMS_Empress_of_Australia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89919235" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=King-Byng_Affair&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86952256" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=King-Byng_Affair&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86952256" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. However, the IP accusations at the top of this section don't ring true to me. At most, G2bambino should be reminded about the importance of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civility</a>. On the other hand, it seems much more likely to me that the editor who goes by <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonawiki_ecd3.html" title="User:Jonawiki">User:Jonawiki</a> may be wikistalking G2bambino. I see Jonawiki has suddenly appeared at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Talk%7EMonarchy_in_Canada_10ab.html" title="Talk:Monarchy in Canada">Talk:Monarchy in Canada</a>, one of G2bambino's favorite articles.

<li>After reviewing the presented evidence and and reading 1000s of characters on either side of the linked passages, I seem to be reminded of the argument between the wise man and the idiot--sometimes, you can't tell which is which. G(x)b does show a long and impressive list of helpful activities and much civility, albeit of strong opinion. At other times, it seems obvious that his response to given stimuli is more than he can deal with, resulting in reactions rather than planned actions. Both sides of the "war" seem to using the same evidence to prove their points. I believe that none of the particpants is really of pure heart and ethically clear in this incident, but I can see no strong evidence that "wikistalking" is taking place. Unfortunately, the current controls allow many folks to have multiple personas, making it nearly impossible to find the truth. Is there such a thing as a "restraining" order?!?

<p>Please could someone have a word with the user who keeps adding warnings to my talk page. recent example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117539679" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117539679" rel="nofollow">here</a>. She insists on accusing me of removing content, despite my having explained to her repeatedly that this is not the case. I have already raised this on the ettiquette page for comments from other editors, and asked her to stop editing my talk page and explained why the warnings are not warranted but she seems to be ignoring me.

<dd>Actually, it looks to me like she's right. You're converting stubs to redirects, repeatedly. And her thinking on the need for stubs is also strong. I suggest that instead of jsut making redirects, you start to expand the stub. A scientific discipline is far more notable than the 771st pokemon or some such. If you think the article needs attention because it hasn't been edited in a long time, add to it. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 16:17, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did a quick google, and found a site which I placed on the talk, and which led me to find a couple more articles here at WP to add tothe stub. it's still a stub, but we can probably get some progress by a little effort. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 16:25, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have tried so hard to assume good faith. I've tried to assume good faith when I've gone out of my way to on edits other users thought were simple vandalism only to receive a comment in return telling me my edits looked "fraudulent". I've continued to assume good faith while Rebroad brought my edits to ANI and while Rebroad argued over factual items that I cited, and when not having something to argue about would go onto something else. But now, every time I leave the computer for a minute, there's an additional attack, and enough is enough.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>After Rebroad's bizarre renaming of Person, I looked through his edits. This is generally what I do when I come across vandalism or other odd editing. Looking at someone's edit history helps me figure out what's going on, and while the edits were very troubling, they all appeared to be in good faith. So I left Rebroad a long and detailed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;oldid=117540256#Warning_in_re_your_page_moves" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;oldid=117540256#Warning_in_re_your_page_moves" rel="nofollow">warning</a> where I explained the various problems with his recent moves. I felt that a template warning wouldn't have helped him, and that hopefully this would.</dd>
<dd>At first Rebroad responded well to my comments (or at least not hostilly)--he left a comment on my talk page, and responded point by point to the comments I had left him.</dd>
<dd>However the <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nephology.html" title="Nephology">Nephology</a> article has for some reason been a sticking point with Rebroad. Rebroad set up an elaborate moving plan which didn't work, and needed an administrator <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">User:Arthur Rubin</a> to undo the leftovers. After this, Rebroad continued to push for Nephology to be a redirect--after I had listed it at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_expansion_6da0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for expansion">Wikipedia:Requests for expansion</a> and so I left him this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;oldid=117540256#Stop_removing_content_and_pushing_against_expansion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;oldid=117540256#Stop_removing_content_and_pushing_against_expansion" rel="nofollow">warning</a> which addressed the specific problems with his edits.</dd>
<dd>At this point, Rebroad turned hostile, leaving me a warning on my talk page that I was "impersonating someone of authority," and calling me "a Jimbo Wales sockpuppet" etc.</dd>
<dd>After I replied, Rebroad said that he hadn't read my comment, but that he was giving me a "<i>second warning for stating your opinions as fact. Further continuation of this may result in you getting blocked from editing wikipedia</i>" (somehow without having read my comments, he knew).</dd>
<dd>He has since left two unsigned template warnings on my talk page for vandalism and not assuming good faith.</dd>
<dd>He has also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117536363" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117536363" rel="nofollow">edited</a> my comments on his talk page, because he thought they were factually inaccurate, and removed two template warnings I left him: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117531736" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117531736" rel="nofollow">uw3-delete</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;diff=117540256&amp;oldid=117539890" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;diff=117540256&amp;oldid=117539890" rel="nofollow">uw4-delete</a>.</dd>

<dd>I would very much appreciate some intervention at this point. I don't know how much help I can provide an editor who needs to see Wiki policy to prove that disambig page descriptions are based on articles and that articles are not based on disambig page discriptions, or how I can possibly communicate with someone who was/ie under the impression (I didn't even get this until the end) that every statement I made that was not preceded by an "I believe" or an "I think", was my trying to say that that was wiki policy. The communication gulf here was large to begin with, larger than I knew, and now that this user has turned hostile and abusive, there's little I think I can do. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 17:09, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>Hi. In response to <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">User:Night Gyr</a>, I was going by the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html#A_rule_of_thumb" title="Wikipedia:Article size">Wikipedia:Article_size#A_rule_of_thumb</a> policy, which said that if the article is &lt;1K for more than a few months then to merge it into a related article, which is what I was doing. I think the problem here may be that wikipedia is starting to get too many policies which conflict with each other - a bit like statue law in many ways! Which is the overriding policy? --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 17:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually the guideline says,</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p><i>If an article or list has remained this size for over a couple of months, <b>consider</b> combining it with a related page. <b>Alternatively, why not fix it by adding more info? See Wikipedia:Stub. If it's an important article that's just too short, put it under Article Creation and Improvement Drive, a project to improve stubs or nonexistent articles.</b></i></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>Now, this isn't a candidate for Article Creation and improvement, but you could have listed it at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_expansion_6da0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for expansion">Wikipedia:Requests for expansion</a> or worked on it, especially as no information was added to the Cloud article. You didn't go to WikiProject Meteorology either.</dd>
<dd>And you didn't cite this or just "consider" merging it--you rammed it down people's thoats. When the whole moving shabang was undone and this article was listed at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_expansion_6da0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for expansion">Wikipedia:Requests for expansion</a>, you commented there saying that it wasn't appropriate to be expanded and then went and redirected it again (never properly I might add). The steps were being taken to expand the article at this point and you were actively preventing them. WP:Article Size doesn't say anything about that. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 17:43, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know what else to say. Miss Montegreen's comments above seems to prove my point earlier regarding assumpion of bad faith as she now accuses me of being hostile and abusive, which is totally untrue. She is also misquoting me in several places above, which you will all be able to determine for yourselves if you have the time to check my recent contributions regarding these recent events. There does seem to be a communications problem here also, and Miss Montegreen's comments often seem to be those of someone in charge and dictating policy but upon further exploration it appears that they are just her opinions, but for some reason she is reluctant to distinguish between her opinion and policy, so this further compounds the communication problem. I have stated my grounds for my actions above and on the various talk pages that discussion has taken place. If there are any further questions, please feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer them when I am next on-line.

<dd>It's Miss Mon<b>d</b>egreen, not Mon<b>t</b>egreen. And secondly, when you come to my talk page and tell me I have a superiority complex, or excuse me, that that's one possible scenario that could explain my edits--I don't need to assume anything. Those are bad faith edits on your part. You're edits can be called hostile, vandalism, talk page abuse--whatever you want, but I'm talking about the same thing. If it's an issue with the adjective's I'm using, that's fine, choose another, but those edits are still problematic.</dd>
<dd>In re my reluctance to distinguish between opinion and policy--I have never been relectant. I already write enough--I'm not going to preface each statment with an explanation or disclaimer. When it's policy it's policy. When it isn't, it isn't. When I say that something won't happen with the cloud article--that is a statement based on my beliefs, not policy. I have no idea how you cloud have thought that that statement was policy, but I can't colour code my writing for you. I wiki link policy in most places anyway so that should be a tipoff. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 18:03, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>I would also add that I will try to avoid responding to Miss Mondegreen directory from now on, as each time I do I end up with several pages of text to read each time, which rarely appear to address the underlying issue. If someone else other than Miss Montegreen could provide some feedback instead, this would be much appreciated.

<p>Hi.

I do think that this user is going out of their to the point of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalking.html" title="Stalking">stalking</a> people, despite the justifications she has so far given. --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 18:02, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At the very least, you could stop now. I understand that you didn't like being warned or criticized, but you had and have always had and could still now stop. You could stop assuming bad faith since that always escalates things, you could stop making the kind of comments you've been leaving on my talk page. You've taken this issue here and continued to escalate--I defend myself on one score and suddenly I'm being attacked for something else. This is a lot like trying to discuss wiki policy with you--I respond in terms of one issue and you move on to something else.</dd>
<dd>And, now that you can see comments other users have left for me, don't you appreciate the fact that I didn't delete comments that reflected badly on me--whether or not the person was right? <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 18:47, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>Rebroad has put up on his User Page that he's taking a wikibreak. I suggest that the time he's gone be used to expand the article, and leave this section to scroll out. It can be referenced fron the archives if we need it in a few days to deal with further conflicts. IN the meantime, make the article better, and no one can complain. I notice that I'm the only one who has tried to expand it, whiel you two have kept back and forth'ing. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 19:49, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually ThuranX--I haven't been doing much editing/writing at all. Between this and other Wiki things that required immediate attention, I've been spending my limited time here on those. In fact, it's very hard to be productive when every time I log on I find the work I've just done, undone, and that I have to go around to a half-dozen pages and leave a warning or ask an admin to revert a move or whatnot. Rebroad's probably gotten me to log more wiki hours since I came back from no internet access :). <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 20:27, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

</ul>
<p>They highlight the problematic nature of User:Rebroad's unilateral name changing of articles. User:Rebroad has been on my radar in the past because of very obtrusive and stubborn failure to listen to other editor's reasoning. He tried to revive an old and obsolete article and deleted a redirect, which was a serious action and created a lot of wasted time for many editors:</p>

</ul>
<p>Rebroad is a particularly uncollaborative and disruptive type of editor, since the types of changes he often makes have far reaching consequences and are <s>an exercise of bad faith</s> disrespectful of the hard work of many other editors who have used the consensus process to bring articles to the point at which Rebroad brashes onto the scene and destroys things.

<dd>(edit conflict) I disagree that Rebroad's edits are in bad faith; I think that he or she firmly thinks that his or her contributions are improving the encyclopedia and, in some instances, I agree. Furthermore, since I interpret the information presented here and in Rebroad's contributions as such, I would not support a block outside of normal channels (i.e. 3RR violations, personal attacks, absolutely egregious conduct despite warnings, etc.) and would not support an escalated block for anything other than repeated violations. I have no opinion on a community ban, particularly since I am unaware if <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> have been attempted. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 05:28, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think Rebroad's actions are in bad faith, but that Miss Mondegreen has exercised extraordinary patience in this situation. Good faith edits can still be performed in very disruptive ways, and this isn't the first time Rebroad has plagued us.

<dd>Thank you, to all of you. The overall problem isn't so much <b>dispute resolution</b>, though since Rebroad clearly thinks that I am attacking him, it would most likely be best if other users dealt with future issues. If I see something, I can go to another editor, and Rebroad can then still accuse me of something, but if Rebroad is warned, hopefully he'll see that it's not due to my having a personal vendetta or enough free time to stalk wiki-users.</dd>
<dd>The problem seems to be that Rebroad's views in terms of editing are a gulf apart from the majority of Wikipedians, and when such things are pointed out to him, he won't accept this unless the exact issue is word by word dealt with in a Wiki policy or guideline, and then he often finds another Wiki reason to make his edit wiki justifiable. He's highly defensive, and so I think he may have seen the logic when I pointed out that disambiguation page descriptions were based on the articles they were describing and that the articles were not based on the descriptions on the disambiguation pages, but his back was to a wall and he decided that this idea made no logical sense and was "blinkered", <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad/Archive_2&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117408699" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad/Archive_2&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117408699" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> and then I had to find wiki-policy to prove the obvious--that descriptions are based on the thing and not the thing based on the description. If someone describes me as being 6'5", I don't grow, I correct the description.</dd>
<dd>Rebroad comes to articles with a definitive view, and doesn't often stay long. He doesn't do the necessary research, either on or off Wikipedia to back his edits (specifically moves), he doesn't talk with other editors, and he doesn't see why it's necessary because he knows why it's right. <b>He reads be bold and sees it as saying be bold until a conflict arises.</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad/Archive_2&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=116572688" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad/Archive_2&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=116572688" rel="nofollow">[23]</a></dd>
<dd>I do believe that his edits are in good faith, but he's been repeatedly told things and ignored them. What Rebroad needs to understand is that sometimes the Wiki community will say, <i>you are "wrong"</i>--and it doesn't matter if they are wrong--if you cannot convince them then the article or the policy or the whatever will stay "wrong". Everyone thinks that they are right, and you can bring in other editors to try and ask for outside opinions and cite sources and policy, but in the end, your version of right or better may not win. If Rebroad can't deal with that, and decides not to get opinions and cite sources and read talk pages and be a responsible editor, then <b>no matter how much his edits are in good faith--his unwillingness to change his behavoir is not.</b></dd>
<dd>Rebroad is taking a break, and <b>we can should hope that he comes back with a renewed willingness to work with others</b>--a lot of his edits needed communication simply because when other people don't know what's going on they do assume the worst. If he comes back and his behavoir doesn't change, then we'll template warn, and he'll either take notice or incur blocks. The only thing we'll have to be vigilant about is that he does have a habit of deleting warnings and editing others' talk page comments. <b>There's no reason to block him <i>now</i></b>--he didn't break 3RR, and he stopped short of getting a block on removing article content, and he's taking a break anyway. When he comes back, if he continues this behavoir, we'll know that he's been thoroughly warned and that he's aware of proper protocol, and <b>if he needs to be warned again, he should start being warned at bad faith level templates for these types of edits.</b> Hopefully, Rebroad will have a fresh approach to editing when he comes back, and if not--then at least this ANI and whole shebang should keep him from flying under the radar anymore.</dd>
<dd>Actually, thought here: <b>could someone post a link to this discussion once it's archived on his talk page</b>, as talk pages are for communication with the user and about the user? Would that be appropriate, especially given his deletion of warnings? If he caused problems in the future it would let people know not to warn him with a level 1, and if he didn't, no big. Any thoughts? <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 08:11, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>Hi again. Hopefully this will be my last words on this matter. I am quite surprised that people have considered Miss Mondegreen's patience to be saintly. Just from this page alone, I feel I have been victimised a number of times:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Referring to my edits as "bizarre" or "odd".</li>
<li>Misquoting me, and being selective in her examples of my edits, such as trying to suggest my interpretation of "be bold" is incorrect, but failing to refer to the wikipedia guidelines I have quoted to back this up (such as <a href="../../../b/o/l/Wikipedia%7EBOLD%2C_revert%2C_discuss_cycle_e770.html" title="Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle">Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle</a>).</li>
<li>Issuing warnings to me on the asumpion of bad faith, and not allowing for different interpretations of wikipedia policy and guidelines. I believe Miss Mondegreen is interpreting some of the wikipedia policies in ways I had never even thought of. She also fails to see how they can be interpreted any other way, and therefore accuses me of not following them or misquoting them. (Miss Mondegreen seems to go to extremes in her interpretation of policies. When she sees the sentence "consider merging", she interprets that as "think about it, but certainly don't do it", whereas to me it seems pretty obvious that merging is being presented as a valid option.)</li>
<li>Accusing me of "elaborate plans" (more bad faith) - I suspect this is more an indication of how Miss Mondegreen thinks, whereas with me, what you see is what you get - no elaborate plans, just a genuine intention to improve wikipedia.</li>
<li>Accusing me of being hostile, accusing me of calling her a "Jimbo sockpuppet" (which I only offered her as a joke hypothesis for her recent actions) - I stand by my analysis that she is impersonating someone in authority given that she has so far failed to show why her opinions should be considered more important than mine. This is not being hostile, this is stating fact, IMHO.</li>
<li>Accusing me of bad faith due to use of the word "fraudulent". My comment about fraudulent stands as when I renamed Person I genuinely believed it to be uncontroversial, however, Miss Mondegreen went onto labelling it uncontroversial when asking for it to be moved back while at the same time argueing to me that it was controversial!</li>
<li>Accusing me of saying she has a superiority complex. I did not say this, I provided it as one of many options for possible explanations of her behaviour, the last option including an apology from me for not manging to understand the reasons for her behaviour.</li>
<li>Accusing me of editing her comments on my talk page. This is distortion of the truth, IMHO. I changed only the title of the section to remove word warning as I did not consider it valid (given it was based on her intrepretation of policy wording alone). I did not change any of her comments.</li>
<li>Repeatedly accusing me of encouraging users to not expand Nephology. This may be a symantic issue here. I encourage users to expand the subject, but that it should be done within the cloud article until it goes over 1Kb at which point it would deserve an article of its own. (This is based on wikipedia guidelines I stated previously). I think it is bizarre to insist on keeping a one sentence article that has not been touched since 2004.</li>
<li>Stalking me. Dispite her rationalisaions, the sole reason Miss Mondegreen is even involved in the Nephology debate is because she targetted it after having seen my involvement with it.</li>
<li>Using violent language and attributing it to my actions, such as "rammed it down people's throats". She also says I didn't "consider merging" - claiming to be able to read my mind it seems. This sort of comment also does not help to garner my patience with her.</li>
</ol>
<p>To respond to some of Miss Mondegreen's points:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding the unsigned warnings on her talk page - since these templates are fairly new to me, I hadn't realised they needed to be manually signed, or whether they should be.</li>
<li>I would not generally have given warnings in those instances, and as I said in the comments on her talk page, they are partly there to demonstrate a point - i.e. anyone can dish out warnings based on their own (possibly distorted) interpretation of the guidelines. Whether this should be done - I would argue that it should not. The guidelines leave much to presonal interpretation, such as saying "do this only if this is important", and the user is left to decide what is meant by "important". Miss Mondegreen and I seem to differ in our opinions on these points. Unless the policies or guidelines can be clarified, then there would appear to be no right or wrong at first glance, and that this would have to be something determined by concensus.</li>
<li>Speaking of consensus, I would like to point out that it was I who made the effort to get other parties involved. Miss Mondegreen seemed quite happy to continue plastering my talk page with warnings without getting anyone else's opinion on the matter.</li>
<li>She continues to state disambigaution pages should be based on the articles they refer to rather than the other way around. She states this as fact, and even claims to have found a policy which states this, but has not cited it. (I believe that her continued alternations between stating wikipedia policy in one instance, and then stating her opinions as fact in another are not helping people to understand the issue.) IMHO, disambig pages and their corresponding articles are a symbiosis. They support each other. I agree that in the majority of cases a disambig page is created based on the articles that are related to, but in some instances the disambiguation page can help bring clarity and direction for the articles to which they refer. This seems to have been the case (and others have agreed with me) with the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person.html" title="Person">Person</a> article.</li>
<li>The "communication gulf" to which Miss Mondegreen refers, I believe is primarily a result of her reluctance to distinguish between what she is stating her opinion and when she is stating policy. It makes it appear she is dictating her opinion as policy, which doesn't help to build rapport (certainly not with me anyway). I believe this is why I have seen so many other users infuriated by her comments and requesting ceasation of communcation with her.</li>
<li>Apologies by the way of mis-spelling Miss Mondegreen. This was not intentional, and you will see that I was already going back and changing the mis-spelling where I noticed it even before she commented on it.</li>
<li>I didn't respond to Miss Mondegreen's analogy regarding her being described as 6'5" as I felt it was not a fair analogy at all expected most people would agree. So, yes, in this example, I admit that I have ignored some things I've been told, but I am not aware that I have ignored anything I should not have.</li>
<li>I also dispute that I come to articles with a definitive view, and that I always try to keep an open mind. The only views I tend to be definitive about is that articles should be reported in a NPOV.</li>
<li>I'm not sure to what Miss Mondegreen is referring when she says she defends herself on one score only to have me attack her on another.</li>
<li>Regarding "his unwillingness to change his behaviour" - to which behaviour is she referring? Repeatedly told which things? These statements seem to say a lot, but they actually say nothing without the necessary specifics.</li>
<li>Regarding my being aware of "proper protocol", I do not believe I was ever unaware. Following this discussion, I am not aware that any protocols have been changed, and unless someone can provide the specifics as mentioned in my previous comment, I can't see how my behaviour needs to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be perfectly honest, I haven't responded to many of the points above so far as I felt that by doing so I would be allowing myself to become obsessed with the discussion. As other users have said, they don't have the time to respond to such "ranting", and therefore this will hopefully be my last words on this matter - I have far more important things to get on with (including, sometimes, improving wikipedia). I hope that my comments above in someway help to show that views in terms of editing are not a "gulf apart from the majority of Wikipedians", but it's just that I can't afford to spend all my time explaining myself like this.</p>
<p>To respond to other users comments:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Morven, thanks for your comments and for saying I seem to have trouble dealing with criticism. I'd like to think I always welcome criticism, although it does frustrate me when people jump to incorrect conclusions - I don't think I mind so much when they jump to correct ones, although this seems to happen rarely!</li>
<li>ThuranX, thanks for expanding the article and for being so level headed (this does not imply that everyone else is not - as my friend just pointed out to me!)</li>
<li>Lucy-marie - I think you have a good point, and hope that admins are careful in analysing all warnings before making a decision to impose a block on anyone.</li>
<li>Fyslee, I still think there was enough information in the Slipped disc article to warrant its own article, but I was outvoted regarding being against the merge. I accepted the outcome and haven't revisited the article since, so I'm not sure why you are mentioning this. This is an example where I think a merge should not have happened, unlike nephology where I am for a merge. I don't see the justifcation for saying I am uncollaborative and disruptive. As per <a href="../../../b/o/l/Wikipedia%7EBOLD%2C_revert%2C_discuss_cycle_e770.html" title="Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle">Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle</a>, I was bold in my initial edit, and then it went to a vote to seek consensus. End of story - I do accept when I am in the minority.</li>
<li>Iamunknown. Thanks for your comments. I'm glad you can see that I edit in good faith.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>DISAMBIGUATION PAGES AND ARTICLES</b><br />
Rebroad--you and I have been communicating on multiple pages. If I go to the trouble of tracking down policy and citing it for you in one place, I'm going to assume that you bothered to read my answer, and am not going to keep a list of things Rebroad wants to know/needs proof of. I didn't think it was necessary that I also link every other word I wrote here. I linked you to the disambiguation page policy on your talk page, btw, and policy aside, since I am hoping this is still a misunderstanding at least on this count, let me explain what I mean:</p>
<p>Disambiguation pages are based on articles by their very merit. If there is only one article with the name XYZ--then there is no disambiguation page needed. If there is XYZ, XYZ (album), XYZ (movie), XYZ (the worst song you every heard), then and only then is a disambiguation page created. Articles come first, then disambiguation page. The disambiguation page lists the articles, and then, based on the articles, writes a description of what it is. Often, it's not hard. XYZ, a brand of toilet paper made by WGBY XYZ, an album by the BBB XYZ, a movie starring ____ and ____ released in _____</p>
<p>Now, is what is notable about the movie changes, the article will. Maybe, at the time of release, the stars of the movie were notable, but twenty years later, no one knows who the stars are and the director is famous. The article will most likely be changed to reflect that--the draw at the time was X, but it's a cult-classic now because of director ____. As such, the disambiguation page should change to reflect that as well--generally, it is people who edit the articles who edit the articles entires on disambig pages.</p>
<p>XYZ, a brand of toilet paper made by WGBY XYZ, an album by the BBB XYZ, a cult classic from 2023 by director _______</p>
<p>Now with the Person article, the Person article doesn't change to reflect the world, it changes because we're having writing issues. The Person article currently deals with philosophical and legal personhood, and so issues of splits and renaming and etc have to be sorted out.</p>
<p>The disambig page that said it was a philosophical article was wrong, and renaming the article based on that was wrong. An article name reflects the article, and that name didn't reflect the article, or rather reflected in inaccurately. You may not have liked my 6' analogy, but it's a fairly good one I think. Disambiguation pages are lists--nothing more. They are lists of articles with one line descriptions of the articles. As articles change, the descriptions should too.</p>
<p>I don't understand how an article could be based on a one-line description, or how they could "work together in symbiosis".</p>
<p>I also don't know what you are talking about in re <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person.html" title="Person">Person</a>. Could you provide a link?</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Editing comments</b> -- I provided a link. They could see that the edit was minor, but you don't edit a comment or the title of a comment at all. You changed what I wrote on your talk page, and that's a violation of policy, that I linked you to in edit summary.</p>
<p><b>Nephology</b> -- expanding within Cloud has already been explained to you</p>
<p><b>Stalking you</b> -- I looked at your edits to see if you were a vandal or a good faith editor. If you would have preferred, I could have reported after the Person move a list of your very problematic moves here instead.</p>
<p><b>WP:BOLD</b> First, in re the page you linked to--it's an essay not a policy or guideline, and you completely ignored the whole "DO NOT Revert back!" Btw, I was referring to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> which I believe I've linked you to before and is an actual guideline.</p>
<p><b>unsigned warnings</b> I signed the warnings I left on your talk page, and you didn't leave the warnings in the same edit, so you should have seen that the previous one was left unsigned. You also added them haphazardly to various sections. Also, just because you can do something, doesn't mean you do. If you go around warning editors for things that they haven't done, the editor should report you and you'll get blocked most likely. Same way you can't just add things you make up just because you can. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Wikipedia is self-correcting and you know that well. You had a problem with me, and took it here, but the problem is is that the things you cite in your defense don't support you. You cite an essay as something official and you did exactly what the essay said not to do anyway. You were told before you commented again here that "The WIkipolicies nad guidelines regarding splitting in no way requires all articles start as sections of others." and yet you bring it up yet again, still unable to listen to others when being told that you are incorrect about something.</p>
<p><b>proper protocol</b></p>
<p>You should have been aware before, and now you certainly are, that almost any move you would like to make should be brought up for discussion and should be listed at WP:requests for expansion. In terms of the various very problematic moves you've been making--you've been addressed, at length, by multiple editors and you should know how to go about making these kinds of moves in the future.</p>
<p><b>consensus</b> I listed the article at Request for expansion, had discussed the issue in re Nephology with two other editors, one an adim, and if you continued, would most certainly have listed you for a 3rr block, or a removal of content block or brought you here. I don't believe that we needed or need mediation--if you don't want to listen to anything that I say, that's fine. I hope that you will avoid this type of behavoir in the future, and if not, and I am the one to catch the behavoir, I will try and get another editor to be the one to talk will you since I know that you think that I am stalking you or some other conspiracy based thing. Also in re consensus, when you specifically violate it and make it impossible for a regular editor to fix that, its not controversial to bring the page back to the last agreed upon version. We had last had consensus on the page being named Person (who knows when we will again), and we don't need to get together a vote or need consensus to undo vandalism or one editor striking out. That's the antithesis of consensus, and since the admins at WP:RM agreed with me, I don't know why you're still bringing this up. Lots of moves listed as non-controversial are moved, because the admins there think that they are controversial. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 03:40, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<p>Rebroad has now admitted that the warnings he placed on my talk page were a to "demonstrate a point - i.e. anyone can dish out warnings based on their own (possibly distorted) interpretation of the guidelines." This is a clear violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, in addition Rebroad has listed an accusation list and I'm beginning to feel like I can't edit or say anything without adding another point to his list. This is what I meant earlier about defending myself on one score only to be attacked on another, a lot of the things on the list are things I accused him of, where he says I misquoted him or didn't understand that it really was funny when the only possible explanation for my actions was my being a Jimbo sockpuppet or having a superiority complex (or he's all wrong, in which case he apologises). Rebraod had said that he was taking a break, which I don't know whether or not he still is, but if the continued accusations etc., don't stop, because at this point I do consider this to be harrassment I'd appreciate if some sort of action was taken. I'm not entirely sure what Rebroad was/is aiming for with his continued comments here, but it's time for him to cease and desist--this is really getting out of hand. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 03:40, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<p>Rebroad was apparantly searching through ANI archives or something, and yesterday posted this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Geo.plrd&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=117863984" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Geo.plrd&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=117863984" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> on Geo.plrd's talk page. I'm a little concerned that Rebroad seems to be actively searching out information on me and things to use against me and for a way to "impose sanctions" on me for the warnings I left on his talk page.</p>
<p>I'm also a little concerned and confused by Geo.plrd's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117938325" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117938325" rel="nofollow">reply on Rebroad's talk page</a> (how I found out about all this btw.)

<p>I clearly rubbed Geo.plrd the wrong way, though I'm not sure how since I've had no interaction with this user, ever AFAIK, but I'm bothered both by the proposal, his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;diff=117938325&amp;oldid=117917059" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebroad&amp;diff=117938325&amp;oldid=117917059" rel="nofollow">reply to Rebroad</a>, Rebroad's behavoir which is coming close to stalking, and his new comments on his talk page, where he accused me of bad faith when I asked to have the block for his suspected sockpuppet SHORTENED.

Every edit I make seems to inflame the situation, when they should be irrelevant or in the case of the shortening block, cool the situation down. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 12:40, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<p>I'm experiencing a problem with a number of editors repeatedly removing a {{Notability}} tag from an article. Several editors, including myself, have some serious concerns about the notability of the article <span class="plainlinksneverexpand lx"><a href="../../../p/a/l/Pallywood.html" title="Pallywood">Pallywood</a> <tt>(</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../p/a/l/Pallywood.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../p/a/l/Pallywood.html" rel="nofollow">edit</a><tt>|</tt><a href="../../../p/a/l/Talk%7EPallywood_5bbc.html" title="Talk:Pallywood">talk</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../p/a/l/Pallywood.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../p/a/l/Pallywood.html" rel="nofollow">history</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Pallywood_7d3b.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Pallywood_7d3b.html" rel="nofollow">links</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../p/a/l/Pallywood.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../p/a/l/Pallywood.html" rel="nofollow">watch</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a><tt>)</tt></span>; these are summarised at <a href="../../../p/a/l/Talk%7EPallywood_5bbc.html#Notability_questions" title="Talk:Pallywood">Talk:Pallywood#Notability questions</a>. However, only one person has provided a substantive reply and he also thinks the article's subject isn't notable. Other editors have argued that the subject <i>is</i> notable, but they have mostly declined to explain why, other than appealing to the number of Google hits (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pallywood&amp;diff=117791109&amp;oldid=117786337" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pallywood&amp;diff=117791109&amp;oldid=117786337" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, several editors acting in a tag-team have now taken to repeatedly deleting the {{Notability}} tag as a means of shutting down a debate which they apparently don't want to have (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117867733&amp;oldid=117866196" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117867733&amp;oldid=117866196" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117757564&amp;oldid=117755647" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117757564&amp;oldid=117755647" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117788251&amp;oldid=117758100" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pallywood&amp;diff=117788251&amp;oldid=117758100" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>).

<dd>Actually the notability questions were a <i>followup</i> to the AfD. The very first two sentences of <a href="../../../p/a/l/Talk%7EPallywood_5bbc.html#Notability_questions" title="Talk:Pallywood">Talk:Pallywood#Notability questions</a> make this clear: "I'd like to return to an issue that came up during the recent AfD discussion: the question of notability. Several of the contributors to the discussion asserted that the subject of the article was notable, but without explaining why." The questions are significant, substantiated and asked in good faith; as <a href="../../../x/4/2/User%7EX42bn6_9d4f.html" title="User:X42bn6">x42bn6</a> says on the talk page, "This is a legitimate concern with a legitimate policy." An AfD does <i>not</i> end debate on a question like this, particularly when the AfD results in no consensus. I'm trying to find a consensus on the notability issue, following the inconclusive AfD. Personally I think it's very significant that those asserting notability have avoided answering the questions, as that goes right to the heart of whether we should have the article in the first place. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 11:54, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a>, if you're going to lodge a complaint against me on the Administrators' noticeboard, I think it would be courteous to notify me of this action on my Talk page. Secondly, the tagging is, as I pointed out on the article's Talk page, without merit. It hinges entirely on the premise that the article is about a term. This premise has been thoroughly rejected - the article is about the phenomenon the term describes. In fact, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> and other editors have made several efforts to delete or gut this article, all of which have failed, and this is but the most recent, namely which is to reduce the scope of the article to the point that it's meaningless and then question its notability. I'm not going to run afoul with the admin noticeboard by removing the tag, but I want to put on record a strong objection against this sort of behavior. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 12:54, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>DailyKos.com dug up a 14-year-old child molesting allegation against Jay Hone, the husband of Rep. <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heather_Wilson_74d8.html" title="Heather Wilson">Heather Wilson</a> (R-NM), three weeks before an election. As secretary of the state's Department of Children, Youth and Families, Wilson moved the investigative file from one location to another within the department. Political enemies have been trying to get mileage out of it ever since, and DailyKos.org dug it up three weeks before the election.</p>
<p>Despite these smear tactics, Wilson won re-election and now a Wikipedia editor wants to reward their efforts by permanently enshrining them in Wilson's Wikipedia article. Hone was never arrested or charged with any crime and the county prosecutor, a Democrat, admitted in a 1996 interview that Wilson broke no law by moving the file.</p>

<dd>A reputable allegation on Daily Kos will be repeated in a reliable source. A smear from an anonymous poster that can't be confirmed will not. This isn't like Josh Marshall posted this on Talking Points Memo and vouched for his reporting. If there isn't a name to place to the source, then it might as well be lonelygirl16, and equally unreliable. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 01:08, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The pertinent argument is that it's not <i>reliable</i>, rather than not reputable. Reputability is in the eye of the beholder. Reliability is something we have <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">an entire policy on</a>.

<p>Fortunately for us, we don't have to worry about settling that debate here; the reliable sources in question are the Albuquerque Tribune, Albuquerque Journal, KOAT TV, and other established news organizations that picked up the story from places like Daily Kos and did their own verification. Is anyone questioning those organizations' status as reliable sources? -<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteforsyth_da42.html" title="User:Peteforsyth">Pete</a> 01:11, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The established newsies are also saying that District Attorney Bob Schwartz, a Democrat, says no laws were broken; that the DailyKos "resurfacing" of these allegations three weeks before the election resulted in some <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturfing.html" title="Astroturfing">astroturfing</a> phone calls to the <i>Albuquerque Tribune;</i> and that the police report about Jay Hone has been a public record at the Albuquerque Police Department for 14 years.

<dd>Which is why current editors of the page in question, including you and me, are basing the current revision more closely on what's reported in the mainstream media, and why citations of DailyKos have been removed.

<li>Actually, I think it is more of a full disclosure of an admitted persuasion so that other editors will be more aware of Jeff's stance in a relevant discussion.

These types of threads are ridiculous. Very time editors have attempted to "police" userpage content it has ended it stalemate and a waste of everybody's time and effort. Unless there is something highly inappropriate on someone's userpage its best to least it alone. Oh, and if people do notice something they think may be problematic on a userpage, it should be discussed with the user on their talkpage before being brought here.

<dd>Um, nope. Your memory of what actually happened is faulty. The size of the image was reduced, and the consensus was abundantly clear that it was considered acceptable. It was never removed.

<dd>Friday, I'd give you a quid pro quo about your userpage, but I don't have time and I have decided (after a steep learning curve yesterday) that civility is best. Allow me to say though, that I have both a FA and GA article to my credit, I actively edit articles, revert vandalism, and the pictures of myself on my page are actually used in a serious article about same-sex marriage here on Wikipedia. I feel as if you want me to both apologize for making myself comfortable and enjoying myself here, as well as censoring my userpage until it meets your criteria for appropriateness. Sorry, but that ain't gonna happen. I dfon't get paid for the work I do here, and if you (and by extension the rest of the community) have to put up with a silly--but entirely innocent-- userpage of my creation in the process, so be it. Now I am off to work. I realize saving lives and stopping pain is not as important as putting my nose to the grindstone here, but I do have a mortgage to pay. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 16:11, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You realize that I was not against you in this discussion, right? I think that folks should be able to have anything they want on their userpage, so long as it isn't libelous, and isn't attacking another Wikipedian.

<p>Dear Wikipedians, how is all this bickering an "incident"? It is not Jeffwp's fault that we have no clear policy on what is permissible on user pages. We have many, many political statements scattered over many, many userpages. If you want to get rid of them, look for consensus on <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia:User page</a>. I would support a general "no political campaigning on userpages", but this would have to apply for <i>everybody</i> and will have to be phrased very carefully. This will not happen overnight, there is no point in picking on Jeffwp in particular, if you care about the topic, look for a clearly outlined wiki-wide solution. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 16:27, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree about this case, though I don't agree with you on not allowing political campaigning on userpages. I just don't see how it hurts anyone if Jeffpw supports Clinton and I support Obama, McCain, Edwards, or whoever. It's not like the content of a userpage has any effect on the content of articles.<a href="../../../k/s/c/User%7EKscottbailey_c4a9.html" title="User:Kscottbailey">K. Scott Bailey</a> 16:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>sure. We need a sane balance between Wikipedians' wish to give a brief account of themselves and their views, and blatant abuse of Wikipedia as a webhost. Jeffpw little "Clinton/Obama" box clearly falls in the former category. My point is that we <i>do</i> need such guidelines, so that we can clamp down on abuse in concert and not according to the personal taste of the person doing the clamping-down. And yes, I do think Jeffwp is overdoing it with the userboxes. I am not interested in Jeffwp's ancestry, IQ, sex life, viral infections, preferred drink or quilting activities any more than in his political alignments. His userboxes may be used as a deterring example in a userbox discussion, but we cannot take away his userboxes before there is a wiki-wide consensus to do away with this sort of nonsense. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 16:48, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I couldn't disagree with you more. If you don't want to know about his ancestry, IQ, sex life, et al, don't go to his page. I find userpages fascinating and enlightening, and don't think that their content (unless it attacks others) should be a major concern to anyone. Again, if you don't care about the intricacies of that person, don't visit the page. Why should WP pass more guidelines for something that doesn't hurt anyone?<a href="../../../k/s/c/User%7EKscottbailey_c4a9.html" title="User:Kscottbailey">K.

<dd>I would encourage you to worry more about the good of the project (the articles) and less about the political preferences of users you happen to not like, disagree with. Making known one's political preference on a PERSONAL userpage (not in an article) is not the same as advertising a company. Additionally, I believe an argument could be made that the ban on advertising applies more to the creation of pages for non-notable companies run by the creator than the hypothetical you described above. One way or the other, you're wasting everyone's time with this frivolous complaint. I am unwatching this page.<a href="../../../k/s/c/User%7EKscottbailey_c4a9.html" title="User:Kscottbailey">K.

<dd>I can understand why ChrisO protected it himself rather than go through the time involved in going through the normal process. Tewfik and others were repeatedly removing maps from several map categories, and then putting speedy-delete notices on them. Discussion was futile. Tewfik never accepted the reasons for the existence of the map categories. These are the same map category names as are used in wikimedia commons. All Tewfik's questions were answered, yet he and others continued to delete all images in a couple categories and put them up for speedy deletes. The categories in question were <a href="../../../m/a/p/Category%7EMaps_of_the_Palestinian_territories_cf72.html" title="Category:Maps of the Palestinian territories">Category:Maps of the Palestinian territories</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/p/Category%7EMaps_of_the_history_of_the_Palestinian_territories_ff97.html" title="Category:Maps of the history of the Palestinian territories">Category:Maps of the history of the Palestinian territories</a>. Admin tools were being incorrectly used in speedy deleting these categories. Because the categories still contain subcategories even when all the images are removed. See <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Categories" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#Categories</a>. It states: "Empty categories (no articles or <b>subcategories</b> for at least four days) whose only content has consisted of links to parent categories." See the image and category talk pages for more info and discussion: Image talk:Israel.png. See also my user talk page. So there may be multiple levels of admin problems. I think the more serious is the incorrect speedy-deleting of the categories. There were additional links I had to rebuild from scratch when recreating the categories. I really don't care what the name of the map category is. I just wish this constant name changing, category deletion, and image category reclassification would end. I now find out today that some people object to the name <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_territories.html" title="Palestinian territories">Palestinian territories</a>. See <a href="../../../m/a/p/Category_talk%7EMaps_of_the_Palestinian_territories_5b3a.html#_Criteria_for_inclusion_in_this_category" title="Category talk:Maps of the Palestinian territories">Category talk:Maps of the Palestinian territories# Criteria for inclusion in this category</a>. A comment excerpt: "Not to mention that 'Palestinian territories' is a POV term anyway, particularly if it is connected to a map that shows all of the West Bank and part of Jerusalem as 'Palestinian territories'." Are we going to delete this wikipedia page: <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_territories.html" title="Palestinian territories">Palestinian territories</a>? If "Palestinian territories" is not correct, then tell me the official wikipedia names to be used. Don't the UN and wikipedia and the most of the world use the phrase "Palestinian territories"? We have map categories for Hawaii, the Bahamas, etc.. They are all the most common names in English for these land groupings. So why not the Palestinian territories? -<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 07:22, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As the creator and original categoriser of the image (which is actually on the Commons - this dispute is over its categorisation on the English Wikipedia) I was surprised and frustrated to see it becoming a battleground for other editors, particularly some who I've seen being involved in POV edit wars in the past. I hadn't been involved in Timeshifter's categorisation project in the English Wikipedia, so I regarded myself as an outside party in his dispute with Tewfik; it was in that capacity that I protected the article to stop a futile edit war so that the matter could be discussed on the talk page. If I misinterpreted my status in the dispute I apologise - I've unprotected the image. But I strongly advise that Tewfik shouldn't remove the tag again - I've explained on the talk page my criteria for categorising it as I did on the Commons <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Israel.png&amp;diff=117660362&amp;oldid=117659204" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Israel.png&amp;diff=117660362&amp;oldid=117659204" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 08:14, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you are were an 'outside party', then how could you characterise as a "a futile edit war" the reversion of three established editors by one other editor (Timeshifter)?

<dd>No problem, always happy to clarify. Admins make mistakes - we all do - and we're accountable to the community for our actions. I think the most important thing is how we respond when we're held accountable.

<dd>Respectfully, I hope that you can add a bit more to the discussion. Yes, mistakes do happen. However, I have difficulty with the idea that you believe you can be in any way an “outside party” when protecting an image you created; also, protecting immediately after reverting the image to the "right" version has been more than frowned upon (to say the least) in these pages again and again, as I’m sure you’re aware. What you’ve done strikes me as being a clear and deliberate violation, yet you've responded with <i>"If I misinterpreted my status in the dispute I apologise"</i>. Perhaps you could just go back and strike out the "If," and promise to be more careful in the future.

<p>At what point does persistent disruptive editing, after many warnings, become vanadalism? Does it ever do so? Can a block be imposed, or do we just have to put up with it? I'm not clear on any of these questions, partly because I've seen them answered in different ways at diferent times and on different Talk pages.</p>
<p>For example <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharoog10_65aa.html" title="User:Charoog10">User:Charoog10</a> has for weeks (probably much longer) been reverting articles to his own notions of correct format (everything from capitalising all words in headers to turning standard lists in to ornate tables), removing templates like {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} without explanation, moving articles from correct to incorrect titles (without correcting double redirects or editing the article in line with the new name), etc. He simply ignores all advice, explanation, and warnings from various editors and admins.</p>
<p>Now, do we all just keep clearing up after him, leaving comments at his Talk page for him to ignore, or is there a point at which we apply a block in the hope that the enforeced rest from misbehaving will make him think again? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 09:25, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I haven't looked at this particular user, so this is just a general comment in response to your opening questions. Edits don't have to be defined as vandalism to be blockable.

<dd>No comment about content, you two are splitting hairs far too finely for someone not a Metal expert to have an opinion about. Personally, I can't tell the difference between your two preferred versions. However, Deathrocker, you are not on an even footing here, which you really should know. Due to the arbcom ruling, you can't revert war <i>at all</i>. It's a bad idea for everyone, but for you, it's a blockable offense. Sorry, but you really should be aware of this, you've got half a dozen blocks listed on that arbitration case. Please try to settle it by discussion, rather than edit warring. In fact, that's how you have to settle it. The arbcom restriction clearly means any edit war, you will lose. Your good behaviour needs to be enforced.</dd>
<dd>By the way "reverting vandalism" isn't an excuse here, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia: Vandalism</a> needs to be pretty clear, someone inserting gibberish, blanking swathes of the page, that sort of thing. This is just moving information around, reformatting, and changing cites - both versions have cites. This is clearly a content dispute, and not vandalism. I hate to do this for so long, for a well meaning editor, but your last block was for 72 hours earlier this month.

<p>I have already written a sock puppet report on this individual at <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Landau7_7ec4.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Landau7">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Landau7</a> but was recommended by an admin to bring it to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> because the sockpuppet page isn't monitored enough. This seemed the most appropriate category to post it under.</p>
<p>I would recommend that the report itself be checked out, where the majority of my arguments are listed. Actually, someone in the family of one of the sock puppets admitted to me in private e-mail (of their own volition) that this was indeed going on, but I would like to ask their permission before I quote them as a source.</p>
<p>I myself am a biased source for the article in question (<a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishpachah_Lev-Tsiyon_402d.html" title="Mishpachah Lev-Tsiyon">Mishpachah Lev-Tsiyon</a>) so stopped editing it. I have likewise ceased contributing to the talk page until this issue gets resolved. While I made a mistake of classifying one of the user's as the group's leader (this mistake came about when I noticed the group's compound's IP making most of the heavy edits and I assumed they were the same due to similar phraseology -- I later apologized when I discovered they had a similar editing history), it would seem the group's leader (the one behind the "anon" IP) tried to contextually pose as an admin and then continued to character assassinate me on the talk page. I only noted his IP because of his own bias.</p>
<p>Anyway, please feel free to check the report I filed above (I will be updating there instead of here unless this poses a problem). It goes into better detail than I can on here.

<dd>I was about to say that this was a standard block escalation, first one day, then one week ... but something about his contributions looked familiar. He reminded me a lot of a sock puppet case I closed: <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Enlighter1_bd44.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Enlighter1">Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Enlighter1</a>. So I dug a bit, and noticed his very first contribution was a request to unblock him. Very strange. Seems he was autoblocked per <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.114.131.26.html" title="User talk:84.114.131.26">User talk:84.114.131.26</a> ... which is an IP address never to be unblocked because it is used by, guess who, Enlighter1.

<dd>Nardman, please understand that currently there is no consensus supporting the idea that deleting warnings from your own talk page is vandalism. Your warning: "Do not blank warnings from your talk page, as you did today.

<dd>Yes, admins definitely to be careful with the checkboxes in regards to those kind of blocks. I only leave account creation blocked if the username creator has been creating several inappropriate names that indicate that they were all spawned from the same person or if its an obvious sock of a blocked editor.<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal"><font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b>¤~Persian Poet Gal</b></i></font></font></a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal"><font color="purple"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 18:24, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed, admins should be more careful about the blocks. The last time I've disabled new account creation was on the block of The Anome2, which previously created impersonating usernames and even asked to be unblocked for the purpose of creating further ones. However, I'm not quite sure what template should be given in such cases. {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameBlocked_b445.html" title="Template:UsernameBlocked">UsernameBlocked</a>}} can't be given because it's encouraging new account, nor should {{<a href="../../../v/a/n/Template%7EVandalblock_23dd.html" title="Template:Vandalblock">Vandalblock</a>}} because the user hasn't actually vandalized yet. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10">Michaelas10</a><sup><a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><font color="darkgreen">Respect my authoritah</font></a></sup> 18:42, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I tend to ignore the block messages in those cases. At the point of which a sock or username vandal is already pretty known of on the New Name logs, I just tag the userpage with indefblock or the sock tag. Might be better just to ignore any tag or message all together on some occasions.<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal"><font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b>¤~Persian Poet Gal</b></i></font></font></a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal"><font color="purple"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 18:45, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tags are not absolutely required. If no tag really does the situation justice, then don't leave one. I often don't see the point for obvious vandalism-only accounts. As for blocks - I always think about the implications of the autoblock or account creation block when I block someone. But I don't do that many username blocks, so... <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="green">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="purple">ka</font></a> 21:09, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, as I've pointed out here before, they are required (see the Blocking policy page); they're also a courtesy to other admins, who otherwise might (as I often have done) start to block someone only to find that someone has beaten them to it. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 22:16, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have an anonymous editor who keeps adding the same sites to a number of porn star articles.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive219_f6cc.html" title="Edit section: Unresolved: Dr. Stephen J. Krune III.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Unresolved: Dr. Stephen J. Krune III.</span></h2>
<p>I have decided to bring this back to AN/I over a highly controversial&#160;!vote on my RfA (no canvassing is intended, opposes are high anyway); and I do not want to start a discussion there. This is the oppose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FAcalamari&amp;diff=118107123&amp;oldid=118049252" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FAcalamari&amp;diff=118107123&amp;oldid=118049252" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I am not bothered by the oppose itself; I am bothered by mentioning of Krune again. The user who left the oppose is <a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a> (<a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leflyman_14ce.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leflyman">contribs</a>). I am not stopping him from opposing me; I am simply wanting to end a dispuute from late January.</p>
<p>Leflyman has broght up the topic of User: Dr. Stephen J. Krune III. Leflyman doesn't want to leave this topic alone. This topic was discussed previously on AN/I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=104501888#Misuse_of_Blocking.2FBanning_by_Chris_Griswold.3B_and_other_actions" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=104501888#Misuse_of_Blocking.2FBanning_by_Chris_Griswold.3B_and_other_actions" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The discussion was unresolved, and I do fully agree with Leflyman that the incident must be resolved to avoid further damage and disruption in the future.</p>
<p>Krune was a user who I originally welcomed in January. He stated on his user page that he wanted to reach the highest rank of authority on Wikipedia. In my welcome, I politely told him that there was no authority on Wikipedia, and that all users were on the same rank. Krune didn't believe me, so I responded again, and contacted ChrisGriswold after Krune disbelieved me again.</p>
<p>ChrisGriswold told me to leave the user alone; and ChrisGriswold said that the user was trolling. I left the user alone as he asked. Krune, however, came to ChrisGriswold's talk page, and was angered that ChrisGriswold had referred to his edits as trolling. ChrisGriswold pointed out that few of Krune's edits were decent. This annoyed Krune more. However, all the messages mentioning Krune on ChrisGriswold's talk page are now gone because the entire histroy of the page is gone.</p>
<p>I cannot recall exactly what happened next, but we all got into a heavy discussion on Krune's talk page. I think ChrisGriswold blocked Krune, which was why we had a discussion there. After a lot of discussion, I was told to back down, but I didn't; an action I regret because it violated <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a>. Krune's talk page was protected, and ChrisGriswold deleted the content of both pages.</p>
<p>Krune also had an IP he used to edit with before he signed up <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.81.118.101.html" title="User talk:64.81.118.101">64.81.118.101</a>. ChrisGriswold <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:64.81.118.101" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:64.81.118.101" rel="nofollow">indefinitely blocked</a> the IP, and the IP requested to be unblocked. Yamla denied the request.</p>
<p>The final major issue of the enitre incident is when I removed most of the messages left by Krune's IP. Just like the <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a>, violation, I regret this too. <i>Most</i>, but not all; of the messages were trolling messages. I removed a few of the messages before I contacted ChrisGriswold if it was okay. He said it was fine, and I could carry on, so I did. That was when Leflyman decided to report ChrisGriswold here. At the time, Leflyman blamed ChrisGriswold for my actions, and I even said that everything was my fault; but now Leflyman is saying I am resposible for my actions; as I said, I told Leflyman that I was responsible. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Acalamari/Archive_2#Talk_page_vandalism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Acalamari/Archive_2#Talk_page_vandalism" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this issue was not resolved then; but I want this issue resolved now. As soon as I've posted this message I will be informing Leflyman, ChrisGriswold, and Yamla about this discussion. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 23:23, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My opinion is that the Krune account was a troll. I believe this was investigated on unblock-en-l as well. Just for the record, I declined the unblock request because of vandalism occurring from that IP address. I am not aware that I knew at the time this was used by the Krune account, though my memory is more than a little hazy now. Acalamari, could you please state concisely what you would like to be resolved here? My brain gets tired reading long sections after a day of work and it is not clear to me what exactly you are looking for here. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 23:34, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I apologize that was so long. In the previous AN/I report, no one came to a decision on what to do about ChrisGriswold and myself. No one even mentioned what to do anyway. Since Leflyman brought this topic up on my RfA, it was clear to me that this incident will continue to affect me and ChrisGriswold until something (if anything?) is done. To be honest, I don't what Leflyman hopes to achieve by continually bringing this up. Apart from the fact ChrisGriswold and I made major errors over the issue (I admit I made mistakes, and I don't see why I should keep admitting to those mistakes), I don't see what purpose mentioning the incident has. It's been nearly two months since it happened, and I've learned since then. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 23:44, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Acalamari#RE:_AN.2FI" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Acalamari#RE:_AN.2FI" rel="nofollow">this message</a>, Leflyman has pretty much said that there is nothing to resolve. As far as I am concerned, the issue is resolved with that edit. I do, however, want to make sure that something like this never happens again. I apologize for leaving a long message. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 00:00, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Acalamari, you are under a misapprehension: the AN/I notice I posted about ChrisGriswold's admin actions were only tangentially related to you. The concern was that Chris unilaterally enacted perma-bans without authority to do so, and further took steps to hide his own misuse of such actions by deleting criticisms. His prodding of you to continue removing comments from talk pages was a side issue. The IP address you claimed as being "Krune's" has never been been demonstrably shown to have committed vandalism; nor is it appropriate to retroactively remove all comments by a particular user under a blanket claim that they are trolling. Finally, I didn't bring this "incident" up, I pointed out your inappropriate editing of other users' comments on talk pages.--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 00:05, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree, I should never have removed <i>any</i> of those messages, and what I did was completely unacceptable. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 00:11, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh, and I still do not think that removing intentional disruption is wrong. As part of his trolling, Krune was leaving misleading or inflammatory comments on article talk pages. I tired of this issue long ago; I barely remember details of the situation, and I do not wish to dig into it again. I do recall other involved editors agreeing with my actions, at least in terms of blocking and deletion. Regardless, I am far past the point of desiring to continue this discussion.

<p>Hello. A friend (No longer, see why) of mine recently pointed out a page he had made on wikipedia, Xenoharbingers, over MSN. While I had known he vandalised wikipedia, I did not know his account, and I didn't much care. When he pointed this out, I noticed it already had an AFD tag on it, so I put a speedy delete comment on the AFD informing them of what had happened. Sometime afterwards, using sockpuppetry, and possibly proxies and meatpuppetry, he made edits to try to make a claim of validity, using 89.220.75.184 (<a href="../../../8/9/2E/User_talk%7E89.220.75.184.html" title="User talk:89.220.75.184">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_89.220.75.184_89cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/89.220.75.184">contribs</a>) Adonaii (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adonaii_cbab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adonaii">contribs</a>)Kendra Ardnek (<a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendra_Ardnek_f97e.html" title="User talk:Kendra Ardnek">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kendra_Ardnek_36e2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kendra Ardnek">contribs</a>)206.255.19.22 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.255.19.22_4824.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.255.19.22">contribs</a>)69.76.159.94 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.76.159.94_8e29.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.76.159.94">contribs</a>), and possibly other accounts as well. While this was annoying, I just added another comment on his sockpuppetry, and left it at that.</p>
<p>Though I was planning on just letting wikipedia run it's AFD course to prove to him it would get deleted, as he has expressed contempt for Wikipedia before and this is not the first page he has created about himself, a few minutes ago he logged on to MSN, and the following conversation ensused:</p>

<p>While i'm not terribly concerned over his threats, blatently harassing another wikipedia user and theatening to damage their personal property is still very serious, and he needs to learn that the world doesn't revolve around him, and that wikipedia will not put up with his nonsense...

If he pesters you elsewhere, block his MSN/email/etc. Also, one thing you could do if this gets more annoying is to contact his ISP provider with the above information; a threat to cut of his net access should quiet him down.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 17:19, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Trollish teen is a perfect definition...I actually met him while he was trolling a forum. Thanks for giving me the idea to contact his ISP- hopefully one of the above IPs isn't a proxy (and I think I know which), and they'll give him a bit of a slap on the wrist at least (it wouldn't be the first time he's been kicked from an ISP either) and scare him off. -- <small><a href="../../../f/e/b/User%7EFeba_a08a.html" title="User:Feba">feb</a><sup><a href="../../../f/e/b/User_talk%7EFeba_4982.html" title="User talk:Feba">talk</a></sup></small> 04:03, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Not sure where to report a questionable assertion of Fair Use, but I hardly think <a href="../../../c/a/m/Image%7ECampobelloRoosevelt.jpg_953f.html" title="Image:CampobelloRoosevelt.jpg">Image:CampobelloRoosevelt.jpg</a> qualifies.</p>
<p>The uploader's claim, "no free equivalent is available or could be created that would adequately give the same information", but this is hardly plausible since it's at a public park and PD images are available at the National Park Service website.</p>
<p>Shouldn't this be a Speedy Delete? <i><b><a href="../../../j/g/h/User%7EJGHowes_89ea.html" title="User:JGHowes"><font color="green">JGHowes</font></a> <font color="darkblue"><sup><a href="../../../j/g/h/User_talk%7EJGHowes_861f.html" title="User talk:JGHowes"><i>talk</i></a></sup></font></b> -</i> 22:58, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tag it with {{subst:rfu}}. Notify the uploader with the templated warning message that appears once you save the page. If they dispute it, they'll need to show why it would be impossible for someone to take an image of this campground; really, unless the building has burned down, I can't think of a viable reason which would suffice. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 23:01, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I have tagged the image for all three problems.

<p>When I went through and nuked all those Sandbox subpages, a user, <a href="../../../z/y/t/User%7EZyToggle-Case_326a.html" title="User:ZyToggle-Case">ZyToggle-Case</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/t/User_talk%7EZyToggle-Case_38f2.html" title="User talk:ZyToggle-Case">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ZyToggle-Case_d1ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/ZyToggle-Case">contribs</a>) asked me about two of them, here and here. At first, I offered to recreate the pages and userfy them, but looking at the deleted content I saw that the sandboxes were just huge galleries of company logos. Company logos of companies that do not have, and are unlikely to ever have, articles. Examining the images, every single one is a CSD I-5 / No Source immage. There are hundreds upon hundreds of them, and I have been working on deleting them all (most are conveniently categorized here.</p>
<p>So I blocked the user as a temporary measure, but upon further digging I easily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AZyMOS&amp;diff=115720536&amp;oldid=115687317" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AZyMOS&amp;diff=115720536&amp;oldid=115687317" rel="nofollow">discovered</a> that he is the same as one <a href="../../../z/y/m/User%7EZyMOS_4fc8.html" title="User:ZyMOS">ZyMOS</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/m/User_talk%7EZyMOS_223e.html" title="User talk:ZyMOS">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ZyMOS_d4f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/ZyMOS">contribs</a>). ZyToggle-Case started editing when ZyMOS stopped. ZyToggle-Case claimed to be unfamiliar with image policies, but ZyMOS has been editing for a year and a half. Looking at ZyMOS's contribs, one can see that every image he has tried to upload under that account has been deleted. Add to that that ZyMOS had an unapproved bot (<a href="../../../z/y/m/User%7EZyMOS-Bot_dc50.html" title="User:ZyMOS-Bot">ZyMOS-Bot</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/m/User_talk%7EZyMOS-Bot_4bdd.html" title="User talk:ZyMOS-Bot">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ZyMOS-Bot_c3b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ZyMOS-Bot">contribs</a>)) that was mass-uploading images, and it becomes evident that a larger block is in order. This user knew what he was doing, and violated our image policies to an extreme degree. There are still hundreds upon hundreds of images that need to be deleted.</p>
<p>ZyToggle-Case is really nothing more than a single purpose account meant to upload images. It should be blocked as such. Something should then be done with the ZyMOS account. --Jeffrey O.

<li>Users like these (solely contributing fair use images) are major problems to the project. I already spend half an hour deleting screenshots from a YuGiOh article, and I've helped out Jeffrey some with the deletions from ZyToggle's account.

<p>Raptornet is wasting the time of everyone else who has to revert his edits.

<dd>He is adding information which most readers can be assumed to know (that London is a city in a country called England <small>which by the way is in Europe, Earth, the Solar System, etc.</small>) and removing topographical information and distinctions which are much less likely to be known to people not intimately familiar with London or the various administrative or other divisions in the London area. And, as already pointed out, he has made edits concerning Madrid in the opposite direction. As an administrator has now pointed out on his talk page, this makes it difficult to assume good faith for the other edits.</dd>

<dd>I never used the word "vandalism" above, and I did not realise that this page was <i>only</i> for reporting vandals. The point is that Raptornet's edits in these cases are clearly counterproductive and time-wasting.

<dd>This is not really a content dispute. It is about a user being disruptive, presumably to make some kind of point about the English Wikipedia being biased towards the English and French (!) and against the Spanish.

<dd>I have concerns too. He's db-usered his entire userspace, opposed every RfA running, and was blocked in an attempt to make them calm down. I'm also concerned at the length of time the editor in question spent editing Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20070325040000&amp;limit=950&amp;target=Qxz" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20070325040000&amp;limit=950&amp;target=Qxz" rel="nofollow">after 24 straight hours of edits</a> (with breaks no longer than 2 hours) within the last 2 days, I'd suggest that the cause for the behaviour may be that the editor in question is short on sleep. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 10:36, 26 March 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)
