<p>I just wanted to make a note of this user and their usage of removing of deletion templates/opposing pretty much any deletion request. This user keeps removing speedy delete templates on grounds such as "possibly notable" or removes them and adds stub tags to articles or an external link while not expanding the article. The articles themselves still maintain no sense of notability but the user believes that by adding stub tags it makes them notable.</p>

<p>I was wondering what the administration view of this seemingly willingness to save any article? --- <a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a> 13:13, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anyone can challenge speedy deletion or <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>. If deletion is challenged, take it to AfD. Yes, uncritical inclusionists are a bore, but sometimes they are right and the cost to the encyclopaedia of thinking about a deletion rather than just doing it is relatively small. Once at AfD the articles will either be rapidly fixed up or nuked, either is acceptable. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:22, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>TruthbringerToronto typically expands or sources the articles that he removes speedies from, which is very useful. I hope he continues: he helps us not delete notable topics and his research can only improve the quality of an eventual AfD discussion about the articles. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 13:37, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I mentioned on his RfA, he'd do better to explain why he's done something when he pulls a tag off an article, rather than just saying "probably notable." That cost me 45 minutes of research and things to get the (since successful) AfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_MetaPhase_c39f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/MetaPhase">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/MetaPhase</a> organized. Scattershot tag removal can cause more problems than help, I suggest. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 17:54, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone contacted me and said I should check out this page since I was recently in a dispute with this user about the Images. As I did before, I checked every Image for copyright violations and linked the ones at the bottom per the section headers on the sub-page. If he reverts, kindly revert back, because he has a tendency to think I am vandalizing when I'm really just trying to remove the violations. Off topic, I also removed some deleted Images (red-links) for cosmetic purposes to the page.

<dd>Well I do. In particular I would want to know where such consensus for such a strongly-worded <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> was formed. If I remember correctly, and this was from a couple of years go, somebody unilaterally decided that this was to be the case, citing Chicago, and then there were others who pointed out that Chicago wasn't gospel, and either usage was okay, and it ended that there was no consensus either way. It is quite possible that something like this has slipped in under the RADAR.

It is probably a good idea to let a second admin deny an unblock request, so I've done that here.

<p>This message appears occasionally on computers in the UAE when attempting an edit:</p>
<p>"Your user name or IP address has been blocked from editing. You were blocked by Mike Rosoft for the following reason (see our blocking policy): Blatant vandalism, shared IP Your IP address is 213.42.2.21."</p>
<p><br />
UAE internet connections go through a proxy server administered by the ISP Etisalat and IP addresses frequently change (usually one refresh click is enough to get to edit page after seeing above message) so it is rather pointless blocking an IP, and mildly annoying when legitimate edits are attempted.</p>
<p>Suggestion is to refrain from blocking IPs on proxy and to unblock the one listed above please.</p>

Maybe instead of repeatedly blocking this IP totally as time and time again the IP keeps getting blocked due to vandalism and other issues, why not indef block without enabling the autoblock for logged in accounts, or make people use the AOL style solution if that's easier and/or works better. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECat-five_1ecb.html" title="User:Cat-five">Cat-five</a> - <a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECat-five_6602.html" title="User talk:Cat-five">talk</a> 07:51, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to start a request for the undelete of podcast entry israelisms. I believe this has been an unfair censorship of this Article, I also believe that another 5 to 7 days will bring more comments from outside the small amount that were made at 1st sign of deletion/defacement of the Article.

<dd>I did not come here to make an arguement. Those are your words not mine. I came and made a request. Yes as far as votes ,the very 1st person to nominate the page for deletion and only person said the same thing in one reply and the exact opposite in another reply. This also happened with another contributor of the discussion page - so which is it? I don't see the need for any condescending remarks; this only hurts the Wiki. I don't think notability is the issue here considering a lot of the Fodder that makes up the Wiki. After all this isn't relied upon by academia. I don't know of too many institutions that would let the Wiki be an accepted reference.--John M. 23:27, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Certainly they won't if we don't apply verifiability and notability criteria. I don't take the above remarks to be condescending, but rather good advice - to fulfil your request, you need to gain a consensus that the AfD was improperly closed.

<li>I don't userfy much, but I'll point out this defense, which Calton didn't respond to (on that special page, at least): "<i>In these cases, userfication has prevented the authors trying to recreate the article in the (Main) namespace</i>." This may be preferable to the deletedpage template. Part of what I don't like about those things is that they actually come up when you hit the "Random article" button. In contrast, userpages don't.

<p>Isn't it about time that this be restored? supposedly this was restricted in the first place to help cut down on page creation vandalism, which after about 2 or 3 days simply meant page creation vandals had to login to vandalize.. The only thing the current ban on anon page creation really helps to do, is make it almost impossible for anons to use things like AfD and other things that depend on page creation. If anything, this coupled with newer features like sprotection, anon only blocks, AntiVandalBots with "angry modes", and RC filters that target just anon edits, really hurts the anon friendliness that wikipedia had way back when. Couple that with the fact that Registered Users more and more getting the idea that anons don't matter anymore. Not to mention the recent trend of "RC Patrol" only accounts, who view anons as an obstacle to their RC patrolling. Not to mention, as anyone who has ever tried to run anti vandalism tools as an anon knows, many people would rather restore vandalism than fact that an anon with a high edit count isn't a vandal. Is there anyway that the page creation ban could be reexamined, maybe even lifted for a trial period?--<a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.130.227.58.html" title="User:172.130.227.58">172.130.227.58</a> 16:02, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could an uninvolved admin please take a look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiWoo_a9f6.html" title="User:WikiWoo">User:WikiWoo</a>'s unblock reuqest. This user has a history of blocks for <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>-pushing, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivility</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. In my opnion he is on the edge of exhausting the community's patience, but he insists he is the innocent party - he claims he is the vicitm of "Eager administrator blocking with a manifested bias and a partiality to one side in an editing dispute. Initially attempted to entrap editor into making a personal attack and then interpreting subsequent responses as personal attacks". He believes there is a conspiracy of corrupt government officials in the Ontario Regional Government who are bilking billions of dollars from the public and who are consipiring on Wikipedia to suppress these allegations. He continues to insert these allegations into articles and won't source them (the consipiracy has apparently suppressed all information). He is currently on a seven day block for continued personal attacks against editors who have reverted his POV pushes, but he is objecting at length to this.</p>
<p>He clearly has no intention of stopping his campaign when he returns (as he says on his talk page "Though I know policy, I choose to ignore them.") and despite many specific warnings he continues to make what I consider to be egregious personal attacks on editors in good standing (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Brampton%2C_Ontario&amp;diff=71714699&amp;oldid=71643300" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Brampton%2C_Ontario&amp;diff=71714699&amp;oldid=71643300" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWikiWoo&amp;diff=71851333&amp;oldid=71842394" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWikiWoo&amp;diff=71851333&amp;oldid=71842394" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, the unblock request itself etc.).

<dd>I'm not seeing Wikipedia as a soapbox. I'm not even trying to influence most of the content of the proporn/pros articles. However, if you look right before my post in the first link, for example, you can see how a person attempted to post one <i>single</i> link of a reference critical of prostitution and it was removed. The censoring user deleted the one <i>single</i> link and labeled it "spamming". Unbelievable and this sort of thing is the standard of what is happening on all the prostitution and pornography pages. Opposing positions are most often not allowed on them. Essentially the Wikipedia section for prostitution and pornography is a portal. The bias there needs to be corrected. I have compiled a variety of articles, links, audio speech files and resources and am posting them to remove the POV from these pages and provide a balance. If you look at the previous versions of the articles many of them had absolutely no other viewpoint expressed. I don't think it should be necessary, but if I must I will cut some of them out and remove them from the pages at your request, but some need to remain. --<a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikkicraft_a7ce.html" title="User:Nikkicraft">Nikkicraft</a> 11:47, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You say "<i>I'm not even trying to influence most of the content of the proporn/pros articles</i>" as if that were a good thing. Wikipedia is trying to be a great free encyclopedia, not a link farm. We encourage people to add sourced encyclopedic content to the articles and discourage simply adding links. You are in some ways a POV warrier, which is normally bad, but your point of view is, I believe, a minority position as you are for censorship and Wikipedia is all about the opposite. If you refrain from deleting content and concentrate on adding content sourced from unbiased trustworthy sources (specifically not from you or your friends sites, but from others citing you guys is fine) then you can make wikipedia better. And about the links ... how about deleting in each case I listed above all but the three that are most relevent to the article? For example, you added "<i><a href="http://www.andreadworkin.com/audio/TraffickingConference1989_P1_M.mp3" class="external text" title="http://www.andreadworkin.com/audio/TraffickingConference1989_P1_M.mp3" rel="nofollow">Andrea Dworkin: Why Men Like Prostitution So Much</a> Andrea Dworkin Keynote Speech at International Trafficking Conference, 1989. (Audio File: 22 min, 128 Kbps, mp3)</i>" to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution_in_Thailand_2432.html" title="Prostitution in Thailand">Prostitution in Thailand</a>. Is that <i>really</i> specific to the topic of the article . Tell the truth, its spamming an opinion, isn't it? Needs to go. You also added "<i><a href="http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/MichLawJourI.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/MichLawJourI.html" rel="nofollow">Prostitution and Male Supremacy</a> by Andrea Dworkin</i>" to that same article. Isn't NoStatusQuo <i>your</i> site? Which you also use to "source" the article on you? There are serious issues here that need to be dealt with in a way that lets you help us make wikipedia better. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 12:57, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some of that content may be useful in some of those articles, but not all. For just one example, it seems hard to believe that the article <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comfort_women.html" title="Comfort women">Comfort women</a>, about women being forced to serve in military brothels, can be described as supportive of prostitution, and needing an opposed to prostitution view for balance. I don't think the link to the speech "Why men like prostitution so much" is appropriate there; that topic is not at issue in the article. It looks like the same links were pasted in to the articles blindly, regardless of the article; <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spam_%28electronic%29.html#Newsgroup_spam_and_Forum_spam" title="Spam (electronic)">spam</a> seems like a good description of that process.

<dd>I'm not sure where you get the idea that I'm in favor of censorship. I'm not. But what I believe or don't is not on trial here, I don't think. To reply to your concerns, yes, I posted the audio speech <a href="http://www.andreadworkin.com/audio/TraffickingConference1989_P1_M.mp3" class="external text" title="http://www.andreadworkin.com/audio/TraffickingConference1989_P1_M.mp3" rel="nofollow">Andrea Dworkin: Why Men Like Prostitution So Much</a> Andrea Dworkin Keynote Speech at International Trafficking Conference, 1989. (Audio File: 22 min, 128 Kbps, mp3) to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution_in_Thailand_2432.html" title="Prostitution in Thailand">Prostitution in Thailand</a>. I did so because it's relevant to <i>any</i> page about prostitution because it's from an international conference and it answers the questions of <b>why</b> men buy women and what many of them do after the purchase. No, I <i>absolutely</i> and <i>honestly</i> would <b>not</b> consider it spam. In fact, I would ask any administrators who might have the time to please listen to it then say to me specifically why it has no place in the pornography and prostitution section. Dworkin, no matter how much one may disdain her is an expert in this topic and it's really biased to have any encyclopedia without speeches and articles by her.</dd>

<dd>Yes, the No Status Quo is my domain. The article comes from the Official Website of Andrea Dworkin which has her articles which I, and others html coded, and we had no control whatsoever over the content. It's a library. The fact that I'm the librarian and archivist there should not prohibit me from sharing that valuable resource with Wikipedia. If that is the case I don't understand.</dd>

After I'm done with this then I will certainly want to work on articles more.</dd>

<dd>Please notice that I could be posting anonymously and I'm not. I'm taking responsibility for what I'm doing which is way more than many around here are doing. I am sincerely trying to improve resources for Wikipedia and make the pornography portal less biased and with less of a POV which apparently the editors already here are not able to accomplish with the information they have available on the topic. What I posted was a variety of well chosen articles and audio speeches. If the administrators don't agree that it's a valid contribution, upon your request, I will cull down the resources and remove what I posted and repost a smaller selection. But if I were doing so I would continue to believe that Internatinoal Trafficking Conference audio speech should go first among them, then followed up by Dworkin's testimony before the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography. How could any encyclopedia wish to turn down such contributions I would never understand. --<a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikkicraft_a7ce.html" title="User:Nikkicraft">Nikkicraft</a> 14:07, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another interesting aspect of this is that <i>I'm</i> being accused of conflict of interest for posting library and article entries that sell <i>nothing</i> and Wikipedia is facilitating international trafficking which profits the most unscrupulous slave traffickers of human beings all over the world, and it's all done under the protection of pseudonyms and protecting actual identities; and nobody seems to be bothered by a thing. Folks, the whole pornography and prostitution section with all it's sprawl is what is spamming and that same picture of that German hooker that's on all the different countries doesn't seem to bother anyone as being not related to the country she's posted on. That's the spam. She just lays there all splayed out for the consumer and no comment about what bias that represents. Anyone thinking that supplying hookers for men isn't exactly the purpose that an internet encyclopedia ought to be performing? Or is it? You want to vilify me? Go ahead I won't be able to stop you. You want to take out the bias and POV out of your prostitution portal and I'm willing to help you and please don't think I wouldn't rather be doing something else.</dd>

<p>Coming in late view: All I can say is that we have segmented articles for a reason, to help users find specific things. I looked at the diffs that WAS provided and I don't see the relevance of them to the specific articles they were added to. I can't see readers seeking to learn about prostitution in a specific country finding a speech by Andrea Dworkin of any relevance at all. Our purpose here is to hew to the NPOV, not to advocate, and those links don't support that when placed in the articles they were placed in, in my view. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:44, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, take the Thailand article. Yes, the material about Thailand is meant to be specific to Thailand. My take on it is this. If Dworkin made a specific and notable claim about Thailand that belongs in the article, and if it was in a published and publicly-accessible speech, then the article should say something like this: "Radical feminist Andrea Dworkin once argued that Thailand has too many exploited prostitutes as an outcome of colonialism [or whatever she actually did argue]." There should then be a specific reference to her speech, citing the page number of the published version where she makes this point about Thailand. OTOH, if she had nothing in particular to say about Thailand, but merely included some data relating to that country among others in a general discussion of prostitution, then she did not make a notable contribution to any debate about prostititution in Thailand in particular. In that case, it would not belong in the article. This is the sort of standard of specificity and sourcing that is supposed to apply to all articles. We don't allow editors to put together bits and pieces in a creative way to support a position or interpretation of their own. We definitely do not take editorial positions on which there could be controversy. However, we <i>are</i> supposed to report the significant positions that have been taken by others to date, with precise attribution and referencing. I hope this helps you work out what material you can use and in what articles. It might also help you hold others to similar standards if you suspect a double standard is being applied. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 05:49, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am currently an active and stable user here on Wikipedia, but that was not always the case. Before June, I was a pretty immature person, and did not take Wikipedia seriously at the time. Someone from some school vandalized my page, and I was angry (I really don't know why). I thought that the person was going to return to my page (to my knowledge, they never did), but I wrote a threat to them. It was an immature and a dumb thing to do, and I am truly sorry I did it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AClyde_Miller&amp;diff=52742477&amp;oldid=52296389" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AClyde_Miller&amp;diff=52742477&amp;oldid=52296389" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the difference and my threat to them. I never changed my username after I did that, and now that I am a productive user I really don't want to change my name now (I probably should have been blocked for doing this, but no one noticed). However, I believe such an threat could insult someone reading the page history, simply by it's very nature. Therefore, I am requesting that the edit be deleted from my history (I'll keep the vandalism. It's a reminder for me to never do something like this again). I am really really sorry for who I was, but it is not who I am now, and I am trying to make amends. --<a href="../../../c/l/y/User%7EClyde_Miller_83b6.html" title="User:Clyde Miller">Clyde Miller</a> 22:37, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Couldn't it be just as, if not more, effective to post this apology alongside the threat, rather than attempting to have it deleted from the record in what could be considered a form of cover-up by some of our more paranoid users?

<dd>Well hasn't this more or less backfired? This is not a big scandal and is not news. Furthermore, it will not die (as it would in real life), unless the section is deleted. Finally putting an apology like this in public does nothing more than make people want to look at the threat (makes them curious), which is putting a bad light on Wikipedia, something I didn't want to do. If I had kept it quiet, no one would have noticed. Not that I don't apprciate what you've done to make this a complete aplology, but I think I'd be best to keep some sort of apology on my page but delete the entry itself. It would almost seem easier just to leave this account, but that would be running away, something I don't want to do. I think the best sourse of action would be to leave an apology for my bad behavior on my user page or talk page, but get rid of the entry. Can someone throw in their two cents on what they think? I really don't know what is proper, correct, and what would give me some sort of honor (by exposing this I have essentially destroyed my honor and word, something I have worked hard to upkeep).--<a href="../../../c/l/y/User%7EClyde_Miller_83b6.html" title="User:Clyde Miller">Clyde Miller</a> 00:29, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

His POV is neatly summed up by the Government of Ontario "...are the most corrupt governments on the plannet and the people running them both elected and appointed should all be executed for treason for their gross betrayals of public trust and that such people are not worthy of any respect or admiration from anyone". He claims to have been fighting against said government for thrity five years.</p>
<p>He has been pushing this POV into a series of articles under at least three different usernames: <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiRoo_dac4.html" title="User:WikiRoo">User:WikiRoo</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDoo_83ae.html" title="User:WikiDoo">User:WikiDoo</a>, under the IP User:216.154.134.91 and now <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiWoo_a9f6.html" title="User:WikiWoo">User:WikiWoo</a>. He refuses to provide <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for any but the most minor of his edits and regards any and all Wikipedia policies as non-applicable to his editing: see his statement on his talk page "Though I know policy, I choose to ignore them.". He not only inserts POV into existing articles, but also creates articles to push his POV; see: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Public_Procurement_2921.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Public Procurement">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Public_Procurement</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Prequalified_00ae.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Prequalified">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Prequalified</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Public_Tendering_383f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Public Tendering">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Public_Tendering</a> for examples of not only his creations but also his <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivil</a> justifications that ignore all policy.</p>
<p>Despite frequent warnings and blocks for disruption he refuses to modify his POV warring in any way - see the lengthy discussion on his talk page. He believes he is on essentially a "holy mission" to get this information into Wikipedia at any cost. He shows no understanding of basic rules of verifiability or maintaining a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to his use of Wikipedia to push his (I'm guessing) libellous point of view about the Ontario government, he is convinced that a group of editors (including myself) are paid agents of the Ontario government conspiring to keep his views out of the encyclopedia, for example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Brampton%2C_Ontario&amp;diff=71714699&amp;oldid=71643300" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Brampton%2C_Ontario&amp;diff=71714699&amp;oldid=71643300" rel="nofollow">here</a>. He continues to make frequent unjustified <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> on any editor who attempts to remove his POV-waring and has been blocked for this as well as <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> violations. Every time he comes back he continues exactly where he left off.</p>
<p>After lengthy attempts to explain policy to him, it is clear he has no intention of stopping his diruptive editing. I and several other admins and editors are wasting too much time trying to work with him. I believe that this user has exhausted the community's patience and a community ban should be enacted.</p>

<li>I see increasing evidence that WikiWoo is not going to change. We have been nice, we have been firm, we have been patient, and his response in every case is to carry on precisely as before, ignoring any policies, guidelines and comments which fail to support him, looking in every case for the half-sentence which might support him if only he was able to cite a reliable secondary source. He is on a crusade to Right Great Wrongs, and in doing so he is introducing uncited material critical of living individuals he considers evil and criminal. His response to deletion of biased articles is to create new biased articles or introduce bias into other articles. Lost patience is a pretty accurate description here; one feels that any comment not supportive of his actions (and I have to say I can't remember the last one which <i>was</i> supportive) is simply added to his mental "vast conspiracy" and rejected out of hand. We really ought to have something in <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a> about editors who accuse everybody who gainsays them of conspiracy. Anyway, it's my view that there is little if any hope of any useful contribution form this editor, who has reacted to mild rebukes and brief blocks by becoming more obdurate, not less, and has now got to the point of personal attacks. Frankly we should probably have given up on him when he accused us of being the Gestapo and wouldn't accept that this was offensive. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 20:12, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Many of us have tried to offer constructive advice - but WikiWoo follows very little of it. I see a total ban as pretty drastic, but his comments indicate that he doesn't intend to follow the advice. I'd be inclined to give Wiki one last chance to show that he understands that accusing other editors of conspiracy and of being "Gestapo" is just not acceptable. Perhaps an unblock but with a warning that continuation of previous behavior will lead to a complete ban? I do think he has something to offer than can be done in a NPOV fashion - but I can certainly understand other editors running out of patience. <a href="../../../b/t/b/User%7EBtball_6537.html" title="User:Btball">Brian</a> 20:38, 27 August 2006 (UTC)btball</li>

<p>I was wondering if I could get some opinions from other admins, and people who are knowledgeable about the topic, about <a href="../../../p/r/i/Talk%7EPrincess_Anne_of_Bourbon-Parma_63c2.html" title="Talk:Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma">this move request</a>, as I have gotten a complaint on my talk page. The survey result was 2 to 1 in favor of a move, and there is a conflict in the naming conventions, whether the most common name should trump a specific convention about naming royal consorts, see <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29_dca3.html#Other_royals" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)">number 9</a>. From the naming conventions page, "...use the <i>most common</i> form of the name used in English <i>if none of the rules below cover a specific problem.</i>". The latter convention was made so that the names would not be ambiguous. I do not know enough about the topic to know whether ambiguity is a problem in this case. If an uninvolved admin wants to move the page or reopen the debate, he or she should go for it. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 02:30, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Number 9 does not apply to Queen Anne as she is currently living.

<dd>I think in this case <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> it is regardless, since a majority is a majority. That means of course that not all majorities are always right, however a legitimate vote was held, anyone could vote on it, and if only three users chose to do it, well then... I don't see the proposal and the result as a conflict with existing conventions either, because in this case <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29_dca3.html#Other_royals" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)">number 10</a> clearly applies.

He continues to insist upon adding "expert needed","Worldview bias","Content disputed" tags to the article without explaining the specifics as to why he wants to add them. He shouldn't be able to add tags or remove tags to an article unless he explains exactly why they should be added or removed. However he has continued to do this. Not only that but he resorts to personal insults such as "arrogant fool" or "stinking liar" in his posts refering to me.

<li>Whittaker World cup 2006 - nominated with the reason <i>"no context, no verifiability.

<dd>Back when I used to help out a little with the CSDs, when I saw incorrect CSDs, I, like most admins, nominate them for AfDs instead. I think it would be much "speedier" to simply remove the tag without AfDing, and leave the onus of AfDing back to the person who wants to see the article deleted in the first place. Or heck, maybe create a new template or category, something like our {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_reviewed_1167.html" title="Template:Unblock reviewed">unblock reviewed</a>}} template so we know which speedies have already been reviewed and rejected by other admins. And heck, no longer being accused by defenders of the article of being a rabid deletionist (for moving the article off CSD and into AfD instead) would be nice too. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 15:40, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's a matter of how efficiently things get done. When I deny a speedy, I very often will put a prod tag on it, but I rarely start an AfD unless I'm personally interested: if I don't think PROD would be appropriate, I'll let someone else do it. My take on this is that admins (or anyone else) reviewing speedy deletions should take the time to inform users who have used it wrong: occasionally this would be a waste of time, say, if someone was just trying speedy once and wouldn't go back to it. But for users who make lots of speedy nominations, they need to understand when they're using it wrong. Also, I really think we should get rid of {{<a href="../../../n/n/-/Template%7ENn-club_ea8d.html" title="Template:Nn-club">nn-club</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../n/n/-/Template%7ENn-bio_82c9.html" title="Template:Nn-bio">nn-bio</a>}}, and {{<a href="../../../n/n/-/Template%7ENn-band_13aa.html" title="Template:Nn-band">nn-band</a>}}, because they perpetuate a misuse of speedy deletion, namely, "nn" or "non-notable" does not mean the same thing as the A7 criterion which talks about not describing the importance or significance of the topic. We have db-club, db-bio, and db-band (which those redirect to), which work fine. (I tried nominating nn-bio for deletion a while back but people didn't understand what I was trying to do.) The same comment goes for PROD: I was looking at the PROD backlog today and found at least a few instances in which someone had reverted the removal of a prod tag because no justification was given for deprodding. They'd probably done it in many cases across many different articles, but no one had told them they were doing something wrong. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 16:06, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps you should have actually READ the article in question before complaining about incorrect tagging, as it was about a group of 13-year-olds <i>which the article itself</i> said was (paraphrasing) "not an official company".

<dd>I actually READ the article - and it wasn't CSD-A7. I also deleted the article - out of process - for CSD-A7 as that was what it was nominated for. In fact, it was CSD-G4 from an old VfD, or it might just have scraped CSD-G1. But CSD-A7 it wasn't. And this is typical: admins are damned if we do and damned if we don't - the complaints about deleting stuff and the complaints about not deleting stuff - both from misinformed users - just pour in. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 19:26, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>I actually READ the article</i> I'm not seeing any sign of that -- particularly since you referred to it as a "corporation" above, clearly false. Also, explain to me how deleting under one valid set of criteria instead of another makes it "out of process": if it were so, I have to wonder why exactly you would delete it out of process and then use it as an example when complaining about other people deleting things out of process. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The notion of "Either we abuse the CSD but make admins immune from scrutiny in their decisions on deletions or we change the CSD and leave admins accountable." is a false dichotomy. I "abuse" CSD all the time- the specific criteria do <i>not</i> account for all kinds of delete-on-site junk, and I suspect they never can. I'd rather see admins using actuall human judgment than blindly following exact rules- how does following an exact rule without interpretation amount to being more accountable? The deletion logs holds us all accountable, whether we want to be or not. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:36, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've missed the point here, Friday. Actually, you've missed two of them. The first one is: when a user asks an admin to delete out of process, <b>who takes the flak</b>? Answer: the admin, who has to defend an out-of-process deletion without the help of the original nominator and, on one memorable occasion for me, with the original nominator being amongst those castigating me for deleting the article out of process!</dd>
<dd>The other point is that, whilst admins act out of process, <b>nobody needs to look to see if the process is broken</b>. Nobody is campaigning, for instance, for spam to be added to the CSD, because everyone assumes that it is one of the CSD already. If admins stop deleting spam out of process, the community will rise up and demand it as a criterion. Then, when it gets deleted <i>in process</i>, the complaints from the spammer can be dealt with easily. But whilst spam gets deleted out of process, nobody calls for "CSD-A10: Pure advertisment" to be created and admins are left figuratively naked.</dd>
<dd>The problem here is that the number one cry of Wikipedia's critics is that admins are a law unto ourselves. We make the rules, act out of process, push people around, yada yada yada. We all know that that isn't true... yet here we are, having a discussion where people are saying "we expect admins to act out of process". Where is the line drawn? If admins are allowed - nay, expected - to act out of process on this subject, day in, day out, what's to stop an admin/some admins deciding "rights, it's time to delete all Pokemon articles/block all AOL users/play god in some way". After all, we've got the precident right here: we're expecting admins to regularly act out of process and we're even <b>requiring</b> them to do it for a quiet life. This is very odd. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 19:26, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that you're listening to different critics than I am.

I'd like to make an actual on-topic suggestion while I'm here, though, which is that it would be good to encourage people doing new page patrol to make heavier use of creative redirects than CSD templates. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 19:31, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>You can always place a {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} but would it be helpful to have an "assert incorrect speedy" template that took the same parms as "{{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}}" did? people could then just move the article there by adding a couple of letters to the template invocation and then examine at leisure to see if it qualifies. yes it adds a process, ick. But I agree, right now I tend to come into CSD and I often look at 5 articles and quit, after having found none deletable. That's probably wasting effort. PROD is not a bad suggestion though as an alternative. Is there a variant of PROD that takes exactly the same parms as db? ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 17:35, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Perfect. More userfication would be good, too.</i> Yeah, just what Wikipedia needs, more permanent (for all intents and purposes) vanity/MySpace/webhost pages disguised as User Pages. No, adding more garbage to Wikipedia is not good. More stuff like this (one edit, in October 2005), this (ditto), this (ditto), and <a href="../../../j/a/z/User%7EJazzyB_6ace.html" title="User:JazzyB">this</a> (two edits, counting the big image) -- these are not User Pages and these people are not Wikipedia editors. See <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_Userfied_pages_bc24.html" title="User:Calton/Userfied pages">User:Calton/Userfied pages</a> for many more examples.</p>
<p>Or take [[Ed Comix Inc., the alleged corporation article: it was originally a recreation of an AFD'ed article, userfied by an admin in <b>July 2005</b> and remaining untouched until I reverted the move and slapped on the (entirely appropriate) speedy tag.</p>
<p>More userfication isn't a solution, it's mostly a way of shifting responsibility for making a decision or (gasp) employing judgment. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem isn't really the few incorrectly tagged articles. It's a combination of that plus the editors who don't look at the history first to see if a valid article was vandalised. Then the talk pages of valid articles with nothing more than an anons comment, such as "This is crap". They don't need deleting just blanking. Then you have to go and check to see if the article was recreated but without the speedy tag. Follow that up with having to answer questions as to why you just deleted Peter smallpecker and why you wont restore it. But the real problem is the images.

<p>Hello, it appears someone's effort to reverse the name/redirect relationship between Tribe and Going Tribal ended up splitting the article history.

(This is not just a browser cache clear, and I'm intentionally leaving those articles not purged so people can see the issue.)</p>
<p>There is also an issue with the template transclusion database. Some articles will list hundreds of trancluded templates that are not used in the article.

<p>I'm trying to completely move "The Double Dutch Bus" to "Double Dutch Bus (song)". THis is the only thing left to do and I'd appreciate your help. Thank You.

<li><b>Endorse</b>. Sheynhertz is an extremely problematic editor. His continual messing up of the encyclopaedia, including unfinished articles (many containing German) dumped into articlespace and rapid-fire page moves creating double redirects is unacceptable, and attempts to clean it up are met with instant reversions and bizarre reactions ranging from baseless accusations of vandalism to suicide threats. (All documented in the RfC, so I'm not going to go diff-digging.) I have less confidence than Kusma that unblocking will do any good, though. I have no idea how Sheynhertz' mind works and little inclination to try to find out. I applaud Kusma for taking on this extremely tiresome editor and suggest leaving any decision about whether Sheynhertz should be unblocked up to him. Note that Sheynhertz, whose native language is Japanese, is already banned from the Japanese Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 08:13, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am absolutely appalled at what has happenend. I used to have friendly contact with Sheynhertz-Unbayg on a number of topics, especially articles on <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>. However I lost touch and he seemed to have disappeared. I noticed later that there were some strange fall-outs from the Japanese Wikipedia that spilt over, which really made me wonder since it was surprising. I wish I knew how to help to defuse the situation, however reading the comments of users that have had other dealings makes me wonder if it is actually the same user? Reading through the comments I trust Kusma's judgement, but to me this is just nevertheless really bizarre, highly unfortunate and saddening. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 21:02, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many complaints on OTRS are allegations on libel on our part, especially in:</p>
<ul>
<li>biographies of living people (typically, semi-famous persons such as writers of self-help books, "alternative scientists", radio hosts on local stations, etc.)</li>
<li>articles on highschools (typically, some student or former student has written something insulting for staff).</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, the people whose reputation is sullied have tried to remove the inflammatory content have been reverted, or even blocked for doing so.</p>
<p>Please read <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> if you haven't yet done so. Wikipedia's official policy regarding biographical details of living persons is to err on the side of caution. Potentially libellious information without serious sources should be deleted, not flagged as "unsourced". Users, even anonymous ones, who delete such unsourced information should <i>not</i> be blocked - 3RR does not apply. Users who repeatedly reinsert such information despite warnings should definitely be blocked.</p>
<p>On a similar line, we also have a privacy policy regarding living persons, especially people who are not public figures. The same applies: if personal information such as names of relatives (who are not themselves public figures) etc. is removed, please do not reinsert it nor block whoever removed it.</p>

<dd>I'm going to reject several parts of this:
<ol>
<li>If a random editor comes along and removes perfectly good information from an article, without explaining that it is a result from an OTRS complaint, then another editor is entitled to reach the conclusion, in good faith, that it does not need to be removed.</li>
<li>Thus your direction that we may not reverse it is wrong. Your edits are subject to reversal, no matter your superglue-like adhesion to one of the most damaging policies we have, unless they are potentially libellous and poorly sources (Note the conjunction. We can include negative information if it's well sourced. Until their lawyer telephones Danny, anyway.)</li>
<li>The policy does not provide for indefinite removal and 3RR circumvention of things like names of relatives. It is not "on a similar line" at all. You don't get yourself an exception from being blocked for removal of such information. It is a matter of interpretation of the policy and the material.</li>
<li>Wikipedia's official policy regarding biographical details of living persons is to err on the side of running screaming with our hands in the air.</li>
<li>Since when was a school a living person? If someone is vandalising the article, revert them and block them.</li>

<dd>Woah, Splash. Firstly, you don't get to reject this since it comes from <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">on high</a>. Secondly, it is common sense. When someone is insistingly blanking or removing sections from a bio, don't just scream 'vandal - kneejerk revent and block'. Instead, ask 'could there be a reason for thisact?'. It is always possible that the aricle is crap or libelous, and the anon IP is an angry injured party who doesn't understand how wikipedia works. Take a look at the material that he's removing - consider it - does it look fair? Are negative comments ballanced and referenced? Should the article in fact be deleted or rebuilt from scratch.

<dd>I doubt anyone thinks that removing paragraphs in biographies should always be reverted, and I doubt anyone thinks that they should never be reverted. I think we have one of those imaginary arguments between positions that no-one wishes to defend brewing here. Just use common sense. Before reverting a paragraph removal, scan it to see if it says "Joe Bloggs was recently sentenced to a billion years for being a third-degree cretin" - likewise, check the previous edits, and see if before blanking the 'Controversy' section, the same IP blanked the paragraph immediately before it (indicating straightforward blanking testing/vandalism). --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:24, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Doc, if you're referencing the "divine passage" I believe you are, <i>"If you read something negative about someone, and there is no source, then either find a _legitimate_ source (and make sure that WE do not make the negative claim, but rather than we merely report neutrally on what the claim is), or just remove it... and insist that anyone who wants to put it back, do so with a legitimate source!"</i>, that would support deleting the information. However, you'll notice the emphasis is to make sure that it's sourced, not to simply remove it because it's negative. This is about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, not "being nice", so what we need is proper case-by-case judgment, not a blanket guide about being unable to revert people who are removing negative information. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 23:47, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In an ideal world where <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> was the only relevant issue, an unsourced paragraph that said that the subject won an award recently would merit just as much scrutiny as one saying he was arrested for drink-driving. However, obviously this isn't an ideal world, people like to sue, RC patrollers have limited inclination to fact-check articles on people whom they don't care about, and if people are going to fact-check anything we should make sure they check negative information first. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:27, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The major problem here is your first point. People are reverting "vandalism" without ever stopping to read it, without ever noticing that what was being blanked was the unsourced section saying the subject was a child molestor or an embezzeler (yes, I have seen both such cases in the past). People assume anything in the article was "perfectly good" and revert without thinking, and so we end up with the problem that we're essentially protecting the defamation. This is bad from an encyclopedic standpoint, from an ethical standpoint, and from a not-getting-our-asses-sued standpoint. I'm not sure what order you rank those three in, but it's not good for any of them. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 00:56, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, after all, one should take one's responsibilities. When you revert libellious claim, you are, effectively, inserting it yourself. When you block somebody who was removing unsourced, libellious claim, you are, effectively, exercing editorial control to maintain this claim. (*) You then put yourself as a prime target for the possible lawsuit, especially if the Foundation tries to dodge responsibility by claiming it's the responsibility of whoever inputted the entry. You may also find that some people would like to sue us in various locales (I'm thinking of England here, among other places), and may also prefer to have some local identifiable defendant rather than a foundation in Florida. And I'm ready to bet that the Foundation will be eager to hand over your connection data to judicial authorities if it avoids it some legal trouble; actually, as far as I know, it has already done so.</p>

<dd>Of course you take responsibility for your own edits. That's why you should verify it from an outside source. (If you can cite the negative claim to someone else, then you can pass the legal buck on to them.) Would legal responsibility actually apply to reverts of unexplained section blanking though?</dd>
<dd>What confuses me about your initial statement, though, is that there are people complaining about negative information about the staff of highschools. Wouldn't most of those be your traditional teenage "Mr. Smith sux!" vandal, and easily dealt with? Or has it gotten beyond that, to vandals writing believable libelous claims? --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 00:54, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If it is more than that, though, then other means of communication, like e-mail, should instead be used. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 04:49, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Earlier this evening, <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique">Bastique</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> discovered across a particularly nasty form of copyright abuse on Commons; someone had uploaded two photographs using a username the same as that of the original author, given the legitimate (non-free) source, marked them as free-licenses... and added an OTRS-confirmation template on the end with a nonexistent ticket number. The net result, we have something saying "oh, yes, the source is unfree but the Foundation confirms it's released as GFDL". The first we knew of this was when the author wrote to us complaining about it!</p>
<p>This seemed pretty clear evidence of bad-faith intent to us, and the user was accordingly blocked (as well as another, with identical modus, from back in March). A little detective work by Bastique found someone on en: using the images immediately after they'd been uploaded; checkuser by Kelly Martin and Arnomane confirmed that the user on en: and the user on Commons were the same, so the local user (<a href="../../../j/c/m/User%7EJcmurphy_8372.html" title="User:Jcmurphy">Jcmurphy</a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../j/c/m/User_talk%7EJcmurphy_b950.html" title="User talk:Jcmurphy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jcmurphy_ea45.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jcmurphy"><span title="Contributions: Jcmurphy">contribs</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Jcmurphy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Jcmurphy" rel="nofollow"><span title="Page moves: Jcmurphy"><font color="#002BB8">page&#160;moves</font></span></a> • <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Jcmurphy_fb8f.html" title="Special:Blockip/Jcmurphy"><span title="Block User:Jcmurphy">block&#160;user</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" rel="nofollow"><span title="Blocklog: Jcmurphy"><font color="#002BB8">block&#160;log</font></span></a></span>)) got blocked too. Whilst he hasn't apparently violated policy on en:, we felt that something of this magnitude deserved an indefinite block, pending a <i>very</i> good explanation.</p>
<p>Two reasons for posting this. First, to run the block by the community, since blocking for dodgy behaviour on another project is unusual. Secondly, and more importantly, <i>please</i> be alert if you run across someone adding OTRS permission tags. If someone is adding them <i>when they upload a file</i>, or is adding them whilst apparently a new user, be suspicious. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/OTRS" class="extiw" title="m:OTRS">m:OTRS</a> has a list of people with access to the queue; we're all happy to do quick lookups on the system to check that, yes, there is a permission filed. If you see one that looks unlikely, please feel free to challenge it - we want to stamp on this sort of thing hard. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 00:52, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seems to me that he misused the image on Wikipedia-en so a block is warranted. Indefinate is a good starting place for this sneaky offense.

<p>I'm not in favour of indiscriminate indefinite bans, but here I think we have an especially egregious case of bad faith, quite difficult to catch, and that poses real legal risks for both the Foundation and whoever tries to reuse our content in good faith. Moreover, impersonation is a crime in many jurisdictions. Thus, I think a cross-wiki indef ban is justified for such behaviour. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 15:33, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <b>strongly</b> support dividing images from the main CSD category.

We(well, me and some other people) handle {{<a href="../../../n/o/_/Template%7ENo_source_a38c.html" title="Template:No source">no source</a>}} fine; we can do the same with CSD images.

The current article Telefacts is about a completely unrelated matter, an existing and popular TV program in Flanders (Belgium). A legitimate article, and a reasonable redirect, so no problems there.

<p>I've just read some of <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">User:Giano</a>'s comments at <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html#Carnildo" title="User talk:Lar">User talk:Lar#Carnildo</a>, who (Giano) continues to have hard feelings about a block comment that <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">User:Carnildo</a> wrote when blocking Giano a while ago. This may be a problem that has affected more than one user.</p>
<p>My first instinct was to say we'd need block and edit summaries to be editable by the blocking/editing party, but that means either accepting that when the block comment is removed, the offense is forgiven, or adding another layer of revision control, presumably without summaries. Such an additional layer of r.c. would add too much complexity for my liking (and may not meet with much enthusiasm from the developers).</p>
<p>There is potential that if implemented without r.c., such a facility would undermine the value we currently derive from block comments as a log of past objectionable actions, because there is potential that admins give in to blocked parties too easily upon unblocking, and remove this important information in cases where the user continues to be disruptive. On the other hand, it would be a way of building forgiveness right into the system. It does, however, assume that users understand that if they quote edit summaries, the quoted content becomes, in all but very rare instances justifying oversight, embedded in the edit history, thus remaining visible to those willing to put in the effort to dig it up.</p>
<p>An alternative would be a spam filter for edit, upload, block etc. summaries that gives a warning about the use of typically derogatory words - a warning that could be overridden by a second click (as may be important for articles about anatomical parts or derogatory terms, for instance). This could (?) be easier to implement, but will not catch every offensive instance.</p>

<dd>Except where defamatory statements or private information are included, it wouldn't really be appropriate (and we can't easily filter those out automatically). It's important on Wikipedia to have a sense of proportion; those who don't may pose a problem, but this can be dealt with using normal, human methods. Writing yet more complex software won't help. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 12:13, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we need the ability to wipe a long, the more more urgent one would be the deletion log. I've at least once deleted an article with a libelous or privacy violating title and then though 'woops'. I suspect that happens more often than unfortunate blocking summaries. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 12:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Right. The auto-deletion summaries are often very bad, including birthdates of real people or even attacks.

<dd>Whatever happened to the idea of, "Once a criminal, always a criminal"? If someone screws up once, they're likely to screw up again. Even if they don't screw up again, the people who violate policy once still deserve extra scrutiny. (Except, perhaps, for people who have expertise in highways.) It's like that old "permanent record" they threatened kids with in school: "This is going to go on your permanent record!" Removing notifications of blocks, or removing vandalism warnings, is an all-too-convenient way of erasing one's permanent record. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 20:02, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nice cite of unreasonableness to encourage reasonableness, Elkman! However, it was all summed up better above: "forgive but don't forget". That's a good policy that guards against people falling back into old ways. However, it rarely applies in real life. Those who made a genuine mistake go away and reappear under a new username and never mention their old identity. Those who set out to destroy Wikipedia and changed their minds <b>demand</b> forgiveness but only allow about 8 minutes for it to be granted before they start destroying again, "justified" by not being believed (cf <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">User:Lir</a>). Those who are seriously deranged - and I mean "water tower-rifle interface error" - scream for positions of power in return for returning as "an ordinary user", then start to vandalise in a complete "help me! help me! I need pills and a rubber room!" way (qv <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">User:Blu Aardvark</a>).</dd>

<dd>The problem with this analogy is that, at least in Giano's case, there was no initial wrong. He <i>wasn't</i> hate speaking. His block needs expunging. Elkman would it be OK with you if I blocked you with the notation " indef block, major wanker, eats children in his spare time, runs down old ladies in crosswalks "&#160;?? That's an exaggeration but it's just as unjust and unwarranted a block entry as "hate speech". I think it would be a lot easier for Giano to forgive Carnildo if that smirch were removed. Of course I could be wrong and he would never forgive him but that's my theory. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 20:40, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Regardless of the block log, one cannot force forgiveness or amend lost trust by decree. Especially when there is seemingly so little incentive to do so. But since Giano is bothered by his block log, I'm blocking him for 10 seconds with an appropriate block log note attached.

<dd>I want to expand on my own block log note (which is indeed harsh) because I consider it closely tied to my approach toward Carnildo, who in his responses, draw the comparison that preemptively blocking pedophiles is similar in nature to preemptively blocking homosexuals. My antipathy toward his stance is largely based on the fact that, in the realm of ideas, he has yet to address these notions. So, intellectually, as far as I can understand, that remains his position, which is a pitvotal problem for me. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 21:56, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, sorry if this is the wrong place for a question like this--please redirect me to the right place if it is not.</p>
<p>A user recently added a dump from <a href="http://www.brampton.ca/tourism/heritage.tml" class="external text" title="http://www.brampton.ca/tourism/heritage.tml" rel="nofollow">this site</a> to the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brampton%2C_Ontario_aa5d.html" title="Brampton, Ontario">Brampton, Ontario</a> page, which I twice reverted as copyrighted information. He then emailed me stating that he worked for the City of Brampton and was the author of said information. I'm no expert on copyright, so I told him I'd contact someone here, but I assume he'd need to prove that the city itself (that is, someone who has legal authority to speak on its behalf) has given permission to use this copyrighted information on Wikipedia (and in essence release the copyright through acceptance of the GFDL). If he can provide this information, where should it be directed to? <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 18:36, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

It is a rather complicated situation. Queen Anne of Romania is the most common usage, but there are also good reasons why Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma should be used (see <a href="../../../q/u/e/Talk%7EQueen_Anne_of_Romania_fe9e.html" title="Talk:Queen Anne of Romania">Talk:Queen Anne of Romania</a>, <a href="../../../k/j/k/User_talk%7EKjkolb_1077.html" title="User talk:Kjkolb">User talk:Kjkolb</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#Princess_Anne_of_Bourbon-Parma" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">this section of the Administrator's Noticeboard</a> for discussions). The survey results were two to one in favor of a move. At first, I did not move the article because of an apparent conflict in the naming conventions, the most common usage vs. a rule for the naming of consorts. Then another naming convention seemed to apply, so I moved the article based on that and the survey result. However, the other convention may not be relevant, either. Still, I did not move the article back because of the survey result and Queen Anne of Romania being the most common usage. Also, moving the article back and forth does not seem like a good idea. Finally, while I would not call two to one (or three to one) a consensus, requested moves usually get little participation, often it is just the nominator, so going by the majority is more practical (barring any reasons why the majority position should not be followed, such as a relevant naming convention or having weaker arguments than the minority). -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:04, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for pasting the info below. As I said, the links that are to useful articles are no-brainer keeps but I personally don't believe the links to further links should be kept.

It has a few article which are very pro-Israel, but that is to be expected from a Jewish site. In fact every Jewish site out there has pro-Israel articles, are we going to start removing links to all of them? The links that are in the articles are to specific sections of the site that deal with the content of that article. For example in the Psalms article it links to the transalation and commentary of Psalms, not to any Israel related content. The Israel content is a tiny fraction of a percent of the site. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 13:14, 22 August 2006 (UTC) In addition its Pro-Israel articles focus less on politics and more on prayer, charity, and good deeds. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 13:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do you deny that it carries heavily politicised pro-Israeli editorial content, then? And the translation <i>with commentary</i> is indeed problematic, as is the fact that the copyright status of the commentary is somewhat unclear, and the fact that it is surrounded by adverts selling off the page (see the shopping cart icon?). Oh, and the text "at chabad.org" is weblinked not internally linked. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:06, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

About the Pro-Israel content see above. Why is a third party commentary <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashi.html" title="Rashi">Rashi</a> problamatic? There is no problem with copyright. You can write to Judaica Press to ask them. and a small advert on the side offering someone to buy a hard copy is quite reasonable when you are making the entire copy available online for free. I don't know, but perhaps Judaica Press asked them to place a link there as part of the agreement. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 13:27, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Chabad-Lubavitch is a popular and well-known Jewish movement, and chabad.org is a popular Jewish website - for example, it gets an Alexa ranking of 10,786, significantly higher than other popular sites about Judaism like askmoses.com (15,200), aish.com (15,930), ou.org (66,439), and jewfaq.org (68,141). I daresay it is <i>the</i> most popular site about Judaism on the internet. The fact that it carries a small amount of material about Israel is almost inevitable (just about every Jewish site does), though it's not clear what makes this content "heavily politicised". In any event, most of the links appear to be not to content that has anything to do with Israel at all, but rather to relevant pages on Jewish thought on various topics. In particular it's hard to imagine what is objectionable about the links to Jewish translations of various books of the Bible, along with <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashi.html" title="Rashi">Rashi</a>'s commentary. The <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaica_Press_c0b0.html" title="Judaica Press">Judaica Press</a> translation is generally recognized as one of the most scholarly Jewish translations (it's not a translation done by Chabad, btw), and Rashi is the pre-eminent Jewish commentator - observant Jews almost never read the Bible without using his commentary. All in all, these links are a rather valuable service provided to the Wikipedia reader. Oh, and regarding "copyright" issues, Rashi wrote the commentary in Hebrew in the 11th century, so I suspect his copyright has expired at this point. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:44, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm with Jay on this one. That said, the chabad.org site does not in every single instance represent the mainstream Orthodox Jewish viewpoint. In those cases, alternatives may need to be sought. But I don't support blanket removal of all links simply because an editor (an admin in good standing) once added them many months ago. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 22:39, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</blockquote>

<dd>The issue here is that we are in many cases representing the Chabad-Lubavitch POV as the Jewish POV, which is not exactly correct. If we don't do that, but don't have the mainstream Jewish POV, then it's undue weight. I think in many cases the Chabad link could be replaced with a link to the article in the Jewish Encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:53, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Normally I'd not concern myself with posting a relatively trivial question here but both my own page move and that of an admin have been reverted concerning an image's talk page. This image had to be reuploaded due to the fact that its original name was completely out of accord with NPOV.

<dd>I'm contacting the author of a Shavian font right now (and it's possible that he's the author of the font that the images were taken from, if they were taken from a font), asking for permission to create image files from them for Wikipedia. Is there anything particular I'm supposed to ask/say regarding the copyright situation of the images outside of Wikipedia? Does his granting us permission mean that all subsequent providers of content taken from Wikipedia have the right to use the images as they see fit? <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 13:49, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, granting Wikipedia permission to use the images isn't good enough. He will have to agree to license them under a free license like the GFDL or CC-BY-SA. However, since the Shavian alphabet is a recent invention and has an identifiable author (unlike most writing systems), I'm still not convinced that the letters aren't covered by R. K.

<dd>Where do we go to find out otherwise? I can't even conceive that an alphabet created for public use and which was hoped to replace the Latin alphabet was copyrighted. If anyone owned the copyright, I would think it was Shaw's estate, since Shaw commissioned the alphabet in his will, and so paid the creator for rights to the work. I would assume, with good faith, that Shaw didn't want copyright (and probably stated so in the will). But then, assumptions don't mean a whole lot here, eh? <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 14:08, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I doubt that Shaw's estate would own the copyright to this alphabet. He only commissioned the development of <i>some</i> phonetic alphabet; he had nothing to do with the development of <i>this</i> alphabet. There was a contest, which Read won. But it was Read, not Shaw's estate, who went on to develop <a href="../../../q/u/i/QuikScript_bd56.html" title="QuikScript">QuikScript</a> out of the Shavian alphabet, so I think any moral rights to the alphabet belong to Read.

<p>I'm the creator of the Shavian font mentioned above. I've decided to provide images of my font under the GFDL to replace the images in the Shavian article. I can identify the current images by their shape, and they are taken from an existing font which has been copied much but I don't believe the author has given permission for any of these copies. We really do need to have a properly licensed set of images, and that's why I've decided to provide them.</p>
<p>As for the issue of possible copyright by Kingsley Read, I don't see how it can possibly be copyrighted by him. There was a contest and several people's designs were accepted, and money was paid to the creators. Read's was chosen as the best of them, then additional modifications were made. The alphabet is mostly Read's creation but not totally. I've researched Shavian for several years and have never heard of any copyright. I don't know if an alphabet such as this can even be copyrighted. Unless someone can provide evidence of copyright, we must assume it's public domain, since all the information we have at least implies that. <a href="../../../e/t/h/User%7EEthanL_0437.html" title="User:EthanL">EthanL</a> (<a href="../../../e/t/h/User_talk%7EEthanL_4de2.html" title="User talk:EthanL">talk</a>) 08:19, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

The last time those pages were deleted was on August 19, and David has edited more or less continuously since then, so RTV wouln't have applied. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 16:05, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User talk pages are supposed to be kept. They can be blanked, but the history must be intact. The only times that they are deleted is when the user has only a couple of edits and is leaving forever or has already been blocked indefinitely and requests deletion to make a clean break, when the user is being harassed or when Jimbo deletes it, which is rare.

<dd>The user requested to "vanish" and was afforded this opportunity. Right to vanish does not apply selectively to user talk pages and not the actual user account, but to the entire user account.

<p>The article List of vehicles in the Halo universe has recently been recreated.

The page was recreated 1 September without malicious intent. I do not believe it falls under criteria for SC or PROD (as it does contain factual information). Being unsure about the best way to redelete the article, I moved to standard AfD, where I could not figure out just how to correctly list an article for deletion that had already been deleted. By bringing it to administrative attention, my hope is that the article can be deal with properly, as opposed to me taking a stab at random and hoping it works. --<a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurai_fde2.html" title="User:Ourai"><font color="darkblue"><b>Ourai</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../o/u/r/User_talk%7EOurai_765c.html" title="User talk:Ourai">т</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ourai_9e11.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ourai">с</a>)</sup> 08:56, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive56_24fc.html" title="Edit section: Second or third editor to quit">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second or third editor to quit</span></h2>
<p>I'm the second or third long-standing, good editor to quit Wikipedia as a result of the situation with the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>-related articles, even though my editing expanded far beyond them. Anarchism is listed as one of the subjects on which every Wikipedia should have an article on; yet, it is probably one of the worst and most unstable articles on the English-language Wikipedia. It draws to it a myriad of ideological warriors, from both sides of the spectrum, who have no problem gaming the system to get what they want. Some of them (like <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewolfstar_d89c.html" title="User:Thewolfstar">Thewolfstar</a>) have been banned, but have also admitted or been proven to have numerous sock puppets.</p>
<p>While most of the editors of these articles, regardless of partisanship, are reasonable and intelligent people who are willing to compromise, there have always been two or three (an interesting number, considering that two or three have been banned indefinitely) editors who have thrived on throwing matches into the powder keg. These editors know well how to game the system, and some administrators, probably unwittingly, play right into their hands. They wait for the slightest violation of Wikipedia policy by editors they disagree with and then report it immediately and vindictively, and a few administrators are always more than willing to come barreling in to block so-and-so without actually attempting to understand the context of the situation. I have been blocked three times in the three years that I have spent on Wikipedia, all within the span of the last month or so, as these users have learned how to better game the system. I am not typically a hot-headed or edit-warring type of editor. The second time, it was a mistake (later admitted by all involved). The last time, it was a mistake, but then again, <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> does seem to be incapable of error (and quite rude -- but then again, as a long-standing and active administrator, he deserves the respect of a soldier on the front lines, God bless him, I could never comprehend his travails).</p>
<p>Since I no longer see any reason to put any time into Wikipedia, and now see my thousands of edits and time spent trying to improve particular articles as rather pointless, I've decided to quit along with the two or three editors who have also recently quit as a result of this very same problem. I am posting this, as my last message to WP:AN, only because I hope that people will actually put some time into this problem and attempt to fix it. That is all. I don't want any sympathy, and I don't care whether or not anybody agrees or disagrees with my last block. It just needs to be recognized that there is a huge problem, and that that problem is not me, or Two-Bit Sprite, or Blahblahblahblah, or infinity0, or The Ungovernable Force, or any of the myriad of other editors involved in these articles, but rather two or three editors with too much time on their hands. --AaronS 13:45, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I haven't looked into the specifics of this case. However, I have already seen practices of "gaming the system": using the formal rules of Wikipedia (3RR etc.) to get rid of people of different opinions who have less time to spare or who are less organized. There's something flawed there; essentially, a group of decided POV-pushers with time to spare can effectively lock out good contributors.</dd>
<dd>I'm personally in favor of applying 3RR <i>sensibly</i>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 17:27, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do appreciate your comments, Aaron. What dispute resolution steps have been tried with that article? Might be time for an RfAr to try to get things under control. That article has been "trouble" for a long long time. And I might've been hasty with the blocks and comments. We admins can make mistakes too. Not making excuses for myself but it reminds me of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuro-linguistic_programming.html" title="Neuro-linguistic programming">Neuro-linguistic programming</a> when it was at its worst.

<dd>Just to answer your question, that article has been through a great deal of dispute resolution (RfAr, MedCab, etc.), and it hasn't helped one iota. The most troublesome editors are not interested in compromise. To compromise, for them, is to lose the great struggle. RJII, for instance, really believes that he is on the front lines of a revolution. Also, thank you for your comments. I appreciate that. --AaronS 21:38, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He was sockpuppeting on a related note - leaving messages on talk pages etc but not particularly attempting to engaged in tendentious editing. I unblocked his sockpuppet for similar reasons as Tony has jsut unblocked his main account. I would describe Dbiv as behaving oddly; there is a chance he is being manipulative; however given the quality of his contributions I think we should extend every opportunity for him to regain our trust. IF he continues to either breach the ArbCom decision, or otherwise wind people up, it is little hassle to reblock him. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 23:54, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>One tenet that reassures all of us that Wikipedia never will be overrun by vandals is that people inherently want to be "good" more than "evil," so the number of people reverting and fighting vandalism will always be higher than the number of people vandalising -- no matter how much Wikipedia grows. It has occurred to me, however, that the more notorious Wikipedia becomes, through either media hype of its supposed inacurracies from minor misinformation to libel (Siegenthaler), or god forbid, if any mishaps should happen to children preyed upon by pedophiles here. I'm sure you can imagine the massive media coverage that would get.</p>
<p>Therefore, if Wikipedia becomes notorious in the media for its real or supposed "evils," the number of people using Wikipedia to vandalise and wreak havoc would increase faster than the people fighting vandalism. New vandals would see harming Wikipedia as a crusade in taking down something seen as malicious, something with a bad reputation, and a bloated factory of internet evil. And thus Wikipedia would finally be overrun. Its just a thought I had. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_Mirabeau_ddc6.html" title="User:Wiki Mirabeau">Wiki Mirabeau</a> 03:45, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree fully with this strategy. One of the things that makes image deletion ponderous (for me) is the manual nature of having to check and count the 7 day period.

<p>We block hundreds of accounts with either nil or just one or two edits. Many of these are blocked at creation either for inappropriate usernames, or just trolling 'User:jimbo wales sucks' 'Doc glasgow on wheels' etc. I've been concerned for a while that there is a whole cottage industry of people going around creating userpages for these accounts, and taging and categorising them by whose sock they are thought to be (most are willy impersonators)- or which admin they are impersonating (although they are attacking rather than impersonating). Per <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> I've been tryign to discourage this practice.</p>
<p>I always thought the taggers were simply misguided wiki-criminologists with an obsession with pseudo-law enforcement. However I'm now very suspicious that the same people creating these troll/vandal accounts are involved in tagging them. Many of the taggers are brand new accounts with no edit history e.g. <a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZIN_9a5f.html" title="User:ZIN">User:ZIN</a>, User:UJonk. Others have been specifically confirmed by checkuser to be creating socks as well e.g <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheM62Manchester_f165.html" title="User:TheM62Manchester">User:TheM62Manchester</a>. I'm sure checkuserers could shed more light on this, but as a more general fix I’m proposing the following policy:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Userpages should not be created for indefinitely blocked accounts with an insignificant number of edits. Administrators may delete any userpages so created.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd interpret significant as 10+, but that's details. I intend to enforce this policy immediately, unless there are factors I have failed to consider. Thanks. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 13:21, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most of the policies on Wikipedia were principles or common practices before they were written down.

<p>Good idea.

<p>I think one of the main issues related to this, is that if someone creates an account along the lines of "Bobby Boulders on Wheels loves General Tojo who killed FireFox", somebody will have the great urge to tag the userpage with masses of tags covering all angles of the username. This has certainly been an issue in the recent past, at least. —&#160;<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox"><span style="color:blue">FireFox</span></a>&#160;<sup>(<a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFireFox_263b.html" title="User talk:FireFox"><span style="color:red"><b>talk</b></span></a>)</sup> <sub>13:30, 29 August 2006</sub></p>

<dd>Creating the above bolded language as a policy has my full support. Leaving these pages up just gives incentive to these vandals for "upping their count". Yes, they'll come up with more creative ways of gaining notariety. But each time they do something like this they provide us with more and more information and bring us closer and closer to identifying them. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique"><b>B</b>astique</a><span class="Unicode" style="color:#FF72E3;">▼</span><b><sup><a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBastique_d47c.html" title="User talk:Bastique">parler</a></sup></b> <sub><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bastique_7452.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bastique">voir</a></b></sub> 13:40, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That much is good, but this is not a policy Doc, it's only your idea for a policy. At the moment, it's only a personal policy. Fine, run around deleting these pages at will if you must, I'm not going to complain, but let's have some semblance of discussion on this. I think it would be useful to keep only the generic {{<a href="../../../i/n/d/Template%7EIndefblockeduser_10ad.html" title="Template:Indefblockeduser">indefblockeduser</a>}} for userpages, whether applied by admins or not. We don't all have checkuser access or immediate responses from any informal requests (wherever or however those are done).

<p>The divider for me is: does this glorify the vandal (and at most only incidentally help the admins deal)? Lose it. Or does it help admins deal (and at most only incidentally glorify the vandal). For now, it seems to me that tagging accounts with names that attack or disparage may not be productive (although I tag them with the base {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsername_3cbf.html" title="Template:Username">username</a>}} when I spot them, is that something that is perhaps not productive as well?) but that tagging accounts as socks often is ( perhaps not for WoW or WiC, perhaps but for some of our other sockfesters like PoolGuy for example). It seems that placing them in the category requires that either the userpage or the usertalk page not be deleted (so that the category has a place to be put). But that doesn't mean the page needs more than that category tag. On balance I think DENY ought to be considered to become policy, perhaps with some tinkering but agree it's not yet. Nevertheless it's a good practice. Qualified support of this idea. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 17:24, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, some are useful in the short term (and it should be short term), we just need to apply some common sense. Many of these tags are basically irrelevant. On the point of policy regarding <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a>, I think it should also be noted that there is no policy saying we plaster tags over the userpage of every user who is blocked... --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 19:23, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think Doc Glasgow's proposal is reasonable. WP:DENY is a good idea in principle, subject to implementation. As pgk suggests, it doesn't require a policy change to not add a template, or to blank a userpage, maybe leaving the category. I'm going to start doing this whenever it makes sense. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 20:26, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An example right here of where a LTA page was helpful.

<dd>And Doc has expressed his opinion that all of the pages and categories are useless and this proposal is the first step. The next one will be to get rid of all of them.

<dd>If this proposal goes so far as to get rid of a useful page like the MasgotGuy page (which, if you review it, will clearly demonstrate enormous utility to admins trying to deal with the problem, and no glory to the vandal) then it's going too far.

<p>It's a bit too early to be deleting vandal pages as there isn't any consensus to delete them. Furthermore, some of them contain useful information, like which IP range do you block when Blu Aardvark shows up? If the relevant vandal page gets deleted (which it hasn't because it's in my userspace), admins are going to have to sift through the checkuser evidence while he vandalises away. I reckon such pages should be moved to <a href="http://countervandalism.org" class="external text" title="http://countervandalism.org" rel="nofollow">Essjay's wiki</a> where they are of use but don't give vandals recognition and have been trying to do that, but Essjay seems to be on a wikibreak. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 09:37, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This issue has come up a few times all over the place. There are certain titles involving a number of words which can be lowercased or uppercased, but which must be done in unison. A mixed upper-case/lower-case title for certain offices is fundamentally wrong in English. (It is the equivalent of writing <i>United <b>s</b>tates</i> or <i>George w <b>b</b>ush</i>, or indeed <i>President of the united states</i>.) Because of this the requirement for full uppercasing or full lowercasing was explicitly spelt out when it comes to prime minister/Prime Minister in the Naming Conventions and elsewhere. In the past, when the page was moved to a mixed upper &amp; lower case, the move was instantly undone by admins under the IAR rule, on the basis that to put an office under such a illiterate form of name would be to bring ridicule on Wikipedia, because it is such a fundamental error. (It is the sort of error that students, if they replicate it in exams, are <i>instantly</i> failed on. It is what is known in the academic trade as a "nuclear error" because if you do it, nothing else counts.) While the RM procedure normally functions smoothly, the wisdom of Wikipedia's rule about decisions not being based on votes is shown here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Where there is a valid argument for <i>either</i> uppercasing or lowercasing, for technical reasons we cannot an entirely lowercased version. Rather than make ourselves a laughing stock, it has long been precedent in these and other cases to use the only other alternative then available, using the uppercase version of the title. As with precedent in this and similar cases, to avoid embarrassment to WP and going by the rules laid down in the MoS and NC, I used IAR to overrule the RM vote and reinstate the page to a correct format. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 02:02, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On a further note, the title "Prime Minister" became an official one in the United Kingdom in 1905 or thereabouts, when Campbell-Bannerman took office. It could be argued that prior to 1905 the office was a notional one in the UK, and that the First Lord of the Treasury (or Foreign Secretary in the case of Salisbury) was the monarch's "prime minister." Of course, this ignores the Continental usage, where the office was established in law far earlier than that. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 02:12, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think, Tariq, you realise how <i>big</i> a mistake it is. Saying it would make WP a laughing stock is if anything understating how ridiculous it would look. It is the equivalent of writing <i>United states</i>, of calling Berlin the capital of France, or of writing about a "Prime Minister of the United States". It is the sort of mistake that would lead readers to ask "how could an encyclopaedia make such an elementary mistake?" If the article had remained at <i>Prime minister</i> I can pretty much guarantee that the mistake would make the Sunday newspapers in Britain next Sunday with "and they call <i>this</i> an encyclopaedia?" articles. It is a cringemaking mistake that a first year politics student would get pulled up for. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 02:26, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No. It is about accuracy. The office can either have both words uppercased or both lowercased. It can never ever ever have one uppercased and one lowercased. That is idiotic, akin to writing <i>President bush</i>. As WP cannot for technical reasons have both words lowercased the only option is to go with the uppercased version. A RM vote (of 3!) decided to ignore the rules of grammar and all the rules of Wikipedia as laid out (and the case of prime minister/Prime Minister is explicitly spelt out as an example where half-upper and half-lower is not an option) and move to a made-up name that is quite simply illiterate bullshit. As admins have done in the past (on this article in particular) I used to IAR rule laid down by Jimbo to overrule the application of a move which would make WP a laughing stock. And yes, Centrx, <i>Prime minister</i>. as Mackensen and anyone else who deals with current affairs, political science, history etc will tell you, is illiterate nonsense. It is one of those elementary faux pas taught to students as a "you must never ever . . ." It also features in style guides worldwide as an example of what never ever to do. BTW <i>united states</i>, lowercased, means an informal, unstructured group of states. <i>United States</i>, uppercased, means a formal country by that name. <i>United states</i>, mixed, means either that the person who wrote it had been drinking, or had an English teacher so bad they should sue them for incompetence. <i>Prime minister</i> means the same. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 04:13, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is beyond ludicrous. First off, to quickly deal with <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">User:Jtdirl</a>'s utterly ridiculous example: "United States" is a proper noun, a name; "prime minister", isn't. If you have a reality-based example, bring it out, but this isn't one. If you can't tell the difference, don't spout off nonsense about "illiterate bullshit".</p>
<p>Second, since "prime minister" is the proper form for the job, Wikipedia page titling -- and standard English orthography -- demands the page be called "Prime minister", just like every other two-word title would be in every other similiar situation. Since this is absolutely standard, the only people likely to be confused by this are morons -- and while I realized that Wikipedia is not edited for the protection of minors, I didn't realize it was edited for the protection of morons. Make "WP a laughing stock"? Only among complete idiots.</p>
<p><i>It also features in style guides worldwide as an example of what never ever to do.</i> Fine, give an example, one that <b>explicitly</b> says that using "prime minister" at the beginning of sentences demands that <b>both</b> words be capitalized. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 09:28, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Glad I brought my hip waders today, as I'm going to get knee deep in it here... I don't have my Canadian Press stylebook handy today, but I know that in referring to Stephen Harper, when I'm not using words that aren't repeatable in polite society, I capitalize Prime Minister, and I have one style reference that says that it should be capitalized depending on the importance of the person being referred to - suggesting that as federal government policy. <a href="http://www.cornerstoneword.com/wbrn/capital/capital.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cornerstoneword.com/wbrn/capital/capital.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> Here's another guide that suggests it's capitalized in conjunction with a name, but not otherwise. <a href="http://www.emp.ca/styleguide/emsg-capital.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.emp.ca/styleguide/emsg-capital.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> This guide says only capitalize if it's after a name when referring to a head of government. <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/gcareers/grammar/capital_letters.htm#RULE%206" class="external free" title="http://www.yorku.ca/gcareers/grammar/capital_letters.htm#RULE%206" rel="nofollow">http://www.yorku.ca/gcareers/grammar/capital_letters.htm#RULE%206</a>:] A discussion we had at the office here last week on titles brought forward that if we're putting it before a proper name, it should be capitalized all the time, but if it's after, we can use lower case. Personally, I'd still capitalize Prime Minister if I'm referring to Harper or Blair, but that's the joy of being an editor - you can bend things occasionally. However, we might also want to look at our own <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">manual of style</a>, which, under the second section on Titles discusses capitalization of prime minister depending on various uses. All in all, I think we should follow the initial suggestion: move to "Prime minister" and add the un-capitalized note at the top. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 15:40, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made a long-winded comment on the talk page. Basically, it comes down to a pragmatic decision about what does or doesn't "look funny" that has to be made in some pragmatic way. If it's a question of what is <i>technically</i> correct, then we should write "prime minister" throughout the article except when it begins a sentence. The title of the article should then be "Prime minister" because it is our publisher's house style always to capitalise the first letter of an article's title. Surely, though, we make some pragmatic exceptions to this, don't we? <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 10:00, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To be clear, that doesn't mean that I think the circumstances justify a pragmatic exception being made here. I have no opinion about that. I just think that it would be good if both sides realised that the other side has a point. In one case it's grounded in consistent application of house style; in the other it's grounded in the risk of public misunderstanding. At the moment, consistent application of house style seems to be the majority approach, and I can certainly live with that. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 23:21, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The ascription of <i>liar</i> to a biographical subject is probably less-than-helpful, such that one might reasonably strike it out, I suppose, but this situation seems quite insignificant relative to those that BLP seeks to address; not only is <i>liar</i> almost surely not potentially libellous, but such appellative is mentioned on the talk page of a and quite plainly a subjective assessment not advanced as unsourced fact (toward which, see <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mistake_of_fact.html" title="Mistake of fact">mistake of fact</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinion.html" title="Opinion">opinion</a>; of course, neither <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">unsourced facts</a> nor <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">personal opinion</a> be introduced into articles [or appended to talk pages], but it is worth noting that there are, at the very least, no legal issues here). The <i>fair game</i> formulation does seem to reflect a misunderstanding of BLP (although perhaps the editor means to refer to the distinction in United States law as regards libel between those who are public figures and those who are not [<i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan_6296.html" title="New York Times Co. v. Sullivan">New York Times Co. v.

<li>Even the article about <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a> dosent mention the religion at the very top at the very beginning of the article.</li>

<p>Also, for what it's worth, Jewish is a lot more than merely a religion, it is also a heritage and culture. Although I am atheist by "religion", when someone asks me what I am, I am likely to respond Jewish, because that is my culture and my heritage.

<dd>There was repetitive removal of a properly referenced statement (from <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> a reputable UK paper) of his Jewish origin ("Jewish family", meaning immediate family), because of a POV assertion that this didn't count, according to the removers' criteria of Jewishness. Several of the removing editors were blocked as socks.

<p>Hi everyone, we've come to a fork in the road where <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> is being fully implemented and most of the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELong_term_abuse_53c2.html" title="Wikipedia:Long term abuse">Wikipedia:Long term abuse</a> subpages are being deleted.</p>
<p>So, before <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELong_term_abuse_Universe_Daily_2de8.html" title="Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Universe Daily">Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Universe Daily</a> gets deleted we need to figure out whether to shut down the linkspammer once and for all at the risk of forcing him to change tactics and risk making it harder for us to track him.</p>
<p>"Universe Daily" is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Universe_today&amp;oldid=73319707" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Universe_today&amp;oldid=73319707" rel="nofollow">abusive</a> <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_optimization.html" title="Search engine optimization">SEO</a> who is known to have posted redirect-spam links Wikipedia to 40 known domains of his in the past. For example, stephenhawkingsuniverse.com (<a href="http://www2.dnstools.com/?wwwhois=on&amp;portNum=80&amp;target=stephenhawkingsuniverse.com&amp;submit=Get+Info" class="external text" title="http://www2.dnstools.com/?wwwhois=on&amp;portNum=80&amp;target=stephenhawkingsuniverse.com&amp;submit=Get+Info" rel="nofollow">whois</a>) is one such domain which has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hawking&amp;oldid=72961623" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hawking&amp;oldid=72961623" rel="nofollow">linked</a> to at the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hawking_e11c.html" title="Stephen Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> article. His links aren't noticed for some time because they are actually an invisible frame redirecting vistors to an official site. In this example, stephenhawkingsuniverse.com was a redirect to Hawking's official <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/hawking/html/home.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/hawking/html/home.html" rel="nofollow">documentary</a> site at <a href="../../../p/b/s/PBS_66e9.html" title="PBS">PBS</a>. After having establishing an external link in any article for some time, "Universe Daily" would then either turn on his own ads in his domain's frame or redirect his domain to an ad/<a href="../../../l/i/n/Link_farm.html" title="Link farm">link farm</a> as he did with universetoday.net at <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe_Today_e915.html" title="Universe Today">Universe Today</a> (their official site is .com).</p>
<p>This spammer has continued doing this since May of this year and has been banned many times for using sockpuppet accounts and random IPs as well as the odd open proxy. There's also a debate as to whether we should <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Spam_blacklist" class="extiw" title="meta:Spam_blacklist">blacklist</a> all of his known domains. If we blacklist all his domains, we run the risk of him purchasing a whole new set of domains to start all over again and it may become even harder to pick up his trail again.</p>
<p>"Universe Daily" has also switched to a new tactic where he is directly redirecting his sites back to the revisions of the Wikipedia articles that he inserted his own domains into. Could it be possible to oversight every reversion of every article he's ever edited to sabotage whatever SEO technique he is trying to use?</p>
<p>I just don't know what the best course of action dealing with this spammer is anymore. Through my investigations, I have noticed that the Registrant's contact details are publicly available. Is there anyone from the Wikimedia Foundation has the official capacity to ask him to cease and desist from spamming Wikipedia? -- <small><span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333"> Netsnipe </span></b></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:#003333; color:White"> ► </span></a></span></small> 19:19, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As an aside, and a significant one, this person left <b>469</b> hate mail messages in my e-mail box on Friday, two days ago. Four different messages, advertising an anti-semitic hate site he built himself, and bragging that his vandalized version of the Israel article could be found there.

<p><i>Has he been spamming lately?</i> I knew all of his linkspam sites, and I kept that list private until he started putting his pages as framing to real websites. He sent me close to 2000 mailbombs from wikipedia email until I sat down and noticed it and put an autodelete filter on his emails. I know his real name too, including several details about his spamming activities that is not on the LTA page. That being said, the issue with the LTA page is <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>, where we don't want to help him improve his activities.

<dd>Naconkantari's option is the way to go. It's simply denying him what he wants. There <b>is</b> an issue here, however: the URLs we have for the foul-mouthed little mailbomber are all liable to change, so this isn't a permanent solution as we will have meta admins AGFing and not adding his filthly little sites to the list without many and several hoops being jumped through. And rightly so. But this is the way to go if we want to stop Wayne and his spamming activities on our side. On his side, we're going to need Oz Wikipedians to get in touch with his ISP if it can be found; Canadians to talk to Doteasy Technology, his registration agents, and the Foundation to talk to Google (his ultimate aim) about a hard blacklist.</dd>

<dd>The one thing Mr Smith should not expect is for Wikipedia admins to be put off by mailbombs and persistance. We've all had bigger things than him free with our breakfast cerials of a morning, and his death-threatening mailbombs are usefully futile, amusing... and slowing the idiot down. :o) <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 21:32, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

The only thing I have said to this user is remind him that by submitting any information to the English Language Wikipedia, he is publishing it under the GNU Free Documentation license (GFDL), and that cannot be "withdrawn", as the user wanted to call it.

<p>Per previous incidents, I've deleted most of it which was unreferenced (apart from a couple of points referenced only in German) and reduced it to an acceptable stub, so that solves the immediate problem. Anyone making legal threats gets to be blocked indefinitely, till they withdraw them, as we can't function with another editor in those circumstances. You might like to warn the complainant of that. The article will need to be built up carefully and closely referenced. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:49, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the user is making legal threats they should be blocked from editing immediately. However, I suggest that as they are in the sensitive position of complaining about BLP, it might be politic in the first instance to explain the article has been amended, and ask them if they withdraw any legal threat, or else we will be forced to block them. Perhaps Mets501 could have a go there. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 03:07, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry if this is the wrong forum - I am very new to Wikipedia. The comment within the second paragraph of the Carreer section of the article on Kate Garraway is surely libelous - could somebody remove it?</p>

<dd>Buried somewhere in the various threads, it has been pointed out before that the screen name "publicgirluk" has been witnessed online in various venues, including a number of sexuality related online groups. Unfortunately, this doesn't resolve the underlying ambiguity. Either the real publicgirluk contributed those photos, or someone familiar with that identity impersonated her and uploaded the images (which the real publicgirluk may have posted to some web forum). For the moment, I would encourage people the let the issue lie until we have an agreed upon policy for verifying unusual licensing claims. Once we do have such a policy, I intend to reach out to the person using that persona online in the hopes of ultimately resolving this issue. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 22:49, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>All you would have to do to verify that it was her would be to have her take a picture of herself in front of her computer displaying the Wikipedia home page or her user page. Another option would be for her to hold up a sign saying "Wikipedia can have my pictures" or something. Don't have her write it on her body, that's just degrading.</p>

<dd>On the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Talk%7EMasturbation_e661.html" title="Talk:Masturbation">Talk:Masturbation</a> page we are discussing which image to make the lead image. I have a Klimt drawing there currently, but I seem to be in the minority wanting it to remain there. There are several candidates of pictures of men or women masturbating. As for the "publicgirluk" photos, I've been concerned that it was not her, but her boyfriend who uploaded the image. But of course, there has been no way to tell. At any rate, it is just a matter of time before the no censorship policy results in explicit photos of people. We need to find a way to be sure that the real person does consent to the use of their image. The <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creampie.html" title="Creampie">creampie</a> article is another example of where that is avoided for the moment. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 03:17, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The issue as I understand it is not so much the explicit nature of the photos, but that nature <i>combined with</i> the fact that the subject of the photo was clearly identifiable. Wikipedia has plenty of penis and vulva pictures, but generally speaking seeing that doesn't really tell me anything about who it is. Once you can identify the subject, we have to worry about model release issues. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 03:23, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I like the anatomically accurate drawings that some texts use. However, in some situations a photograph is best. When graphic pictures are used, I think that it should be either a very small thumbnail or a link. I have no problem with nudity or pornography, it just seems classier and it is easier to read an article without an explicit photograph right next to the text. This goes for non-sex articles with explicit photographs, too.</dd>
<dd>Nandesuka, I would worry about model release issues even when the person is not easily identifiable. Also, some photographs on Wikipedia that are unidentifiable close-ups identify the subject in the caption or on the description page, sometimes the person who is posting the picture and sometimes not. If the photograph is not of the person posting it and the subject is identified, it would be close to the same issue as you are talking about ("close" because, to me, being identifiable in the photograph itself is different than being identified in the caption or description page). It would be also be a problem if a poster submits a picture of someone else and claims that it is him or her, especially if the poster has a username that could be used to identify the real person or if the real person's name is given in the caption or on the description page. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 04:40, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Biographies noticeboard seems to be a little bit slow on it, so I'm going to request it here. Emmalina is a non-public figure and her birthday should be rmoeved per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>.

In short, I'm requesitng an admin to delete the article and only restore the revissions that do not contain her birthdate. That means that all revissions from 2 July on (this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emmalina&amp;diff=61648318&amp;oldid=61647757" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emmalina&amp;diff=61648318&amp;oldid=61647757" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> one specifically) should be deleted. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 03:53, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If she is notable enough to have an article on Wikipedia, then, if her birthdate can be proven, there is nothing wrong with including it in the article.

<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia includes exact birthdates for some famous people, but including this information for most living people should be handled with caution. While many well-known living persons' exact birthdays are widely known and available to the public, <b>the same is not always true for marginally notable people or non-public figures</b>. With identity theft on the rise, it has become increasingly common for <b>people to consider their exact date of birth to be private information'</b>. When in doubt about the notability of the person in question, or <b>if the subject of a biography complains about the publication of his or her date of birth</b>, err on the side of caution and simply list the year of birth rather than the exact date.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think this qualifies as a deletion. No, her birthdate cannot be conclusively proven either, it's not on any of the subject's profile pages. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 04:32, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not preventing anyone from doing anything. See the medical school entry now. I totally agree with what everyone has posted especially you and Leuko and a few others. There is a proper way of posting things and you should have seen what Robo doc did to the article - he started the good ol foreign medical school defaming here (using words like "fake medical school" "nigerian fraud" without citations) then completely changed the formatting! If you really think what Robo doc did is ok, then go ahead, block me. By the way, beginning next week, I'm no longer associated with the school so I will no longer post in that area; (I got accepted elsewhere). --<a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrGladwin_3f33.html" title="User:DrGladwin">DrGladwin</a> 15:55, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a war at <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vic_Grimes_a384.html" title="Vic Grimes">Vic Grimes</a> that doesn't technically fall under 3RR that needs attention by an admin. The story so far is: JB196 wrote an article gathering info from various sources and creditted hismelf as the author of the article in the body, this previously had been discussed back in April of 2006 and he was told not to do. I removed the line about him being the "author" of the article and he reverted it and over a few days I got frustrated and brought it to the attention of <a href="../../../p/w/_/WP%7EPW_f376.html" title="WP:PW">WP:PW</a>. What happened from then is that JB196 is attempting to constantly revert the article to its state before his edits, removing all the information and updates, unless he gets creditted with being the author of the article. We've tried to explain that wikipedia is a people's encyclopedia and that anyone can contribute and there are no article "authors" but this has not let up.</p>
<p>Can an admin take a look at this and give a ruling? The result is slightly important as he has done this to several other articles and the ruling would be sort of binding to how we deal with it.</p>
<p>(The reason I didn't take this to mediation or informal mediation is that it's a fast moving situation and that a consensus would be pretty much impossible as it's an all or nothing situation in that either he is creditted for "writing" the article or isn't.) --- <a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a> 03:17, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I made the TWA article. Your point doesn't stand, sir. To the admins: I think the main issue here is that bullet, Lid, and maybe even one or two others are applying double standards to their reasoning, and saying that when I make a revert its vandalism but when they make a revert its reverting a vandalism and therefore legal. That contention doesn't fly any more than my goldfish flies (bad joke but you get the point...). How do you know I didn't just make up all those wrestler names and that HBK didn't train any of them? You're arguing that I don't have integrity in my Wikipedia edits so by your logic I may've just made up most of those wrestlers.

<dd>The fact that a term has been used in a racist context, is not an excuse for continuing to use the term, and propogating the term, and/or the racist context. There are isolated cases of why a term that has a racist connotation by some might be used legitimately, but few. Under what situations would it be appropriate, and legitimate for an article to use the term "Whitey, Coon, or Kike?" In my opinion, almost none, unless it was directly quoting some source, and that quote had important relavence to the quality of the article. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 15:47, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The negative connotations did exist (in Czech language the old colloquial phrase "Turkish economy" (<i>turecké hospodářství</i>) means something chaotic and defunct). During 16-18th century, at least in <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_lands.html" title="Czech lands">Czech lands</a>, "a Turk" was a synonym of menacing threat (border of Ottoman Empire was very near). I have doubt whether Turks were widely known during crusades. And btw, labeling something as racist has devaluated to nothing but stupid offense. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 17:54, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDEL_edb2.html" title="WP:UNDEL">WP:UNDEL</a> policy currently contains, "Non-sysops who wish to see the content of a deleted article, either <b>to use its content elsewhere</b>, or alternatively, because they cannot tell if it was wrongly deleted without seeing what exactly was deleted. (temporary undeletion)". The second clause about undeleting so non-admins can better judge whether it was deleted properly implies that this can be 'temporary undeletion' prior to a DRV and that is my understanding of the way it have been applied in the past... individual admins just temporarily undeleting and/or userfying deleted content on their own without any sort of more formal process. So, unless someone is gonna be out at the barn wall with a can of paint over this latest brouhaha I'd say it's ok, with the caveats (copyright, privacy, et cetera) you noted. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 10:38, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Regardless of the motives or the people involved, we must constantly be aware that any information on Wikipedia is subject to <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, and if we are going to reveal it to other people for publication elsewhere, we must make them aware that they <i><b>have</b></i> to abide by the GFDL requirements for republication. If it's an admin doing the republication elsewhere (as with the Everyking possible copying of deleted material), the admin must follow the GFDL requirements, as well. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 18:38, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To avoid such issues, I would recommend making the information available on wiki only, as a restored article or user subpage. What the user does is his own business; by keeping it on-wiki, the admin has no such GFDL issues <i>and</i> the situation is kept open to inspection. Regarding Mailer Diablo's point, one needs to use discretion and common sense, and if there are any questions, refer the person asking to the deleting admin. (In the Everyking case, one of the things that should have tipped EK off to the fact that this was going to be a sensitive issue is that he was afraid to deal directly with the deleting admin.) <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 19:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Something about this thread leaves me a little worried. Looking at Polewood's contributions, it seems all the edits so far involved: this thread, getting an autoblock removed, and placing templates on the user's page. The first and last is what concerns me. Why would a newly established user come directly to here to report a user that left before this user joined? Also, adding templates and modifying them to fit their own needs was a favorite of TheM62Manchester (I can't provide diffs for this because the user's account page was deleted). I don't know, something seems a bit odd to me. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 16:54, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
