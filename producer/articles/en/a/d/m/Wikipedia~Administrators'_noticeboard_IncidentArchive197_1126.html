If I can find a citation, expect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ben_Thompson&amp;diff=106850128&amp;oldid=106849543" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ben_Thompson&amp;diff=106850128&amp;oldid=106849543" rel="nofollow">your edit to be changed</a>; it's not very encyclopedic in tone. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Train_c9b0.html" title="User:A Train">A Train</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/_/t/User_talk%7EA_Train_dd5d.html" title="User talk:A Train"><font color="DarkBlue">take the</font></a></small></sup> 16:35, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not sure why this is at the top instead of bottom of the page, but anyway ... I just received a talk message asking me to help out on this because I had "been editing the article". I've never edited the article; I added the fac tag to the talk page per the <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> nomination. I don't know how to help here, but it looks like both parties are deleting things from each other's talk pages, so it's hard to follow. Can someone help? Editor20 says BMT's real name is Ben Thompson, FWIW. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SandyGeorgia&amp;diff=106859017&amp;oldid=106799295" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SandyGeorgia&amp;diff=106859017&amp;oldid=106799295" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 16:39, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is! I am using the executive version. When I get home tonight I will even provide a screenshot. also, i have uploaded the article and provided a link to it on the talk page. What can I do to prove this?! I have added a screenshot (look on the talk page of the Ben Thompson article. My source is accurate, and I think anyone who fails to believe it now is deliberately trying to cause trouble. If anyone who has access to LexisNexis Executive searches for "ben thompson" and "1884" for in major stories then they will find the article. LexisNexis professional may not bring up the result. I have even provided a link to an RTF file with the information. Because you require access to look at LexisNexis material, it is not possible for me to provide for you a direct HTTP link to the source. --TheEditor20 19:07, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can someone please use Lexis Nexix Executive and verfify the article I have provided from the Santa Fe New Mexican. Either than or someone find the edition of the new mexican. How can someone say my source is incorrect without even getting a copy of the Santa Fe New Mexixan July 04 1997 and finding out?

<p><b>FIRST:</b></p>
<p>GrahameKing deleted blocks of text from the talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=106984260&amp;oldid=106978867" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=106984260&amp;oldid=106978867" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=106978867&amp;oldid=106264108" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=106978867&amp;oldid=106264108" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>The larger block of text was reintroduced by Proto <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=106018667&amp;oldid=105637440" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=106018667&amp;oldid=105637440" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> after an <i>older</i> previous mass-deletion by GrahameKing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=104118637&amp;oldid=103827267" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=104118637&amp;oldid=103827267" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.</p>
<p>GrahameKing <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrahameKing_2e5d.html#Truce_Proposal" title="User talk:GrahameKing"><b>suggested</b> to leave</a> the deleted paragraphs out of the talk page during the RfC about this issue, due to his concern about such "defamatoy" (his opinion, not mine) stuff listed at Google.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>I am wondering if that´s</b> (GrahameKing´s "truce") <b>the correct thing to do</b> (if no Wikipolicies barring this option), just to avoid a nasty escalation of deletions and reversals. <b>If</b> my source is pronounced as valid, the paragraph then will be in the main article. <b>If</b> it is not, the text will be deleted and that´s it. I have no hurry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think that GrahameKing is a good user, but, -just my opinion- maybe a bit too emotional and too devoted to PrimalTherapy. Not offence intended.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>SECOND:</b></p>
<p>OTOH, GrahameKing presented no alegations for the RfC, and <b>I asked him <u>thrice</u></b> to do so <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103825279" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103825279" rel="nofollow">[11]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105077632" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Primal_therapy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105077632" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GrahameKing&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106099427" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GrahameKing&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106099427" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. I am wondering if I am in front of a <b><u>stonewaller</u></b>. I must confess that my reserves of good faith about this issue are running low.</p>
<p><b>THIRD:</b></p>
<p>GrahameKing also deleted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Primal_therapy&amp;diff=107004602&amp;oldid=105921628" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Primal_therapy&amp;diff=107004602&amp;oldid=105921628" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <i>another</i> section of sourced content (introduced by me in...October <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Primal_therapy&amp;diff=80852059&amp;oldid=80293153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Primal_therapy&amp;diff=80852059&amp;oldid=80293153" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>) from the article , never touched before by GrahameKing´s multiple deletions. This time <i>I</i> reverted the deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Primal_therapy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107044481" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Primal_therapy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107044481" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, because the deleted stuff is totally noncontroversial.</p>
<p>I think that this deletion of a section after four months it´s just a <b>diversionary tactic</b>. As I said, my good faith about this issue is running low.</p>
<p><b>FOURTH</b></p>
<p>Incorrect tagging at my User:Page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Randroide&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106975180" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Randroide&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106975180" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></p>

<p>Is there a process for admin-status evaluation (or something like that)? Or is it just better just to wait for Alkivar to calm down (and hope the account's admins powers won't be misused in the future)?</p>

<dd>Abu badali, your desire to protect the Wiki is admirable. I'm certain you would have done the same for any admin, even those held your favor, and that the fact you happen to have announced the wikibreak of an admin who sanctioned you is a complete coincidence. I look forward to seeing your continued contributions on the project, and again, thank you for the heads up. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 21:05, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>This thing got started really quickly so I'll post here for the record: there's a new noticeboard for decisions that welcome the entire community's input, such as community bans.

<p>I would just like to bring to attnetion User:Booze broads and bullets. The user has been uploading copyrighted images (and in some cases, text) since July 2006, has been repeatedly warned on his talk page <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBooze_broads_and_bullets_b159.html" title="User talk:Booze broads and bullets">User_talk:Booze_broads_and_bullets</a> but has been unresponsive. Just recently again (February 10), he has uploaded a new slew of copyrighted images, using the <i>magazine cover fair use</i> tag which does not apply to the images as they are web sourced from the parent website. He has been warned before and seems unresponsive and doesn't seem like he's changing his ways anytime soon. I'll just leave the resolution to you guys.

<dd>As it is not just text (and not simply naive, as he has been told to stop), I think we have an instance of an increasingly common problem: Copyright-infringing users who create numerous articles. We cannot verify all of them as copyright infringements, and it is a tremendous waste of time for someone to go through verifying them anyway, yet most of them are and if any copyright holder were to find one of the copied articles it would be an odd and unaccepted response that we knew about the user's copyright infringement but did not remove his additions to Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 15:31, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

He or she has stopped, but suddenly people hitherto uninvolved have popped up to do the same (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Persianate_society&amp;diff=107086448&amp;oldid=107074382" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Persianate_society&amp;diff=107086448&amp;oldid=107074382" rel="nofollow">this diff</a> for the latest).

<p>My question is this: these reverts seem to me to be disruptive at best (they're clearly organised by Surena by e-mail), but are they sufficiently vandalistic to mean that reverting them is 3RR-protected? If it isn't, and I have to leave it, I'm inclined to let the thing go altogether and let it stay in the hopeless mess that it is now.

<dd>According to me, banning the user is not going to achieve anything. He is shameless enough to run the gauntlet and edit anonymously, create sock/meatpuppets and other ways of bypassing bans. He appears to be playing to a gallery, though I am not sure which one, since many Marathi people have rejected his/their fanaticism as well.</dd>

<dd>The <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> article (his/their favourite hunting grounds) is in a pretty stable/credible state right now (apart from our friend's edits), so I think just locking down the article for a few months would solve the problem much more effectively.

<p>The <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capella_University_39f8.html" title="Capella University">Capella University</a> article has been the subject of ongoing vandalism by anonymous users (Capella University employees) in the past with these users resorting to name-calling and other tactics. As a result, the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capella_University_39f8.html" title="Capella University">Capella University</a> article had been locked. No sooner had it been unlocked, when the vandalism began again - this time by another new anonymous user (the IP traces back to Minnesota, home of Capella University). It might be best to ask for either administrative support from Wikipedia, or arbitration in order to prevent another heated revert war. Shac1 02:18, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

I only had a quick look, but this looks like a content dispute rather than vandalism. You say the IP is spamming/vandalising while the IP says that you are only citing negative material from an article which includes positive material and that they are trying to even up the negative/positive quotes. The IP and you, User:Shac1, need to take this to the talk page, or, as you've already been advised, try an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a>. <b>Sarah</b> 05:31, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your post; however, if you take a look at the edit history that I've just posted on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Capella_University" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Capella_University" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>, you'll see that the individual posting from 75.134.132.66 also appears to be 68.117.38.94 (who was recently blocked from Wikipedia), and Pizzaman6233 (who has also received many warnings). You will also note that the charge that only I am the one reversing the vandalism is completely unfounded (again, I've cited seven others (there may be more) who have also reversed the vandalism: all seven of these users may be found on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Capella_University" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Capella_University" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>, ). Of course, these matters don't include the unfounded and ongoing personal attacks being made against me - some of which were recently deleted by Wikipedia administrators. The charges that I'm removing positive posts/edits is also not true. For example, the anonymous user posted listed a series of scholarships provided by Capella University. I've also noted the phenomenal growth of the school. Finally, in regard to spamming, the anonymous user has previously posted a long list of twelve different "articles." As is noted on the talk page (under the RfC I've created), all twelve of these so-called "articles" are literally press releases by Capella University. This fact is easily verified by examining them. As the anonymous user (User:68.117.38.94, User:75.134.132.66, and User:Pizzaman6233 consistently demands it's either his way or no way, I believe it would be best for the article to remain locked.

<dd>Yes i saw that it had survived its afd (with a <b>no consensus</b>) and that's is why i didnt prod it.

<p>The editors of the main <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interlingua.html" title="Interlingua">Interlingua</a> have had to contend with sneaky vandalism for a very long time. Most often, this takes the form of plausible misinformation or deletions, but there is a lot of variation. One vandal even replaced an external link with one that read "demon" and apparently contained a virus. I had to replace my hard drive after I clicked on the link.</p>
<p>The last bout of sneaky vandalism has culminated in a spate of tags and signs left by someone who was frustrated that his misinformation had been reverted. Could I get someone to remove the tags and signs? I'm afraid that, if I do it, the result will be an edit war or retaliation. Since he's an administrator, I could also be blocked.</p>
<p>This person, <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDissident_e7c0.html" title="User:Dissident">User:Dissident</a>, describes himself as a bureaucrat on the Interlingua Wikipedia. This claim has turned out to be true; there is evidence that he uses the status as a cover. Another person left a sign on top of the article to amplify the ones that were already there. He professes an interest in Interlingua, again, probably as a cover since his behavior suggests opposition.</p>
<p>At this point, most of the constructive editors have given up and stopped contributing. Only the vandals are left, and they are continuing to vandalize the article. I am very open to suggestions on how to respond to this sneaky vandalism, or help with reverting it when it occurs.</p>

<dd>The person who agrees supports a different auxiliary language, <a href="../../../i/d/o/Ido.html" title="Ido">Ido</a>, and authored the article on it, so it's understandable that he agrees.

It is true that the third person, who agrees in part, is not associated with another language, but notice that he begins by agreeing and then refocuses the discussion on the criticisms section of the article.</dd>

<dd>On discussing the matter, it takes a special skill to reach agreement across auxiliary languages, and I'm not all that good at it. The talk page has been sort of off-limits except to supporters of other languages. Interlingua supporters have been commenting mostly in the edit summaries, if they haven't stopped editing entirely. I feel like stopping too, but if the article is left alone, it can degenerate pretty quickly.</dd>

<p>Sneaky vandalism is tough, especially on a specialized topic. The challenge is to document it and cite it and explain it for the rest of us. See my investigation at <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_Complex_vandalism_at_Joan_of_Arc_3c00.html" title="User:Durova/Complex vandalism at Joan of Arc">User:Durova/Complex vandalism at Joan of Arc</a>. Maybe that will set you on a path where you can spell this out for nonspecialists. The burden's on you to substantiate the accusation. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 04:19, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm glad to hear from someone who has experience with this issue. Sneaky vandalism is especially difficult for Interlingua because its underlying theory and development procedures are complex.

<p>Meatpuppetry looks more probable within the pro NLP group. There are single or virtually single use accounts eg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Fainites" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Fainites" rel="nofollow">[59]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.178.176.153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.178.176.153" rel="nofollow">[60]</a> using similar arguments and language. They are definitely ignoring my voice and some have stated they deliberately intend to. I am also complying with the relevant sockpuppetry guidelines in this regard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry#Advertising_and_soliciting_meatpuppets" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry#Advertising_and_soliciting_meatpuppets" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding the constant allegations of sockpuppetry. I understand that neutral administrators can block sockpuppets at their own discretion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>. If any neutral administrator considers me to be contravening sockpuppetry regulations then feel free to block me. Similarly if any neutral administrator considers me to be trolling please take the appropriate action or notify me here or on my talkpage. Also if any neutral editor feels that I am dong anything that is not constructive – again feel free to post here or on my talkpage.</p>
<p>Pro NLP editors seem to include views – yet present them in a selective and often non-sequitur order in order to negate criticism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=103787585&amp;oldid=103776086" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=103787585&amp;oldid=103776086" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>. Thus they tend to edit defensively as has been identified in the Cleanuptaskforce assessment. The pro NLP arguments have been presented using OR and are certainly unencyclopedic. Critical views are being suppressed from the lead and the main body of the article. I have had a look at the other subsidiary NLP articles and they follow the same pattern. They also tend to spread critical comments around which makes the article look even more like an argument or debate and less encyclopedic. There seems to me to be a strong reluctance to make straight reports of NLP. They are still reluctant to remove debate or argumentative edits from the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=105025704&amp;oldid=105007809" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=105025704&amp;oldid=105007809" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>. As shown above they are also persistent in suppressing the critical science point of view <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104301653&amp;oldid=104299778" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104301653&amp;oldid=104299778" rel="nofollow">[65]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=106519550&amp;oldid=106497018" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=106519550&amp;oldid=106497018" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>. There is a strong tendency for pro NLP editors to present research speculation as conclusion (selective editing) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=103787585&amp;oldid=103776086" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=103787585&amp;oldid=103776086" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the currently dismissive and uncivil actions of the pro NLP group – I would not ban or block them or apply page protection. I would give them another opportunity to make some effort to get along without intervention from outside. I believe that its more constructive (actually necessary) to continue to apply scrutiny and to encourage editors to get along and edit in a more collaborative fashion long term. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 03:13, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello user 203.212.143.167. I'm glad you replied. I believe you havn't quite grasped the reality of the situation. Of the six editors you present above, one is just a single use IP user (74.38.250.5) as is yourself (I'm assuming your present IP is also 58.179.191.108). JBhood is not a regular editor at all and could well be a meatpuppet also. Fainites is a single use account and seems to me to be strongly averse to admin suggestions. Comaze and Doc pato seem to have obvious conflicts of interests. Your edits seem to be the most argumentative and OR in order to suppress criticism. Your edits seem to show that you are calling me a sockpuppet and a troll in order that the article is prevented from being presented "in a balanced manner and that each is summarized as if by its proponents to their best ability.”<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial" rel="nofollow">[80]</a>.</dd>

<dd>Even though you seem to be persistently and quite incivilly suppressing information in order to promote NLP, I am doing my best to collaborate both here and on the NLP talkpage in the spirit of Wikipedia in order to get on with editors of various worldviews. I see no problem at all with pro NLP argument as long as it is sourced and "summarized as if by its proponents to their best ability" as per NPOV policies. You and other editors on the NLP article really do seem to have a problem with summarizing the critical science views towards NLP though. I encourage you to collaborate with myself and any other constructive editor in presenting the article according to NPOV policies. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 09:17, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I am not a meatpuppet. I came across the HeadleyDown issue through random surfing, and have followed the whole dismal saga on and off since then. AlanBarnet is HeadleyDown. That in itself would merit a block, although on the other hand the other editors' current "ignore and revert" approach might produce more desirable results in the long run. Not really for me to say, since I am not interested in editing the NLP article, but it would make sense to either block AlanBarnet or to ignore him on this noticeboard just as on the other pages. <a href="../../../j/b/h/User%7EJbhood_89a5.html" title="User:Jbhood">Jbhood</a> 10:33, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes Ryulong. Thanks for the reply. The pro NLP group seem to be persistently suppressing critical science views on NLP, being uncivil, refusing mediation or arbitration, and displaying meatpuppetting/COI characteristics - and though presenting diffs here is preventing total OR - there still seems to be a pressing need for the pro NLP group to be somehow encouraged into civil acceptance of editors such as myself in order that the critical science views be presented properly without domination， WP:OWN，　or suppression. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 10:08, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ryulong, none of this requires administrative attention (save for a sockblock on AlanBarnet/ HeadleyDown), nor does it get any.

<dd>Yep. I do want to apologize if it seems like I "dropped the ball". Some of the NLP had brought this to my attention awhile back but I had SUCH a bad experience as a mentor that I just didn't want to get involved. And I know that the NLP editors understand that as they haven't really been a bother at all. But still. I should've let another admin know sooner. So. I apologize if this lasted longer than it should have. And yes.

<dd>Its quite a relief you got round to blocking me from the NLP article. I thought you were slipping after I made myself so obvious both here and on the article. Rules are to be followed after all. Well, I understand the reluctance of some admin to block me was due to the hope for someone to civilly put long term COI information suppressors in their place. Not an easy task though. A single editor such as myself doesn't stand a chance against such a group.

I may post on the ANI again in future. If I appear on the NLP articles again I'll make myself just as obvious in discussion style and IP range.

<dd>I may also appeal against my block but only if it helps make other admin usefully aware of the long term problem of critical information suppressors such as FT2 on <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoophilia.html" title="Zoophilia">Zoophilia</a> and NLP (COI issues), Comaze (.com) and co on NLP related articles and so on.

<dd>It further seems that you have convinced most independent people of this - people who have read your rants, and attacks, and protestations, and are unconvinced... Woohookitty, Mackensen, Ryulong, David Gerard, and several sets of ArbCom members in multiple cases.

<dd>As an alternate proposal, since the various editors involved aren't completely worthless, perhaps a community ban <i>from the article in question</i> may be a better alternative before just banishing them altogether?

<p>Based on the many, many previous incidents that resulted in singularly useless warnings and 24-hour blocks that were waited out, I am concerned that any action of the nature contemplated will only be ignored once again. I will be engaged in a perfectly civil discussion with some other editor, such as Calton on the Peter Roskam Talk page. BB and/or FAAFA will intervene, challenge every keystroke I make, and claim that it's all for the good of Wikipedia and that I'm being naughty, <b><font color="red">as is occurring right now.</font></b> I will complain here and all three of us will be banned, <b><font color="blue">even though I have done absolutely nothing wrong.</font></b> What assurance do I have that this will not happen? <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeanHinnen_6a4b.html" title="User:DeanHinnen">Dino</a> 16:12, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Dino, could you advise how you think this could be resolved? If blocks and warnings don't get anywhere, and you doubt this proposal is going to solve the problem, should the next stage be ArbCom?

Arguing over content with moments of incivility is one thing and it merits warnings and 24-hour blocks.

<p>I remember my first hour here. It was an interesting experience. The moment one administrator got the (later proven false) idea in his head that I was a sockpuppet, I was permanently blocked. The moment the same administrator got the (later proven false) idea in his head that Carolyn Doran, the Chief Operating Officer of the Wikimedia Foundation, was impersonating a WMF employee she was permanently blocked.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>No discussion. No questions asked. Absolutely zero hesitation. It was as though the two of us had decided to take a little stroll on the beach in Normandy on June 6, 1944.</p>

<dd>You already did which?

<dd>Well the reason for moving the boxes is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_September_2#Wikipedian_rugby_fans" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_September_2#Wikipedian_rugby_fans" rel="nofollow">here</a> but the question Iam asking is why didnt he solve the problem be4 migrating the userboxes and when I said that i had already written to him is that I was implying that I have already posted a messsage on the user in question and I thought there might be something else in regards of Botfailure which might have led to the problem of the unnecessary userbox migration is why I posted a comment <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">here</a> to see if there are any other wikiusers facing a similar bot malfunction problem..thanx--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECometstyles_5139.html" title="User:Cometstyles">Cometstyles</a> 13:50, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm somewhat confused then. Which problem are you talking about? Your question here is why were they moved? You don't seem to be suggesting the bot is not functioning as designed, more you don't like what it is doing. The question you asked seems to have been answered - there has been an ongoing task to move non-encyclopedic userboxes out of the main spaces into userspace, I'm not sure what deletion/merging of the categories has to do with this.</dd>
<dd>Looking closer the bot isn't updating userspace to reflect those moves, I've updated your page and I can see it did so for one it moved a few days ago. Since the bot isn't currently running there is nothing further to be done, we just need to wait and find out if it should be updating userspace and if it is, why it isn't. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 13:56, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>OK, the response here is that it is supposed to update the transclusions, but looks like it does it as a separate task. Wait a little longer and it should all come good. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 14:10, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Correct. (for the record) It's a two step procedure, first it migrates a bunch of userboxes, then it updates the transclusions. This is to avoid having to make an edit on someone's userpage for each box migrated, instead of fixing many at once. —<span style="color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">M<small>ETS</small>501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 14:27, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It might be a bit early for an indef community ban of Hkelkar, since TerryJ-Ho and BhaiSaab were also both caught sockpuppeting this week. (More precisely, it may be too early to <i>single out</i> Hkelkar for an indef ban.) Certainly the sock should be indef banned and all three one-year blocks should be reset.

<dd>I endorse this block. Despite some positive contributions, this user has overall become a disruptive influence on a wide array of article.

<dd>That is unacceptable and a complete abuse of admin powers- I contatced various people about several AFDs (none of which I had started) to increase the level of debate. I also contatced the main contributors to the debates from both sides. This is allowed per the guidlines on <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECANVAS_b8fe.html" title="WP:CANVAS">WP:CANVAS</a>.</dd>
<dd>As for the article, <a href="../../../%C3%B3/g/l/%C3%93glaigh_na_h%C3%89ireann_%28CIRA_splinter_group%29_b5f9.html" title="Óglaigh na hÉireann (CIRA splinter group)">Óglaigh na hÉireann (CIRA splinter group)</a>, this is clearly non notable (only claim to fame is an unsourced post office hold up). Your decision to speedy keep is again against the guidlines, and your claim that I am being disruptive is uncalled for. I am sure many other people would agree to delete this article, but now we will never know unless someone else calls for it to be deleted. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 17:28, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there anything that either I or an admin can do about continuous soapboxing? I and another editor have repetitively pointed out that WP is not a soapbox in this one particular Talk page, but it continues. The latest rant appears to be some lengthy diatribe about Jewish people<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Asian_fetish&amp;diff=107102779&amp;oldid=107015042" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Asian_fetish&amp;diff=107102779&amp;oldid=107015042" rel="nofollow">[96]</a>.

<dd>Yes, the article had been subjected to heavy vandalism; however, since the page had been fully protected for three months, it was quite possible that the vandal might have lost interest. <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>'s admonition "do not unprotect until mid-2007" does not act to prevent another administrator from unprotecting the page, since <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a> has no greater powers than any other administrator. While <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_of_Hearts_dcbc.html" title="User:King of Hearts">King of Hearts</a> did not consult <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a> prior to reducing the page to semi-protection, <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wikipedia%7EWheel_war_ce1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wheel war">Wikipedia:Wheel_war</a> states that "Undoing another admin's action once is not considered a wheel war". There is no excuse for repeating a disputed administrative action, unless the administrative action being reversed is obvious vandalism (deletion of the main page, for example). If <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a> disagreed with the good-faith unprotection of this article by <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_of_Hearts_dcbc.html" title="User:King of Hearts">King of Hearts</a>, he should have discussed the issue with <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_of_Hearts_dcbc.html" title="User:King of Hearts">King of Hearts</a> and/or requested that another administrator reprotect the article. Moreover, since I didn't claim that <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>'s policy violation was conducted in bad faith, claims that I am somehow violating <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> are without merit. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 18:18, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not a wheel war, and it <b>most certainly</b> did not require immediate posting to AN/I. A little communication goes a hell of a long way, and posting here without even attempting to discuss it with Centrx is in my opinion, a very clear lack of assuming good faith. (I don't agree with near-permanent full protection, but that is irrelevant to me at this point.

<p>I have been mediating as the MedCab mediator on the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">Surrealism</a> article. There was some dispute over the creation of links and there seems to be a monumental discussion over the actual meaning etc. of Surrealism on the talk page. Whilst I have tried to remain neutral, it has reached the point that mediation can no longer continue because one user, <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> has created an apparent army of sockpuppets to push the same point, despite the sockpuppeteer agreeing to a previous MedCab consensus that was put in place. No comments have been made on the Sockpuppetry request page and the 10 day limit is almost over. Ordinarily I would just leave this to a SSP outcome but all the while more and more sockpuppets appear. It is blatantly obvious that they are all one and the same user; they have identical speech and indeed formatting patterns (e.g placing certain words in capitals) and all want the same thing. Indeed, it has been put forward by one user that they are all known alias of the same person from other web-communities. I didn't feel a RfCU was required as there doesn't seem to be any real ambiguity over the identity of the person; they have seemingly admitted to being one and the same person at one stage. However, some of the later users in the list I am a little unsure about but couldn't find the right code to submit this under at RfCU. This user continues to disrupt articles and spam Wikipedia, and as such I would ask an admin to have a look, and if necessary, intervene. Note: Some of the later users are not involved directly in the current dispute, but a look at the talk page will show an extremely similar pattern of behaviour. Not sure if I should have sent these to a Checkuser.</p>

<li>If the "sockpuppets" are disrupting a valid <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">Dispute Resolution attempt</a> then a block may be necessary to end the disruptions. An RFCU may not be appropriate if sock puppetry can be proven using other methods. E.g. editing styles, contrib history, and likely spa. I was unable to find an appropriate code, however, using other methods to prove likely sock puppetry, and in the case of disruption, blocking will not require the technical evidence RFCU can provide.

<p>Thank you, again, Arritt, Durova, et al -- but here's Wikipedia behavior policy in a nutshell: even idiots deserve politeness. Wikipedia policy does <i>not</i> allow you not to be nice with a guy just because he's a jerk. Making use of such policy, I'll be nice enough to tell you that you're fundamentally wrong with regard to NOR. It does <i>not</i> apply to the way sources are chosen, and no one in a talk page can stop an editor from arguing for (or against) a source on the grounds that he's using OR to check that source. The <i>only</i> place where OR is forbidden is in the Wikipedia articles -- period. You can't <i>write</i> your own research into the article: that's the one and only limitation. Outside of the words written into the article, you're allowed to use OR for <i>whatever</i> purpose, including source choice.</p>
<p>Your failure to understand that elementary issue shows that the Wikipedia Policy pages are a large amount of beautiful words that are not actually grasped by the users, who wield NOR as a kill-it-all weapon they take pleasure in using against others, trigger-happy fashion, instead of using it with judgment. But then, if admins do not understand the rules, what can one expect from rank-and-file users.</p>
<p>One final word for Bbatsell. Your claim that "If I had seen just that comment out of context, I would agree, but looking over the talk page shows the reasons for such wording" is most telling. All my comments in that page are well-reasoned and polite. What you don't like is what you think are my ideas. The various ad-hominems I've gotten in this page also go in the same direction.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is young. Hopefully, in the future a way will be found to deal with these distortions. --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 20:42, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

You're justifying and "understanding" what is clearly uncivil behavior, and you're warning and admonishing me for daring to challenge a nonexistent consensus (you haven't even grasped what this word means), perhaps forgetting that Wikipedia <i>requires</i> us to swim against the current if we believe it's the right thing to do -- IOW, to be bold. I'm confident Wikipedia will improve over time, and this kind of childish behavior will become rarer.--<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 23:24, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As have you. Don't play wikilawyer unless you're in the clear. We really shouldn't be arguing here. Adding the tags does not create the dispute, either. Let me get to the point. Tell me what is wrong with the article. Specifically. Go to the talk page, outline your problems, cite sentences, note errors, the whole shebang. Just knock it off with the tag pestering. Do me and anyone else who might be paying attention a favor and tell us why you're so damn eager to add these tags instead of spending two minutes to actually fix something. Your behavior is incredibly frustrating, because the few times you actually do this you don't even listen to the people telling you why you're misguided on the particular issue. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 09:41, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Someguy0830 isn't the only person that's had his toes stepped on, intentionally or not. MsHyde has come into disputes with a number of editors. She's posted many a time to various help and policy pages; see her contrib list. She's also become a lightning rod on her talk page. I'm not saying all this as an attack though I can certainly understand if it's perceived as such. I just wish MsHyde would ease a little more gently into Wikipedia; I don't think I'm alone in that sentiment. Read the comments others have left for her and judge for yourself.

<dd>Your comment makes it difficult to help you. I'm digging through the diffs on the page, from the first example listed above as 'original version'.I have seen NUMEROUS tags applied by Ms. Hyde. Although some, like the tagging of the audio file, seem to have produced consensus results, others seem only to be about antagonizing others. I note that SomeGuy repeatedly asked you to explain yourself, to which your reply was at least once 'there is a dispute'. That's not helpful to anyone in making clear your objections. I noted that SomeGuy, by working back and forth across edits with OTHER editors, found what I see as an excellent, NPOV means of distinguishing between mainstream scientific experiments and those conducted by 'paranormalists'. I think he chose <i>"Scientific experiments did not find any anomalies that fulfill the characteristics of EVP. Informal experiments, on the other hand, recorded anomalies which, upon analysis and listening tests, seemed to the experimenter to"</i>. This seemed excellent to me, and then we get into the issue of the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>, which is separate and distinct, and easily dealt with. Such COI on a problematic page should result in that editor (Tom Butler) being asked to stay away from COI pages, and then if needed, enforced by a brief block for the editor to engage in policy studies. It is regretable that later, someone esle insisted on a change in the wording, and then SomeGuy removed a big section, resulting in a LESS clear version.</dd>
<dd>I do note that in diffs such as this:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_voice_phenomenon&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106979440" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_voice_phenomenon&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106979440" rel="nofollow">[101]</a>, MS.Hyde's claims of NPOV seem to be LESS NPOV. 'An Audio Sample' is far more clinical than 'sounds', FOR THIS TOPIC. Because EVP is ABOUT the understanding, veracity, and nature of a certain set of audio phenomena, Editors should work carefully with descriptions of sound. Were things in this article regularly referred to as 'the voices', many editors would justifiably argue.</dd>
<dd>In summary, there is some definite conflict here. Neither side is innocent, but I do see more community relations and team and consensus building from Someguy. Ms. Hyde, meanwhile, seems fairly intent on seeing her viewpoint pushed. Both need to work on their patience, but Ms. Hyde would do well to get her incivility under wraps. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 04:54, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Edit/revert wars have proven inadequate for bringing this article to compliance. Given the history of this article and the current choreographed effort of POV pushing by EVP proponents, the best course of action may be arbitration. --- LuckyLouie 20:49, 9 February 2007 (UTC)"</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not simply my perception that there is a POV pushing problem at this article from EVP proponents, it is the perception of a longstanding editor. It also appears that another longstanding editor who has tried to counter EVP POV, ScienceApologist, is on break, which probably created a sort of vacuum. Someguy has continued to revert two editors--me and Milo H. Minderbinder--today. The issue of COI is <i>not</i> separate and distinct, as Someguy emails with Butler, and appears to agree with Butler that stating the scientific point of view is "disparaging" to EVP proponents. Removing POV tags on the grounds that the dispute wasn't stated is patently ridiculous, as Someguy followed me to OR and the science desk and was well aware of the terms of the dispute. And no, "informal experiments" is not NPOV, and it is a violation of WP:FRINGE, as I have stated on the talkpage. If you look through the history of the artcile, something I have now done, the same POV issues about the same wording have come up before. Violating 3RR to remove dispute tags about issues which have already been contested seems like bad faith. (ScienceApologist went on break, the article slunk into a POV version, I happened by and raised objections which had already been raised. Someguy fought to keep the objections from being raised and attacked me on personal grounds "you are being childish" "you tag too much" when he was well aware that that there had already been objections to precisely what I objected to.) There is a longstanding POV problem at this article, and it should probably go to Arbcom if LuckyLouie thinks so. In the meantime, attacking me personally or violating 3RR to remove dispute tags will not mask the longstanding POV problems, and is not helpful. In addition, since Someguy continues to "own" the article, and reverts any edits made by me or Milo H. Minderbinder, I find it particularly unhelpful that no one has addressed the 3RR complaint.-<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMsHyde_99ac.html" title="User:MsHyde">MsHyde</a> 05:34, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, you are woefully mistaken. I <i>may have</i> reverted Milo once, and unintentionally at that. I've only reverted you intentionally. As Thuran points out, I've been trying to get it fixed. You have not. Second, I'm not putting up with this e-mail nonsense. E-mails with Butler? Who are you to say I've been e-mailing anyone? Do you have proof, or are you throwing accusations about randomly? I won't stand for that.

<dd>Yes, it is Martinphi who says on the talkpage he has emailed Butler, not you. (But note your defensiveness, and the extremely hostile attitiude, overreaction, etc, which I have found to be typical of you). You do appear to second Butler's POV, and you have not objected to his editing, in spite of his COI, or the threat he made to Wikipedia. You <i>have</i> reverted Milo, and he added your reverts to the 3RR report I made, and wants to take the case to Arbcom. He advised me to seek more help on several policy boards. Both Milo and I gave up aditing the article today after you reverted our edits. Driving away anyone who disagrees with you and then making minor concessions after they say they are going to Arbcom does not resolve the problem, especially considering the great lengths anyone had to go to to get you to even acknowledge there was a dispute (a dispute you were already aware existed). Your reverting and owning of the article is a big problem, in my view. And since there is such an ongoing problem with EVP POV pushing at this article, according to longterm editors, it should probably go to Arbcom.-<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMsHyde_99ac.html" title="User:MsHyde">MsHyde</a> 06:08, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If I said you were hired by scientists to discredit Wikipedia articles, wouldn't you be annoyed? Don't be surprised when I take offense to your statements. I have tried to be helpful about this thing. I've tried to incorporate the suggestions of those on the talk page to appease POV concerns. None of this seems to come to your attention. I no longer care what you think of my motivations, nor do I plan on discussing yours any further. Reign in your accusations and do something productive. If you think that's arbcom, then quit threatening it and do it. I'm out of patience in this regard.

<dd>No, I would say that what you did was try to bully and personally attack me to keep me from rasing objections that had <i>already been raised,</i> while ScienceApologist was gone and the article had descended into a very POV state. You have been extremely hostile to me, in my view, and I think purposely so. I think you thought by being very aggressive, I would stop objecting and the article could stay POV. I am waiting for the longterm editors to get notice about Arbcom and file, also more help. From what I can see in the talk archives and the page history, this <i>is</i> a longterm problem. There's a huge recurring POV imbalance, aggressive EVP POV pushing, and Butler not only comes back again and again, but he says things like "I am not going to go away" and makes threats.-<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMsHyde_99ac.html" title="User:MsHyde">MsHyde</a> 06:41, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Denial of actions is NOT an admission of guilt, Ms. Hyde. You are trying, above, to imply that because someguy took umbrage with your unfounded, and incorrect, allegations of emailing Butler, then he probably SI guilty. That sort of BS'ing doesn't work on most of the editors and admins that regularly review AN/I, and it's distinctly <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">uncivil</a> of you. As for Arbcom, let it go there. I'm more displeased with your hostilities than I am with any POV that SomeGuy may be pushing, because 3RR aside, he seems at least more communicative than you do about things.

<dd>ThuranX, your first reference is to a complaint made by recent arrival to the scene (MsHyde)—just after we had arrived at agreement about the entry. She immediately got into an editing war with Someguy0830, a person who had been working very hard to build a consensus. That first complaint seems to be mostly about MsHyde.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Those other two references are pretty specific to me but please not that they come from two people very new to the EVP discussion, and one who wants to prove I am delusional because of Spiritualism. All three are apparently determined to “win” at any cost. It is that tactic that traps me into becoming aggressive. That is my short coming, but since Wikipedia offers me no solution, and I am not going to simply smile and let misinformation about my field of study be disseminated under the guise of a trusted encyclopedia, what alternative do I have.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In my defense, when I came to the EVP entry, there were many statements that were not factually correct, and there was a personal attack on my wife and me, and directly at the AA-EVP. Clearly, left to itself, Wikipedia is incapable of a balanced point of view in regard to EVP. At the same time, Wikipedia is ranked 3rd in Goodle for an “EVP” search. There are at least three other web sites that have copies of the version I decided needed to be fixed. Since it poses itself as an encyclopedia, Wikipedia has a responsibility to be both factual and balanced.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>The last bone of contention over EVP was the terminology used to describe both the skeptical view and the concluding remarks. “Skeptic” was used for a long time before MsHyde and Proponent for the other view. For a while, such words as “hypotheses” and “theory” were used and I was fine with all of those. MsHyde came in and changed “Skeptic” to “Science, and made the concluding remarks look like science had passed judgment on EVP and found it to be baseless fantasy. In fact, science has no looked at EVP and the statement and use of “Science” instead of “Skeptical” shifts the point of view way over to the skeptical side for the whole document. How does “Experiments performed by scientists have found no evidence of EVP” Sound to you? It states simply that MacRae is not a scientist an danything he said is unsubstantiated by “real” scientists.” It has not been established that’s “cientists have found no evidence of EVP” The reference is for Baruss, who is a psychologist.</dd>

<dd>At this moment, LuckyLouie has posted, “Being an AA-EVP member and fellow Spiritualist, MacRae does not appear to be Tom's competition, but rather a fellow proponent of EVP and life after death (or "the survival hypothesis" as they term it). Furthermore, I have nothing against MacRae or Spiritualists, but since only those with strong beliefs seem to get any positive experimental results, we must be careful not to represent such work as "science" when it really is more an ewxample of "pathological science", i.e. cases where there is no dishonesty involved, but where people are tricked into false results by a lack of understanding about what human beings can do to themselves in the way of being led astray by subjective effects, wishful thinking or threshold interactions. --- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyLouie_ff26.html" title="User:LuckyLouie">LuckyLouie</a> 19:32, 11 February 2007 (UTC)” First, I do not think MacRae is a Spiritualist, I doubt that Lucky knows for sure and it has nothing to do with the subject. Lucky has repeatedly tried to discount EVP because of the involvement of Spiritualism. There is no evidential foundation for his innuendoes, it is prejudicial and a deliberate attempt to discount EVP without evidence.</dd>

<dd>The tactic taken by the Wikipedia Skeptic is to out stubborn the opposition. It is the skeptics who have mounted an organized effort to push a viewpoint. Did you notice the call to arms at the top of the page? “This article is being improved by WikiProject Rational Skepticism. Wikiproject Rational Skepticism seeks to improve the quality of articles dealing with science, pseudosciences and skepticism. Please feel free to help us improve this page.”</dd>

<dd>Of course I am frustrated. And yes, I have threatened to take extra action. Since we do not have the sponsorship of Wikipedia, I have begun a “Concerns with Wikipedia” campaign. As long as misinformation is being distributed to kids using the internet for homework, I feel a social obligation to make people at least examine how information is collected and edited. All and all, I am not the problem here. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Butler_316c.html" title="User:Tom Butler">Tom Butler</a> 23:55, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, the positions you espouse here in defense of your view of EVP are EXACTLY why <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> exists and is enforced. Citing <a href="../../../i/g/n/WP%7EIGNORE_187e.html" title="WP:IGNORE">WP:IGNORE</a> to excuse <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> isn't wikipolicy. IGNORE is a corollary of <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a>, but if you are confronted with specific policy (in your case <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">COI</a>), then you should adhere to the proper policy, not re-excuse it via IGNORE. That multiple editors have cited COI indicates you DO have a COI, and should desist from EVP and EVP-related articles. Further, your <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> Violation below is egregious, and given your apparent familiarity with Wiki-Policy, you knew that could set you up for a block.

<dd>Per the user's aove admission of an Anti-Wikipedia campaign as result of his 'field of study' being, in his view, maligned by wikipedia to the detriment of students worldwide, I'd say yes, actually.
