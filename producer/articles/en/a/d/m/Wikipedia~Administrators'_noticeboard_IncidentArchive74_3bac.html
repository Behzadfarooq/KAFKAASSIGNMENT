<p>I don't know why this is, but there is a vandal who I have attempted to block completely, yet they seem to still be able to edit quite often. If you look at <a href="../../../o/d/i/User_talk%7EOdin_of_Valhalla_5921.html" title="User talk:Odin of Valhalla">User talk:Odin of Valhalla</a>, it lists all of the IPs this user uses, all of which have indefinite blocks on them at this point. And yet, even today the user seems to have been able to go through and vandalize the same page again (they insist on inserting erroneous and out of date information into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_with_nuclear_weapons.html" title="List of countries with nuclear weapons">List of countries with nuclear weapons</a>, despite having been talked to about this for a number of weeks now and given about a thousand warnings). What gives? Am I doing something wrong here with the blocking? Why are they are able to still edit pages? --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 18:52, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yeah, I've converted most of those IP blocks to a month, I hadn't realized that they shouldn't be blocked indef but I can see why. So, is the answer here to my general question: I should "unblock" the other blocks and then "re-block" with the one I really want? --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 19:58, 11 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You can't block a range of IP addresses for a month as per policy because of the collateral damage. 24 hours please. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 20:01, 11 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It isn't a range, it is a set of a few addresses this one fellow seems to use, and nobody else seems to use. Two of them in particular seem to be his primary IP and it seems relatively fixed (at least one is a public terminal at a library, a few of the others are probably things of this nature). The fellow returns every day to vandalize and does little else, and I think the IPs that look static could easily be justified as blocked for over 24 hours, though I'm happy with reducing the blocks in the other cases (though again without any evidence of collateral damage I'm hard pressed to see it as a bigger problem than a repeat vandalizer, but I digress). In any event, my main question is still unanswered about the technical nature of it, not the policy of it. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 20:14, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>The policy on IP blocks is clear - I am really politely asking you to stick to it - or I will have no choice to revert you. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 17:19, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't understand the tech aspect in this instance either: there was an expired (24 hr) block from 4 Feb, then several indef/1 month blocks on 10/11 Feb starting at 01:20 on 10 Feb. No unblocking or shorter blocks logged until 19:10 on 11 Feb, yet a bunch of contributions from the IP in the intervening period.

<p><a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">User:Wgfinley</a> is going around making snap decisions on what constitutes fair use himself and removing and deleting images outright that he disagrees with, even ones that he unsuccessfully put through IFD and were kept because they did meet fair use guidelines. See <a href="../../../w/g/f/User_talk%7EWgfinley_1460.html" title="User talk:Wgfinley">User talk:Wgfinley</a> for some discussion, where a number of users inclusing an admin on the IFD project all tried to talk to him without success. He is ingoring comments from people trying to explain the concept to him, treating anyone questioning his actions as "uncivil" behavior" and refusing to undo his deletions. Can we please get this person to stop playing cowboy and enforcing his own ideas of rules on the project?</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are seeing more and more cases where admins are just doing whatever the heck they want because they want to and not following any policy or listening to otehr editors or admins... It'd be nice if other admins and ArbCom members would actually stand up and show that this behavior is wrong and will not be tolerated. This is becoming more and more like the Wild West here, with people who are in the worst position to be making decisions going ahead and doing them and daring everyone else to do anything about it. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 18:25, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately images can't be undeleted, which makes this sort of behaviour even more unacceptable. It certainly seems clear that Wgfinley has drifted into behaviour outside his remit as an admin. I've left him a message pointing this out, and asking him to put images through the appropriate channels in future. We're all human, and can all act over-hastily on occasion, but should try not to make a habit of it, as the discussions on his Talk page indicate that he is.</dd>

<dd><i>edit-conflict</i> It looks like one of our articles about a porn star was using a DVD cover as an illustration of her, rather than to identify the film in question. We probably shouldn't do that. We certainly shouldn't vote on <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a> to allow that. As far as I can tell, the only interesting things here are why <a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">User:Wgfinley</a> deleted this image and not the thousands of other images used in precisely the same wrong way, and why anyone is making a fuss about the deletion of an image of a DVD cover, which is surely replacable if we ever have a legitimate use of it. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 19:22, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's also important to note that one set of complaints about the deletions is plainly inappropriate. This set of disputed deletions (example at Image_talk:Adele_Stevens.jpg) required the insertion of linkspam -- not simply a copyright credit -- as a condition for image use, and essentially required Wikipedia to accept advertising links. It's hard to see how any responsible editor would not have deleted all such images on sight, given the copyright holder's position. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 19:30, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm perfectly happy that removal of fair-use images from articles where they're not used fairly is good parctice. I'm also happy that sometimes images are claimed to be fair use when they're not. I'm not happy about three points, though.</p>
<ol>
<li>David Gerard seems to be saying that, because in some of the cases discussed on Wgfinley's Talk page he was in the right, therefore he's beyond criticism, full stop. That's such an obvious logical fallacy that I can't believe that he meant it, but I'm unsure what he <i>did</i> mean.</li>
<li>The existence of the image on Wikipedia can't be fair use or non-fair use in itself, because it's not being used. Fair use applies to the use being made of an image. If I up-load an image in preparation for genuinely fair use in an article, is Wgfinley entitled to leap in before I can go further and delete it on the grounds that it's not fair use yet, because it's not linked to an article?</li>
<li>Kim Bruning has followed my comment at <a href="../../../w/g/f/User_talk%7EWgfinley_1460.html" title="User talk:Wgfinley">User talk:Wgfinley</a> by saying essentially that I'm wrong, and asking to talk privately about the matter because it's "political". OK, ignoring the last bit of characteristic ostentatious cloak and dagger stuff, his reason is that Wikipedia policy is: "if in doubt, zap it". Are we really supposed to accept that any admin can delete an image because of a feeling of doubt, even when a group of other editors have discussed the issue and decided that the image is OK? When did admins gain these god-like powers of discrimination, and why was I left out?

<p>I think we would get a lot further here if some of the inflammatory tones could be avoided, I won't cite chapter and verse, it's pretty obvious and there's major contributor on my user page already. I have explanations on what I did on each of these pages. Why did I delete them out of process? Because the process is broke. IFD is a broken, it's a cesspool of stuff that sits there and gets deleted. If someone has a gripe about their image they post it there and their image is spared because the vast majority of images on IFD have little or no input. That's not a good sign of community support, it's a sign of indifference.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don't know why copyvio isn't a speedy category and it should be. But, I'll admit it, I saw the email on Foundation and I chose to make a stand with those images -- two were as blatant copyvios as they come, had no fair use rationale provided, were link spam and incorrectly tagged several time before Fair Use was the fallback option. The other I was making a point that these images are frequently being abused and, as frequently happens, someone goes to fix the abuse only to get reverted. I removed the image being abused.</p>
<p>The two other images, again, blatant obvious copyvios and should be framed as examples of such -- I have yet to hear any argument here that states these images are not copyvios, just that what I did was out of process. So, what's more important, the process or the fact that copyvios get removed and protect Wikipedia from exposure to litigation? If the answer is that avoiding litigation is more important than great, let's do something about fixing the process. I don't wish to set a precedent that any admin can delete such images on site (although I think two of these are incredibly obvious), I was trying to correct something that's broken. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 08:46, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder if it would be helpful to prominently place a disclaimer like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your contribution to Wikipedia is material under a non-free license, and you claim that it is "fair use", please accept that it may be removed or even permanently deleted at any time for reasons that may appear capricious or nonsensical to you, and that you may never receive a compelling explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we are really moving to a "If in doubt, delete" position on copyright infringements defended by a "fair use" claim, we can't rely either upon a somewhat difficult-to-parse remark on a mailing list very few editors read, nor upon <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, nor upon the diplomatic or consensus-building skills of those people who are volunteering to deal with image policy, nor upon every logged-in user understanding <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>. This issue has been generating an enormous amount of ill-will. We should invest the time in thinking about a way to reduce the level of antagonism. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 21:32, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would generally be in favour of a warning something like that. I think that the problem is that a lot of users don't really understand copyright law. Even experienced users don't always know when something is fair use (fair use is a very tricky concept) or in the public domain. A lot of users don't really understand that Wikipedia is a <i>free</i> encyclopedia, and that copyvios are a major risk to that idea. I think that we definitely need to emphasise more the importance of copyright compliance to the project. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 22:09, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Usefulness includes having existing external links to the page, which this years-old list certainly has.

<dd>I disagree that an unblock without discussion with the blocker is <i>automatically</i> inappropriate. Sure, as a general rule, discussion is good. But it's up to the blocker to make the reasons for the block clear. If people looked for reasons for the block and were unable to find them, unblocking is not unreasonable.

<p>Could someone with a greater understanding of Commons talk to him/them about checking whether fair use content is actually being used here before deleting, and if so, move it over here first.

<dd>Right. If anything, <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShizhao_dfa6.html" title="User:Shizhao">User:Shizhao</a> should receive a warm "thank-you" for taking the bother to clean up on another project by removing the dead links. The idea that a Commons admin should be forced to take responsibility for uploading copyright infringements on en: and assert that they are "fair use" strikes me as absurd. Remember, the uploader is taking personal responsibility for those copyright-infringements and is personally defending them as fair use. No one should have that demanded of them. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 19:56, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If a valid fair use rationale is provided at Commons, it should be copied here. We shouldn't permanently delete usable content just because someone couldn't figure out the right place to put the notice. Also, I have noticed several cases where Shizhao deleted links to images <i>even though</i> a local copy of the image already existed. In other words he didn't bother to check that a legitimate copy of the image already existed on EN before removing the link. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 20:13, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I agree with the implied sentiment that there are other unaddressed concerns regarding the use of commons as an image repository for en:, I do not believe that this particular issue is anything other than the fault of the original uploader of fair-use material to commons. Commons doesn't permit fair use, and it is never the responsibility of the deleting admin to find alternate hosting for material that isn't permitted. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 20:10, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, I, for one, am pleased to hear that. You would, of course, understand if there's a bit of healthy skepticism on the part of the administration here. Over time, we've developed what may be described as unpleasant feelings towards persistent vandals, such as the one you claim to be (you impersonated me, I think, 6 times). In fact, though I choose not to do it myself, it's very likely that you'll find yourself blocked anyway. That being said, I appreciate your decision to cease your vandalism, even if it only because you've come to the conclusion that you cannot be the #1 vandal. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 04:45, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was recently blocked by <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" title="User:Freakofnurture">User:Freakofnurture</a>. Where percentages were in digits ('26') not words ('twenty six'), I changed the <i>percent</i> and <i>per cent</i> to the symbolic form <i>%</i>. Unfortunately <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" title="User:Freakofnurture">User:Freakofnurture</a> blocked me and said I should delete the space character that remained between the digit and the symbol. Eventually he said <i>Please provide some source for the use of a space or I will block you for a greater duration'</i>. You will see other phrases from him/her like "making shit up" and "for fuck's sake"</p>
<p>I am no prude but I the issue was hardly worth swearing about, particularly since I had said that I would use his/her personal preference as he/she wanted. It would have been bad if we both started swearing. I even started a debate at the Manual of style to see if there is a 'correct' answer, but I really think that <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" title="User:Freakofnurture">User:Freakofnurture</a> should have done that.

<dd>Percent has <b>always</b> been spelled out in every encyclopedia article I can recall ever reading; further, a search for "percent" at the Britannica website yields more than 6,000 pages (including <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-81483?query=percent&amp;ct=" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-81483?query=percent&amp;ct=" rel="nofollow">this</a> first result, with numericals) while a search for "%" yields none. In radio news writing, I can say from experience that we always write out "percent" while only numbers ten and under are written out.

<dd>Unless I'm missing something, the response seems uncivil and disproportionate. Was the rationale for the block that Bobblewik was using a bot? (Although it's really beside the point in this case, I don't exactly think the MoS and bobblewik have plucked this idea from thin air: "%" for figures, "percent" or "per cent" for words. That is what I've seen in style guides. As for the space, who is to say? Proper typography would probably put a half-space in front of a percentage sign or a unit, but that is not possible in Wikipedia.) –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke</a> 22:08, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, a firestorm.</p>
<ol>
<li>When I questioned bobblewik's edits, he offered only the following response:
<dl>
<dd><i>I answered that question further up this page at the section titled Bot on SCi Opp Cl Ch. I hope that helps. Thanks. bobblewik 12:44, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Then he continued to perform the same edits at a bot-like speed, as if to ignore me altogether. I questioned him again, stating that I had read the section above, followed the links to the manual of style page, and found this:
<dl>
<dd><i>The format of the numeric and percentage terms should match. Thus pair 7 with % and seven with percent.</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>So I once again asked him why he was putting a space between the number and the percent sign. He responded by merely copying and pasting another portion of his talk page as if that was adequate explanation and as if I he thought I hadn't read it already.</li>
<li>Thus I blocked him for one hour, hoping that he would focus attention on his talk page long enough to give an adequate response, and also hoping that would be long enough.</li>
<li>If the edits in question were being performed from a separate bot account, as he has been previously asked to do, I would have blocked only the bot, and not bobblewik himself.</li>
<li>I don't believe any of the various formats are actually incorrect, thus his accusation that I blocked him to enforce my preferred style is deceptive.</li>
<li>I have never seen anybody besides him put a space between a number and a percent sign. I asked several individuals via IRC and nobody indicated use of that style.</li>
<li>He should not be making bot-speed edits from his main account.</li>
<li>I should not have sworn at him, but he caused greater frustration than I have experienced since mid-december.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html#Current_policy_on_running_bots" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT#Current policy on running bots</a> states: <i>"Sysops should block bots, without hesitation, if they are unapproved, doing something the operator didn't say they would do, messing up articles or editing too rapidly."</i>

<dd>It looks to me like a miscommunication on one hand, and an admin that was a little trigger-happy, though likely still acting in good faith. I suggest the parties involved discuss the miscommunication and try to look forward, as the alternative is to keep making discussion comments instead of doing real work/editing. My advice: Decide if there's a conflict to be pursued, which only the complaining party really can decide. Hopefully, they'll just accept the faults of communication as blame, and try to work together to solve the problem. Then they can perhaps serve as authorities if it comes up again somewhere. But it's ya'll's choice, to fight or edit.

<dd>Given the choice, I would prefer to edit. However I would also prefer that bobblewik didn't change formats that, as clarified by RadioKirk and others, are equally acceptable. The use of the space is what first upset me, but it was his discourteous lack of response, and continuing to make the same edits which convinced me to block, and I might add that mine was the mildest block he has ever received (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>).

<dd>Well, that's disappointing. I really thought maybe all that stuff was done. I'd support a week block for disruption, as per his probation.

<dd>I was recused from that case, but just to clarify, it is <i>uninvolved</i> admins implicitly, just as <i>any</i> administrative action should ideally be taken by an uninvolved admin. I think <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProbation_b453.html" title="Wikipedia:Probation">Wikipedia:Probation</a> clarifies this. Also, to be clear, there is only one uninvolved admin needed to ban from an article or talk page where he is deemed disruptive (probation), and three for any more serious measures of your own devising, including a ban (<i>general</i> probation). He's on both probation and general probation. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 08:46, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm completely uninvolved; this is the first time I've even looked at any edits by Benjamin Gatti, as far as I can recall. Clean safe nuclear energy is an aggressively POV piece at its core; that appears to be exactly the sort of editing the ArbCom ruling is trying to discourage. I support either a one week block or a one week ban from all nuclear energy topics, enforceable by block. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 17:14, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok this is duplicated with the notice on the <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>, so can someone just make that a link here and copy the comments over? This doesn't appear worth a block yet, but repeating similar actions would. The one week ban from all nuclear topics wouldn't be a bad idea though, and that makes three by the way, as I'm univolved with the current nuclear dispute, though for full disclosure, I have disputed with the user in the past for similar behavior of his and commented a bit in the arbcom decision based on that. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 20:40, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just for the record. I proposed the subject because I was continuously struck by those four words, and I felt they deserved to be fully understood. You're welcome to interpret as you like, but I find it unnecessary to suggest that I was "testing" the Arbcom stampede-to-judgement. The article quite probably could use balance; but I fail to see how the simple creating of an article refencing a fairly important Presidential phrase is itself expressive of a point of view. I think it was not agressively POV, while certainly it includes only a single perspective. There was no reverting other perspectives for example and such would be a critical element of aggressive POV editing. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a> 00:45, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It was so obviously POV that your claims not to be able to see that are hard to believe to say the least. There wasn't any effort to edit it because it was so obviously useless. Don't bother trying similar stunts. If you have useful, researched material to help improve articles please stick to that and save everyone the headache.

<p>Yesterday I had been in a content dispute with <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> and without a warning someone listed me for 3RR. I had been unaware that I had broken the rule as there were various disputes, so I immediately stopped editing there. I showed that <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> had broken the same rule. Admin <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom harrison</a> warned both of us and <a href="../../../n/s/l/User%7ENSLE_4a42.html" title="User:NSLE">NSLE</a> tried to mediate. However, <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> went on to revert two more times in the following hours when other users reinserted what he did not like. I complained and we both got blocked, I seven hours after my last revert. Can you imagine in a soccer game two guys in a conflict get yellow cards, and when one of them goes on with foul play BOTH get the red one? I think that is unfair adminship. The admin who blocked us did not reply to my email complaint although he was online and responded to <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> who threatened him. <a href="../../../n/s/l/User%7ENSLE_4a42.html" title="User:NSLE">NSLE</a> gave me the advise to report this here. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 01:27, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is one of the silliest explanations I've ever read. Both users being annoyed at you is a sign that you haven't been <i>more</i> unfair to one than the other, but it is, by no means, a reflection that you've been fair to both parties. Hypothetically speaking, if I were an admin and decided to indefinitely block two edit warriors for all eternity, hell yes they'd be both annoyed at me, and hell yes it'd be unfair. I'm not bothering to address the actual dispute, but someone needed to point out that that is <i>not</i> "always a good sign."

<li>I am editing this piece while not logged in. I am a very bad boy and must be punished. But as it is the middle of the night for both <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_6ffa.html" title="User:Mailer diablo">Mailer Diablo</a> it seems the only way of raising general attention. The 3RR block was blatantly unjust because my edits to <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_Events_62e7.html" title="Current Events">Current Events</a> were not (apart from one) reverts. They were all different versions of trying to get a compromise. Check the edits and you will see this for yourself. This new interpretation of 3RR that each individual sentence counts is bizarre and never before seen, and in my last edit to that page at 21:37 I included "kicking" in a plural so it's not even true. If the 3RR is acting to prevent attempts at compromise, then it's certainly not helping. As for unblocking myself, I was quite open as to the fact that I was doing it, and cited <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. The direct reason was that I was in the middle of making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_UK_by-elections&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39667931" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_UK_by-elections&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39667931" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> which had taken the best part of an hour and involved comparing five separate reference books. It was 1 AM local time and I had to be in work at 9 AM. (It took <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom harrison</a> a whole 18 hours to reply to the email I sent him a minute after he applied the block) There is no way that I was going to see this work lost even if that meant involving myself in what I expected would be a whole load of trouble in the morning. I was very surprised when there was absolutely nothing and no-one seemed to have noticed: indeed no-one noticed during the day so I was hardly disrupting anyone! I spent the time adding a whole load of useful encyclopaedic information and <b>writing an encyclopaedia</b> (I actually rather like <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Rhodesia_general_election%2C_1962_7084.html" title="Southern Rhodesia general election, 1962">Southern Rhodesia general election, 1962</a>, and if anyone speedy deletes it on the grounds it was made by a user who should have been blocked then that will be the height of lunacy). Blocks are not applied for punishment but to stop disruption. I was not disrupting anything, Q.E.D.

<dd>Dbiv, while I have implied here that I felt your block was unjust and said as much on your talk page, I don't think your action in unblocking yourself was well thought-out. Though I am a mere user without admin powers, from what I've read, there's a strong consensus that under <b>no</b> circumstances should this be acceptable, and I think the reasons are obvious. Even when "justified," unblocking oneself has a tendency to cause far more trouble than its worth, especially when the initial block was for only 24 hours. Though I think hardly anyone considers you anything but a good faith editor, disruption is in the eye of the beholder, and as an involved party, I don't think you should be the one to decide that. The reaction right here could very well be considered disruption in itself, and the blocking/unblocking actions already feel like the beginning (if not the process itself) of a wheel war. I don't see your point about "losing" your work. Few changes to Wikipedia are important enough that can't wait a day, and those that are can be handled by someone else. Unless there's something I'm missing, I don't see why you couldn't have saved your work elsewhere, and waited to make the change after the block expired. -- <a href="../../../h/i/n/User%7EHinotori_3bf9.html" title="User:Hinotori">Hinotori</a><sup><small><a href="../../../h/i/n/User_talk%7EHinotori_c2fa.html" title="User talk:Hinotori">(talk)</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hinotori_253e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hinotori">(ctrb)</a></small></sup> 09:54, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Blocks should never be applied "for the sake of form", only to help preserve the encyclopaedia. If it is true that there is disruption here because of the discussion of my unblocking, that's because someone brought it here more than 24 hours after it happened. The actual unblocking didn't seem to disrupt anything, but it did allow me to add useful edits yesterday. I want to be unblocked now to add useful edits today. I always thought the cardinal unwritten rule of Wikipedia is that "whatever it is, writing an encyclopaedia is always more important".</dd>

<dd>And therein lies the problem with your assumption. Form and process are a part of ensuring a functional system for writing the encyclopedia; even if your initial block was unjustified, you are encouraging a precedent that one can unblock his or herself as long as one thinks it's for the good of the encyclopedia. Surely you see the problem with this thinking. Even if <b>you</b> are right in <b>this</b> instance, sanction of your actions has the potential to give excuse to those who would abuse such actions and has a long-term effect of making blocks ineffective. It causes ill will, gives newer users the impression of a Cabal, and has the potential to start disruptive wheel wars, giving Wikipedia a bad impression in general. Unblocking yourself was in fact the cause of the discussion here, as none of this regarding your action would have been said if you didn't unblock yourself to begin with. In fact, had you not unblocked yourself, another admin would most likely have, and you would have been easily vindicated. As for improving the encyclopedia, again, I see no reason your edits couldn't have waited till after the block, so the benefit to Wikipedia appears neglible to me. The harms, on the other hand, are already making themselves manifest. -- <a href="../../../h/i/n/User%7EHinotori_3bf9.html" title="User:Hinotori">Hinotori</a><sup><small><a href="../../../h/i/n/User_talk%7EHinotori_c2fa.html" title="User talk:Hinotori">(talk)</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hinotori_253e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hinotori">(ctrb)</a></small></sup> 10:29, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't like it either. But in the circumstances I had no choice. With regard to <a href="../../../h/i/n/User%7EHinotori_3bf9.html" title="User:Hinotori">Hinotori</a>, with my browser if you get the 'blocked from editing' page, you lose the edit. It was 1 AM and I needed to sleep; if another admin had removed the block, what was I supposed to do - stay awake and wait? I'm not asking for sanctioning my actions because I acknowledged I shouldn't be doing it right from the start. I know it was wrong - and I'm not going to unblock myself now. But since (a) everyone other than the blocking admin has accepted that the original block was unjustified, and (b) I didn't disrupt Wikipedia while blocked, what harm did it do? If you don't want good quality edits from me today, please say so explicitly. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> (<a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dbiv_6df1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dbiv">contribs</a>).</small>
<dl>
<dd>The harm has been explained further up by Hinotori. As for your browser, you could have copied the entire contents of the edit box, pasted them into a text editor, saved them and then recopied and pasted them back again when the block expired. I'm not going to undo the block because i think it is important that we send a clear message to everyone that admins must not unblock themselves. I know this means that we lose your edits today. It's the lesser of two evils IMO. What I will do though is ask Tom Harrison to review your edits yesterday and his blocking of you both and consider if he wants to unblock you today. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 11:17, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I comment here because I was briefly involved in the middle of this skirmish, editing the section in question once and reverting once. I declined to revert again, for obvious reasons, and finished editing for the day before the discussions at <a href="../../../c/u/r/Talk%7ECurrent_events_efc4.html#Iraqi_abuse_video" title="Talk:Current events">Talk:Current_events#Iraqi_abuse_video</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/3RR</a> took hold. Having reviewed the histories and logs, I agree that GBWR violated 3RR and a block was warranted, although, given the highly charged emotions evident on these pages, perhaps more discussion / warning before the block might have been appropriate. Dbiv does not appear to have violated the 3RR and the block appears to be wrong.</dd>

<dd>However, I think that the self unblocking was utterly wrong and agree completely with Hinotori's points made above. David, you say you had no other choice - <i>it was 1 AM and I needed to sleep; if another admin had removed the block, what was I supposed to do - stay awake and wait?</i>. With respect, you did have other choices, as you clearly knew you were blocked at that point. Make a local copy on your computer and either wait out the block, appeal it by email to another admin, place the appropriate template on your talk page or post anonymously here identifying yourself as you have just done. You could even have elected to do any combination of the above. I also think that as an experienced editor you would be in the habit of making a copy of any major edit before submitting it, a practice made all the more important with the recent server problems.</dd>

<p>I think we would all agree at this point that Dbiv shouldn't have acted as he did; but also that he shouldn't have been blocked in the first place–especially as the block came some time after the non-existent 3RR violation, at a time when <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_Events_62e7.html" title="Current Events">Current Events</a> was not convulsed by an edit war. That's punitive. It's also clear that Dbiv recognizes (indeed, recognized at the time) that unblocking himself is a Bad Thing. In the interests of collegiality, assuming good faith and what not, might we all agree that several admins make bad judgement calls, but in the end no serious harm was actually done. Those are my thoughts, anyway. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 12:00, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have unblocked <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a>. I acknowledge that many people think the 3RR violations were debatable, and the blocks for it unnecessary.

To whit, exactly what he said:'<i>_ _ Handling this via speedy is IMO a gross abuse. WP:CSD provides for U1, covering subpages only, and for U2, covering only IP users. G7, "Author requests deletion" is quite explicit abt further criteria": "Any page for which deletion is requested by the original author, provided the page was edited only by its author and was mistakenly created...."

It is absurd to say I wanted to hide my "blocks and warnings" because the block log is not lost when a page is deleted, it was only one block in all my time here, and the "warning" was merely from you who in spite of confirmation by various administrators insist that I have no right to delete content from my user talk page as many users do. I deleted the opposition to the deletion <b>after</b> my page had been deleted and the opposition was hence obsolete.

<p>I stopped during this point to make comment twice on the articles talk page to the user, asking for co-operation and discussion of changes in line with Wikipedia policys, and also provided the NPOV tutorial and explained deliberatly blanking pages is vandalism, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGothic_music&amp;diff=39858614&amp;oldid=36072092" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGothic_music&amp;diff=39858614&amp;oldid=36072092" rel="nofollow">[76]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Gothic_music&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39858614" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Gothic_music&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39858614" rel="nofollow">[77]</a>.</p>

<p>The user then went on to try to delete the article by claiming a merger when there was no dispute on this, which i reverted due to it being vandalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gothic_music&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40005491" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gothic_music&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40005491" rel="nofollow">[88]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gothic_music&amp;diff=40005740&amp;oldid=40005491" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gothic_music&amp;diff=40005740&amp;oldid=40005491" rel="nofollow">[89]</a>.

<dd>Ismael76 assumes that Gibnews = Gibraltarian simply because they both show a pro-Gibraltar viewpoint. In the statement above, that last sentence was clearly a call to "reeducate" Gibnews. Whether that is serious or not, it is simply UNACCEPTABLE to call for someone's personal status to be downgraded. Like I said, that statement violates AGF, NPA, HAR, and CIVIL.

<dd>DG, I do admire your work, I just wanted to point out that it is <i>very likely</i> that several other editors are associated with S&amp;F's IP &amp;/or IP range. Perhaps a block on his Userpage &amp; of him on Freemasonry (I'm pretty sure you can do the latter too) would be good? On the flipside, I do know he's been a little off lately, but historically he's an excellent editor. There's a lot of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shenanigan" class="extiw" title="wikt:shenanigan">shenanigans</a> going on there right now, so I dunno what'd be best.

<dd>The socks were making the same sort of edits from the same IP (not range) at similar times - it's very consistent. His behaviour in consistently removing the <i>many</i> warnings about his behaviour doesn't speak to his good faith. He can contact me if he cares to come up with an explanation that doesn't sound like sockpuppeteer snake oil. In any case, systematically removing referenced content because he thinks it should be kept secret is unacceptable.

<dd><strike>Well, there seems to be a lot of this going on lately. If something's in AfD, and people are still not satisfied, there are <i><b>no</b> grounds whatsoever</i> to close it early. A consensus is not reached if people are still unwilling to close the AfD. These kind of actions just go overlooked, and that's what the problem is. These rules exist just to keep this kind of thing from happening, and it's <b>the admin who closed the damn thing early</b> who broke the rules.

<p>This is a case where an otherwise useful article should be permitted to die quietly. It does not reflect well on Wikipedia that, after an apparently genuine request is acted on, the silliness starts, quibbling about rules and process and all kinds of pointless nonsense. Let it die. No debate needed, it's just a routine deletion done as a courtesy from OTRS. If this silly nonsense continues to happen, I <i>guarantee</i> that the board will be confirmed in its longheld belief that something serious needs to be done about our deletion process. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 05:08, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many genuine requests are received about many pages, such as Ashida Kim, Daniel Brandt, etc. If we act on some cases, but don't act on others, that means that each case needs to be decided on a case by case basis.

<dd>I agree; that's what I've been saying all along. The best thing to do is to let it die and move on. I'm not so sure what the problem is. It was closed early. Oh well.

<dl>
<dd>I believe the problem is <b>not</b> that it was closed early: it was that it was closed, and then the article was deleted out of process (the AfD in question was somewhere between <b>no consensus</b> and <b>keep</b>).</dd>
<dd>We have kept articles in defiance of the subject's wishes before (<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashida_Kim_6a74.html" title="Ashida Kim">Ashida Kim</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a>), and it is not clear why an out-of-process deletion was needed in this case, and not in those.</dd>
<dd>In short: if the argument is that Brian Peppers is not notable, then that is grounds for an AfD discussion, not unilateral deletion. If the argument is that we have been asked to delete the article, then I do not understand why the aforementioned two articles (as well as many others) have not yet been deleted. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> 19:47, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The rationale, which is stated above as well as on the article's talk page, is that publishing the content is in violation of privacy laws.

<dd>I think it is fair to say that procedures are getting ever tighter around complaints about articles, partly because of our increased visibility. It would be nice if <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> could step in and make this a <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> affair, but it would also be nice if users in general could spare a thought for the people who have to deal with the complaints that a tiny fraction of our articles cause. There is no slippery slope, Wikipedia continues to publish large numbers of controversial articles, but it is an encyclopedia, not an exercise in free speech or democracy. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhyschim62_05f3.html" title="User talk:Physchim62">(talk)</a> 20:05, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The solution, then, is to make people aware of what is acceptable and what isn't. If there is not to <b>be</b> a slippery slope, then we need guidelines, or preferably policy, dealing with this. An admin (who, I assume, is not a lawyer) unilaterally deciding to do something is not a good substitute for policy.</dd>
<dd>Is the article on <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a> legal and acceptable? What about the article on <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashida_Kim_6a74.html" title="Ashida Kim">Ashida Kim</a>? What about the article on Brian Peppers? I don't know, and I don't expect that the admins taking action in this matter do, either.</dd>
<dd>I strongly believe that the <b>inconvenience</b> of having a given article should never be a reason pro or contra its existence. I'm certain that the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scientology_879d.html" title="Church of Scientology">Church of Scientology</a> could brew up <b>plenty</b> of inconvenience for us; and I am convinced that the reason they have not done so so far is because they realize that it would be futile.</dd>
<dd>Again: policy please! It would save everyone so much time, and so much effort. I have no doubts that this will not be the last such debate. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> 20:53, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looking at the source code for a typical undelete page, I see the undelete form is <i>within</i> the <code>div#bodyContent</code>. While <a href="../../../h/t/m/HTML_Tidy_0243.html" title="HTML Tidy">HTML Tidy</a> will close an unclosed tag, the closing will happen only just before the parent is closed — which is after the undelete form. I think this is a bug: either the <code>div#bodyContent</code> should close before the form, or the content should be enclosed within another <code>div</code>. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 19:31, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had my talk page deleted. Someone however wrote there. An admin recycled it, removed my comment that I do not want any further messages and now <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliezer_60dc.html" title="User:Eliezer">Eliezer</a> even protected the page. That is unfair. You cannot force people to stay here forever, and users clearly have the right to get their pages deleted.

<dd>Oh please, stop it. You tried to speedy delete a page that didn't qualify for it. You tried to hide you "just 1 block" which was in reality, "just 1 block, and about 6 warnings".

<dd>Thanks. However I repeat that there is a discrepancy in our policies - some of which seem to permit deletion of user pages for any reason, and some of which do not. I'll note that I became interested in this because I disagreed with the deletion of a lengthy user talk page (<a href="../../../2/4/i/User_talk%7E24ip.html" title="User talk:24ip">user talk:24ip</a>) when the user was simply changing names, not even leaving as this other user is doing. If we don't make a practice of such deletions than that should be reflected in the policies. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 00:08, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jesus Christ! This user is trying to leave. Let him go! I've blanked his talk page (not deleted it).

<p>user mini mike has just posted an offer to take me to court if I repost his IP address on my talk page.

<dd>As far as I know, there's no policy. It's just common sense to add the unsigned template, since a message without a signature tends to "blend" with the following message, making it nonobvious where one message stops and the other one starts. If I were to categorize the "policyness" of using the unsigned template, I'd say it's a guideline that just was never proposed (and would be shot down as "instruction creep, just do it" if it were to be proposed, so don't try). --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 21:53, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Speedy deleting a page on the request of someone claiming to be related to the subject, against precedence and even if later shown to be part of a widespread hoax, is a 'foundation issue'?

<li>P.S. To forstall the "George W. Bush is clearly notable" rebuttal, I'm of the opinion that potentially having <b>three</b> categories of notability - 'notable' (you're George W. Bush and you get an article), 'non-notable' (you're Joe Bloggs and you don't get an article) and 'sorta notable' (you're Brian Peppers and you get an article but we'll delete it for bizarre reasons like someone sending us a hoax email) - is unworkable and silly. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 20:45, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>IIRC, Snopes mentions that every so often, people claim to be related to Mr. Peppers and try to post information/try to get rid of information/whatnot.
