<dd>Wow, bringing back the old times, I had v 1. something of nethack as a game on my first computer--an 8086 with a 20mb hard drive. The later versions never seemed to carry the same luster. A simple hex editor and you had all the hit points, etc you wanted! Still not enough to win the game, but I'm not sure if that makes me more or less of a loser.&#160;:) I'll have to try the rouge game. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 22:59, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To make a long story short, I think I forgot to include "noinclude" when nominating Template:User Golfer woods for speedy deletion. It's been deleted, so I would have guessed that the user pages would no longer be listed as candidates for speedy deletion and that the problem would now be moot. There are still 4 user pages up for deletion, though (oddly enough, <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMaphi_bac1.html" title="User:Maphi">User:Maphi</a>, who has the said template transcluded, is <i>not</i> up for deletion).

<dd>Thanks. I thought the need for null edits went away when they fixed some problem or problems recently, but I guess not. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdric47_8ef5.html" title="User:Ardric47">Ardric47</a> 06:23, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It appears to depend on exactly what kind of null edit is needed. A change to the category on a template that is transcluded will repopulate the category very quickly. I've noticed however that if something is deleted with the category still intact, the article will continue to show up in the category for a while (forever? I haven't gone back to look) and may need a null edit if its a concern. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 11:50, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was a recent page move that was put into effect from Sidhoji Rao Shitole to the above page. The result was that the edit history of the above page was wiped out - which was a mistake. The page move should have been a simple redirect, but the admin who put it in didn't read the discussion page carefully. As a result, 4 months worth of edit histories were wiped out, and a previously protected page (Yogiraj Gurunath Siddhanath) was replaced with a mock-up that was thrown together on the redirect page Sidhoji Rao Shitole. I'm requesting that the edit history of the Yogiraj page be restored so that the full record of 4 months worth of edit history not be lost. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> 14:50, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> is being a bit misleading here. The consensus (4-1) was specifically for a page move, with only himself calling for a redirect, as can be seen at <a href="../../../s/i/d/Talk%7ESidhoji_Rao_Shitole_3297.html" title="Talk:Sidhoji Rao Shitole">Talk:Sidhoji Rao Shitole</a>. There are, I believe, no objections to merging the page histories, provided that the intent is not to resurrect old disputed content. However, a look at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Hamsacharya_dan_44ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Hamsacharya dan">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Hamsacharya dan</a> might be in order before determining whether restoration of the old edit history would be a wise idea.

<p>I'm glad that we agree that merging histories is in order. Hanuman Das - I have a copy on my harddrive of the old Yogiraj Gurunath Siddhanath page. If I wanted to, I could have restored it any time I want to. I'm asking for the edit history to be restored for record, not so I can start messing with the content. This is not about you or me or edit warring. And it was 3:2 not 4:1 on the simple redirect. And the 3 was you and the other "2" usernames that you used to sockpuppet around with. To all admins: By all means - please take a look at the requests for comment page - that way everybody on wikipedia will see how much of an idiotic rivalry this is. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> 07:43, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi guys, I would very much appreciate it if someone went over my closing of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Christian_views_of_Hanukkah_c9fd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Christian views of Hanukkah">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Christian views of Hanukkah</a>. This has gone to something of an argumentative Deletion Review and I would welcome some experienced eyes having a look. I am fairly sure that I made the right decision but, rather unsurprisingly, some people are very upset with the result and are highjacking the review to this end. I do not wish to appear to be vote chasing, but the existence of the process implies that I have made a pretty major error of judgement, something I take very seriously, and I would like some neutral eyes to evaluate it.

<p>Me too, I closed AfDs as a non-admin when they were still called VfD, and before they said that non-admins can only close unambiguous votes. Back then, the only limit non-admins had was that we couldn't close Delete votes (for obvious reasons). I closed a lot of "No consensus" votes, but I'm sure if non-admins did those now, they'd get a bit of a talking-to.

I'm not familiar with the history of that account, but it mentions something about vandalism experiments or whatnot from a known user? Anyway, I am a bit uncomfortable with the block, but I don't see any urgency to unblock it at the moment...we can say, wait 24-48 hours and do the unblocking, and temporarily let the indefinite block stand while some discussion takes place.

<p>One of the things that I've lamented since I got to Wikipedia is that "Requested Articles" and "Requests for expansion" are off in a corner and not altogether well maintained. I got an idea the other day, though: Given that categories are really easy to see, really easy to search, and really well indexed, and amazingly easy to depopulate and populate, why not use those? Furthermore, there is no project page needed. <b>Therefore</b> I have created <a href="../../../r/e/d/Category%7ERed_list_bd59.html" title="Category:Red list">Category:Red list</a>. A lot of us keep lists of articles we want to write or articles that we mean to get around to researching. Sometimes we want those to be private and don't want people to sneak in and "steal" our topics. Most of the time, though, we don't care <i>who</i> writes the article: we just want someone with an interest to do it. In the latter case, all you need to do is apply the category tag to the redlink list that you've put in your user talk space, and then folks'll be able to see what they can do to help. I'm not a programmer, and I stink at category manipulation, but if we can subcat this appropriately (Red list:Literature: Poetry: 17th century), it would be even more useful. This will work, if we use it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:48, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An anon is claiming on my talkpage that the image Image:Fredandjack.jpg "had source info and qualified as public domain", and is hinting that "OrphanBot's deletion of it" constitutes vandalism. OrphanBot's logs indicate that the image was tagged as "no license", so could someone check to see if the image description page had a plausable claim that the image was in the public domain?

<p>Along the same lines, could someone temporarily undelete the image description page for Image:USSCobia.jpg? It appears that OrphanBot made a mistake when tagging it, and the history will let me figure out what the bug is. (The deletion was not a mistake: the image was licensed under a no-commercial-use Creative Commons license). --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 22:26, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Found and fixed two bugs related to this. One would cause OrphanBot to tag something as "no info" if a Creative Commons license was selected in the license dropdown, and a license tag was entered at the end of the upload summary. The other would cause OrphanBot to <i>not</i> tag an image if it only had a license tag that takes one or more parameters (such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>}}). --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 22:55, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's currently 85 talk pages in this category. I blocked a user earlier today, he appealed using {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} but given this backlog it's likely that his block will expire on its own before someone looks at it.

<p>The trouble with clearing the backlog is that I dealt with two (denied a stupid request, listed an open proxy who claimed to have been closed on <a href="../../../o/p/_/WP%7EOP_2cfb.html" title="WP:OP">WP:OP</a>), and then the next two I looked at were shared IPs that had been blocked for long periods of time and claimed collateral damage... while my instinct is to unblock, I don't like to do it without discussing with the blocking admin, and I don't have the time to do that right now. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:04, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Turns out that someone edited {{sharedip}} to included the unblock template.

<p>There are real-time reports of each use of the {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} template in the #vandalism-en-wp IRC channel, as well as #vcn-unblock, if any admins who use IRC would like to keep track. The main problem is, vandals tend to continue using the template, even when multiple admins have refused to unblock, and it grows to a point that you begin ignoring the reports. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 03:51, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not to me it doesn't. If it's an uncontroversial move over a redirect - and the admin checks the page and talk first - why make the user go through that bureaucracy?

<p>Are song lyrics copyrighted? I ask because a <a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzyNumber1fan_0af9.html" title="User:OzzyNumber1fan">user</a> added the lyrics to <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_More_Tears_%28song%29_56e8.html" title="No More Tears (song)">No More Tears (song)</a>. (I haven't recently checked his other contribs yet). I do know of how many sites that have song lyric listings out there (which caused me to question if it is so), but I also know that just because it's on the internet doesn't mean it's legal, therefore I thought I would ask before reverting.

<dd>I know it's different in the US, but the chance of an English schoolkid getting his hands on "an SMG, 2 AK-47s and a Spaz Shotgun" is between none and bugger-all. I'll give the kid a warning but personally, I wouldn't inform the school.

<dd>I really hope I don't feel like a fool tomorrow, but if someone was planning a shooting, they wouldn't post it on wikipedia. Most likely someone who doesn't like the supposed perpetrator put it up to stir up trouble. This is nothing more than the high-tech equivalent of writing on the bathroom wall.

<p>That leaves me perplexed. I'm more than 100% sure that the articles which use {{<a href="../../../h/a/r/Template%7EHarv_762d.html" title="Template:Harv">Harv</a>}} style listing for references worked fine with cite.php, right until a day or two ago. The articles I mentioned are all FA's, and the Tagore article was on the main page on May 7. I think something broke with Harv style notations/references because only articles with that style seem to be affected. See also, <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>. That too had Harv style references and showing the same garvled refs. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 23:42, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, all: I've written up <a href="../../../q/u/a/Wikipedia%7EQuasi-protection_policy_6458.html" title="Wikipedia:Quasi-protection policy">Wikipedia:Quasi-protection policy</a>, a proposal similar to semi-protection that would effectively limit sleeper accounts used to vandalize articles linked from the Main Page.

<p>Currently a lot of requests for unblocking (both from people hit as collateral damage form other blocks and people blocked for cause) come in to info-en, the regular mailing list, and to random admins' email addresses. This is not really an ideal situation. The mailing list just isn't the place anymore; posts from users who aren't subscribed get stuck in moderation, and admins who are happy to do blocking and unblocking but don't care about hundred-post licensing debates don't subscribe to it. The info-en address has limited staff, and isn't meant for this sort of request, and a random admin may or may not be around to answer.</p>
<p>Is there any support for an admin "hotline" list, publicly accessible, to be linked from the block message, where blocked users can go to complain and get a pool of interested admins to answer?</p>
<p>Note that this is not meant for users to be able to "shop around" for an admin to unblock! Just that a lot of users are pretty clueless when they find themselves blocked, especially if they're on a shared or dynamic IP; anyone blocked for cause should have the blocking admin consulted as usual. Is there support for this? Anything you'd change about the idea before implementing? <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 00:24, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I certainly don't subscribe to that cess pool called a maling list, so I only rarely know of these unblock requests after I've braved the archive.

</ul>
<p>Unfortunately the scope of the specific remedies in his cases do not yet seem to match the scale and inventiveness of his disruption. Typically he will choose a dozen or so articles, edit war on them over some detail of nomenclature, get banned and move on to another set of articles where he'll edit war on the same point.</p>
<p>This absorbs an appreciable amount of administrator time and it can be rather demoralizing to realise, a couple of weeks later, that one has only succeeded in moving the venue of the disruption. It has also become all but impossible to track the articles from which Instantnood has been banned as a result of remedies in those of his arbitration cases that reached completion (2 and 3).</p>
<p>A General Probation applies in Instantnood's case. I propose to use it in the hope of convincing Instantnood that he cannot continue in this way.</p>
<p>The probation reads as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Instantnood is placed on general probation indefinitely. Any three administrators may, for good cause, ban him from the site. All bans to be logged at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Instantnood_3_68ef.html#Log_of_blocks_and_bans" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Instantnood 3">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Instantnood 3#Log of blocks and bans</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I open this to general discussion. My own thoughts are that a two week ban from Wikipedia might serve to convince Instantnood, a certified Wikipediholic, that he cannot continue to edit war indefinitely. But I'm not set on this.

<li>I'm not sure that there's a better way to handle it. I will say that I would support a two-week ban on Instantnood, but I agree that if there is a better way to handle it, we should do it.

<dt>my non-admin comment as his foil.</dt>
<dd>I've said before I don't like the idea of a permanent ban. He's been banned for two weeks before without any change and immediately resumed the same behavior - so I'm not convinced it would change if done again. The page bans work, sort of, but are becoming too numerous to track. And he still filibusters on the talk pages. There really does need to be some behavioral tweaks to his sanctions.</dd>
<dd>I proposed before the idea that he be prohibited from doing the same revert twice. So if he makes a change, and someone reverts it, he should be allowed one revert (with a talk page note), and then be forced to drop it. It would force him to seek other editors to form consensus.</dd>
<dd>Otherwise, the deal with moving the same edit war to different articles has to have some force behind it. If there is a style change, (eg from today: parentheses, flag images, or the spelling of Macao) that he's known to obsess over it should be said to him in some authorative way: "Someone else needs to make these changes if you feel they need to be made. Don't make this same edit in a different article."</dd>
<dd>I also worry that a general, permanent ban would result in sock puppetry. In a previous ban of a week or so, it was so important to vote in a poll somewhere that he created a sock to do it. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 02:08, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually the idea of a limitation on reverts (a revert parole) sounds pretty good. I wonder if it would be a good idea to put the idea of a revert parole remedy in this case to the Commmittee.</p>
<p>Examples of revert paroles in other cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Depleted_uranium_dd90.html#TDC_placed_on_revert_parole" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Depleted uranium">TDC</a>: "TDC is hereby limited to 1 content revert per article per day and must discuss all content reverts on the relevant talk page for one year. He may be briefly blocked for up to a week for violations. After 5 such blocks the maximum block time increases to a year."</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Lou_franklin_9273.html#Revert_parole" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Lou franklin">Lou franklin</a>: "Lou franklin shall for one year be limited to one revert per article per week, excepting obvious vandalism. Further, he is required to discuss any content reversions on the article's talk page."</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Leyasu_595f.html#...on_Leyasu" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Leyasu">Leyasu</a>: "Leyasu is placed on standard revert parole. He is hereby limited to a maximum of one content revert per page per day for one year. Each revert must be explicitly marked as such."</li>
</ul>
<p>A revert parole can only be imposed by the Arbitration Committee, but any arbitrator can propose a motion in a previous case. If on discussion this emerges as a possibility, it should be easy to persuade the arbitrators to consider such a remedy. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 02:43, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tony, I have seen no evidence to support this. Could you supply diffs? I checked at random 7 of his edits of 16 May. Six were fine (one was beyond my technical ability). A theme of his editing is applying accurately the differences between <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">nation</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereign_state.html" title="Sovereign state">sovereign state</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country.html" title="Country">country</a> in relation to "Chinese territories". As I said on 7 May I had checked his edits on <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macao%2C_China_47e2.html" title="Macao, China">Macao, China</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bridges.html" title="List of bridges">List of bridges</a>, and <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_national_football_team_ede7.html" title="Hong Kong national football team">Hong_Kong_national_football_team</a> (some of the articles I believe he has been unfairly banned from). His edits endeavoring to use correctly the various terms for "country" were fine and no one has said they were not. I doubt the issue will be resolved until it is acknowledged that his use of the terms is well informed.<a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccready_a493.html" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a> 03:45, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We do not owe any edit warriors a "judgement" for whether their preferred version is correct. The question we are to look at, which all your replies have neatly sidestepped so far, is not whether he is reverting to the "correct" version (whatever that may mean), but <i>Has Instantnood been disruptive in spite of specific remedies imposed in his prior Arbcom cases?</i> And to that question (which is the only question that matters here) the answer has to be an emphematic <b>yes</b>, necessitating the invocation of the general remedy. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimchi.sg_9ead.html" title="User talk:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kimchi.sg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kimchi.sg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">sg</a> 05:54, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm happy to rephrase: <i>I think a good resolution of the issue depends on a judgement by the community that he has used the terms correctly.</i> I have to disagree with you Kimchi - on the evidence I have examined in detail, and I restrict myself to that alone, his edits have been correct. If we avoid the meaning of correct why are we trying to create an encyclopedia? If someone could post a diff where he was incorrect I'd be happy to look at it. I make no comment on edit warring except to say I disagree again - it is not the only question that matters here. We do the project a disservice if we don't examine carefully what appears to be the root of the problem - his usage of terms like state, nation, country, nation state, sovereign nation, sovereign state, etc. and his objection to others who use the terms loosely or inaccurately. <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccready_a493.html" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a> 06:36, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The revert restriction has a lot of attraction, since excessive, often-trivial reversion is a large proportion of the problem -- such as a stub tag being reverted back to a redirect <i>to the same template</i> (the mind boggles). The "filibustering" can be vexing, but less out and out disruptive. Rather than throw this back straight at the ArbCom, I think there would be some merit in sounding IN out to see if he'd be prepared to agree to <i>voluntarily</i> restrict his revert activity in the manner described, as a means of addressing people's reasonable concerns as expressed here and elsewhere. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 04:34, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a>. I've not formed a good impression of Instantnood, based on his frequent vexatious posts to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> - <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html#User:William_M._Connolley" title="WP:ANI">this</a>, for example. And I'm not a big fan of people who get obsessive about the difference between a state and a country (Instantnood's hobby-horse), or the status of the "traditional English counties", or the "correct" name for the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>. It seems to me that half the problems on Wikipedia are caused by nationalists who won't let things go. Having said that, Instantnood is not an outright troll - I think he's getting worked up to a ridiculous extent over trivia, but so are some of the people who are opposing him. He does seem to make some good changes and additions to articles. I'm pessimistic about the effect of asking him to voluntarily curb his aggressiveness, but it's worth a try. I don't think the time is right yet for a long ban, but I'd support a short (week or two) ban as a shot across the bows. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 06:41, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tony, my previous request has been moved. Could you supply <i>recent</i>(perhaps 13-16 May) diffs you feel are disruptive, so that the community can examine the request for a temporary ban.

<p>By the way, this was <i>not</i> a request for a temporary community ban. It was a community discussion concerning a temporary ban to be passed under the terms of Instantnood's General Probation. As such, it had passed the "three administrators" threshold by 1655 UTC yesterday, and Phil Sandifer implemented the ban. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 05:33, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that a revert parole would be the way to deal with Instantnood's revert warring, better than simply blocking him. Meanwhile, <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanmak_22a2.html" title="User:Alanmak">User:Alanmak</a>'s anti-social behavior and extensive edit warring needs to be dealt with, since there are multiple sides to the problem. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 10:56, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I haven't looked at that users' contribs, but I've asked him to modify his userpage, as likely to add fuel to the fire. (It's practically a declaration of revert-war, and an unduly personalised one to boot.) But Instantnood is a distinct case, in that his arbcom ruling expressly puts him in the "last chance saloon" (or temporarily evicted from it, given the above), and we won't be at that point with other users until other steps are taken first. If you'd be willing to approach him with regard to a voluntary revert limitation with a view to avoiding future such agro, you'd be doing us all a favour (himself included). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 18:48, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Instantnood's actions are no doubt distruptive for me, for example, he insisted on some styling (e.g. comma vs bracket) issues, which others find it incorrect. Like in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:HKG-PRC&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:HKG-PRC&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Hong_Kong_%28PRC%29&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Hong_Kong_%28PRC%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, other editors are against his edits, yet he never give up reverting them to his own version. And on the image of Hong Kong, the old HK Image, which is in png format, Image:Flag of Hong Kong SAR.png is rendered redundant by <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Hong_Kong.svg_a750.html" title="Image:Flag of Hong Kong.svg">Image:Flag of Hong Kong.svg</a>. Though Instantnood still try to reinstate the old flag (like in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong%2C_China_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_9ff9.html" title="Hong Kong, China at the 2004 Summer Olympics">Hong Kong, China at the 2004 Summer Olympics</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong%2C_China_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong%2C_China_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>), which was retired, in various articles, citing something incorrect about the new flag which he himself couldn't tell what that is. These are just few of his recent examples of causing disruptions in Wikipedia. His continuous disruptive actions is requiring a few editors to constant monitor his edits (sort the construtive ones from the disruptive ones) and fix them by reverting those pages.<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinhunter_d2c4.html" title="User:Winhunter">Hunter</a> 11:52, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If it is the reverts that are desruptive, while the content of my edits are useful ones, then what we actually have to figure out is why these edits keep being reverted by a few editors, namely user:Alanmak, user:Winhunter and user:SchmuckyTheCat. User:Jiang has already pointed <i>part</i> of the key problem in his comment above (10:56, May 18). What I have been facing is that the other party I am facing do not bother to discuss, and even if they discuss, they don't provide evidence to justify their position. If they do not actively edit the articles (and categories and templates, same below) themselves to realise their point of view, there wouldn't be anything necessary to be reverted.</p>
<p>Another thing that is disappointing is that user:SchmuckyTheCat has requested for administrators' action against me at WP:AE for a few times. Yet everytime he filed a request, he provides only one-side evidence, and administrators act only based on what one of the two sides have filed. Such mechanism is far from satisfactory.</p>
<p>Last be not least, user:Phil Sandifer, who cast the third vote without signing and subsequently blocked me (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Phil+Sandifer&amp;page=" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Phil+Sandifer&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> 16:56, May 17), was previously user:Snowspinner, was user:SchmuckyTheCat's advocate in the case he and I were involved.

<p>Following discussion on the mailing list - someone mentioned that community bans are going to become more common as the number of editors increases, and the arbitration committee is less able to deal with a volume of cases. The current situation is that any admin can community-ban a user, and the user's only comeback is to appeal to the arbitration committee. There's currently a bit of minor wheel-warring going on over one user who I'm satisfied ought to be banned, but others obviously disagree (I'm not the banning admin, but I have a low tolerance for people who are only here to push a particularly strong point of view). Might it be useful to have a formal process for community banning along the lines of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProbation_b453.html#General_probation" title="Wikipedia:Probation">general probation</a>? A page for admins to list users they wish to community-ban, the agreement of another two admins required before the ban, and possibly a lightweight review process along the lines of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a> rather than having to go straight to the arbitration committee? There clearly are users here whose presence is intolerable, and who need to be got rid of quickly, but there needs to be slightly more transparency and fair process than there is at the moment. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 08:33, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that makes sense. Currently seems to be no clear definition of what IS a community ban, how does it happen, how does it get labelled as such.

<dd>Oh, heck yes. I'm getting very wary of the community bans. N.b. what's going on is community <i>ban,</i> not community <i>block,</i> and the distinction between the two is eroding faster than the world's beaches. I remember the Lir and Michael days, when it took the most monumental, tectonic motion to impose an actual <i>ban.</i> Now, it seems like we're getting free with the "indefinite block" button. It's not that I can point to one or another, although I think Secret London is right that an IP must <i>never</i> be blocked indefinitely, since no one knows who's going to own the IP in 3 months. I'm not sure this is the place to draft and work out the procedure, however, as its readership is already pre-selected to the grumpy and the injured. More light is needed, I think. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:00, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Increasing the size of ArbCom did not solve the workload issue, and community bans will work only in the cases were there is agreement. Perhaps the solution is to create more than one ArbCom committee, to spread the workload. Rather than turn ArbCom into a court of last appeal and have ad hoc community bannings to take over the workload, I'd rather have several committees that are capable of handling the caseload (see <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Arbcom_restructuring_5678.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Arbcom restructuring">NoSept/Arbcom restructuring</a>).

<dd>The problem at the moment is that from the perspective of the banned user, one admin is able to ban them, and they have no comeback beyond a lengthy and bureaucratic ArbCom case. The admin may be someone they have had long-term involvement with - if someone's doing a lot of edit-warring, there may be dozens of admins reverting, warning and protecting pages. What I'm proposing is that effectively an ad-hoc committee of three admins bans them, and there is some form of lightweight appeals process so if they have anyone willing to speak up for them, the ban can be reviewed and altered if that's necessary. Most of these bans ought to be uncontroversial - three admins to ban, a week for review, and I really think that in most cases people will get the message and ArbCom won't be involved. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 10:55, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Having some sort of way for the community to test whether a community ban has consensus is a good idea. Right now we just have the comments of those who choose to chat on the notice boards, those comments are limited in number and may not really reflect what the (admin) community as a whole thinks. That is one reason why having even one admin who thinks a ban was incorrect should be taken seriously as proof that consensus does not exist. If that one admin is in the wrong, the onus must be on the community to prove that consensus is really there, despite his objection. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 20:02, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In the past there have apparently been some mass community motions to ban someone, but nowadays some admin usually does so long before that could happen. Currently 'community bans' are when there is no admin willing to unblock someone. If admins disagree then only the ArbCom can make such an action permanent. Personally I think that's a reasonable structure. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 10:58, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>CBD is correct. We only have a community ban if no admin is willing to reverse someone else's block. With 900 admins, a dedicated troll can get hs ban overturned by someone. The problem with this structure is that it promotes the accusation of wheel warring. The admin that removes the ban will be jumped on by those who imposed the ban, and the third admin who puts the ban back again will also be accused of wheel warring. Perhaps we should say that reducing a ban (from indefinite to something less) is acceptable as long as enough time remains on the ban for the community to discuss it before the ban expires. But in the end, I would prefer a system that does not lead inevitably to the accusations of wheel warring, which the current system has the potential to do. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 11:12, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>The problem with that is that if admin A thinks a community ban is in order, and admin B doesn't and unblocks, that's wheel-warring. And there's something like that going on right now with a user who is making a lot of noise on the mailing list. If we have a firm agreement that if admin B unblocks, that's OK and it's the end of the community ban, fair enough - but that's not the procedure at the moment, and that's not what's happening. Also, even if admin B unblocks, admin C will be along in a while to decide that another community ban is in order, because these users are not generally ones who change their behaviour. I think we need a firm and fair process to decide that the ban genuinely has community support, and that it should stick. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 11:04, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The general idea of "community bans" is that they are outside process. One problem is that we are mixing up several different processes. Some poeple such a WoW have a genunine community ban. In other cases none of the ~100 admins who actualy deal with this kind of blocking really want to do the unblock. In yet more cases it is simply a missnamed IAR block.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 20:53, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Historically, wrongfully banned users have appealed to the WikiEN-L listserv over indefinite blocks hoping to get a consensus of admins in favor of reducing or lifting their ban. It's not a "one admin bans you, you have to appeal to Arbcom" type of issue. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a> 17:41, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is what I don't get. My understanding is that you don't need a consensus to remove a community ban; you need consensus to <i>make</i> one. The <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">banning policy</a> says:
<ul>
<li>"The Wikipedia community, taking decisions according to appropriate community-designed policies with consensus support, or (more rarely) following consensus on the case itself. Some editors are so odious that not one of the 915 administrators on Wikipedia would ever want to unblock them."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>This gives me the impression that community bans occur when not a single administrator objects to an indefinite block. Apparently, that is more controversial in practice than the policy page indicates. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 18:11, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, it's messy. Just like any other consensus-based decision on Wikipedia, it's less a matter of no one objecting and more a matter of no one wanting to stick their neck out to actually unblock, hence the "not one of the 915 administrators would ever want to unblock them". — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a> 18:15, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can think of at least one example where an administrator did stick his neck out and unblock the "community banned" user, only to find himself accused of wheel warring and the block re-applied. I wonder how many community bans would be enacted not because the editing user is that odious, but because admins don't want to involve themselves in a block war. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 18:43, 24 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I thought a block/edit/wheel war could by definition only happen if someone reverts an action at least twice. So if admin A blocks and B unblocks, that's one revert, not a war. If A reblocks, maybe it's a war if you count A's reblock as a second revert. If C reblocks and B re-unblocks, that also might be war. If C reblocks and D unblocks, not a war, etc. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 21:15, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That's precisely my view. As I've just said on the mailing list, I actually think community bans should be used more frequently than they currently are, but I'm not keen on controversial community bans leading to wars between admins. As I say above, if we're going to have clear agreement that unblocking a community-banned user is OK, and that the original banning admin should accept that decision without reapplying the ban, that would be another way to deal with it. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 18:50, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ryan Delaney says, "apparently, this is more controversial in practice than the policy page indicates." I don't think that's true. We indefinitely block dozens of users a day (sometimes hundreds) because of extreme vandalism, legal threats, persistent copyright violations, etc., without objection from anyone. The percentage of these blocks that are controversial is miniscule, and any change in policy should reflect that. I'll concede we may need to change the way we deal with users who have some good edits but are very difficult, but that shouldn't make us unnecessarily change the way we deal with pure trolls. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 18:39, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The problem with community ban proposals is that currently even a single administrator can dig his heels in and repeatedly unblock. This has happened a few times. In instances where there is a very strong consensus to ban a problem user, I propose that the dissenting administrator, or any other party, must use a lightweight procedure to overturn the ban. A proposal to overturn should be made on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration</a>, and if four arbitrators agree to the proposal then the community ban is overturned. Unblocking against general consensus of administrators on the wiki is of course an abuse of administrator powers, so there would be a strong incentive to administrators to follow this route.</p>
<p>The procedure still favors unbanning by only requiring four arbitrators to agree with the motion to overturn. If the ban is overturned, the case may still optionally be taken to arbitration. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 19:09, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a bit misleading to say that your procedure is "lightweight" and favors unbanning because it only takes 4 arbitrators to overturn. Arbitrators are not morons, not a single one is going to overturn a case against a legitimate troll (which is as it should be). It amuses me that you would require 4 arbitrators to undo a blocking action that was endorsed by 4 to 8 admins on WP:ANI (many announced community bans only get limited discussion). We must not presume that consensus for a community ban has been reached just because there was not a lot of discussion.</li>
<li>Your plan also seems to call for Arbitrators to routinely make final decisions without ever conducting a case. That would essentially change the whole Arbitration process. Instead of imposing sanctions as they do now, you would have ArbCom merely be the reviewers of sanctions imposed by others.</li>
<li>Community decisions should be decided by the community, and ArbCom decisions should be decided by ArbCom. Trying to mix the two as you have is not a good idea. If there must be a review of a community decision because there are admins with opposing views, then have some sort of admin consensus proving procedure, to make clear whether consensus exists. Or else, go to ArbCom through the proper procedure, with a properly formed case. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 19:24, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any individual admin can claim that a user is banned by the community. To make it so easy for the user to be blocked, then so difficult for the block to be reversed, is a Bad Idea(tm). I would rather see the bureaucratic resistance flowing in the other direction. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 02:27, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I owed 50 euro to another Wiki user, but he refused to take the money; instead he asked me to donate them to Wiki. This I did, but I received no receipt of my donation. I need a receipt to show the user in question that I donated the money. The only notification I have is when I log onto my PayPal account, but he can't verify that info. I could take a screenshot, but that's not a good method. Is there a way to verify this info? The "Thank You" page said the following: "An email receipt will be sent to you shortly. Please print this out for your records." I received no such email; not on my Wiki account email and not on my Paypal account email. I also emailed donation@wikipedia.org, but I got no reply from them. Grr, what is this?

<p>This keeps being deleted as "patent nonsense", which is it not (it is neither random strings of characters, nor particularly confusing - merely incomplete). It has been deleted out from under me twice as I enter information (including information on the cultural relevancy of the text and the authors), VERY shortly after creation.

<dd>Something screwy seems to be happening with extending blocks - I had two new blocks fail to override old ones in one day a while ago, even I unblocked first in both cases. I've noticed some admins block a user for one second, then apply the indefinite block.

<li>This does raise another point to me. I'd misspelled 'category' last week, and when I caught it self-nominated it using {db-because} while emailing a friendly admin to move it; and not wanting to create a talk page too, added the inline comment, or better yet, move it to 'category', the software doesn't allow me to do that with protected space. It also goes to the point that several stubs have been speedied before I could get back to fix them up. Again, with an inline comment saying I was hip-deep in nested edits, and would be doing so.</li>

<dd>So why isn't there a <i>minimal check</i> by people to check for inline comments at the least, and shouldn't there be a minimal time period from <i>article creation</i> before someone can tag on a Csd template? I'm talking about stuff that disappeared in less than three hours, addressed a redlink, was categorized, and I just couldn't get back to because of other editting. Totally disrespectful of the creating editors time—more the behaviour one would expect from some juvenile schoolkid without any sensitivity to or experience with the needs of others he/she may be working with. This is counter-productive as it's currently administered to those of us primarily adding content. Someone needs to apply some checking, an inquiry, and some commonsense instead of blindly crossing things off a list because a template put them there!

<p>Currently, the talk page of <a href="../../../w/p/s/WP%7EWPSPAM_fbb6.html" title="WP:WPSPAM">WP:WPSPAM</a> is acting as a sort of <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> for reporting spam and external link abuse, as cases are usually too lengthy and complicated for AIAV and AN/I to deal with.</p>
<p>To make this resource easier to find, and to encourage its use and patrol by administrators, I've proposed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Spam#Proposal" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Spam#Proposal" rel="nofollow">here</a> that a dedicated noticeboard for link spam be produced, in the style of WP:AIAV and <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>, WP:AN/3RR, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, the success of such an initiative depends mainly on input from the administrators, so I would be grateful if any admins interested could leave comments and suggestions at this talk page. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquilina_e23d.html" title="User:Aquilina">Aquilina</a> 14:27, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I understand it, calls for oversight are directed at a small subset of admins and are generally urgent, so a separate board seems eminently sensible.

<dd>I support the creation of both, with some kind of indicator on the spam board for when a case has reached the point that it needs to be added to the Spam blacklist on meta. Since only meta admins can add to the blacklist, and not everybody knows who we are, it would be helpful to have a centralized place we could skim every so often and add things as needed. (Obviously, most spamming cases can be solved with a block of the offender, and do not rise to the level of having to be blacklisted on every Wikimedia project, and dozens of non-Wikimedia projects that rely on our blacklist.) As for the latter, I think a Wikipedia:Requests for revision removal (to follow the naming conventions of things like "Requests for checkuser" and "Requests for arbitration", and avoid the confusion of what exactly "oversight" is) would be an excellent idea. Very helpful for those of us with the oversight permission, and for those of us who are meta admins. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 02:30, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi - I need some clarification. Should links to categories that are lists of users be included in the main Article space?</p>
<p><b>Dispute details.</b> It seems clear to me that a reference to a category that contains lists of wikipedians (links to the User space) is a self-reference that should be avoided. Yesterday, I happened upon the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisville%2C_Kentucky_392f.html" title="Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a> article to do some research - noticed the link in the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisville%2C_Kentucky_392f.html#See_also" title="Louisville, Kentucky">see also</a> section and removed it. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman">User:Stevietheman</a> has reverted the change twice - with comments <i>"(rv to last edit by Stevietheman; the "metadata" is staying)"</i> and <i>"(rv; it's staying)."</i> I brought the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Talk%7ELouisville%2C_Kentucky_8e50.html#Link_to_list_of_wikipedians" title="Talk:Louisville, Kentucky">issue up on the talk page</a> and the only other editor to comment agreed that it should not be in the article space. I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Louisville%2C_Kentucky&amp;diff=56120212&amp;oldid=56074115" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Louisville%2C_Kentucky&amp;diff=56120212&amp;oldid=56074115" rel="nofollow">removed it again</a>, and linked to it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Louisville%2C_Kentucky&amp;diff=56120212&amp;oldid=56074115" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Louisville%2C_Kentucky&amp;diff=56120212&amp;oldid=56074115" rel="nofollow">the talk page</a> instead.</p>
<p>Am I correct here that this is a self-reference that should be in the article space - it seems stupid to edit war about something like this so I am going to abandon my attempts to follow the style guide here for a bit, but think that some clarification from an admin could be helpful in resolving the issue.

I blocked Kurt for continuing to put misinformation into articles and for refusing to come to an agreement with Deng. This has been going on for 2 months now. We've tried every method possible to stop this. Both users have been blocked. A RfC was opened earlier this month. That didn't do it.

Has Kurt acted poorly as well? Yes. But we cannot and should not let users do what Deng is doing. It pretty much defines disruption. But I myself am tired of watching this farce continue. And as I said, this didn't just start. If you look through SuperDeng's contribs, I believe that over 80 of them (and probably more) are reverts of Kurt. I don't care what someone has done on here. That's uncalled for.

<p>This matter has been discussed before on the incident board as can be seen here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive90#SuperDeng.27s_and_Kurt_Leyman.27s_revert_wars" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive90#SuperDeng.27s_and_Kurt_Leyman.27s_revert_wars" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive90#SuperDeng.27s_and_Kurt_Leyman.27s_revert_wars</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperDeng_2807.html" title="User:SuperDeng">Deng</a> 17:10, 31 May 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>Also the RFC was made by me Super Deng against kurt it can be seen here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Kurt_Leyman" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Kurt_Leyman" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Kurt_Leyman</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperDeng_2807.html" title="User:SuperDeng">Deng</a> 17:10, 31 May 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>Now to the matter at hand as can be seen in both matters the RFC and the IncidentArchive, the facts are simple kurt alters sourced figures with numbers that he pulls out of thin air, I then revert it to the sourced numbers. It is as simple as that. Anyone who wants to know more just click on the 2 links.[[[User:SuperDeng|Deng]] 17:10, 31 May 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>another matter here if importance is that in this text it can be proven that and admin was wrong, --&gt; so this means the world must end. This is wrong <i>for 8 (yes 8) reverts in 2 hours on the <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josef_Stalin_83d9.html" title="Josef Stalin">Josef Stalin</a> page.</i> <b>And I can prove it</b> if someone requests it. The admin confuses reverts with fixing typos and the adding of references neither which are reverts. It is not a revert to add a references, it is not a revert to fix typos. Also this matter is extremly complex and anyone who wants to do so must atleast sacrifice many houers to look into what has actually been going on, on the stalin page.(<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperDeng_2807.html" title="User:SuperDeng">Deng</a> 17:10, 31 May 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>And have not better ways been tried? Also if a person would add <i>penis breast sex more penis</i> then removeing that would be no problem, and if that person would add it in many articles then removeing it in many articles would also be no problem. The matter at hand is that what Kurt does is much harder to spot then <i>Big penis ooh yeah</i>. He alters numbers of things that existed some 60 years ago, for example he changes the number of guns a ship had. Now if he were to write <i>penis big boobies ooh yeah</i> anyone could see that that was wrong. But removeing a few numbers from an article or altering them, is a diffrent story. Who would know that the info is wrong. It is like changeing the birthday of some not so famous singer who would know? If someone were to add <i>Big boobs i love them</i> to some long forgoten singer then anyone could see that that is wrong but changeing the birthday from august 15 to june 12 is a different matter. Also kurt mass vandalizes many articles therefore there needs to be many reverts and he then re vandalizes the same articles again and again creating even more reverts. <i>Big penis suck it hard</i> can be seen by anyone as wrong but altering figures in a long forgotten battle cant be seen by anyone and only a few would ever know that it was wrong. That is why it is critical to fight Kurt for every inch so that he can not spread misinformation and create vast amounts of false and incorrect information.

<dd>What about Wombdpsw and TBeatty and Cal Burrattino ... What was your evidence again? ahh yes he wrote "lets keep it NPOV" ... Good one. How many more people you 3 going to accuse of being sock puppets, this is beyond fishing its intimidation tactics. TBeatty asks for clarification on Merecat and all of sudden people are accuing the user of being merecat, Burrattino edits an article the 3 hold dear and he is merecat also. Wombdpsw edits Iraq War and he also is a sock puppet. I find it all to conveinent that anyone who opposes the view of RyanFreisling, Mr Tibbs Nescio and Phr end up being accused of being sock puppets. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 17:35, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I restored this userpage because of a <i>polite</i> request from the user. SlimVirgin never explained to me why she blanked and protected it, but I think it's because HK insinuates on the page that even administrators can push POVs and vote-stack sometimes (I don't see any problem with admitting that publicly). Since it's unprotected, feel free to nominate it for <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMFD_9ce3.html" title="WP:MFD">WP:MFD</a> if you would rather not see <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_wikiphilosophies_1501.html" title="User:Karmafist/wikiphilosophies">rants and accusations of cabal rule in userspace</a>.

<p>Hi. A few days ago, I noticed an anonymous user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=B.J._Averell&amp;diff=56046531&amp;oldid=55135022" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=B.J._Averell&amp;diff=56046531&amp;oldid=55135022" rel="nofollow">deleting content</a> from an article I recently improved. The user's IP address and the nature of the edits were consitent with what I would expect from B.J. Averell himself. When a new user, User:Hexadisc, began making essentially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=B.J._Averell&amp;diff=56051816&amp;oldid=56050343" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=B.J._Averell&amp;diff=56051816&amp;oldid=56050343" rel="nofollow">the same edits</a>, I began a discussion with him on <a href="../../../h/e/x/User_talk%7EHexadisc_6ec0.html" title="User talk:Hexadisc">his talk page</a>, in which Hexadisc asserted that he is either B.J. or a representative of him, and agreed to discuss concerns on the article's <a href="../../../b/2E/j/Talk%7EB.J._Averell_80d7.html" title="Talk:B.J. Averell">talk page</a>. This has yet to occur, and in the meantime I have been reverting similar edits from other new users, who Hexadisc claims are more upset associates of his and not sock puppets. I have been eagerly awaiting a discussion on the article's talk page, but today Hexadisc himself has made essentially the same edits to the article without the discussion I thought we had agreed should take place.</p>
<p>At this point, I am uncomfortable reverting these edits again, especially from a representative of B.J. Averell who seems to have a grasp of the preferred method of dealing with his concerns. To ensure that proper steps and a fair discussion take place, I would like to ask that one or more administrators become involved. I believe that someone who can more authoratitively interpret <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> and convince Hexadisc that a discussion can result in a fair article, as well as evaluate my interactions with him to ensure that I haven't gotten something wrong, can make a difference and satisfy the concerns of all more fairly and effectively than I can do right now.

<dd>IMHO, the version to which Hexadisc made edits was wholly permissible and appropriate per <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> but likely was a bit <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">crufty</a>; the current version, even as it is demonstrably less critical of the subject, seems to provide a more encyclopedic treatment of the subject.

<p>This is just a public announcment (maybe this gets more readership than bot approvals normally does) - anyways the proposal is @ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3ABots/Requests_for_approvals#Tawkerbot2A_.28WoW_gone_as_fast_as_normal_vandalism.29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3ABots/Requests_for_approvals#Tawkerbot2A_.28WoW_gone_as_fast_as_normal_vandalism.29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3ABots/Requests_for_approvals#Tawkerbot2A_.28WoW_gone_as_fast_as_normal_vandalism.29</a> - essentially its operation is described there. Several users have said that RfA wasn't the correct place for discussion hence the bot request but Essjay has expressed concern its not advertised enough and when the flags are set it would raise hell. Its essentially a replacement for the offline / inactive Curps bot, as usual if anyone has any questions you know where to ask. -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 06:48, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tawker, that is rather skewed version of my concerns. Given the past expression of community opposition to bots with admin priviledges, and the fact that even Curps' bot did not have wide community support (read the discussion of giving him checkuser if you're not aware of what was said), I was concerned about whether the community was even aware of this. It had never been mentioned here, or on the Incident's board, where it would be commented on, nor was it ever mentioned, even a note directing attention to the bot discussion, on RfA, where adminship discussions are expected to be placed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Announcing that a new bot is being placed into service, and that it is being granted adminship, without ever notifying the vast majority of the community, smacks of secrecy, and it was my concern that the community would feel the discussion had been hidden. While I've always apprecaited Curpsbot and the work it does, I do not support granting adminship to completely separate bot accounts, and there is considerable concern about it at the Foundation level (one such bot was desysopped just last month after reports that it had gone berzerk); if individual admins want to run bots on thier accounts, that's for the community to handle, but to set up a completely separate bot account and grant it adminship without notification to the majority of the community is quite simply not the way we do things around here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The community outcry over the use of Tawkerbot2 was queited for the most part by assurances that it would never become an adminbot; this strikes me as a direct reversal of those assurances, and the assurances you made when you were granted adminship, that the bots would remain separate from admin priviledges. I can see us right back here in a month when this bot is blocking users based on Tawkerbot2 warnings. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 07:09, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said, I could have run it as my personal user account but I believe in a little thing known as honesty and I won't run it as myself (despite it being suggested to me multiple times.) In fact, I was asking around trying to figure where the correct place to get consensus would be, I was told it's not a matter for RfA, to leave it on bot approvals, then today it was suggested AN was a good place and hence it was posted. I should also note that <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> had offered to set flags yesterday but I didn't think there was consensus or a mandate to run this bot so I asked him to decline until such a time. I think I did make a mistake, this is basically a unique bot, the only thing it really shares with the revert-o-bot is it shares the same IRC feed.

<dd>To be entirely honest, I don't believe for a second that it's proposed scope will remain it's scope for long at all, and given the way this proposal was handled, I have to question whether the community will be consulted <i>at all</i> before new functions are added. I feel completely deceived, as I was told, personally, by both you and Tawker, that admin functionality would never be added to these bots (this semantic garbage about "we added an 'A'" is total bull, and you know it). This is a complete reversal from what the community was told when Tawkerbot2 was set up, and I'm beginning to suspect quite strongly that this has been the plan all along. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 07:27, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have some rather strong reservations about sysopping the bot, but the request for bot approval seems to be rather strong support. I'm assuming that no 'crat will sysop the account without an RfA for it, and in that RfA, I intend to oppose unless I'm pursuaded otherwise. I mean, the bot's great, but I feel a certain creep here--I agree with Essjay that I wouldn't be shocked to see its scope grow and grow without any communication with the community. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 07:33, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Essjay, you were told that Tawkerbot2 would never need admin access. This is a new proposal for a new different bot with a highly limited scope. If a bot with admin access does something outside of its scope, I would think that would be grounds for desysoping the bot and quite possibly the sponsor. To quote from Tawker's RFA: "If a supermajority of users (95% or so) wants the bot to have sysop, sure, I'll think about it" He was not categorically opposed to a sysop'ed bot.</dd>

Unlike Amir Taheri, Bani Torof is not an employee of the right-wing Benador Associates think tank in the US which is definitely a source of propaganda. He is an Iranian writer living and working in Iran and with no political affiliation. The reason some editors have a problem with him is because he writes on Arab heritage in Khuzestan and that seems to offend the sensibilities of some.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 12:06, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My dear brother, Mr. Taheri uses "verifiable" sources like CIA! That is better than your "Centre for Iran Studies" that does not even exist! Again that you remove the tag says everything. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 12:10, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The CIA does not comment on Khuzestan's demographics and Taheri is no expert in the field.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 12:15, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think both of you need to calm down here. Wikipedia does not function totally on the truth. The truth has to be verifiable and backed with proper citations. Please review Wikipedia's policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citing sources</a>. And yes, it is always advisable to have a discussion on the talk page of the article in case you are going to make major changes to the article. But, always remember to cite the sources, and official ones from the Internet (preferably, so that they may be confirmed easily by other users).
