<p>This injunction is not a ban. Do not suddenly pretend that normal standards can be made more flexibly interpreted. Use common sense judgement.

<dd>I must point out that an injunction is not normal standards, that it was phrased as a tight leash and that it was quickly voted for as a tight leash. Probably a more productive approach that would reflect well upon your conduct would be to show that you can keep to it flawlessly (which would be strongly to your credit), rather than showing that you cannot (which would be strongly to your discredit) - surely that's the obvious sensible response - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 12:46, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC) (whilst logged in on <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkady_Rose_3b70.html" title="User:Arkady Rose">User:Arkady Rose</a>'s machine, my apologies!)</dd>

<dd>The injunction banned Netoholic from reverting in the Wikipedia namespace. It seems in this case he called attention to Neutrality's removal of a template in an unsual way, apparently in order precisely to avoid doing a revert, completely in compliance with the injunction. It got called a "revert" anyway, and he still got blocked. If the meaning of "revert" can be stretched to cover this edit, then almost any edit can be interpreted as a revert, and Netoholic might as well interpret the Arb Comm injuction as giving any administrator the right to block him if he edits in the Wikipedia namespace at all. Is that what the Arb Comm intended? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:29, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While the HEC is voluntary, perhaps in future we could borrow the HEC editing rules for our concept of <i>revert parole</i>.

<dd>Had I been asked to, I would have voluntarily adhered to the HEC/one-revert guideline while my ArbCom case was pending, as an act to show my good faith. This "zero-revert" injunction is unprecedented and is <i>practically</i> a ban, since I can make no mistake and every edit (even this very one) needs to be perfect so as not to trigger some gung-ho reaction. I can't even self-revert. I fear making any change lest someone dig up a similar edit from months ago and slam down the ban-hammer. If I make a change to something, it must be <i>extraordinarily</i> different from anything else. I hope at least the ArbCom takes this lesson away and doesn't bother with this again. A full namespace ban is at least cut-and-dry, and one-revert restrictions avoid problems with admins being "loose" with their interpretations. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 15:00, 2005 Apr 8 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said above, I think, practically speaking, that you are banned from more editing in the Wikipedia namespace than it might first appear. Almost any edit that touches existing text can apparently be labelled a revert by some admin who might object to it. Even completely new text better not look too much like something that was previously deleted. In this case, replacing a template with a comment that there used to be a template there, and suggesting that the matter should be discussed on the Talk page, is a "revert" of the template removal in some administrators' books. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:13, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is where administrator discretion comes in, and common sense. Nobody is going to ban anybody for four edits in a row tinkering with older text. Nobody would even ban Netoholic for four edits in a row that tinker with older text. And if they did, I would remove the block as soon as I saw it. But that's not what happened here. Netoholic got reverted and found a way to insert the same content in different wording. Blankfaze saw through the stealth revert and blocked. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 17:03, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I basically agree with your latter sentence. On the one hand, I do think that there's a plausible case to be made that this belongs in e.g. Wikibooks. Mind, I'm not saying I think I've <i>concluded</i> that it's more appropriate there than in Wikipedia:, it might well be better suited where it is. However, I don't think it's a slam-dunk that it ought to stay where it is. So I think for Neutrality to simply remove the template was out of line - it was a good-faith addition to the page. How he found his was there is an interesting question - I assume it was after it was listed in Netoholic's RfAr. It seems the Neutrality's following Netoholic around - which is bordering on (yet another) unhealthy Wiki-obsession. At the very least, getting in a revert war with someone <s>whose arbitration case he is about to have to rule on</s> displays very poor judgement indeed. On the other hand, Netoholic's sly reference to the template in his second edit really was (basically) an attempt to undo the substance of Neutrality's revert, while staying within some literalistic interpretation of his injunction. Everyone involved in this shabby affair ought to take a Wikibreak. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 20:35, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, Neutrality is a party to the case and has recused himself as an arbitrator, so he's not going to be ruling on anything affecting Netoholic.

<dd>Yeah, the 50,000 foot view, without trying to figure out all the rights and wrongs of this case is that it is fundamentally a petty, obsessive, ongoing feud between Netoholic, on the one hand, and primarily Neutrality and Snowpinner on the other, and that they are all guilty of much the same transgressions against civility and Wikipedia policy. Unfortunately for Netoholic, Snowspinner is an admin, and Neutrality was elected as an arbitrator. Fairness demands that all of them should be rebuked and disciplined, but that probably is not going to happen. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 21:54, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To try to reduce this to a Netoholic vs. Neutrality &amp; Snowspinner feud is disingenuous. Just a quick look at Netoholic's <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Netoholic_b71c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Netoholic">RFA</a> (vote:3/28/7) will show that just about everybody who has had dealings with <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> has had a negative experience with him. How many Wikipedia editors have been listed as reasons that someone has left the Wikipedia (e.g. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">User:Mintguy</a>) or as a reason for Wikivacations besides Netoholic? <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> apparently tried to work with Netoholic and was burned by him (See Raul654's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_mediation&amp;diff=6845946&amp;oldid=6845633" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_mediation&amp;diff=6845946&amp;oldid=6845633" rel="nofollow">RFM</a>).

With that said, I will agree that it looks like Neutrality has also not been on his best behaviour either. <a href="../../../a/s/y/User%7EAsylumInmate_3ea9.html" title="User:AsylumInmate"><sub>Asylum</sub></a><a href="../../../a/s/y/User_talk%7EAsylumInmate_5737.html" title="User talk:AsylumInmate"><sup>Inmate</sup></a> 06:33, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Only one person "seems to have ever come to an accomodation or understanding of Netoholic"? You're trippin'. Did you mean to say that, in those words? I just don't have the time to wade through the voluminous documentation of this feud and take a stand on it, unfortunately, but it seems outrageous to me to speak of a long-term and useful contributor in that way. It's literally untrue: my own experience of Netoholic has been as a helpful and considerate experienced user. He helped me with practical stuff when I was new in June, and a little while back I noticed his gentle touch when reasoning with a particular social-skills-impaired contributor (who I needn't scandalize by mentioning here, especially as he has now left the project), that I for my part found it extremely difficult to keep a wikiloving tone towards. Whatever's been going down in this conflict, I really hate to see somebody's whole good work for wikipedia dismissed like that. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a>|<a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">Talk</a> 09:25, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User:203.103.60.119 made a series of edits today, including blanking <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">User:Dr Zen</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/_/User_talk%7EDr_Zen_fb35.html" title="User talk:Dr Zen">User talk:Dr Zen</a> twice (second one with edit summaries of "Please respect my wishes. Zen"); both times he was reverted. I left a message on his talk page asking if he was Dr Zen; he responded on mine that he was. He was then blocked for vandalism. Since he was not warned before being blocked, and the blanking appears to be the only vandalism, I am going to unblock him. If I am wrong and anyone wishes to reblock, I will not unblock again. Let me know if I have <del>this wrong</del> <ins>acted inappropriately</ins>.

<dd>I agree; I asked him to log in and make his changes, but he had already been blocked by that point. Actually, that brings up something I'd been wondering: suppose an anonymous user is blocked—can he or she then register or log in and edit? I didn't think so, which is one of the reasons I unblocked. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 06:46, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, for what it's worth, I don't think it's Dr. Zen. If he was he'd have logged in before he was even blocked to make the changes. I think the anon is attempting impersonation. Can we email Zen directly from his user page? Is he a mailing list contributor? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:46, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)

<li>It would appear that he can be emailed from his user page. I don't know if he is a mailing list contributor or not (I'm not so I don't know how to find out). <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 09:14, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>That IP address is registered to the same area as a previous IP address known to have been used by Dr Zen, so I'd guess it's him. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:20, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)

<li>It points to the same spot as at least two other IPs he's used in the past, actually.

<li>Blocked for bad-faith editing: <i>They may be the worst band of all-time and are certainly a bain on the contemporary music scene. A University of Connecticut student who unwittingly attended a Mastodon concert in October 2003 summed up his reaction to the band. "There were a lot of large, drunken, sweaty men dressed in ripped jeans and Metallica t-shirts," he said. "They were bobbing their heads to the worst music I have ever heard.

IT'S 'UNFAIR' FOR ME TO FIGHT BACK.. I HAVE NEWS FOR ALL OF YOU. LEGALLY, TRUTH IS A DEFENSE -- THE TRUTH IS ON MY SIDE. IT'S OK FOR SQUEAKBOX TO SAY I HAVE BIASES FOR MY ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY WRITTEN ARTICLE ABOUT JAVIER SOLANA -- IT'S NOT OK TO POINT OUT WHAT HE SO FREELY AND PROUDLY CONFESSED TO ME ABOUT HIS BIASES -- HE'S INTO THE NEW AGE MOVEMENT - ALICE BAILEY, RASTAFARIANISM AND ALL. AND FOR THE RECORD, THERE WERE SOLANA FAMILY CONNECTIONS WITH HAILE SELASSIE WHICH ARE DOCUMENTED BY SALVADOR DE MADARIAGA IN HIS BOOK MORNING WITHOUT NOON.

<li>Removed reference to Lindzen paper online at MIT 4 times, blocked for 24 hours for 3RR violation. This user needs to stop trying to gain ownership of articles on this topic, and chill out a bit. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 17:13, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the dates indicated by Cortonin above, what has actually been happening is that Cortonin keeps reverting William M. Connolley, and Connolley in turn keeps reverting Cortonin. If Connolley is guilty of a 3RR violation, therefore, Cortonin himself is equally guilty. I haven't bothered to trace the entire history of this, but this particular revert war seems to have been going on since sometime prior to 8 Apr 2005. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheldon_Rampton_b54a.html" title="User:Sheldon Rampton">Sheldon Rampton</a> 05:09, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>So, file a 3RR on them, making sure to give the diffs. I'll cheerfully block all edit warriors. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 12:23, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

Somehow the software ended up banning me for 48h not 24 (I mailed Jnc but he didn't seem terribly interested). As for the "ownership" nonsense: its nonsense, just like the Lindzen 98%: if you feel like contributing to the science of the article, do please join in.

<li>Let's see - within 5 minutes of receiving your email (I didn't see it immediately - I do sometimes have a life outside the Internet), I had i) checked <a href="../../../i/p/b/Special%7EIpblocklist_2536.html" title="Special:Ipblocklist">Special:Ipblocklist</a> to make sure that your block was not somehow still active (it wasn't in the list of active blocks, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;user=Jnc|block" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;user=Jnc|block" rel="nofollow">log</a> entry says <i>17:10, 9 Apr 2005 Jnc blocked "User:William M. Connolley" with an expiry time of 24 hours</i>); ii) found an auto-block that had been generated on another account by that block; iii) cleared that (<i>01:26, 11 Apr 2005 Jnc unblocked User:#19934</i>); and iv) replied to your email, giving all that information. You have a strange definition of "not .. interested". <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:12, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The point at issue was why the auto-block had ended up blocking me for 48h. This remains unexplained.</li>
<li>Sorry, I have no idea on that; that's a problem for the developers. You need to go over to <a href="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">Mediazilla</a>, and first <a href="../../../b/u/g/Wikipedia%7EBug_reports_020d.html#Searching_for_bugs" title="Wikipedia:Bug reports">check</a> whether the problem has already been reported, and if not, <a href="../../../b/u/g/Wikipedia%7EBug_reports_020d.html#Enter_a_new_bug" title="Wikipedia:Bug reports">enter a new bug report</a>,

<li>Sure. PS: one thing you might want to check - when you go to <a href="../../../p/r/e/Special%7EPreferences_a6b2.html" title="Special:Preferences">Special:Preferences</a> it should list your "internal ID number" - if that number is the same as the one above (#19934) that would probably we worth noting in any bug report. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 18:42, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure it's a security issue to release it (I can't think of anything one could do with it), but probably best not to. In any event, I have no use for it. The fact that the account that was auto-blocked was not yours is a bit of data which would be useful to add to the bug report, though. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 00:15, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is a dispute on the naming of certain China-related articles that has gotten entirely out of hand. Basically, there seems to be a naming consensus (involving <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">User:SchmuckyTheCat</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">User:Huaiwei</a> and <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">User:Jguk</a>, and possibly others), and one person intent on overthrowing it - <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">User:Instantnood</a>. I've seen this ongoing debate all over WikiPedia the last couple of days, even if I'm not doing anything China-related.</p>

Both an RfC and an RfAr have been filed for the matter; it would seem appropriate to postpone all these similar discussions pending the outcome of those request.

<p>I've just received the following two e-mails:</p>
<dl>
<dd>62.255.64.9 has been autoblocked due to your block:</dd>
<dd>'Autoblocked because your IP address has been recently used by "Gumba Gumba power". The reason given for Gumba Gumba power's block is: "new account of blocked user, vandalising Holocaust denial".'</dd>
<dd>The IP is not listed in the BlockList, so I cannot discover when the block expires.</dd>

<dd>Apparently my IP has been blocked from editing on Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>However,</dd>
<dd>a) The banned IP in question is 62.255.64.9. My IP, however, is 80.7.169.132. That said, I am house-sharing with others, which may have caused this confusion.</dd>
<dd>b) I did not attempt to edit other articles prior to me being informed of the ban. The user name "Gumba Gumba Power" is completely alien to me. I certainly did not do anything which I feel would warrant me being banned from editing articles on Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Thanks for your time.</dd>

<p>Your explanations lack any credibility and you are wrong as usual. When I have the time to deal with your tampering, I will post it in the correct place.

<p>The only reason I Vfd'd Ron Branson was because I thought him not noteworthy, and therefore wanted to see if other users agreed with me or not. I put lots of things on Vfd, but always based on my judgement of the piece. If I had been going tit for tat I would have put all his stuff up for Vfd, but the aother articles were all clearly valid. I am quite simply not cyberstalking Agwiii. I improved all the articles he refers to, removing repetitions, unencyclopedic bits etc, all good wiki work. So I feel I am the one being harrassed, compared to the Khmer Rouge, etc, --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:57, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>For the man who wrote on his home page that, "My greatest achievements here so far have been elevating Haile Selassie I to the status of Almighty God," you bring an important political perspective to the reform of the American Judicial System. Clearly You know absolutly nothing about the issue. You've admitted you don't live in the United States, so then, what legitmate motive could you have --- and the only answer is none. You know nothing about Branson or J.A.I.L 4 Judges. Your sole reason for the Vfd is harassment. As we say here, "never argue with a fool - they will drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience." <a href="../../../a/g/w/User%7EAgwiii_34b2.html" title="User:Agwiii">Agwiii</a> 20:00, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>SqueakBox (talk · contributions) has a vendetta against anything that I post or edit.</p>
<ul>
<li>He follows my work on Wikipedia and dog posts creating intentional distortions of the facts in its bogus claim to be neutral.</li>

<ul>
<li>Most recently, it vandalized the J.A.I.L. 4 Judges ® page by turning the registered acronym into the word jail.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This person is a prolific vandalizer of my work, a dog poster whose only purpose is harassment. These actions constitute the crime of cyberstalking, according to Florida Statutes 784.048(1)(d).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The behavior of Squeakbox is typical of the online harrassers and cyberstalkers. After a period of antagonizing and threatening, the perpetrator often tries to spin the story around and play the victim.</li>

<ul>
<li>Typical of those who practice online harassment, Squeakbox (talk · contributions) is now accusing the target of his harassment of his very actions.</li>

<li>glad to hear it. All we can tell you here is: If you want to take legal action, do it, but cease from editing Wikipedia while the case is pending. If you do not, don't make void threats and follow dispute resolution like everyone else.

<li>I agree with dab and mgm. At this point you need to either leave Wikipedia or stop making legal threats.

On his own account, however, he has removed a VfD notice from an article he started (Ron Branson <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ron_Branson&amp;diff=12122345&amp;oldid=12122273" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ron_Branson&amp;diff=12122345&amp;oldid=12122273" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>), and has struck out one of SqueakBox's comments on <a href="../../../a/b/o/Talk%7EAbortion_3254.html" title="Talk:Abortion">Talk:Abortion</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abortion&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12134819" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abortion&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12134819" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. he really needs to be dealt with quickly, as things are getting worse, but I'm not clear that he's done anything that warrants a block, and he won't listen to the various editors who have tried to get him to stop and to calm down.

<dd>It's now becoming rather more complicated. This user refuses to discuss anything with anybody.

<dd>It's true that SqueakBox deleted one of Agwiii's comments, but it was part of the revert of Agwiii's tampering with SqueakBox's comment. I also think that it would be unfair to treat them in the same way, as SqueakBox is rather more the victim in all this. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 22:09, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>Mel, your lack of objectivity and neutrality is the final straw. To think that Squeakbox is the victim is the equivalent of making O.J. Simpson the victim of Nicole Brown.

<li>Thanks for seeking out advice of other admins rather than acting unilaterally this time. I respect that. I created the redirects because I feel that they fall within the requirements on <a href="../../../r/_/_/WP%7ER_3abc.html" title="WP:R">WP:R</a>. A direct quote from that page: "For example, redirecting Dubya to George W. Bush might be considered offensive, but the redirect aids accidental linking, makes the creation of duplicate articles less likely, and is useful to some people, so it should not be deleted." Furthermore, there has long been a redirect from <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slick_Willy_0a74.html" title="Slick Willy">Slick Willy</a> to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, as well as numerous other unflattering nicknames for various individuals (<a href="../../../b/u/t/Butcher_of_Baghdad_7b62.html" title="Butcher of Baghdad">Butcher of Baghdad</a> --&gt; <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>). Either all of these should be deleted or none should be. I opened a thread on <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a> myself for these two; I am not vandalizing or trying to sneak anything past anyone here. Anyone should feel free to discuss the issue there, but I do not believe that admins should take it upon themselves to unilaterally decide that these redirects are inappropriate. They should go through the prescribed process. 63.173.114.141 22:35, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>There must be something about this US President that appears to get the worst out of people... Being reasonably neutral (Non American and disliking Bush and Clinton with equal measure) I would think it is eminently wrong to have such clearly offensively meant nicknames link directly to the person in question as if these were valid names. The appropriate way of dealing with them is to make them all redirects to the nickname page. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 00:23, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can understand not wanting to have a redirect directly from Smirking Chimp to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.

However, I don't see what the objection is to redirecting it to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_U.S._Presidential_nicknames_f422.html" title="List of U.S. Presidential nicknames">List of U.S. Presidential nicknames</a>, which obviously <i>describes</i> what terms some people have used to refer to Presidents, without endorsing them. I still believe that <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a> is the most appropriate forum for settling such disputes. I can see a justification for leaving out Commander Codpiece and Whistle Ass, since they have far fewer Google hits, and this is why I did not try to re-create those redirects. But a nickname with hundreds of thousands of Google hits is clearly newsworthy. And it <i>is</i> mentioned in the article. Why is a redirect inappropriate? BTW, would anyone have an objection to changing <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slick_Willy_0a74.html" title="Slick Willy">Slick Willy</a> to redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_U.S._Presidential_nicknames_f422.html" title="List of U.S. Presidential nicknames">List of U.S. Presidential nicknames</a>, instead of directly to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>? 63.173.114.141 01:26, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to me that the anon has a point. If Smirking Chimp is an inherently POV redirect that should be deleted, then so is <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slick_Willy_0a74.html" title="Slick Willy">Slick Willy</a>. One cannot argue that one should be "in" while the other is "out" because of currency and degree of use, because both of them are in common use -- only by different groups with different points of view. Admitting one, and not the other, is far from NPOV. Since Smirking Chimp has been deleted and turned into an entry on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_U.S._Presidential_nicknames_f422.html" title="List of U.S. Presidential nicknames">List of U.S. Presidential nicknames</a>, then <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slick_Willy_0a74.html" title="Slick Willy">Slick Willy</a> should receive the same treatment. Given some of the other articles in Wikipedia (I notice the IFD vote on autofellatio_2.jpg is now completed, and the image was retained), we are being a bit touchy about such a trifle as respect for U.S. Presidents, aren't we? Or does only the reigning one merit respect? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:43, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(written before BM comments above, but caught in an edit conflict) <i>Smirking Chimp</i> has enough currency to warrant a redirect to the nicknames page. I think the anon is raising a valid point regarding disparaging POV redirects. Slick Willy should probably also redirect to the nicknames page rather than directly to Bill Clinton. There's no need to encourage (or at least make it easy for) people to use such slang POV terms to refer to either Clinton or Bush in articles. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 01:51, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most of Smirking Chimp's currency seems to come from the website or blog, not because it's actually used as a nickname. Anyway, we probably shouldn't be basing decisions on Google searches alone. Slick Willy has entered the public consciousness and has been referred to as Clinton's nickname in the mainstream press.

<dd>I don't think either nickname is used very much by the "mainstream" press. Both of these are nicknames which are used by people who are inclined to use these insulting nicknames. That means, generally, Republicans use SW and Democrats use SC, and both are very commonly used. If Wikipedia is going to have one, it should have the other, or else it can kiss any pretense of NPOV goodbye. You could argue that it isn't encyclopedic to have articles or even redirects concerning common insulting nicknames for national leaders, but that would apply to all of them, and not just to the national leaders who one thinks deserve to be insulted. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 03:04, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know who keeps deleting this article, but I am creating it again as a redirect. This is NOT vandalism. Besides the original anon, of whom good faith should be assumed, four other people in this discussion have given reasons why this article should exist. These were Calton, Michael Snow, Bkonrad, and me. Since it is not vandalism, no administrator has the authority to delete it just because he doesn't accept these arguments.

<dd>I don't know Commander Codpiece but Smirking Chimp seems reasonable. We can't go around deleting valid redirects just because they're unflattering. This particular case doesn't seem to be related to the google-bombing phenomenon where, for instance "Great French Military Victories" when queried with the "I'm feeling lucky" button was caused to return no result except the question "Did you mean Great French Military Defeats?" <a href="http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/images/blpic-frenchmilitaryvictories.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/images/blpic-frenchmilitaryvictories.htm" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, however I'm sure that there are cases where a redirect could be misused in a similar manner, creating an unflattering but unencyclopedic redirect. Such redirects should probably be judged on content and not treated as vandalism as a matter of course--it's a judgement call. I don't think the administrator was wrong to delete and then seek advice here. Deleted redirects can always be restored if found to be appropriate. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:58, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Turns out that Timwi deleted the picture in error during a vandalism cleanup. dab, I think your suggestion should probably be made on the image talk page. As you are probably aware, image size can be adjusted on the including page.

<dd>I agree the picture should be kept for now, possibly in a different format, but if nobody supports me on this, I'll just drop it.

<dd>I realize a majority wants the image gone. I am referring to the more general idea that when an ifd vote reaches a majority, but no "consensus", that it should then be looked into if the image can be <i>modified</i> to address some of the concerns of those who want to delete it. It strikes me as obvious that the voters of 'keep' should be open to such modifications since they can see a majority disagrees with them. It seems straightforward to me, but do we have anything like this in the guidelines, and if not, does anyone else think that we should? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 20:26, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd>It being no longer possible to inline the image solves any vandalism concerns, does it not? How was this done—is it a software change, tied to the specific image name?

<dd>The inlining was done by a "fr:en:" hack, and support for this kind of interwiki redirect has been turned off. I must say I find the idea that one must delete images simply because they've been used for vandalism somewhat mind-boggling. If you delete one, surely another will be used. We'd end up deleting every image that could be regarded as even remotely shocking, when all that is required is to revert the vandalism. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 07:23, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>the concept of consensus is based on <i>respect for minorities</i>, i.e. avoid the "tyranny of the 51%". I have no respect for minorities who lack respect for the <i>majority</i>, entirely.

<dd>dab, for now you're <i>alone</i>, the only person suggesting degrading the picture. You're not even trying to get a consensus. Yes, you're showing disrespect. No, a minority that fails to support deletion for a picture is not required to support your proposal to vandalize it as an alternative. Put this as a proposal and get consensus on it, and stop trying to treat that slim majority, blatantly gerrymandered as it was, as anything other than a badge of shame for the vote-fixer who gleaned it by spamming editors who he thought would support deletion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 10:13, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, he can always discuss things on the talk pages, and any notable theories can be included and treated in a NPOV manner. I think there's been a worrying tendency towards the idea that these views should be excluded outright.

<p>I agree with your sentiment. If he can produce a NPOV treatment of the subject matter that's fine.

<dd>Personally, I wouldn't have blocked at all, but I think a ban of perhaps a day could've been justifiable. A week is tantamount to telling someone "go away. We don't want you here." <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:14, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>GRider broke the arbcom parole the day after it was imposed. This was a clear attempt at thumbing his nose at the community, and the block was entirely appropriate. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:25, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with BrokenSegue that this violation was quite flagrant. If you check the block log, you'll notice that I actually blocked GRider for a week before Snowspinner imposed his block. Last week, GRider violated the ArbCom's temporary injunction and was blocked for a day. After the ArbCom ruling was posted on his talk page, GRider blanked it and proceeded to edit VfD pages. This can not be taken as anything but blatant disregard for his deletion-related ban. It also emphasizes GRider's refusal to ever discuss his behavior. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 23:28, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are several points to consider with this:
<ol>
<li>Is the page he edited deletion related? I think everyone can agree that VfD is deletion related.</li>
<li>Was he covered by the ban at the time? The resolution was passed at 18:53, 10 Apr 2005. This edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Jordan_Middle_School&amp;diff=12175749&amp;oldid=12173688" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Jordan_Middle_School&amp;diff=12175749&amp;oldid=12173688" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> was made at 18:23, 11 Apr 2005. So, yes he was.</li>
<li>Could he reasonably be expected to have known about the ban? Arbitrator <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">Sannse</a> left the message about the ban on his user page at 18:58, 10 Apr 2005 (correcting the link 1 minute later) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GRider&amp;diff=12169712&amp;oldid=12129840" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GRider&amp;diff=12169712&amp;oldid=12129840" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. At 16:37, 11 Apr 2005 GRider edited his talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GRider&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=12169712" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GRider&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=12169712" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, removing Sannse's post. It is safe to say therefore that he was well aware of the ban.</li>
<li>Does this deserve a punishment? Imho, yes. This was a clear violation of the arbcom resolution. If such rullings are not enforced, what is the point of the ArbCom?</li>
<li>What punishment does it deserve? This was a deliberate violation (imho) - editing a page that was clearly deletion related (indeed it is a vote on a school, the exact sort of article that broke the camels back and led to the case in the first place), less than 24 hours after the ban was enacted, and less than 2 hours after he had removed the notice of the ban from his talk page. Short of one or more frivolous nominatons to VfD and posting a message on his talk page about it, I don't think he could be more blatant in his defiance. If this isn't punished severely then what message does it send to him and other users subject to arbcom cases/resolutions/injunctions? It would say that it is fine to ignore them, and you'll only get a short ban at most. Imho that would be a very <i><a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Thing_c3ab.html" title="Bad Thing">Bad Thing</a></i>. The maximum penalty available is 1 week, and based on my reasoning I feel Snowspinner is perfectly correct to have blocked him for that amount of time. Fwiw, I am not an admin, but would likely have done the same thing as Snowspinner. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 23:46, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Does Grider have to check in with his Parole officer every week or so, to make sure he's still on the path to righteousness? Did we outfit him with a Wikibraclet on his leg so that he won't wander into areas his "parole board" has decided he shouldn't violate? Is there a set of "rules" on Wikipedia regarding his behaviour that aren't, of course, editable and changeable by the entire community, including Grider? I am concerned that if Grider is a recidivist and ends up back in Wikijail, he may get shanked by some of the other miscreants. Apparently if he uses Wikipedia facilities to the best of his abilities, he will be punished. Does his name need to be changed to GharrisonBergeron? I'm all for it; then we'll know what he's about. Too bad his name doesn't have a letter "A" in it, so he can change it to red. I hope I meet none of you in the road. --<a href="../../../j/s/c/User%7EJscott_f61d.html" title="User:Jscott">Jscott</a> 17:33, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I used to follow this guy around and remove his sneaky vandalism, but after a while I simply gave it up. It takes much time to fact check every one of his many many edits, you can't block him as he'll simply use another IP, etc. Between his vandalism he makes alot of valid edits as well, usually hiding his vandalism behind the good edits. He likes to create lists (like lists of episodes) with tiny mistakes in them for example. Sometimes I'd really like to simply revert him on sight, no matter what he is doing, and if there is consensus for that, I'll gladly do the job. I created a <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_MyWatchlists_SVGuy_9e5f.html" title="User:ContiE/MyWatchlists/SVGuy">watchlist</a> (just use the "Related changes" links) a while ago of articles that he edits frequently, feel free to use it and add new vandalized articles. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 12:51, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)
