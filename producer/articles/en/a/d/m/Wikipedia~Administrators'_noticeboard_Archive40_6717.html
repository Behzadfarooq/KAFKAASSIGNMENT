<p>I'm looking for a volunteer putting <a href="../../../p/r/e/Talk%7EPrem_Rawat_f4e1.html" title="Talk:Prem Rawat">Talk:Prem Rawat</a> on his watchlist, enforcing <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, guiding Wikipedia newbies not to use the talk page for endless discussions of the subject etc. I've tried but I'm not up to the task.

<dd>I tried once, in mid-February, and I burned out like <i>that</i>. It's a terrible place. I'd say no prior involvement is more than a plus, it's a precondition, because once people have tried to do those things you describe, Pjacobi, they're unlikely to go near it ever again. I mean, I tried, and look at me now, sticking straws in my hair, muttering to myself, clutching at the air. <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html" title="Prem Rawat">Prem Rawat</a> and its talkpage are home to some contributors (I speak euphemistically) who edit only there, who are at Wikipedia for no other purpose than pushing their POV at that article. It's a lot like the notorious <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bogdanov_Affair_8cfb.html" title="The Bogdanov Affair">Bogdanov Affair</a> in that respect. Frankly, in several cases, I don't think it's that they're newbies (they aren't any more), it's that they're not here to learn. Rather than sending new waves of fresh-faced young admins into these purging fires, it might be time to send the article and its habitual editors straight where <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bogdanov_Affair_8cfb.html" title="The Bogdanov Affair">The Bogdanov Affair</a> ended up: to messy and acrimonious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Regarding_The_Bogdanov_Affair" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Regarding_The_Bogdanov_Affair" rel="nofollow">arbitration</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 12:42, 6 May 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I found your comments, Bishonen, to be unnecessarily negative. Yes, we have sometimes contributors that come with the only intention to bypass policy and push their POV, engage in uncivil behavior and disrupt talk-page discipline. These come and go after a few weeks. But we also have committed contributors that are civil and do a great deal of research to improve the material in the article. At the end of the day, it is perseverance and patience that wins the game against POV pushing. The article has benefitted from your first intervention and from P. Jacobi's. Efforts have and continue to be made to make the article better, more succint and more compliant. Unnecessary negative comments and comparisons as the ones you made above, only help those that want to sabotage Wikipedia's processes. Your Barnstar to a self-declared POV pusher, commending him for "his efforts to balance the article" after just a cursory look at the article, did not help either, and shows a definitive bias that I am surprised to observe in you. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 15:19, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I fully deserved Bishone's award for keeping the Prem Rawat article balanced against Jossi's POV pushing. Jossi repeatedly removed all specifics of criticism from the summary. Bishonen's observation of Jossi's behavior then was enough or could have been enough to see that Jossi is not exactly the ideal, neutral contributor to that article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 22:14, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This is an outrageous and untruthful statement, Andries. Judge me by my edits, by my behavior and by my contribututions to Wikipedia. I have welcomed each and every editor that came to edit this article, even those that attacked me personally and were banned. I have explained policy to each one of them. I have restored criticism deleted by proponents. I welcomed Bishonen's and Pjacobi's interventions, while you were at work in the detractors' forum colluding on how to push their POV with your help. You are the self-admitted POV pusher, not me. Just read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19511011" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19511011" rel="nofollow">your own words</a>. My opiniopn remains that Bishonen's "award" was a mistake and did not help, on the contrary. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 22:41, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I openly admitted that I was a POV pusher, but I wonder how other editors would feel if e.g. the article <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_people.html" title="Dutch people">Dutch people</a>, or <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_people.html" title="Swedish people">Swedish people</a> stated that they cannot be trusted and do not speak the truth.

<dd>Bishonen, arbitration for violating what policies and guidelines? Yes, the talk page is used by minor contributors for many off-topic discussions, but I do not think that the violations by the main contributors relative to the amount of contributions by them on the article have been frequent and serious enough for arbitration. I almost wished they were, because then the endless disagreements, reverts and discussing could possibly lead into constructive directions. Now the proportion of non-constructive edits and discussion remains too high and this is not likely going to change. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 13:01, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Deep breath... all right, I'm familiar enough with Wikipedia at this point to see how the above represents a pattern. User A harasses user B (User B being me), user B reacts (in an entirely appropriate way), user A makes a public accusation of harassment (accusing the victim of his own behavior) and editors rush in to "warn" User B to back off. First off: gomi-no-sensei is, I believe, a user who has severely harassed me in the past (and almost been blocked for doing so) and may have multiple sock puppets. But before I get to that - does anyone here believe, for one tenth of a second, that a newbie editor would make his first edit to create someone else's user page? And how would a new user even know that most editors who make lots of edits don't have red usernames unless he was already an editor? Did his mythical "friend" tell him? But that's really the tip of the iceberg. Let's take some of gomi-no-sensei's points one by one.</p>
<p>"<i>I have been the subject of harassment by two Wikipedia users: User:IronDuke and an anonymous editor 69.117.7.84, who may be the same person as IronDuke.</i>" I am especially grateful that GNS made this point, as I think it illustrates not only the disingenuousness going on here, but that GNS attempts to smear me with what he is in fact guilty of -- being/using a sockpuppet. The reason that 69.117.7.84 complained on GNS's talk page was that GNS created an unwanted user page for him, too (and that's harassment?). Is GNS implying that, at random, he selected two users for whom to create an unwanted userpage, and that those two users happen to be the same person? What do you suppose the chances of that are? At any rate, I'd be interested to see GNS press that case formally, if he truly believes it.</p>
<p>Moving on: my first edit to GNS's talk page was simply this: "Who are you?" I think this was a perfectly reasonable, neutral thing to ask in response to someone messing with my userpage, neither rude nor polite. I was genuinely curious, thinking it might be a bot, or someone had just made an innocent mistake. I didn't want to bite someone's head off without getting a response. The response I got was having my message simply deleted. Later, when I restored the message, and added another, it was also deleted. Finally, GNS abused the speedy delete function to entirely erase my comments (and bragged about it), when he could have at least (improperly) archived them. Also, just as a for instance, GNS did not "restore" a deleted user page. Mine was never in existence up until his edit.</p>
<p>I've been advised to "move on" and I think that's good advice and would love to. However, I am being harassed/stalked by someone via their sockpuppet (or maybe meatpuppet, but I'm pretty sure sock). I think I'm not out of line in asking for a checkuser run with GNS and several other users who may be socks/puppeteers of GNS.</p>
<p>There is, finally, a tendency here at WP, when two editors are having a dispute, to essentially tell both of them, "Okay kids, play nice, I don't care who hit who first." That's totally understandable and generally sensible, but it's a really bad idea here: this user, I believe, has been stalking me in a really unpleasant and threatening manner. I may be wrong, but it absolutely has to be investigated, and if I am indeed wrong, I will abjectly and grovellingly apologize to all concerned. This is why I began the sockpuppet investigation, to get the ball rolling. I believe that it has been closed prematurely and improperly. I have more evidence, and was not consulted in any way prior to its closing. Please know, I'm not denigrating any admins or casting aspersions. I know the idea here is to try to reduce friction and get on with editing, and believe me, that's what I'd like to do. I didn't seek this out, I was essentially baited by a socktroll (and fell for it), and now am put in the unfortunate position of having to plead my case as a co-aggressor, when an actual investigation of the person tormenting me should be taking place. Please keep an open mind here, I really need this to stop. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 22:57, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I requested a check user and it confirms that <a href="../../../g/o/m/User%7EGomi-no-sensei_9953.html" title="User:Gomi-no-sensei">User:Gomi-no-sensei</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomicene_da7b.html" title="User:Anomicene">User:Anomicene</a> are operated by the same person, and that someone from that same IP set up <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuck_cbd4.html" title="User:IronDuck">User:IronDuck</a>, which was never used, but which appears to have been created to mimic IronDuke. Given that Gomi's first edit was to create a page for IronDuke, and that someone using his IP address created an account mimicking IronDuke, that strongly suggests to me that Gomi may indeed be Gnetwerker, who was previously harassing IronDuke in the form of posting his personal details. However, the check-user evidence on that point is "inconclusive," which I understand means the IP evidence doesn't confirm that Gomi-no-sensei and Anomicene are Gnetwerker, but that it doesn't rule it out either. In the meantime, I've blocked Gomi-no-sensei as an abusive sockpuppet, leaving Anomicene as the main account until further evidence linking them to Gnetwerker is available. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:15, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I guess I have to say something here (actually several somethings):
<ul>
<li>I am not <a href="../../../g/o/m/User%7EGomi-no-sensei_9953.html" title="User:Gomi-no-sensei">User:Gomi-no-sensei</a>;</li>
<li>I am not <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">User:Gnetwerker</a>;</li>
<li>I know who both of those users are, and they are not the same people</li>
<li>I do sometimes work on the same sub-net as Gomi, so I see how <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> got confused; and</li>
<li>Gomi is astonishingly pissed-off that he has no way of responding to his block -- he can't edit anywhere, or send email to admins, apparently.</li>
</ul>

<dd>All of this is beside the point, I guess.

<dd>I don't know exactly what the check-user evidence showed, but it was enough to conclude that you are the same person, and in addition you edit the same articles. If you want to e-mail me or any other admin, as Gomi, there is nothing to stop that account from doing so. In addition to the sockpuppetry, the same person set up what looked like an attack account, IronDuck. We've had enough of whatever these shenanigans are. The bottom line is that the person behind these accounts needs to stay away from IronDuke. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:49, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The root of the problem is the refusal of some (apparently Russian) editors to accept that {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-USSR_abc6.html" title="Template:PD-USSR">PD-USSR</a>}} is just plain wrong.

Note that I didn't invent that reasoning; there are several U.S. experts who say so; and Russian and Ukrainian experts also agree, and I even discussed the issue with Jean-Baptiste Soufron, our very own Wikimedia foundation lawyer specialized on international copyright issues.

<dd>In pertinent part, the "Wikipedia shoot" notes that, <i>...Wikipedia is run by the biggest gang of geeks to ever walk the face of God's green Earth. Some of the people here (DGX &amp; feydey being the worst offenders) decided to wreck unnecessary havoc and remove a perfectly fine and noteworthy entry</i> and that <i>DGX, feydey, and any of you other tools here: you're on notice</i>. The former, although likely indecorous, isn't, IMHO, a personal attack, inasmuch as the focus is on the (altogether correct) conduct of particular users, rather than on the users themselves; we generally, I think, look with disfavor on user page criticisms of individual editors (here, he could criticize the deletion of his vanity bio without referencing the other editors with whom he clashed), but the former criticisms are not particularly strident or vituperative (similar, in fact, to those many listed on their user pages w/r/to <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">User:Kelly Martin</a> during the Userbox Wars). The latter, though, terms editors as tools, and so is likely a personal attack; even as I have many problems with <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, I recognize that the policy generally enjoys wide support, so, in view of NPA, I'll remove the offending sentence from Uofakevo's page; I can't imagine that anyone would think further action (e.g., short block) would be appropriate, but surely others may disagree. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:45, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

The terms are that the mediation ends if he (1) uploads any personal pictures which don't have connections to the purpose of Wikipedia, (2) "outs" anyone's personal information, or (3) engages in personal attacks on other users, especially if those attacks involve the personal information of another user.</p>
<p>As my mediation was a term of his being unblocked, I think that if this mediation fails we would be looking at a community-supported indefinite block, which was where he started. Failing that, I suppose we could consider Arbcom. In the short term, any admins who find Shultz in violation of those three terms should feel free to block as they feel necessary.

<p>I am unclear as to what extent <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a> is Wikimedia policy and to what extent it binds our activities on here <i>en</i>. I don't believe it assert any <i>right</i> that one's talk will be deleted (and only mentions talk <i>sub</i>pages), though I am unclear how carefully the procedure was discussed. A significant objection to the deletion of talk pages is that they are primarily the contributions of <i>other</i> editors that a user should not have the ability to have deleted. Those edits then disappear from the contributions of other editors as well (for instance, if someone undergoing a request for arbitration had made inappopriate comments to Moe, they would no longer be accessible). I re-deleted since I would rather come to a consensus first. I still feel that it should be undeleted; it can be blanked and protected if necessary. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 23:46, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually blanking and protecting seems reasonable enough. Moe is there any particular reason that you must have your talk page deleted? I think the idea of a right to vanish comes from meatball wiki.

<p>This is a minor matter, but I'd like some wisdom from someone. I am slightly irritated by recent edits from sockpuppets of <a href="../../../a/i/n/User%7EAine63_4c1a.html" title="User:Aine63">Aine63</a>, as shown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sexual_harassment&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sexual_harassment&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I've given a couple of warnings to the IP users concerned, but I'm disinclined to get "heavy" at this point, and besides I don't want to use admin powers over a content dispute that I'm involved in. OTOH, I feel that being an admin shouldn't mean having to put up with another user's sockpuppets continually deleting sources and sourced information, adding back deleted unsourced information, or simply acting uncivilly. Does anyone want to offer a suggestion or take an interest in this article? Feel free to drop a note on my talk page. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 00:02, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For the moment I've semi-protected the page. The next sockpuppet revert would have been a 3RR by <a href="../../../a/i/n/User%7EAine63_4c1a.html" title="User:Aine63">Aine63</a>. I'll leave the page alone for now and let someone else unprotect it at their discretion.

For reasons that I hope are obvious, I don't want to be the person to block <a href="../../../a/i/n/User%7EAine63_4c1a.html" title="User:Aine63">Aine63</a> but I do note that there is <strike>now</strike> soon to be a clear 3RR violation by this person and his/her sockpuppets.

No block necessary on this occasion, but note that Aine63 has gotten away with four reverts in a <i>very</i> short time thanks to my patience and concern not to abuse admin powers. I thank the others who stepped in and dealt with the immediate problem.

<dd>Nathan, you should remove the images from your signature not because it's "required by policy" but because it's the <b>polite</b> thing to do. Being wilfully impolite, as you are doing, reflects poorly on you as a Wikipedian and will tend to bias people against you. It's your call (for now); I'd strongly suggest that you stop thinking about your "rights" and instead focus on how you can behave in a manner more conducive to maintaining a friendly, productive environment in which to write an encyclopedia.</dd>

<dd>Having reviewed the conversations to which Nathan linked, I must say that I am quite disappointed in Nathan's behavior, and I find neither personal attacks nor uncivil behavior from Kelly Martin nor Cyde Weys. Cyde's first comment to Nathan, as far as I can see, was "Please remove the images in your sig. One is already beyond the bounds of what is expected; three is entirely beyond the bounds of what is expected. See <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">WP:SIG</a>." Nathan responded quite emotionally, implying that even were it policy he would only remove the images is MediaWiki disabled them, and protested perceived blocks and orders. I see no evidence that Cyde or Kelly ever threatened a block, issued an order, or made any other statements besides requests. To me, Nathan's reaction seems quite over the top. If I have missed the incivility or personal attacks, I'd appreciate them being pointed out. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 03:29, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Reply to Knowledge Seeker:<br />
Kelly Martin said, "Being wilfully impolite, as you are doing, reflects poorly on you as a Wikipedian and will tend to bias people against you.". That means that Kelly Martin is calling Nathan "willingfully impolite" or "rude". And Kelly Martin is saying he is not a good wikipedian. So, calling someone rude and a bad wikipedian can be considered a personal attack. Right?. Also, Kelly Martin said, "I'd strongly suggest that you stop thinking about your "rights" and instead focus on how you can behave in a manner more conducive to maintaining a friendly, productive environment in which to write an encyclopedia.". That means that Nathan doesn't have rights, because Kelly Martin quoted them, which is implying that "rights" are a joke. Also, Kelly Martin is saying that Nathan is not friendly or productive. Nathan is very friendy, because he has many friends. Nathan is very productive, because he has over 6100 edits.<br />

<p>Hi. I am <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">User:Aksi_great</a>. I have recently been blocked by <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">User:Philwelch</a> first for 15 minuted and then the block was extnded for 3 hours. The reason given was <b>harassing an admin</b>.</p>
<p>If you visit Philwelch's talk page you will understand the whole sequence of events. User:Samir asks him "Phil, please don't call him names. Thanks." for whichhe replied "Who the fuck asked you to come to my talk page? I really like being lectured by clueless newbies. Go find yourself a better hobby". At this point I put a no personal attack warning on Philwelch's talk page and I was blocked and asked by him to "Leave me the hell alone! ". On posting a noblock template on my talk page I was further blocked for 3 hours. - <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.88.151.10.html" title="User:203.88.151.10">203.88.151.10</a> 10:43, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>His block was extended because the first block failed to correct his behavior, as can be evidenced by his dialogue with me on his talk page. It had nothing to do with his request for being unblocked. This individual was the third person to come to my talk page and lecture me about policy, starting an entirely new section about it to boot. Yes, I made uncivil remarks and I appreciate those sensible users who came to my talk page to inform me of it. However, the sort of piling-on that Aksi and Samir were engaging in is nothing less than harassment, and is completely unnecessary. If Aksi promises not to engage in such harassment in the future I will unblock him and put this behind me. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil Welch</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Philwelch_0d8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Philwelch">c</a>) 10:50, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Sophia, While I could unblock, I wouldn't, as a matter of principle, since I have raised the issue above. Now Phil Welch has gone ahead and blocked an IP, saying block evasion, an IP from which Aksi_great had contested the block. This is sad because the block on the user itself has been undone by another admin. I request the other admins to view the situation on the talkpages of Aksi_great and Phil Welch and lift the block ASAP. From my limited interaction with Aksi_great, i've found him to be a good user who just completed 2k+ edits. It is very frustrating to be blocked for what is not an offence. Admins should be in a position to take criticism in their stead and maintain civility, not block non-admin users who leave civil messages on the admin's talkpage. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 10:51, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, Nathan is a blatant troll, and his posse came to harass me about the blunt manner in which I came to that conclusion and supported Tony's action above. Yes, I should have been more civil about it. But I'll be damned if someone from the troll posse is the one to tell me that. I've accepted Gurubrahma and Petros' recommendations since I actually trust and respect their judgment. People who come to my talk page to stick up for trolls don't get that trust and respect, and I'm sorry it has to be that way. Furthermore—I'm an administrator. I've been here since November 2004. If you're going to come to my talk page to tell me off, have the common decency to do so without a goddamn template. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil Welch</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Philwelch_0d8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Philwelch">c</a>) 10:55, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you regard template warnings as an insult but "mere" users have to accept them as you are an admin - is that it? If you have power and you use it you will be questioned sometimes - deal with it politely and firmly but never rudely as this looks as if you've lost the logic of the argument and are just lashing out. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 11:07, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The 3rr situation with Phil appears to the outside exactly the same: he agreed you were correct about the 3rr and blocked himself, but since blocks aren't meant to be punitive we can assume he's going to make an effort to avoid that. If he's going to avoid it, there's no reason that he needs to be blocked...and if he happens to go back to the reverted article, then we can deal with that situation at that time.

<p>Well, I missed all the foofaraw about this when it was happening, and I've never had any interaction with Nathan before. Furthermore, I think that most people would agree that I'm not exactly the president of the Tony Sidaway Cheerleading Squad, so I hope my opinion on this carries some weight: this is a good block. Reading through the talk page it is clear that Nathan is simply spoiling for a fight. Several <i>polite</i> requests were made on his talk page, and he characterized them as acts of aggression and began, metaphorically, shouting "Murder! Theft! Arson! <b>Dictatorship!</b>" We have a word for that kind of behavior: disruption. Nathan wasn't simply blocked for having a stupidly large signature, he was blocked for being disruptive. The best way to avoid being blocked for disruption is to avoid engaging in disruptive behavior. Hopefully he has learned his lesson, and it won't have to happen again. Those of you who are defending Nathan's behavior in this matter should be asking yourself why you are wasting your time on this instead of editing an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 14:12, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok. I am back (before the 4 hour period, but even then...). Today has been a bad day for me. I seem to have got caught up in something which I never knew about (the sig. image issue). But still, I feel that I did what was right and am not going to apologise for what I have done. It was within the rights of <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)">User:Samir_(The Scope)</a> to have aksed Phil to be civil. But instead he was abused and called a newbie. Everyone know what happened next. I never was the one who lost my cool. In fact, I eve wrote on Samir's talk page - "You probably caught him at the wrong moment. Don't lose your cool. I am sure he will regret saying that once he cools down.". That was just moments before I got blocked.</p>
<p>I understand that Phil is an admin, and that he has been here 1 year before I have been, but I too have been doing my part to build an encyclopedia. It feels bad to be called a troll, and to be blocked. When I used the unblock template on my talk page, I was further blocked by Phil (to correct your behavior - accroding to him). What behavior is he talking about? I agree that the talk page is a personal page, but he has no right to abuse others on that page. I also agree that it may have been unwise to use a template for an experience user, but why waste time on writing what is already written. If a warning template cannot be used on an admin then it cannot be used on anyone else. I am not going to take this anywhere else and this is probably the last time I am writing here. How can I be acting in a harassing manner when I made a single remark on his talk page. This is the first time I ever heard about Phil. I feel that I should atleast be given an apology, considering the fact that my block log is an open notebook. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 14:19, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wrote the above before Phil apologised to me on my talk page. I accept the apology and request other users not to carry on this discussion forward. It serves no purpose as it wastes my time and Phil's time too. Let us do what we have come here to do. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 14:19, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I feel this is a great example of how a potentially explosive situation was settled very peacefully by a few mutual apologies &amp; reconcilations. I must commend all the parties involved for settling this issue with <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a>. I feel that I too owe an apology to <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil Welch</a> for posting my comments behind the pace of the ongoing discussions. I had written that section when it was relevant &amp; forgot to hit "save" then later mistakenly posted it. Now let bygones be bygones &amp; as Phil has quoted on the Incidents page "Lets write an encyclopedia".

<p>This user received a warning for vandalising my userpage, which he afterwards removed. I thought that there was a rule about removing warnings from talk pages, so I restored the warning to his talk page and commented on him removing it. He afterwards responded angrily on my talk page, saying that he could do whatever he wanted to his talk page and telling me to leave it alone.

<dd>It may be worth adding that in his response to Flcelloguy, "out of respect for your request..." which Flcellogu describes as a 'a postive response', Guanaco actually unrepentently repeats the very agressive words to which I had initially objected. Rather than debate the issues he snidely and unhelpfully refers again to 'some people' as 'bullies' - and their ideas as 'bullshit'<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGuanaco&amp;diff=53028985&amp;oldid=53026257" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGuanaco&amp;diff=53028985&amp;oldid=53026257" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.

<dd>True; I'm not condoning Guanaco's actions here. I personally feel that he was incivil as well. But I'm disagreeing with the block because Guanaco had only reverted once when his comment containing a borderline (i.e. not clear-cut) personal attack was removed, and had not edited in over an hour and a half prior to his block. Blocks aren't supposed to be punitive, and I don't see a justification when the editor had stopped reverting after he had reverted only once and wasn't even editing.

<p>I have to register an extremely strong disagreement with Flcelloguy. Calling a fellow editor a bully is not borderline. I felt, and still feel, that Guanaco's deliberate and premeditated rebuff to some polite requests, and his repetition of the original attack, merited some kind of preventive. I blocked Guanaco at 1958 UTC, putting a note on his talk page at 1959 and on this page at 2003 and 2007. I chose to remove the personal attack some time afterwards--over an hour afterwards, at 2109 UTC. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 22:43, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am definitely not condoning Guanaco's actions here; I urged him to not use such terms as well. There is no excuse for personal attacks of any kind. However, a block when he had neither reverted nor edited for over an hour and a half, had only reverted what he perceived as the removal of his valid comment once, and had not reverted since being asked not to, was inappropriate in my view, especially since the comment was not a clear-cut personal attack (i.e. "so and so is a bully or idiot!" versus "And practice should reflect consensus, not the demands of bullies," which while is still incivil, is not as egregious as an outright insult or personal attack). Blocks are not supposed to be punitive.

<dd>The "personal insult" was at best/worst indirect and to me at least came across as a criticism of behavior - it is not a personal attack, after all to characterize behavior as bullying, if such a charge can be substantiated. Sidaway, on the other hand, blocked without getting familiar with the specifics, including efforts to mediate and reciprocal efforts to calm down. Unless he actually intended it as a punitive measure, the block was unfounded. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 02:31, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I cannot accept that "And practice should reflect consensus, not the demands of bullies" is not a most egregious and unacceptable personal attack. The block was intended to prevent further escalation of this repeated personal attack, which was defended in the most disingenuous and back-handed manner <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Guanaco&amp;diff=53028985&amp;oldid=53026257" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Guanaco&amp;diff=53028985&amp;oldid=53026257" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 00:00, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I must disagree with this statement. While - I repeat - I'm certainly not condoning Guanaco's actions or statement here, his comment was not a direct personal attack; it was simply a statement, that while possibly uncivil, did not warrant a block at the time. A direct and egregious attack would consist of saying "so and so is a bully"; his statement neither named a specific person or group of people nor called anyone any insults directly. Nevertheless, regardless of whether you felt that the comment was a personal attack, I don't understand the justification of the block when the user had not edited in over an hour and a half prior to being blocked (and had not edited the page for an even longer period of time), had only reverted once in what he perceived was an unjust removal of his comment, and had promised to tone things down. A block isn't supposed to be punitive.

<p>Since his arbitration case, KDRGibby has been blocked for personal attacks, general incivility, tendentious editing, attacking administrators when warned, and edit warring. He has been banned from two articles under his probation. He has repeatedly violated the ban on one of these articles. He has been blocked eight times in the past ten weeks, the last two times for one month each. His behavior shows no improvement and his talk page is currently protected after his continued incivility and personal attacks on the talk page while blocked.</p>
<p>The above two paragraphs comprise a summary of his case, full details of which are at the case page of his arbitration, linked above.</p>
<p>I have contacted all of the administrators involved in enforcement of this case, suggesting that, in view of the failure of the enforcement measures so far to improve his behavior, and the lack of any sign that he is both capable of and willing to reform, we should invoke the General Probation remedy of his arbitration case, and ban him from Wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>KDRGibby is placed on general probation. Any three administrators, in the exercise of their judgement for reasonable cause, may ban him from Wikipedia if his general pattern of activity is unacceptably disruptive. Such a ban and the basis for it shall logged at Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/KDRGibby#Log of blocks and bans.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Two of those administrators have responded so far, each indicating that he has no objections.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I open the proposal to further discussion. KDRGibby is currently blocked for one month, and the block terminates in mid-June. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 14:28, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I haven't yet reviewed his recent "contributions" in detail (hadn't realized he was back until informed by Tony), but if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:KDRGibby&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53258525" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:KDRGibby&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53258525" rel="nofollow">this sample</a> is anything to go by, he's back to exactly the same stuff that had him on probation, and then blocked for a month, last time. If we're serious about enforcement of such rulings, he must merit at least a longer block this time, and I'd find it hard to argue against a permanent ban. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 14:53, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Here's what I said in February: <i>It's pretty much a waste of time to put him on any sort of parole -- he knows full well he's under close scrutiny, and continues the same nasty ways. If the max period is one year after five blocks, ok, but it's a foregone conclusion the more drastic remedy will be applied; he's been given plenty of chances.</i> I don't see any change for the better and don't expect any. If there was some chance a one year ban would have some useful effect, I'd recommend that; maybe that would give him time to mature a bit. But I'd back a full ban as well. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 15:19, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Scanning his list of contributions reveals that he is loath to add proper edit summaries; those he does bother to add are often insulting and bad-tempered. A quick sampling of edits reveals that the content of his comments to other editors are often off the same calibre. If this is the behaviour of someone currently on parole, then he needs to be taught a stronger lesson. <b>Endorse ban</b>.

<li><b>Endorse</b> indef block, as I was the one who talked about it in IRC. KDRGibby had quite a few chances to redeem himself including a prior one month log ban, but as soon as that ban ended, KDRGibby started edit warning and severe personal attacks in his talk page again.

<p>Tarikochi, you are decorating your userpage with unfree images. Please remove them. I'm sorry that other editors were overly aggressive in doing it for you, or have failed to explain the issue clearly. Nevertheless, Wikipedia is not offering you personal webspace to display content that is under an unfree license. I'm afraid that this isn't negotiable. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 02:21, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Posting a full copy of a manifesto to a discussion page isn't appropriate, particularly when it includes a number of attacks on other editors.

<p>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia first and foremost. User pages that do not get in the way of us being an encyclopedia are not a problem. Jimbo and <b>all</b> his key top functionaries have agreed that pictures with a copyright such that Wikipedia's only right to copy them lies in the fair use doctrine should not and will not be allowed on any nonarticle page.

Fair use at Wikipedia means two very different things. One thing it means is <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">Fair use</a> which is a legal doctrine. A second very different thing it means at Wikipedia is <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> which is Wikipedia's guideline for use of materials with a copyright such that Wikipedia's right to copy is covered by the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_Use_83e7.html" title="Fair Use">Fair Use</a> doctrine. <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> is both more restrictive and more clear cut than <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">Fair use</a>.

<dd>I was the one who originally protected the article. I have to agree with ems that the timing of the unprotection request is "curious", although I'd be remiss to not also note that ems has been curiously quiet on the article's talk page until today. Having read the discussion on the talk page, my impression is that ems makes some good points but doesn't express them very clearly, nor in a tone generally conducive to dialog, which is unfortunate. The unprotection is, IMHO, "in order", and somewhat overdue. It's too bad the editors involved didn't work harder to inform themselves about the valid issues ems was trying to raise. This is edging on "more appropriate for the article talk page", so I'll leave it at that. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 01:41, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I have commented elsewhere, the idea that Lag B'omer somehow would prevent "most Jews" from commenting is ridiculous. The holiday is a very minor holiday with no form of work prohibition whatsoever. Most people who celebrate the holiday do so by going on a hike for a few hours. Furthermore, the claim that somehow the unprotection was timed for a minor holiday (which frankly most non-Jews and probably many non-Orthodox Jews have never heard of) seems to be an awful example of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming bad faith</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 17:53, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know a load of administrators must be watching this page, so I am going to tell you all this right here:</dd>
<dd>The recent antics (Nanook Vandalism etc.) preformed by this anonymous user (216.164.203.90) were preformed on purpose, as a part of an experiment. I am currently writing to you from my place of work, located in Boston, Mass, USA. I have chosen to perform this unorthodox experiment from my workplace, in order to avoid negative votes on my possible upcoming election as an administrator, on the Wikipedia username I use from home. The main purpose of this experiment was to know, first hand, what vandalism “feels like,” from the vandals’ point of view. Let me tell you, “I have learned a lot”</dd>
<dd>I appreciate how you all quickly reverted vandalism and left welcoming warning messages in the beginning. When I continued to vandalize “Wolf” I appreciated how you all “Assumed Good Faith.” However, Kim van der Linde, at times you forgot to stay “As cool as a cucumber.” I especially admired Radio Kirk’s reaction and cool persistence with the block he initiated. His direct quoting of the complaints of others was a smart move. I also liked how you all continually to welcome me to Wikipedia even though I was annoying the ^&amp;%$ out of you.</dd>
<dd>So, to recap, the recent problems caused by than account were done on purpose, as an experiment by me, in order to find better ways of combating vandalism with my other Wikipedia account. I thank you all for you response and for now I’m signing out. If anyone else uses the ip to access Wikipedia in the future, please regard them as a new user, as I don’t plan on using my work computer to access Wikipedia in the future.

<dd>It depends on what you call extreme. I can deal with pretty much everything people could call me. User page vandalism, no big deal. Scolding, just assume it is their normal language, and it glids down. 50 e-mails, kill file does the job (if the spam filter has not got it before that)</dd>
<dd>Why I think this is a big deal is the experimentation and the deliberate covering of the tracks by using the work computer while normally doing stuff from home so that we can not trace it. The reason to be angry is the underlying motivation to experiment, but to be sure it is not jepardizing his admin request. And if it had been just a few things to see how fast it would have been reverted, nuisance and it would probably not have been a big deal. What does not go well is the deliberate personal attacks for an experiment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A216.164.203.90&amp;diff=53057591&amp;oldid=53024843" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A216.164.203.90&amp;diff=53057591&amp;oldid=53024843" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>.

<p>I want to relate a story (an analogy, I guess) I first heard some time ago and has been used several times. Let's say that a certain city has cracked down on litter; policemen, code enforcement, and volunteers diligently clean up trash and remove litter from the streets and parks of the town. In due time, due to the hard work of these people, the city is sparkling clean. In amazement, you come to the town to observe. Would you willingly dump a bag of trash to see if the city cleans it up? No. In the same fashion, vandalizing Wikipedia to see if the process works is also inappropriate. The fact is that vandalism, no matter what the intent, harms the integrity of the encyclopedia and the integrity of the entire project. Back to our analogy: if you wished to study how quickly the trash was picked up, you would carefully observe existing trash and also look at past data. You wouldn't dump more trash. Similarly, if you wish to observe vandalism and how it is reverted, look at current vandalism instead of creating more. Vandalism is, quite simply, inappropriate. Also, a reminder to assume good faith to the greatest extent to all people, even our friend who started this thread.

<dd>It may be a troll or vandal trying to (as Deskana put it) wind us up. But I have a few questions; firstly, why do you need to know what vandalism feels like? In some cases, yes, you need to know your enemy, but not here. The most interaction you'll get with a vandal is blocking them. Also, its not like vandalising will give you a better understanding of vandalism, as you're not vandalising for the sake of it, but to see what happens. Which messes up your (alleged) experiment. Lastly, what have you found out about vandalism? I mean, what have you discovered that isn't covered in <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a>? <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_of_Puppets_db54.html" title="User:Master of Puppets">Mopper</a> <a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_of_Puppets_098b.html" title="User talk:Master of Puppets"><sup>Speak!</sup></a> 22:30, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

Sure, it's all too possible this person is a troll wasting our time; it's also quite possible that this person genuinely made an astoundingly stupid mistake (which even the most intelligent person can do). I still believe the user should come clean, accept the fact that several admins will be watching, and—if indeed that is this user's intention—spend the next several months regaining our trust.

<p>Guys, let's just move on. Maybe this is a troll, maybe this is slightly more creative vandal than usual, maybe it was a geniune admin-to-be trying out the dark side. Block the IP to mildly reduce future risk and move on. The total amount of stress, vexed feelings, and bad karma displayed in this thread far exceed whatever was generated by the vandalism. If this is a person aiming to be an admin (in my view possible though unlikely), he/she would certainly be silly to "confess" now, and the total disruption he/she has caused is significantly less than that caused by some of our more vocal and nonstandardly-behaving admins. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 00:02, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please keep in mind that Phil initiated this entire episode. He started the revert war, he ignored my inuse tags, he ignored my plea to stop reverting, and he had uncivil behavior. What was the reaction: the admins gave him a free pass. As shown above with other users, this is not the first time Phil has abused his powers as an admin, nor is it his last.</dd>

<dd>Phil instigated a Personal attack on the intervention board, and yet he is the only one being abusive, he has called me a tempermental child, has said that he would use my RfC as toilet paper, and now he says that I have an "unhealthy obsession".

Would the admins simply let it go if I apologized as <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">User_talk:Philwelch</a> did, and forget the whole thing happened?

<p>Both of these edits were made by User:1147858215, and add a bunch of spamlinks to Wikipedia. What is new about these attacks is that they hide their spamlinks from view by using the CSS display:none attribute, and are thus completely invisible unless you view the source. In addition, they use whitespace padding to try to push their text off the bottom of the edit window to prevent their edits from being seen.</p>
<p>Finally, they both contain the curious message "[We are delicate. We do not delete your content.]", which can be taken either as an apologia or as a veiled threat.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>can we prevent the use of display:none by spammers?</li>
<li>how many other edits like this have gone undetected?</li>

<p>I've seen two or so cases coming by recently where people were complaining they weren't appropriately warned before being blocked.</p>
<p>Please remember to always warn clearly, sharply and politely, and only block if behaviour continues. Please ensure that at least one person has indeed issued a clear warning, and that the warned user has had time to respond or react.</p>

<p>What kind of blocks do you have in mind, Kim? Vandalism? 3RR? Personal attacks? Surely it would depend on the context — for example, whether or not it's a particularly bad offence, whether or not it's a repeat offender, whether or not the person was already aware of the rule (for example, if an editor reports another editor for 3RR in February, and makes seven reverts within two hours in March). For <i>obvious</i> cases of banned users coming back from IPs or as sockpuppets, I don't give warning. For vandalism, I warn IPs, but I don't warn newly-created usernames. When patrolling <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, I check that the vandalism continued <i>after</i> warnings were issued. I think it really depends on the situation. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 11:33, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are cases where blocks without warnings are ok. For instance, if someone blanks the FA with the text "Wikipedis is communism", are you going to wait to give them a test series? The person obviously is familiar with vandalism and Wikipedia, and a block on sight is fine. However, if someone blanks a page with "Hey hows it going", even if it's the FA, they should be properly warned. --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 13:54, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sure, plenty of times when it might be appropriate to block first and ask questions later, but try to be as conservative with that as possible. It's not much extra trouble to put on extra test-templates (for the REALLY REALLY lazy), or actually talk with people politely for a minute, after all.</p>
<p>People also commented on that at the recent Request For Comments on Tony Sidaway, for instance. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 14:16, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nathanrdotcom had had ample warning about his behavior. He responded to the polite requests by asking for one party to be blocked and another warned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=53252176&amp;oldid=53248040" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=53252176&amp;oldid=53248040" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. The suggestion that he was blocked without warning is a canard. He was, at most, blocked without an explicit warning that he would be blocked. I cannot see what good such a warning would have done, given that he already regarded relatively polite approaches as blockable offence. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 14:32, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh I'm not disputing that.

<p>Without commenting on any specific case, I'd like to echo what Kim said. Sure, there might be certain exceptional circumstances, but <i>in general</i> we should warn before block- I doubt anyone disagrees with that, right? Also, I very strongly feel that an explanation for the block should be given on the user's talk page. This explanation should contain enough information (use diffs, people) that anyone coming along can see why the block was done, without having to do detective work or have an extended conversation with the blocker. There have been many times where a probably-justified block was given, but without adequate explanation, and it's turned into a big disagreement. There's no reason for this. Justify your blocks. If it's because of a pattern of disruptive behavior, explain this- it's only takes a minute. If you don't have time to explain, you don't have time to block. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:32, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we're seeing some absolutely needless breast-beating here over imagined lapses of good practice. For instance, in the Nathanrdotcom case the blocked party had been given ample notice, and the block was recorded on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> <i>below the section in which Nathanrdotcom and other parties had described the situation</i>. If there were parties who did not understand the circumstances of the block, those parties had only to read the notice on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>, those immediately above it, and corresponding discussions on Nathan's talk page. We should not leap around shouting about "administrator abuse" simply because we haven't taken the trouble to read about the case.--<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 14:36, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah nonono, maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that case.&#160;:-/ It's just a quick reminder to stick to practice for folks.

Do we allow people to upload stuff they made/wrote themselves under fair use (only)? <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 15:42, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The last bullet under policy #2 on the upload file page reads: "If you upload a file here to which you hold the copyright, you must license it under a free license or release it into the public domain." There's never been any dispute of that policy. So, no. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 15:47, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
