Yet nothing had been done to the image - the tag was not removed nor was that "not deleted" template thingy attached to the image. On 17 December, the category was apparently recreated for vandalism (something about "chowbok"), meaning that the image would have once again appeared in the category, but Angr deleted the category without acting on the Jayson Blair image. On 24 December, <b>25 days after I tagged the image</b>, Alkivar finally removes the tag <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Jayson_Blair.jpg&amp;diff=96254901&amp;oldid=91118092" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Jayson_Blair.jpg&amp;diff=96254901&amp;oldid=91118092" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<dd>Hoping that Santa is listening, here are my thoughts: If he's not causing any disruption, and is spreading good will, then there is no cause for blocking. Leaving positive messages for other users does benefit the encyclopedia, and does so much more so than some of the other holiday antics around here, like the things that many people do on April Fool's Day. If the user has become disenchanted due to last year, then I would advise that the person responsible for the account leave it dormant, rather than spreading any ill will. If Santa would like to go and leave users presents (I would suggest limiting himself to those who he gave presents to last year and who expressed appreciation, either on his or thier own talk pages), then more power to him. If not, as I said before, the account should just go dormant, rather than stirring up any kind of disharmony. I think blocking the account will do exactly the same, and would encourage those thinking about doing so to ask themselves "Am I really doing Wikipedia a favor in doing this, since I know how much discord doing so will bring?" <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 04:41, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Santa" was blocked about an hour ago. From what I can see, other than a couple of messages on the noticeboards, he (I'll deem the Santa character to be male) was in the process of responding (with tailored and measured responses) to 5 users who had posted "wishes" on his userpage. I think leaving this go would have been harmless, though I will admit that I wasn't around last year and can only get a sense of what happened through reading the contribs log.</dd>
<dd>It's obvious that "Santa" was being played by a regular user, who knows many of us here, and that the "lack of constructive edits" pertains to this special-occasion account and not the user as a person. I would urge unblocking now, not so much because I want a present, but so as not to embarrass whoever might otherwise get caught behind the autoblock. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 04:48, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since I'm being called out by name here, I'll respond. First, I don't think any of us believe that this is the only account this user is using; to have come in all of a sudden and picked the list of people that were messaged last year is far beyond the scope of coincidence. There is obviously an established user behind this account, one who knows many people, and who makes regular contributions to the site. The fact that this seasonal sockpuppet does not edit in the non-Christmas season is irrelevant; the editor responsible for it obviously does. Beyond that, I see no evidence that the unblocks were a result of AGF; they pretty clearly state they are reversing unjustified blocks made outside of policy. (We don't block to enfore wikibreaks, see <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>.) I'd suggest everybody step back at this point, as this has already caused far more discord than the edits of the user, and it will only cause more if it continues. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 05:54, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

RadioKirk advances fallacious logic. He claims a=b and b=c so a=c. Apples are fruit and oranges are fruit so apples are oranges. Santa=troll and troll=bad so Santa=bad. Worse, he constructs the first part of his fallacious equation from a hasty conclusion and somewhat of an argument of authority, or maybe more like begging the question. He declares Santa's activities to be trolling, based on his authority to declare it so, or just begging it so. Beyond the simple declaration of his conclusion, his assumption draws a hasty conclusion that if trolls act in a certain way, all others who act in that same way must also be trolls. Apples have red skin and are white inside, but not all things with red skin that are white inside are apples. Is this debate about strength for reasoning, or about status in a social context? 1 thang 06:11, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have worked up an essay attempting to get at a set of best practices for IRC at <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_IRC_considered_f828.html" title="User:Geogre/IRC considered">user:Geogre/IRC considered</a>, and a few other folks have been working at it as well. The one IRC channel that prompts this most of all is the en.administrators.irc channel. It is a channel "for administrators only," even though at least three people who are not administrators are on it (and two have "ops"). The rationale offered for the channel is that there is a great need for real-time private discussion of sensitive material among administrators.</p>
<p>I have never been to that channel, myself. Instead, I look here, at the Administrator's Noticeboard, and at the Administrator's Noticeboard Incidents. There, I see people with complaints and issues that get investigated and addressed in as little as two or three minutes.</p>
<p>Am I therefore a bad administrator? Are <i>you?</i> What sensitive, real time, private information is it that we are not receiving? Are we all failing Wikipedia for not having it? Should, perhaps, we disallow everyone else from reading and posting to these pages?

<dd>Hopefully you ask sincerely and not as a way of baiting people to respond in the affirmative so they can be targeted to relieve administrative stress. I don't know what kind of people you are, but bad administrators, yes. You're not bad admins for failing to visit IRC, but for failing to control the adolescent slander bandied about there toward charitable contributors to the project. And the proper adjective would be poor, not bad. Depending on one's philosophy, we all be bad people at times or in part.</dd>
<dd>The question regards not your moral qualities, but whether you poorly apply administrative skills, and the answer to that is most affirmatively yes. You (speaking to the collective you about whom you inquired) invite people to contribute then attack them for the contributions. You impose your subjective values about what is "good for the project" and attack people without remorse when they don't fit your personal standards. You invite people to edit an so-called encyclopedia that "anyone can edit" with the tease that "there are no rules" then once they contribute in exactly the manner such an invitation can be expected to elicit, you turn on them without mercy -- not acknoweldging that their views of the project may have merit though they are contary to yours, but ridiculing and demeaning them as "trolls", "sockpuppets" or "vandals". Yes, those who conduct back-channel dialogues in language not allowed on-wiki have a special flavor of poor administrative skill, with somewhat of an actual bad taste. But that could only happen in an administration where any administrator was free to impose whatever ad hoc pseudopolicy they could rally a like-minded crowd to support.</dd>
<dd>To make matters worse, it is all done under the rhetorical protections of Jimbo Wales in the world media, whose allusions to "wikilove" (does that mean self-love as in narcisism) present the false notion that the project is more driven by accord than by the rampant dischord that makes this a psychologically toxic enviornment. Properly stated, administrators generally do a very poor job of implementing the values the project claims to advance. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKindWordsNotHeard_314e.html" title="User:KindWordsNotHeard">KindWordsNotHeard</a> 03:15, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Geogre, let me compliment you for having voiced the thoughts of many other contributors <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_IRC_considered_f828.html" title="User:Geogre/IRC considered">here</a>. Judging by the recent events, IRC has become a dangerous tool for persecuting <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">established contributors</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">ousting them from Wikipedia</a>. I know admins who were scared from Wikipedia after taking a look at what's going on here. I am particularly disappointed with the behaviour of <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">User:Jdforrester</a>, who seems to pride himself on being a co-author of this channel and defends it so vehemently as if it were a core element of Wikipedia. IRC is deficient in that it concentrates on discussing personalities rather than articles. It is all about people rather than content. It leads people away from the core aim of this project. The recent elections demonstrated that any mention of a vote on IRC among people you think you can trust will garner you several times as much support votes as spamming user talk pages of other wikipedians (which is frowned upon). I don't know what can be done about it as long as there seems to be a circle of admins and, what is worse, arbitrators who derive their authority and popularity primarily from having logs spanning back years, rather than from any onwiki activities. All this makes me very pessimistic indeed. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 00:59, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Quick statement of fact</b> - IRC is here, has been here for a very long time, <i>is</i> the core basis for much of the work that we ("we" being "we the firefighters who save the Foundation from lawsuits every week"), and will continue to be used as such, regardless of the hysterical nay-saying that has gone on (though it must be said that none of the contributors to this thread have partaken in any hysteria). Those who take somewhat of a Luddite position and insist that one particular technology must not be used will be disappointed when someone comes along and uses another - as no doubt they will - and when they were to end up not in the flock, how would we know if they respected our beliefs and were being productive?</dd>
<dd><b>Of course</b> people should not abuse IRC to stack votes (but then, if we did not have binding votes <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_binding_decision_f46c.html" title="Wikipedia:No binding decision">per policy</a>, there wouldn't be a problem, would there?), to influence elections, or to plot against other people in a political fashion, and I'd like to take the opportunity to highlight Geogre's essay on IRC as an interesting view and possibly helpful on the subject of how to discipline oneself against erring into such matters, and also to thank those that have approached me for clarification about what <i>is</i> before launching into campaigns not based in fact.</dd>

Seriously: if anyone thinks this is something like that, then he or she is at such a fundamental disconnect with Wikipedia that I don't know what you're doing here.</li>
<li>James: my question is somewhat restricted. I'm not being Luddite, myself, or trying to knock out IRC. The question is restrained strictly to en.admins.irc. As administrators on the noticeboard, I figured we needed to go back to the basics. The debate over the creation of the channel was ... abridged, I suppose ... but it was no slam dunk. My sense was that the preponderance of administrators were against its creation. I'm sure it was the sense of those in favor that the preponderance was the other way. My recollection was that the decision was, "Let's create it and see how it goes." Well, my view is that it has gone badly (that particular channel), so I am returning to the basic question: why have a private administrator's medium, when we have no such thing on Wikipedia? What is the <i>advantage</i> to it that is actually commensurate with our policies and practices? There is no attack in the question.</li>
<li>Sure, I have my view. Sure, it's easy to figure it out. It would be the height of "assuming bad faith" to believe that I cannot have a view and yet have honest inquiry, and anyone wanting to sniff through the garbage pails to create a "case" has no business at Wikipedia, because she or he is, frankly, unfit for collaboration. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:09, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One does not need threats to increase his popularity. I have every reason to believe that some people have become popular and elected to administrators primarily based on the number of friends they have acquired while chatting on IRC. Whenever I post on this page, I expect my message to be discussed on IRC by some people whose names I ignore. This is disturbing, therefore I encourage every attempt to formulate what are the relations between Wikipedia and IRC, rather than routinely dismissing the question on the grounds of IRC and WP being totally unrelated entities. No, they are related, so much so that IRC increasingly influences Wikipedia decisions, including blocks. Since as much is established, please come up with a policy on the nature of that relationship. Something along the lines of ""Do not block established contributors on the basis of on-IRC discussion." and "Do not let IRC distract you from the necessity of on-Wiki consensus".

This is wholly independent of how long someone has been active on IRC; indeed, many people don't log at all (no IRC clients I am aware of have logging enabled by default), and very few save them from years back.

In fact, it's something that I wrote up (in my characteristic long form) in my essay: IRC has what I call a lensing effect. I can think of two people who made administrator despite having very, very few edits. They had expressed interest in being admins before they had done any edits at all. Now, I like both of these people, and they never, to my knowledge, acted inappropriately as administrators. These are two whom I know. They're not on trial, but the lensing effect of IRC is undeniable. We can either strike the policy against "talk page spamming" or institute one against IRC spamming, or we can just be hypocrites and say that IRC = power. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:32, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems that people have forgotten (or perhaps even never known) why #wikipedia-en-admins was created. The purpose was to have a forum where Foundation people (Jimbo, Brad, Danny, et al) could discuss high-priority issues requiring urgent action with trusted admins in a non-public place. Why non-public? Because these issues generally involved matters which were the subject of press attention or of threats of litigation, or otherwise prone to creating difficulties for the Wikimedia Foundation if not dealt with quickly and, as much as possible, quietly. Unfortunately, the channel was quickly compromised (there have been several instances of logs being leaked to various unscrupulous parties who have used them to try to create embarrassment or otherwise complicate the Foundation's efforts to avoid being embroiled in negative publicity or litigation), and as a result, such situations are now managed through other, even more secret, forums.</p>
<p>We could shut down the #wikipedia-en-admins channel, but that wouldn't get rid of the nonpublic backchannels. It would just change their names and disperse the participants somewhat. At least #wikipedia-en-admins is an obvious channel name; it is certainly more informative than one of its progenitors, #fluffykittens.</p>
<p>Major administrative decisions have been made, at times, in these backchannels. Some of them have been quite momentous. In most of those cases, the decisions that have been made have been decisions that could not possibly have been discussed, let alone made, on the public wiki, but nonetheless have had to be made. This is a situation where the exigencies of real life, a universe which is replete with dastardly beasts such as reporters, pundits, and attorneys, force us to dispense with a full and open public discussion because doing so is the only way to avoid a vicious nasty lawsuit that would at best cripple and at worst utterly destroy Wikipedia. You don't have to like this. I'm not really all that happy about it either. But it's the way things are, and it's not something that's going to go away any time soon.</p>
<p>So, anyway, that's the "vital information" that gets passed through IRC backchannels like #wikipedia-en-admins, and why it cannot be passed through the public noticeboards. If you're not an admin doing crisis management for the Foundation, then you probably don't <i>need</i> to be there. But it would rather nice of those of you who are not doing crisis management for the Foundation to at least afford the assumption of good faith to those who are. And keep in mind that there's always the chance that if you do see an admin do something inexplicable, it might be a crisis management action, and that perhaps a polite <i>private</i> inquiry should be your first line of action, instead of an incendiary post to one of the noticeboards. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 02:51, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Foundation here is at cross purposes with the media, and with its projects ambition to avoid advancing points of view. KM suggests the channel was created to facilitate discussion of sensitive topics without incuring "negative publicity" in the press. But if something negative occurs in the context of Wikipedia, those who advocate free flow of information advocate mass communication of such negative events with equal force as positive events are communicated.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia claims to represent any and all topics in the world with a neutral point of view based on all avaiable information. The foundation, on the other hand, and those who advocate the secret channel, don't seem to trust any other crowd -- not even a crowd of professional and trained media personnel to explore negative aspects of the project and to represent those negative aspects in a way that benefits clients of those various media markets. In Wikipedia's small world, the only valid benifit is to the project -- not the common good, not the rule of law, not human decency. If comments "disrupts the project" no matter how severely some aspect of the project might need to be upended, administrators act thoughtlessly to exclude the comments and the commentator. After a few years of such tolerance for self-interests above all other interests, of course some so empowered will develop suspicious or downright anti-social administrative habits.</dd>
<dd>The reasoning appears to suggest Wikipedia has cause to hide some dark underbelly. If Wikipedia is above board, not libeling, not invading privacy and not usurping copyrights, there is no legal threat it needs to fear. Legal quandries can be discussed as openly as any other topic, unless one party hopes to gain an advantage by concealing strategy. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKindWordsNotHeard_314e.html" title="User:KindWordsNotHeard">KindWordsNotHeard</a></dd>

<p>Thanks for your input, KindWords, but I am afraid your view represents a significant overstatement. I can think of many types of situations that need to be addressed in a forum other than on-wiki. I have personally been involved in threads here where I have suggested getting the discussion off the public noticeboard, for exceedingly valid reasons. Such situations are hopefully rare (and don't include something like whether to hand out a 48-hour civility block), but they certainly exist. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:28, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If indeed such circumstances arise, you could advance the discussion by detailing such a circumstance rather than simply declaring that they arise. You could also advance the discussion by citing which of my views you believe to represent a significant overstatement. Is it an overstatement to imply the professional media have a valid interest in publicly examining negative aspects of a project that both relies on the public for content and influences public perceptions with its content? Whether or not situations such as those to which you allude exist does not necessarily inform your claim that one or all of my earlier statements is significantly overstated. Until you advise us what sort of situations to which you refer, we must allow that the circumstances I state as not warranting secret talks and those you claim to know of but don't elaborate may be entirely different circumstances. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKindWordsNotHeard_314e.html" title="User:KindWordsNotHeard">KindWordsNotHeard</a> 03:57, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with detailing the circumstances, as you request, is that in these cases the factors that necessitated nonpublic discussion initially generally prohibit public discussion on a going-forward basis as well. There's been any number of events that I've been involved in where I am prohibited by confidentiality principles from discussing them with any specificity, indefinitely. You will simply have to trust that the Foundation is providing adequate oversight of such activities.

<dd>What I do know is that if something warrants discussion in a descrete forum, an IRC channel does not provide a secure venue. When personal information about those involved in quasi-public activities is discussed in a secret forum, the operators of that forum have an obligation to maintain the same dignity and respect in that forum as if it were an open forum. As a general rule of caution for those who engage in editorial discussion in any context (but not in any way expressed here as a suggestion of particular action), words exchanged among confidants may still generate actionable harm. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKindWordsNotHeard_314e.html" title="User:KindWordsNotHeard">KindWordsNotHeard</a> 06:19, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It would obviously be counterproductive to link to specific discussions that I believed should not continue on-wiki, but in general they concerned topics such as (1) dealing with incidents of off-wiki harassment and physical threats, (2) a situation in which an editor appeared to have a mental health issue that was being implicated by being talked about here, and (3) specific and concrete legal threat situations. Please note that by the latter, I refer not to the generic "this edit is defamatory" or "I'm gonna sue" which can usually be handled with an on-wiki cite to WP:LEGAL (or application of WP:LIVING where warranted), but to specific and concrete threats of litigation by people who are known in the real world to have brought prior litigation against their detractors, and that legal threats are sometimes directed not just against the Foundation but against individual administrators or editors.</dd>
<dd>I emphasize again that I am talking about rare situations, not the everyday stuff of content or user conduct issues, as to which primary decision-making should be transparent on-wiki as much as possible. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 16:49, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I do have a few questions regarding the IRC situation, especially in the context of Kelly's responses. Fair disclosure: I am not an admin. I do not use (Wikipedia) IRC. I also don't think there's some vast IRC-wing conspiracy at work here ... but that doesn't mean I don't see some things about the current environment that could benefit from dialogue.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) Kelly's explanation seems contradictory to me. Either IRC has been compromised and is worthless for secure, emergency information, or it is an essential means to distribute secure, emergency information? Couldn't this goal of real-time intervention be better served through an ArbCom (posibly +clerks) only channel that is <i>actually</i> secure? Or are there enough of these problems that such an approach is insufficient (I hope not!)?</dd>
<dd>2) Wikipedia is neither a bureaucracy nor a social networking site, but frequent IRC communication has aspects of both. The social networking aspect is obvious; the bureaucracy less so. An honest question: how many low-yield (1WW or 2WW) wheel warring events have been caused by desynchonized information, because one side of the conflict was party to material that the other side could not become party to? Priveledged information is <i>essential</i> for ArbCom, which is why there's no WP:RFArbCom, but I worry about its long-term effects on admin-to-admin interactions.</dd>
<dd>3) Outside of the realm of issues with a viable need for real-time intervention (and as a business manager, I'm quite aware of what those may entail), is anything gained by discussing administrative actions off-wiki? This isn't meant to be rhetorical: is there ever a time when it would be preferable for two admins to confer regarding, say, a 48 hr civility block (as mentioned above) in a non-permanent, sunlight-free manner? Offhand, I don't <i>think</i> I can think of any, but if you pressed me to debate the other side, I'd give it a whirl, too... the bottom line as I see it, though, is that off-Wiki discussion of <i>routine</i> admin functions is more confusing for the non-admin editors and for the non-IRC admins, and we should try to select for processes that minimize confusion for the project.</dd>

<li>Yes, IRC has been compromised and is worthless for secure, emergency information. Yes, an ArbCom-only channel would probably work. Neither of these things, though, completely obviate the function of #wikipedia-en-admins.</li>
<li>Sorry, Wikipedia <i>is</i> both a bureaucracy and a social networking site. We don't like it, it's not supposed to be one, and our official policies specifically mention the fact that it is neither, but in reality Wikipedia has aspects of both of these things; it is as much as we can do to keep their impact to a minimum. IRC is certainly more of the latter, though I'm reluctant to believe it's much more of the former. I also don't see an immediate problem with that. "Low-yield wheel war" must be some technical jargon I haven't previously come across. I imagine such things have happened, though I imagine they are at least as many, if not more, that don't involve IRC as do involve it. Suppose the information was on the mailing list (which not everyone reads), in a private email between one administrator and another, or even just elsewhere on the wiki. We can't all read everything.</li>
<li>Perhaps nothing much is gained, but I don't see that much is lost either. The responsibility for an administrative action rests with the administrator who made it, regardless of where they discussed it and who. I think any medium of discussion is better than none at all, which is what I think many people would/are often tempted to go with if the immediacy of IRC is not available. – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 13:34, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Gurch, regarding (2), no, its not some technical jargon. Its more a term I contrived for the purpose: a "low-yield" wheel war is one that involves only one or two reversions of admin actions, as opposed to, say, the Pedophilia Userbox wars. But, more importantly, regarding (3), what I fear is lost is the ability for independent review. GFDL, the value in reliable references, historical-tagged deprecated policies, and more exist because one of Wikipedia's greatest strengths is the ability for anyone to review what came before (or, at least any admin to do so, in the case of administrative actions that are not user-visible). Because IRC is off-Wiki, and, further, because IRC discussions <i>cannot become on-Wiki</i>, there is no chance for independent review. It doesn't take believing in a cabal or assuming bad faith to think that admins can make mistakes; all of us make mistakes. The problem, as I see it, is that it is much harder to tell if mistakes are made, what they were, and why they happened when the reason behind the decisions is both secret and ephemeral. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 18:45, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Finally, for people who come back with the old chestnut that "back channel" will occur anyway, it may, but it won't with Wikipedia's resources. It won't with Wikipedia's name attached to it. Is the mailing list deficient? Are the noticeboards deficient? Kelly doesn't explain.</li>

<p>Gurch has graciously answered Geogre's questions, but I would like to expand on those answers somewhat. The admins channel was created, IIRC, by Essjay, at either Danny's or Jimbo's request (I forget which). Its original purpose was as I discussed above: to facilitate communication between the Foundation and enwiki administrators. The channel is under the auspices of the Wikimedia Foundation IRC project, which mainly means it's under the nominal supervision of James Forrester as the Wikimedia Foundation's designated group contact with <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freenode.html" title="Freenode">freenode</a>, the same as all other "official" Wikimedia-related IRC channels (such as #wikipedia, #wikimedia, et cetera). None of the Wikimedia-related IRC channels consume any of Wikimedia's resources; they are all hosted at freenode, which provides the IRC service as a public service to open source and open content projects such as Wikimedia. freenode has no ties to the Wikimedia Foundation that I am aware of (although I believe the Foundation may have made donations to freenode's organization from time to time and certainly many WMF donors donate to freenode as well). This is unlike the Wikimedia-operated mailing lists, which are hosted on Wikimedia-owned and -operated servers.</p>
<p>IRC, as Gurch notes, enables the ability to have conversations. While it is possible to have a conversation in a mailing list, this is normally a slow process entailing hours if not days. IRC allows the same conversation to be had in minutes. This is very important especially when responding to active crises -- the very purpose for which #wikipedia-en-admins was created. The problem with the on-wiki noticeboard is that they are too public. The channel was created to allow the dissemination of important information to people who need to act on it without, at the same time, disseminating that information to the general public, and more importantly to those people who would attempt to use the information thus acquired to harm the Foundation or its activities. The public mailing lists, being excessively public and frankly overrun with trolls, is even more useless for the purpose for which the channel was established; the same defect is why the public #wikipedia channel is not useful for this purpose.</p>
<p>The admins channel is, in principle, open to any admin. However, admins who, through their conduct, convince the channel's management that they are not trustworthy may be refused admission to the channel, and the channel management reserves the right to invite such other persons as they feel will benefit the channel's mission. This has included, to date, selected admins of projects other than enwiki, various Foundation staff, developers, and certain others who, while not admins, are nonetheless trusted by the Foundation and by channel management. Note that "trusted by the Foundation and by channel management" is not the same as "trusted by the enwiki community".</p>
<p>Participation in the channel is not "vital" to being an administrator. The participation of a decent number of administrators is vital to the Foundation, but there is no particular reason why any particular administrator has to be there. If participation in the channel will not assist you in being an administrator, there is no reason for you to be there, and you might as well be somewhere else. The channel exists to serve the Foundation's purposes, not to serve your personal purposes.</p>
<p>Again, the reason why there can be no on-wiki discussion of the sorts of matters that necessitate the confidentiality I discussed earlier is the fact that the wiki is inherently public and these matters are necessarily confidential. It's not that you, Geogre, are specifically not trusted (although, to be frank, I personally would not trust you), but that anything said publicly on the wiki is necessarily shared with everyone in the world, and <i>that</i> includes any number of people who are not trusted, and who have demonstrated hostile or malicious intent toward the Foundation and its projects. In addition, the Foundation imposes a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy" class="extiw" title="m:Privacy_policy">privacy policy</a> on its volunteers, and we are obliged to adhere to it when dealing with Foundation matters. The constraints of that policy prohibit public disclosure of the circumstances of most of the incidents that necessitate the existence of a nonpublic forum such as the administrator's channel. If you are dissatisfied with that, I suggest you take it up with the Foundation's Board of Trustees; they are the source of that policy and it is they that would need to change it.</p>
<p>Now, at this point, because of the fact that there are so many people now admitted to the admin's channel who do not accept its purpose for existing and, in fact, enough who are actively hostile toward that purpose, the admin's channel is probably mostly useless for its original purpose. The channel has instead become the equivalent of the "old hats" list of a.f.u (see <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html" class="external text" title="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html" rel="nofollow">Clay Shirky's article on group dynamics in online fora</a>): a low-noise (or at least lower-noise) alternative to the main IRC channel (which is really quite the cesspit at times), used for general discussion of issues deemed to be of importance to the people who are engaged in "gardening" of the English Wikipedia community. It's my conclusion that the admin's channel has scaled beyond the point of usefulness, which means that it's probably time to create the "new hats" channel. (There actually was a channel filling this role for quite a long time, but it lost critical mass when four of its major participants all left the project or went on longish breaks at about the same time.) The current attacks on the channel (e.g. the several people who have in the past disdained it but recently have taken to lurking in it, supposedly to provide "accountability") are simply going to create more impetus to establish a new backchannel (to which they will not be invited) where gardening discussions will simply be moved to over time. The discussions will not cease, they will simply move, and by forcing them to move in this manner you will ensure that you are not part of those discussions. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 16:17, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I got here late, so I only read the original question. My answer is everyone has the right to talk to each other in private outside the wiki, everyone has the right not to.

<dd>Kelly, I certainly understand the importance of a conversation-speed setting for sensitive issues. Frankly, that's why I suggested the secure ArbCom channel, above; I'm not sufficiently versed in the canny means of Foundation back-office structure to know exactly who else would need such a channel, but I assume that an OTRS-staff channel would be reasonable as well. The current IRC structure is ill-suited to these needs, or, at the least, is better suited to other needs than to its own. It is demonstrably not secure; logs are leaked to users here, to email, to Wikitruth, to who knows where. That would make it seem a poor choice for the sorts of ArbCom or OTRS work that you appear to allude to. But by the same token, it is an "excellent" means to quickly debate typical administrative decisions. I don't think that requires any assumption of bad faith or cabalhood; it <i>is</i> efficient at that task. The problem is that, like everyone, admins can be wrong, and decisions that are logically discussed in secret appear to everyone else to have been brought to life more like Athena, full-grown from the head of Zeus. You have been actively involved in the necessarily-secret business in the past (although I'll confess to being more than a bit confused about your actual current role in the Foundation...), so do you have any insight into how we might <i>fix</i> this? This thread is evidence enough that it is not working as intended. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 18:40, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know this discussion is long enough already, but I just wanted to inject my own opinion here, as I've been thinking about the issue for some time. I feel that the problem is not with the use of IRC in general, but with the blanket prohibition on public logging, as stated on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC_channels" class="extiw" title="meta:IRC_channels">meta:IRC channels</a>. More specifically, the issue is not that there are private channels — as has been mentioned, people who <i>want</i> to conspire in private <i>will</i> find a way regardless — but that the most popular and convenient channels, including both #wikipedia and #wikipedia-en-admins, remain in "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas" mode by default. Thus, well-meaning people who simply want to discuss Wikipedia-related things on a real-time forum are encouraged to do so in a confidential setting, even if the actual matter being discussed could easily have withstood the light of day.</p>
<p>My proposal for fixing the problem would be to make all open Wikimedia IRC channels officially logged by default, and to announce this prominently in the channel topic as recommended by the <a href="http://freenode.net/channel_guidelines.shtml#logging" class="external text" title="http://freenode.net/channel_guidelines.shtml#logging" rel="nofollow">Freenode channel guidelines</a>. At least for some channels, including official but invite-only ones like #wikipedia-en-admins, the logs could be kept behind a password, available only to selected groups (ArbCom / all admins / etc.); the important thing is that official logs exist, not that they be available to anyone who Googles for them. Of course, private unlogged channels could still be created, and even made (semi-)official, for those who want and/or need such privacy. The important thing would simply be that someone who just wants to stop by to ask "is this edit vandalism?" should not be encouraged to do so on a confidential channel. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 16:46, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am in the admins channel because (a) I want to be and (b) my presence there is useful to the project insomuch as I can advise others on appropriate courses of action to take in specific situations (having previously proven myself competent to do so). (I am assuming that (b) is the case because, as of yet, nobody has sought to revoke my access or advise me that my presence is no longer beneficial.) I am aware that a small but noisy segment of the Wikipedia community no longer feels that I am worthy of trust; however, that opinion is apparently not shared by the Foundation, or by the bulk of the participants in the admins channel. I am still very much involved in gardening the Wikipedia community, and participate in the channel to that end. I offer my opinions because, in the past, many diverse people have indicated to me that my opinions have been helpful to them. You are, of course, free to disagree with them, but I think the project would be best served if you did so respectfully.</dd>
<dd>Now, I ask you: why do you care that I am a participant (and, in fact, leading member) of the admin's channel?

The fact that you are, as you say, "a leading member" of the admin's channel - shows just how out of touch those that continue to tolerate your presence there are.

<dd>I don't think you quite understand the meaning of "invite-only" in this context. "Invite-only" on a Freenode channel means that a channel operator has to invite you to the channel (or add you to the auto-invite list) before you can join. This is to distinguish such channels from non-invite-only channels, where anyone who isn't banned from the channel can join. Clearly a channel intended for English Wikipedia administrators has to be set up as invite-only in this sense. In other words, invite-only does not mean you have to "await an invite", it means you have to <i>request</i> one. Have either of you ever actually asked to join the channel? – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 13:51, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm a 12 year IRC veteran, I know how it works. It's invite only because the channel operators, who are admins here from the sound of it, wantto keep certain users out.

<dd>Aye, there's the rub. I realize how difficult changing the policy of an existing channel (not to mention dozens of them) on such an issue would probably be; but on the other hand, I doubt getting dozens or hundreds of users to simultaneously move to a new channel would be any easier. I doubt most people on, say, #wikipedia care one bit whether the channel is logged or not, but by the same token they're not going to bother to join "#wikipedia-logged" when the channel they're already on is working just fine. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 20:37, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem is that secret IRC discussions are being invoked onwiki as grounds for admin action, even when such secrecy appears far from paramount.

<dd>Indeed that is the problem. If it's secret, it should stay secret and the channel ops/monitors should try to ensure such discussions have no consequences for individuals (no talk of blocking established users, attempts to undermine them, no blackening of names); or if it's to include all that, then it must be possible for users to find out who said what about them so they can challenge it. The ArbCom channel and mailing list exist for when established users have to be discussed discreetly. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:12, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Kelly Martin that the people who make the serious decisions about Wikipedia need to be able to talk with each other in private; but I doubt they are doing that on IRC any more, as it doesn’t seem very private judging from the toxic leaks which ignited this debate. The issue doesn't concern that but whether administrators and others should make routine decisions about blocking and suchlike on IRC instead of on Wikipedia: I believe they should do it on Wikipedia, to be transparent. And if on occasion they need to discuss something privately—for example, to outwit a vandal who monitors their activities—they could surely do that by e-mail. I would like to see as many administrators as possible follow such a principle, which would spare them lapsing into the gossip and slander so natural to informal conversation but so hurtful to the targets if revealed in the cold light of day. It is still possible, of course, to be gossipy and conspiratorial on Wikipedia itself, but there you do at least take more care, knowing the parties involved might read what you say, or that you might be called for breaching policies and guidelines. I can understand that some editors might enjoy socialising on IRC: I see no harm in that, so long as a voluntary code-of-conduct be observed—for example, no discussing Wikipedia business directly or criticising editors not present. A room moderator or appointee of the sort (excuse me, I've never been on IRC) could keep each session on the straight and narrow. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 18:26, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's an issue of speed and efficiency though. In IRC you can resolve in a few minutes something that would take hours on-wiki. Not everyone likes playing talk page tag. Hell, I don't even use the talk pages of anyone who I can contact on IRC because it's just that better. IRC clients will ping when you are contacted; Wikipedia doesn't. If you aren't browsing Wikipedia but are still at your computer, you won't get a talk page message, but you will get an IRC PM. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 19:44, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Absolutly, there's a flipside to this whole IRC situation that nobody has noticed, or doesn't want notice. Decisions can be made to block a user within seconds, but just as easily, a decision to unblock can also be made, a discussion that could take a day on Wiki can be done in an hour on IRC. And after all is said, we choose on admins on their ability to look at the evidence available on Wikipedia regardless of where or who presents it. Is an AIV report on IRC any less valid than an AIV report at WP:AIV - Nope, the evidence still has to exist on Wikipedia or the blocking admin will get a bollocking. --<font color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Kind Regards -</b> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><b>Heligoland</b></a> | <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><b>Talk</b></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland"><b>Contribs</b></a></font> 20:02, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you need assistance, what's wrong with posting on the administrators' boards? Not only will you get a quick response, but you will probably get it from someone you don't usually work with, which is healthier. And everybody will know about it, which is more useful. As for unblocking, why would there need to be a rush? There's too much unblocking going on already, in my opinion. And usually a number of people are watching an incident once it's been presented on the noticeboard, so I see even less need for IRC with unblocking: those without IRC would be half in the dark as to what was going on. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 21:05, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

Even if the channel was disbanded tomorrow, and all participants congenially came to AN/I to discuss all issues, it doesn't guarantee more participation...just more eyes to see things. (Which I won't deny is all many are asking for)</li>
<li><i>And everybody will know about it, which is more useful.</i> Everyone can know, if they eyeball the block logs. Even more people would know if Admins would post their block actions to AN/I as they occur, as I wish they would. While advanced warning of block actions on AN/I would be great, I suspect some admins feel time is more critical - hence, discussing it in the immediate forum of IRC, than on-wiki.

Hmmm, this argument isn't going to die, is it? It's so long now I can't find where I should put this, so here goes.</p>
<p>This thing about administrative actions not being discussed on IRC. As far as I'm aware there's no rule stating <i>where</i> on-wiki you have to discuss administrative actions. So it's perfectly acceptable for a small group of users to disucss administrative actions on their own user talk pages, yes? Becuase it's logged, "open channel", call it what you will. However, every administrator does not read every other administrator's talk page, so they're not going to know about it unless they specifically go looking, are they? So surely the argument about different parties not being equally well-informed applies there as well? So we should go one step further and insist all administrative-action-related discussion takes place on this page? I don't understand this approach to the matter at all – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 21:25, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For that matter, if discussion of administrative actions is banned on IRC, is there anything to stop people discussing administrative actions privately in a different channel, and then hastily posting stuff on each others' talk pages after they've already made the decision just in case anyone asks for a "record of the discussion"?

<dd>Oh, one more thing. Are administrators prohibited from discussing administrative actions with each other via email?

<dd>Yes, it is fine to discuss on other pages than this, because that leaves a trail of accountability, though if speed is the concern (as it is of a couple of people above), you will get more attention and action if you post on the administrators' boards rather than on one person's talk page. And let's not exaggerate Wikipedia's slowness—it gives you alerts when you get a note on your talk page, and you can exchange talk very quickly if you have to. But if the matter is so complex that it needs an involved conversation, much better to place it on the administrators' boards and get advice from others, tangents notwithstanding. Seeing the arguments written down and being able to read them over and consider your comments and actions is in my opinion likelier to result in a wise decision.</dd>

<dd>Well, <i>I</i> have no intention of using email for such things, just as I consider myself capable of using IRC in an acceptable way (though it's too unpleasant to do so at the moment).

<dd>As for e-mail, personally I've only discussed administrative actions via private e-mail twice in the time I've been on Wikipedia. Both times left me feeling vaguely dirty, even though the issues being discussed were the antics of permabanned users and even though on both occasions it was the banned user themselves who first took the matter to e-mail. I just don't personally like discussing things "off the record" if it can be avoided, and find maintaining such secrecy to be often stressful. ("Can I say this? Where did I hear that? Will I reveal something by acting on this?") Still, I do accept the need for such privacy in certain cases — I just wish we wouldn't encourage it for trivial matters. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 00:56, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think SlimVirgin has the right answer - if the admins need a private channel to discuss confidential situations, that's fine, but that channel shouldn't have a visible impact on the public wikipedia. If something needs to occur without a public explanation, it should occur by an Office action, not by a random admin stating that they are acting for reasons that they cannot disclose, but that were discussed on a private IRC channel. There is some risk that any private communication channel will result in a de facto exception to the "little or no campaigning" rule that is forming, but I don't see a good solution to that, except to ask editors to report any off-wiki campaigning that they see. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 14:48, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm afraid the "leading lights" or IRCadmins have abused the channel to such an extent that no one will ever trust anything that come out of it again. Too much dirty work has been done there. It need to be closed and quickly. Then we need to make an example of those admins who have abused the system their with their lies and clumsy plotting. As for those who just stood idly by in the channel gleefully listening to it all but saying nothing, their attempts, to distance themselves from it all now, claiming "they called Jimbo" or "I advised against" are quite frankly nauseating. they knew what was going on and did nothing. They are no better then the ringleaders. The way their behaviour changed the moment Jimbo walked into that room was akin to a teacher entering a class of delinquent juveniles.

<dd>Yes, I did hear you the first time. But since your main concern seems to be with the conduct of certain people, my question is nonetheless relevant. Do you want a replacement channel with different rules about "openness" established (so that as far as accountability is concerned, it is no different to the mailing list), or do you want the channel to be removed entirely and no replacement created. Your tone gives the impression that you wish for the latter of these. However, it seems to me that there is nothing to stop the people whose conduct you have a problem with from simply taking their discussions elsewhere. The rest of us (neutral parties such as myself, who nevertheless find IRC discussion useful) are then deprived of a resource which we wish to use (and have always wished to use) for productive purposes. On the other hand, setting up a more open channel would prevent the abuse and coruption of which you speak from taking place, forcing out those who wished to use it for that purpse. They may well still choose to take their discussions elsewhere, of course – but the rest of us need not be impeded as a result – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 19:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That all rather depends on the fates of the lying and unpleasant admins who corrupted IRCadmins in the first place, if they are allowed to remain as admins then no admins can be trusted to have secret wiki-concerned conversations.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive69_8770.html" title="Edit section: My own conclusion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">My own conclusion</span></h3>
<p>I really, really, really am trying to read without jaundice, here. My own conclusion, from reading the above, about the question I asked (ignoring all of the other stuff) is that it's down to "it's for private communications between the Foundation and certain trusted admins" (Kelly) and "<a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>" from Gurch (not meaning to denigrate there, but you did say that you like IRC and don't like noticeboards).</p>
<p>It seems to me that, if it does exist so that certain (i.e. selected) trusted (and "by whom?" and "how do we know?" come up) administrators and the Foundation is the reason, then why are those persons not inducted into the Foundation? I cannot imagine what sort of data is private enough that it cannot be revealed to the project <i>but can</i> be revealed to an IRC channel. Checkuser data? That cannot be revealed to anyone but ArbCom. Anyone who uttered that stuff in an open IRC channel would be a fool and should be drummed out. Slander/libel of living persons? We discuss that stuff on the noticeboards all the time, because it's something has to happen <i>on the Wiki</i> for us to address. People's real political activities? That's no one's business but ArbCom, if even theirs. Kelly doesn't explain, even in vague terms, why the rest of the administrators cannot be told this stuff nor, even in vague terms, why other administrators can. More particularly, I don't get any sense that the rest of us cannot perform our duties without the information.</p>
<p>Additionally, if such were the function, and if the function were so strong that we cannot even be told what it is, so strong that we <i>must</i> assume that the channel is used for that and only for that (because no one can check, and if someone sees something else going on there, he or she cannot report it or prove it), it would have been negated the instant a non-administrator were in the channel. In fact, at present two non-administrators (certainly one, and I think two or three) have "ops" in the channel. Also, we have nowhere gotten any indication of why the <i>logical</i> and <i>secure</i> medium for discussing sensitive matters (e-mail and mailing lists) are not sufficient.</p>
<p>The idea that an IRC is better than e-mail because it's real time is silly. The other person has to be awake, at a computer, and online, <i>as well as on IRC,</i> to be available for chat, just like e-mail. If you're both at your computers, you can send e-mails back and forth as quickly as chat. If you're not, then the chat makes no more sense than e-mail. It's a foolish argument that really shouldn't be offered.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I don't see anything I'm missing out on. I can be a good admin without that channel. I'm not sure that I could be one with it, but I know I'm not a bad one without it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:17, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So don't use IRC if you don't want to. And shut down #wikipedia-en-admins... it won't actually accomplish anything, but it would prevent possible criticisms of the channel. The rest of it (that IRC is bad in general, the strawman that IRC participation is required, the conclusion that the opposite extreme is better (that participation should be discouraged)) is all a waste of time, and nearly trolling. A lot of work gets done on IRC with regard to the wikimedia servers, the toolserver, and for other projects, and nothing suggested so far could lessen the work that gets done over IRC. (and probably won't change the "no logging" default used across many channels) --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 18:23, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So <i>who</i> has said that IRC is bad in general? It wasn't me. Accusing me of "nearly trolling" would be considered a personal attack by some of the block-happy people who hang out on en.admins.irc. In fact, what I have said is that the en.admins.irc has no philosophical justification. The fact that three to four non-administrators are some of the heaviest users of it should have alarmed the people who claimed the great need for trusted environments as much as it did the people convinced that those people are generally up to promoting their own good above all else. If you're <i>in favor</i> of the original justification for that channel, you should be outraged at what it is now. As for the media channel, the dev channel, etc., when these same people use those channels <i>without check from the other users,</i> they will have succumbed to the weakness of the medium, too, and gone again toward the promoting of little playgrounds for little people to stroke their egos. All I ask is that we have some justification for the sacrifices that we take onboard by having "private" channels, when we have "private" nothing else on Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>I would urge you, though, to read my essay, if you believe that you're near to characterizing my views accurately. I promise you that it's pretty well written.

<dd>Actually I didn't say I like IRC, just that I hate mailing lists and this page. Right now I hate IRC too, because it's caused people to get into this mess. But I take your point. (As you can probably guess, I also didn't put too much thought into those one-word answers; fortunately Kelly Martin seems to have compensated for my lack of verbosity by writing a whole page of stuff in response.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry if I misstated. I was asking, though, why we accept a non-Wikipedia and anti-Wikipedian medium.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My point is that mailing lists can be fast, and e-mail is fast. There is a different <i>feel</i> to IRC, but there are huge limitations to it as well (limitations I discuss in my essay; in short, it's line/buffer length and lack of persistence). I feel that in-depth reasoning is not possible when you get five words per line and that any on-Wikipedia action affecting users deserves some detailed (and usually some slow) reasoning. Emergencies occur, but they're pretty darned rare. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:18, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ah, I remember being a little puzzled when I read that the first time... what exactly is this "line/buffer length" thing of which you speak? OK, you can't write an entire essay in one line, granted, but that doesn't matter. That's not the way conversation works. You can fit a perfectly good, <i>long</i> sentence (or even two) into one IRC "message". Yes, it will wrap to the next line, but so will it in any other medium. IRC is not for posting essays; if you want to say a lot, say it a sentence at a time, and people will read each sentence as you say it. If they have something to say, they may be patient and wait until the end, or they may interrupt you in mid-sentence. That's how conversation works – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 23:49, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not true. Apart from anything else, you'd either have to schedule your email client to send and recieve every ten seconds, or keep hitting the "Send/Recieve" button while the other person was typing. And if you kept replying to the previous person's email, eventually you'd be sending tens of kilobytes of text back and forth each time just to transmit one line of conversation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, IRC has been around for a while – it predates HTTP, HTML and wikis (if not SMTP) by several years, so let's not get too bogged down in arguments over whether "IRC is better"; the benefits and drawbacks of decades-old protocols have been pretty extensively discussed elsewhere, and are not really relevant to our "problem". For general collaboration – a central part of Wikipedia – people are entitled to use whatever method of communication they find to be most productive – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 19:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we had persistence (the words stuck around via logs), portability (we could take them onto our user pages or policy pages), and accountability (some rules for what's allowed and not allowed), I'd be pretty indifferent and regard en.admins.irc as just another venue. The lack of those three forces me to ask why we grace the thing with our name and allow the implication that it has some status other than "chat room." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:18, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If these back channels are used to discuss confidential matters, shouldn't we have a mechanism for deciding who has access to them? It's perfectly OK for appointees to exercise delegated power confidentially, but these people should be appointed and the power should be properly and publicly delegated, either by the community or by the foundation.

<li>The last time I asked a question like that, I was told (by a now blocked user), "tough, loser." At the time, I figured that wasn't an official position, but no official position emerged. Is it Danny? I've known Danny for years, and I would be shocked that he'd act without process. Is it Jimbo? If so, it would be uncharacteristic, given his statement of purpose on his user page. Is Brad? I don't know him, so I have no comment. The point is that it <i>seemed</i> to me to be self-selection, and that's not good if the self-selected also have any say on exclusion. I'm still not sure that I believe Kelly when she says that the channel was created by Jimbo or the Foundation, as she can't recall the details.

<li>Anyone in the channel can see the list of people with access to the channel (/cs access #wikipedia-en-admins list), and anyone inside could protest if non-admins they didn't trust got added, I guess.

<dd>FGS, it is a private club devoted to the adoration of Kelly(who is not even an admin), James and Co. No doubt Danny who founded it does not see it that way, but that is what it is. Anyone who fails to follow the line there is made to feel very unwelcome. The rest are so grateful and pleased to be there they will do anything asked of them. The only time they behave themselves is when Jimbo turns up.

<dd>You mean you <i>don't</i> behave when Jimbo turns up, or that there have been some other occasions when you've behaved? I disagree with Giano, but it <i>shouldn't be possible for his position to have legitimacy.</i> The fact is that I have seen, with my own eyes, people conspiring to block him. I have seen, with my own eyes, three people talking about their desire to "kill" Irpen "slowly." I have seen, with my own eyes, people talking about absent users as "process wonks" (that's me!) and "wiki-lawyers" and "trolls," and these were steady contributors. In other words, because it has occurred in the past, Giano's broadside could be wrong on a specific occasion, but it is correct on another occasion. <b>Every one of us</b> is undermined when we speak to users because of this. How can I tell an actual troll "there is no cabal," when I know that there has, in fact, been collusion and sniping and ugly denigration? I used to believe in the aggregate good will of the project, that, if Kelly or you were to engage in character assassination, others would quickly put an end to the nasty talk -- the way things often happen at the general Wikipedia IRC channel. However, after having user after user say that he or she was "frightened" of being "kickbanned" for protesting, and after seeing, on three occasions now, <i>threats</i> used against anyone who told people to stop being so malignant, I think the problem is in the idea of an <i>owned</i> IRC medium.

<dd>So far in this discussion, I've tried to bring up some points that I thought might be worth discussing merely from observation of what people had said before; from an outsider's point of view, so to speak. However, as the conversation has progressed over the last 24 hours, I have become increasingly concerned. I feel compelled to bring up my personal experience at this point, as it would appear that either I am guilty of gross misconduct and should be desysopped immediately, or I am not. I would very much like to know which.</dd>

<dd>I was asked if I would find the channel useful soon after I became an administrator. It must have been some time in July; I forget exactly when. Had I requested access sooner (well, any time after my RfA), I am certain I would have been granted it; I had no record of incivility or, as far as I'm aware, anything else that would be percived as problematic. I started, participated in, and listened with interest to many productive discussions in that channel, and I certainly feel I have more experience and a better understanding of Wikipedia as a result of being there. I certainly don't regret my involvement. Yet apparently, I am either to blame for months of abuse, or "nauseating" as a result of my faliure to do anything about it.</dd>

<dd>I probably spent thousands of hours logged into that channel (not always actively conversing, of course, but nevertheless logged in), before this argument flared up during the ArbCom elections and I decided I wouldn't want to be seen to be taking sides. So, then, I'm an administrator, and I used IRC. Frequently. I'm not entirely sure whether that makes me an "IRCadmin"; I sincerely hope it does not, as if it does, I am shocked to hear such allegations as "lies and clumsy plotting" directed at me.</dd>

<dd>If it does not, my situation hardly seems to be better. I wonder aloud whether I "stood idly by in the channel gleefully listening to it all but saying nothing". It's quite possible that I did, if you define that to mean being logged in but not speaking. Generally such behaviour indicates that I'm out, asleep, or just concerned with other things. On the other hand, there were discussions that I did read, but did not contribute to. Generally I couldn't think of anything useful to say, or wasn't particularly bothered about the issue, but I read them nonetheless; I like to be informed.</dd>

<dd>This last paragraph also does little to reassure me. I don't particularly adore Kelly. She's not my type. For that matter, she doesn't particularly like me. I spent several months on <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_B_bfb3.html" title="User:Kelly Martin/B">the B-list</a> (remember that?) and it was me that first discovered and questioned its existence. Interestingly, I never discussed the matter on-wiki; I brought it up in the IRC channel. The fact that it was subsequently MfD'd and deleted without my involvement (I was on holiday) seems to demonstrate that not everything that happened in that channel was dictated by one party. My relationships with James and whoever you're referring to when you say "and Co" are also notably lacking in the adoration area.</dd>

<dd>I find the notion I belonged (and, I suppose still do belong; last time I checked I still had access) to some sort of "private club" bewildering. Prior to my RfA I had had virtually no dealings of any sort with administrators, other than the odd one-time message/reply over some trifling issue. I was nominated by a non-administrator, and supported primarily by non-administrators. That situation changed little over the next month (it inevitably changed a small amount out of necessity). Certainly I had done absolutely nothing that might warrant some kind of "membership"; yet I was welcomed as another administrator and, as I say, had many productive discussions in the following months.</dd>

I was (and still am) relatively inexperienced, so I'm sure I did something wrong at some point. But I'm curious as to the percieved magnitude of it.</dd>

<dd>[in response to Gurch 20:06]&#160;&#160;&#160; Obvious hyperbole doesn't usually require a reply, as far as I know. If Giano does sincerely believe that those in the channel spend time adoring Kelly or James F, it would be good to explain that further, because I just haven't seen that. Bishonen did mention she felt unwelcome on the channel... that's unfortunate, I don't think any admin should be made to feel unwelcome there, and it'd be nice if we could change that. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 20:28, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In response to Interiot: Did you notice, "You're not doing yourself any favors?" Did you notice the invitation to leave? Would you have perceived that as an implied threat? A lot of people do. Bishonen is not cowed, of course, by ridiculous puffing up like that, but many people are, especially when people were just saying that they might announce Jimbo's selection of ArbCom for him (trans. "I am important") and others speaking over and over again of how important she is to Jimbo/Danny/Brad/the Cosmos. Given that that particular person has seen fit before to go to talk pages and say, "You are heading for a ban" (that's ban, folks, not block), it sure could be construed as a threat. Where, then, were the voices piping up and saying, "You're full of beans! You can't threaten people like that! You're not the center of the universe, you nasty, bitter solipcist." Where were the voices saying, "Will people <i>please</i> stop talking bad about everyone else?" (Curiously, that occurred <i>right in the middle</i> of one user directing everyone at RDH's blog so that they could collective condemn it and complain about his complaining.) The modus operandi here was to whine about "whiners," to insult people who they thought were insulting, and to continually refer to each other about their own importance. If we need something to stop, it might be that. Are these the people we trust? Are these the people we want with confidential material? Are these the people we think should have a private space so that they can speak without fear of accountability? They aren't for me, but I'm just a drone, just a writer. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:36, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why thank you for the info Geogre! It helps put my mind at ease...I was wondering how that rude little anon comment got on my board (And on X-mas too for X's sake!:). I chose to delete it rather than feed some nameless troll, but had they bothered to sign, or even put a bit more thought into it, I might have deemed it sponge worthy. So I've now tightened security a bit and disabled anon commenting. But I'm a bit gratified that my tiny community has finally come under the eye of the mighty IRC cabal. I must be saying something right there, to have them interrupt such a vital and deep philosophical discussion amongst all the lil fluttering fairies to try and gather an X-mas stoning party.

<li><i>Demoting</i>? I can see why perfectly sensible proposals, in line with the usual business practice where privileged accounts are concerned, are rejected when temporary desysoping is seen as demotion. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 15:52, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, the obvious issue is, what's temporary mean? If a controversial administrator gets into a car accident and doesn't edit for four months, can he automatically regain his adminship? Ideally, this would be the case, but what if someone raised a complaint- would this admin have to go through a potentially unpassable RFA? <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 11:34, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>It's not one of the hottest concerns we have, but people who aren't here aren't here, and, if they come back, they'll be way, way, way out of the loop and therefore not enjoying community trust. Administrative status is not a caste one is born or reborn into, and it's annoying that we keep treating it like an inherent quality of the person. (If a person came back after only two years, he'd go looking for VfD, VfU, be unaware of WEB, BIO, ALBUm, etc. He'd never know that we had echelons of echelons of IRC, which is now less and less optional. He'd never know a ton of things, including where the speedy deletes are, how templates are controlled, what userboxes are, etc. I'm not sure he could function very well as an admin upon his return.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:57, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>True, but as he had been made an admin he is (presumably) a sensible person who would realise that the site would have changed a lot in two years. We should trust our admins to familiarise themselves with the new common practices before doing anything after a long break. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaven4x4x_5184.html" title="User:Raven4x4x">Raven4x4x</a> 13:22, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what other admins have been "out of the loop", but neither Zoe nor myself had much of a problem getting back in. Conversely, I've seen one or two freshly promoted admins that are pretty much clueless regarding how certain important parts of Wikipedia work. Unless you would propose an "admin exam" on rules knowledge that people have to pass upon promotion and return (say, 100 multiple choice questions, need at least 75 correct, and no I don't seriously think this is a good idea). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 13:30, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It depends on what the definition of an administrator is. If it's a person trusted by the community, then it should be a heck of a lot more fluid than once-chosen-always-holy. Great that Radiant! and Zoe got back in the swing of things, but that's not much of a data set to extrapolate from. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrowbait_dbc7.html" title="User:Crowbait">Crowbait</a> 18:03, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would not object to an Admin exam, but I imagine I'm in the minority here.

<dd>(after edit conflict) Only if the exam did not have question pooling, and had "open grading". I've been in distance education for the past 10 years. Creating a question pool, multiple-choice/single select and/or multiple-choice/multiple select, with scores released either by section or the entire exam, without giving out correct (and/or incorrect) choices selected - or even pass/fail only - would not compromise the integrity of future exams.

<p>Crossing the streams a bit, what with writing the test before the horse, aren't we? Anyway, it dead-standard practice on any system with access control to remove access when it's no longer used/required. Security concerns aside, it's just <i>tidy</i> to do so. The risks associated with auto-re-opping someone who has been away are microscopic.

<li>David's "wtf" can easily be explained: Virgin Unite is unquestionably a notable enterprise. I think a dose of good faith is probably called for here, and frankly if any other charitable matched-funders <i>don't</i> have articles then we should simply create them ourselves, thus forestalling the problem, because there is little doubt that people seeing the site banner will want to know who the matched funding providers are. If it's thought to be a problem then maybe we could create them on Meta as sponsors or something, but that's probably unnecessary. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 11:34, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"wtf" does not explain that. Anyway, I don't see that this organization is "unquestionably" notable. The sources in the article are relatively trivial: one is some barebones tax information, one is a PR release from the organization, one is a motorcycle website, and there at the end we have another PR release. The only actual reliable source is one part of a medley of several different philanthropic people, and is not even about the organization but is about Richard Branson.

There may be better sources, but the possibility of those existing is far from the organization being "unquestionably a notable enterprise", and those sources would need to be added to the article for it not to warrant merging into those other articles. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 11:54, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I stumbled upon <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_a79f.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User">Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User</a>, of which I was previously unaware. Fostering community and helping new users is an awesome goal, but I'm a little worried about the MySpacy-nature (some people have a list of 10 or 20 "adoptees" via the {{<a href="../../../a/d/o/Template%7EAdopter_9277.html" title="Template:Adopter">adopter</a>}} userbox) and the involvement of kids combined with the perceived permanent relationship (see posts about "forever families" on talk page). The more official this project becomes, the worse the damage should something disreputable hit the media. Am I just being paranoid? Can this project be nudged in a slightly different direction? <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2006-12-29 08:46Z</small></i></span></p>

<dd>I think the Adopt-a-User program is aimed at helping new users, not necessarily young users (although sometimes they overlap). I guess changing "<b>Older</b> editors can "adopt" newbies..." to perhaps "<b>Established</b> editors can "adopt" newbies..." in the intro might clear up some confusion. <a href="../../../g/z/k/User%7EGzkn_c916.html" title="User:Gzkn">Gzkn</a> 09:20, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually I frequently recommend <a href="../../../a/d/o/WP%7EADOPT_c4e7.html" title="WP:ADOPT">WP:ADOPT</a> to editors whether or not they're new to Wikipedia when someone seems to be making a sincere effort to help build an encyclopedia but is getting in trouble with site policies. Sometimes I've shortened a userblock when an editor pledges to enter the program. It's a positive and productive way for people to get their questions answered and adjust to the way this site works. Most of their mentorships are successful. Maybe a few superficial elements of the project space could use improvement, but I'm proud we have it. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 14:43, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At this stage, I wouldn't want to offer an opinion as to the utility of this program. But I would say that something like <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECAblonde15_e606.html" title="User:CAblonde15">CAblonde15</a>'s asking for mentorship makes me raise an eyebrow. As I read the username and contribs, this user is implying she is a 15-year-old blonde from California, and her only edit is the {{adoptme}} template. This looks a bit like bait of some kind to me. She(?) is on my watchlist, but I wonder what others think. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 15:35, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As with anything else at this site, an occasional problem user tries to exploit the program. One confirmed example is BooyakaDell, whom I recently banned after an investigation concluded that this account was a sockpuppet of previously banned <a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a>.

That sort of example doesn't make me doubt the usefulness of the program any more than vandalism to the front page featured article makes me doubt the utility of having featured articles. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charg</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0c0">e!</span></a></i></sup></font> 18:13, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I am prepared to implement and run a bot to automatically protect templates and images appearing on the Main Page and Today's Featured Article, and then remove that protection when they are no longer in these high profile locations. Automating these important but monotonous tasks would be one way to help prevent some high profile vandalism we have seen lately, but I realize the idea of adminbots are frowned upon by some, so I would appreciate feedback from others.

I don't hold with reverting even on a bad mood day (&lt;g&gt;), but would appreciate some help getting through to this guy that one person cannot make us all look silly because of his take on the world. I asked for templates like <span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}</span> and such be tagged first, or an enumerated list of what he perceives as imbalances before reasserting the tagging, but he's apparently willing to push 3RR and ignore the talk.<br />
<br />
As far as I can see, as others have commented, the article is balanced and was a FAC article. With the news facts settling out, I would prefer to see it locked for say 36 hours or so whilst the news agencies get some facts out, as the recent changes are occasioned by the execution. I leave it in your hands. I'm not into edit warring, and his actions all seem stubbornly childish. // <b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fra</a></b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html" title="User talk:Fabartus"><font color="green">nkB</font></a> 17:37, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

The problem in the discusion page was that he didnt find until afterwards where in that talk page I had flagged the POV tag. This kind of editor just makes everyone else want to go home, leaving wikipedia to the trolls.

<dl>
<dd>Replace the old contents with a redirect to the target page, unless the consensus was to specifically merge content and delete. The history should be retained for GFDL purposes and there's no need to hide it from non-administrators normally. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2006-12-31 02:19Z</small></i></span></dd>
<dd>Do you want a longer answer?&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>You might want to make sure the text was actually merged properly before replacing with a redirect at the original page. A very important step is to say in the edit summary when adding in the text being merged, <b>where the merged text has come from</b>. Otherwise, someone years later looking through the page history sees a chunk of text appearing as if from nowhere. They might even think the merging editor wrote the text, but in fact for the full edit history and to correctly attribute who wrote which bits of the text (ie. the GFDL requirements) you need to be directed back to the original page. So put something in the edit summary like "merged from <a href="../../../e/x/a/Example.html" title="Example">example</a> per AfD discussion". If the merge has already taken place without a properly informative edit summary, find a minor edit that you can attach the more informative edit summary to, and consider putting a note on the talk page of the article. There is something called merging page histories, but I believe that only tends to work if the edit histories can be easily synchronised (which is rare).</dd>
<dd>The other thing to consider is what to do with the talk page. Obviously if the article being merged doesn't have a talk page, then no problem. If it does, then you can (a) add a note to tell people that the redirect (which is now where the merged text used to be) must not be deleted because it contains relevant edit history, and (b) move or link to discussions and archives of discussions. One way is to go to the page into which the text has been merged, and put a link in the talk page archive box (create one if there isn't one) to the talk page of the page where the merged text came from. An alternative is simply to move the talk page to an archive talk subpage of the page where you merged the text to. For example: move Talk:Page 1 to Talk:Page 2/Archive 2.</dd>
<dd>The final point to consider is that all of this can be done by anyone. None of it requires admin tools, though an admin is required to close the debate. I'm not certain, but I think the general procedure has been to just close the debate and leave those involved with the actual editing of the page to do the actual merging and tidying up. Though invariably when people in general move text from one article to another, they hardly ever stick to the detailed process I've outlined above, though they should. Uninformative edit summaries is the most common error, breaking the chain of attribution. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 02:37, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good points about edit summaries. As for talk pages I would just tag with {{oldafdfull|result='''Merge''' to [[foo]]}} and leave it; I find that talk page movements generally cause confusion and as an archive it might as well stay at the old location. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2006-12-31 02:49Z</small></i></span></dd>

<dd>AfD is not the places where merges are decided (the clue is in the third word of its name), so closing admins are in no way obligated to carry out the merge - indeed, IMO it's something best left to regular editors of that article/subject area. To avoid confusion, I simply close AfDs with a large proportion of 'merge' opinions as 'keep' (which is what they are basically arguing for) and note that editors are free to merge as usual. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 18:49, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When I was more active in closing VFDs (yeah, that's a good clue of how long ago it was) I asked about what should be done with merges. The answer I received, and the method I have used since (including about a week ago when I closed an AFD archive) was to subst: the merge tag on the page to be merged and then alter the text to specify that it should be merged per AFD, rather than is proposed for a merge. Whether any of these were ever carried out I cannot say, but it certainly isn't the responsibility of the closing admin to do the merge. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 23:14, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I merge the easy ones, but if I don't feel like doing the actual content merge I do this: redirect the merge source to the merge target, then leave a note on the talk page of the merge target with a link to the pre-redirected version. This way, if nobody does anything the default is the source stays as a redirect, otherwise if nobody does anything it'll just linger around until another person AFDs it (it's not uncommon to see "previous AFD resulted in consensus to merge but nobody merged it, so now delete").

The comment said that I was a troll for afd'ing it and that he would like to indef block me for it.

<dd>Royalguard does make a good point. Maybe we can learn from the way WikiProjects and even entire wikipedias are deleted (there is a page on meta that deals with deleting inactive WikiMedia Foundation wikis). In those cases, inactivity seems to be the only criterion. There has been talk of Esperanza beoming less and less active, so maybe if left to itself it will die a natural death? Has there ever been precedent for deleting an active organisation with this much history? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:41, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anything that harms Wikipedia gets deleted. Esperanza is slowly dying anyway, all of the senior members were leaving, with only excitable new users with no sense of history or wikipedian policy left behind. It's becoming more and more dangerous, and if there is no precedent, better to set one than to keep something around that a <b>lot</b> of people want deleted. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 00:45, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dev920, it is considered bad form for the originator of an XfD to ask for it to be closed early. It is terribly easy for people to get the wrong idea and think you want it closed at a point where the nomination is succeeding. I realise you aren't, but for appearances sake it is best to leave things to take their natural course. Anyway, "more and more dangerous"? Some of those attracted to Esperanza may be misguided, but they are hardly in the same class as the vandal who has been targeting the main page and the featured articles on the main page. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:01, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>New Wikimedia project goes through a preliminary testing phase and the "Wikipedia" project itself is already unequivocally decided to be appropriate for Wikimedia. The concept of a "Wikipedia" has already been well-tested and is a fundamental project for the Wikimedia Foundation. These projects are shut down for inactivity because that is almost the only reason why there would be any reason to shut them down. A Japanese Wikipedia would only be at odds with the goals of the Wikimedia Foundation if all the other Wikipedias were also at odds with it. With a Wikipedia project, anyone can create it and it could be about anything at all, as the various subpages of Esperanza have shown. I don't think there is much history of the concept of "deleting an active organisation", because there is no other "organisation" that has decided to separate itself so much from Wikipedia at large. There are no other "organisations" like this, because if you want to do something on Wikipedia you can simply create a Wikipedia page and do it—without gated access, without a sense of superiority, and without bureaucracy, and then possibly it gets deleted at MfD just like any other such page. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 00:56, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>In any case, this probably shouldn't be closed as a normal Mfd would. Maybe there should be some sort of admin "vote"-ing to determine what the Mfd discussion has determined (delete, keep, no consesus, inappropriate for Mfd, whatever), though that does seem a touch silly and bureaucratic. In any case, it seems like too major of a Mfd close to be done by a single administrator. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 00:46, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think the options and consensus is somewhat. The question is whether leaving it open is going to generate anything else that a summary would not. No commenter now is reading that whole discussion, and some appear to have only read the nomination statement. At a certain point, any new comment is just going to ignore the progress that is already made, with new commenters just giving visceral reactions about the project they love or hate. Given that it is not a vote, but a discussion, the question is whether the MfD should be closed and the discussion points summarized and reviewed elsewhere, with decisions about where and what to move being done more slowly and carefully than any 5-day MfD or any mostly ignored 2-day MfD. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:02, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I certainly wouldn't close it early, but I'm thinking that when it is closed normally, the consensus result per the discussion should be to turn all of the subpages into protected redirects to the main page and then write a historical essay there about Esperanza. Note that this doesn't actually delete anything; all of Esperanza remains in the history for everyone to see. It's an important part of Wikipedia history, and shouldn't just simply be deleted. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 02:32, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If that happens, you first move the subpage in question (to preserve the edit history), then return to the original page (now a redirect) and redirect that to the Esperanza front page, and add a note there saying that that subpage that redirects here was continued at whatever location it was moved to. If there are only a few links in "what links here", bypass the redirect manually for them and point them at the correct location. If there are hundreds of links, leave people to correct them themselves. I've looked at what links here for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Esperanza/Tutorial_Drive&amp;limit=659&amp;from=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Esperanza/Tutorial_Drive&amp;limit=659&amp;from=0" rel="nofollow">the Tutorial Drive</a>, and there are around 660 links, but the vast majority appear to be user talk pages, probably from a copy of the Esperanza newsletter left on members' talk pages. The Tutorial Drive was created on 31 October 2006. The what links here for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Esperanza/Alerts&amp;limit=556&amp;from=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Esperanza/Alerts&amp;limit=556&amp;from=0" rel="nofollow">the Alerts program</a> is surprisingly similar, at around 556 links. Again, mostly user talk pages or user pages. This program was broken off from the Esperanza main page on 19 September 2005. So far, just looking at these two programs, it seems that the links are mostly (though not all) contained to social interaction on user talk pages. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Esperanza/Reach_out&amp;limit=299&amp;from=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Esperanza/Reach_out&amp;limit=299&amp;from=0" rel="nofollow">Reach out program</a> has around 300 links, again, the vast majority being user talk page links. Reach out program created 11 November 2005. The Calendar program is similar. The Happy Birthday program page is not heavily linked as most activity seems to be on the subpages. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Esperanza/Collaboration_of_the_Month" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Esperanza/Collaboration_of_the_Month" rel="nofollow">Collaboration of the Month</a> has less than 50 links, but it was only created on 11 November 2006.

<dd>Talking of the history, when exactly did it start? I noticed the link to a September 2005 Signpost article, but was that merely a relaunch? I found the earliest version of Esperanza <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Esperanza&amp;oldid=20848643" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Esperanza&amp;oldid=20848643" rel="nofollow">here</a> from 12 August 2005, but I was mightily confused by Cyde's comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Esperanza&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97056332" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Esperanza&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97056332" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where he says <i>"even after years and many, many, second chances"</i>. I can't make a year and four months "years", no matter how many times I count on my fingers. I checked the deletion log, and I don't see any signs of it having been deleted before. I can only assume that Esperanza hasn't been around for years, which is strange because I seem to remember it being around before then (not that I was around very much before then). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 02:47, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>All in all, deleting the history of these pages isn't going to achieve anything useful, but will make many discussions on Wikipedia that link to the pages incomprehensible to new readers. Redirecting all subpages to the main Esperanza page and marking the main page as rejected is a much better solution. We don't even need to protect the redirects preventatively. We can get to that if anyone actually tries to resurrect them after the obvious consensus to discontinue Esperanza. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 13:16, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This may already have been addressed, but WikiProjects get deleted for more reasons than simply inactivity. We've seen projects which the community has felt to be in bad faith deleted at mfd before now, which should create the precedent for this deletion debate.

<li>Thanks for answering the query I raised about whether WikiProjects have been deleted before. Can you remember any off the top of your head? What other alternatives have been proposed? I know that content-focused projects (or at least the associated articles) have sometimes been transwikied to a wikia wiki. As Esperanza is so focused on Wikipedia, I guess that makes no sense at all. But it is the previous WikiProjects deleted for non-inactivity reasons that I'd be interested in. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 18:46, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>From a quick read-through of that, it appears that that was plain and simple a voting block. There was no other reason for the organization. EA has been called a voting block (on RfA's).

<p>Dmcdevit placed a range block on '208.54.0.0/17' due to Cplot accounts coming from that range.

I attempted to correct this by unblocking and re-blocking with the 'Block anonymous only' and 'Prevent account creation' boxes checked and the 'automatically block last IP address' box unchecked. In theory I would think that should allow already existing accounts to edit normally, right? If so, wouldn't it make sense to use a configuration like that for <b>most</b> blocks on determined sockpuppets/vandals?

It's not through Starbucks, but through Tmobile Hotspots which is located at many Starbucks (all of them in some regions) and many other locations as well. Tmobile uses only a few IPs for all 9,000 US locations. I had asked for the Foundation to write a letter to Tmobile someoneI provided the address after corresponding with Tmobile on the issue). The Wikimedia foundation has a project underway to help with this called the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/XFF/RFC_1918" class="extiw" title="meta:XFF/RFC_1918">XFF/RFC1918 project</a>. It would help a little. Everywhere I've tried to bring this up, the post has been reverted away over and over again. The cplot sockpuppets have been quite helpful in trying to restore the post, but apparantly some administrators think that being misinformed is an asset against vandals.</dd>

<dd>The important thing to understand is that this issue cannot just be swept under the rug. If this network of 9,000 LANs is being blocked because a single editor is talking about uncomfortable topics, then some solution has to be found. If a block of 9000 LANs does nothing to stop Cplot (and from what I can tell it doesn't) then why block it at all? Perhaps simply airing the uncomfortable topic would be a better approach than blocking an entire segment of the US internet. I don't think the Cplot sockpuppets are like any others. I think they're here to stay and until we address the underlying problems they're not going to stop. That's my sixth sense about this. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyNewYear2007Again_1cb7.html" title="User:HappyNewYear2007Again">HappyNewYear2007Again</a></dd>

<dd>The problem is that these hotspots are essentially low-tech open proxies. You can hop IPs by editing from the local Starbucks.

You'll find Dmcdevit blocking IPs for six month because a Cplot sockpuppet walked by a WiFi netowrk. It is so irresponsible. And Tmobile hotspots are not like open proxies. Far from it. Every user that logs onto a Tmobile hotpot is a customer of Tmobile. For serious abuse, Tmobile could tell you precisely who the person was that maade the edits from their network. These are not proxies at all. Tmobile runs a WAN using <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC 1918</a> internet protocols. Blocking this one IP it's much less aacceptable to block an IP that's the public address for over 9,000 LANs in the United States. This is Orwellian to say that blocking thousands of LANs is more acceptable than blocking a single user working from home. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInternetLiteracyIsFundamental_2a0d.html" title="User:InternetLiteracyIsFundamental">InternetLiteracyIsFundamental</a> 09:00, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The above sounds like Wikimedia need to keep up-to-date with the latest internet technology. Can someone clearly explain that they are up-to-date, and how this is being dealt with (if it can be)? How does "upgrading to hard blocks due to sleeper accounts" allow logged-in users to edit through that hotspot? Do logged-in users now have to limit themselves to non-blocked hotspot IPs? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:35, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've recently had a bad experience with the Speedy Renaming process — and similar things have happened to me before. I put up a category for speedy renaming, as it contained a glaring and embarrassing spelling mistake: "Category:Occitan personnalities". This clearly needed correcting to Category:Occitan personalities, but the category was, at the time, rather full, so I proposed it at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_7d72.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion">Wikipedia:Categories for discussion</a>, hoping to get some help with the transfer of articles. Instead, when I returned to the page, I found that my proposal had disappeared. Some detective work eventually revealed that it had been removed to the discussion page for category deletion. No-one had bothered to inform me (this seems to be standard, if discourteous, practice; the same thing happened to another of my proposals within a day or so), no indication had been left at the discussion page, and the renaming notice at the category had been left unchanged, pointing to a non-existent discussion here.</p>
<p>Someone then objected to it on political grounds, it was largely ignored, and today I find that the renaming has been rejected as "no consensus". Well, there was no chance for consensus, as the proposal had been hijacked and removed from discussion at the renaming section. The result was that an obvious and clear renaming proposal was rejected, and the embarrassing spelling mistake stayed. (I decide to do all the work myself, but when I returned I found that the category had been virtually depopulated, only one article remaining; presumably by the objector — who has just tried to propose it for deletion again.)</p>
<p>At the very least, proposers should be informed that their proposal is being moved, and the notice at the category altered accordingly. Better would be a policy that ruled out this sort of thing. Perhaps a move should depend upon the agreement of the proposer, or a deletion proposal should wait until the renaming proposal had gone through (with provisions made for very populous categories, so that work isn't duplicated unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 12:05, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was actually moved to the substantial <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_7d72.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion">Wikipedia:Categories for discussion</a>. Prior to today, for some historic reason, this was still titled "<a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_ac22.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion</a>" despite the content being clear that the page also covers renamings, mergers and splits. A proposal being moved there does not make it a deletion proposal. This is a point that others have found <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_January_1&amp;diff=97710233&amp;oldid=97709781" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_January_1&amp;diff=97710233&amp;oldid=97709781" rel="nofollow">unable to grasp</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reason for making the change so was because the Speedy Renaming states "Deletion and de-listing may occur after <b>48 hours</b> if there are no objections." (Original emphasis) The proposal in question had a disputed destination and so was accordingly moved so that the alternative options could be considered. There was a chance for consensus but the original proposer's belief that it was a deletion nomination rather than a renaming made this hard.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the tags,yeah fair point and from now on I'm aiming to update them and inform the proposer when moving these. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 17:12, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>First, I didn't misunderstand the nature of Osomec's proposal; indeed, the implication of "I can't see any sign of a request to delete this category, so am unclear why it was moved here" is that I saw a mismatch between the title of the page and what he was proposing. Osomec's subsequent hysteria over this would be more charitably ignored than linked to.</p>
<p>As for the notion that my belief that it was my intransigence/stupidity/ignorance that caused the proposal to be rejected is absurd, as even Osomec accepts that I didn't oppose his suggestion; indeed, no-one opposed it, the only other person who joined the debate supported it. Moreover, it was closed out of process.</p>
<p>Timrollpickering's reponse doesn't really answer my specific complaint, nor the more important general worry that it raises, though I'm glad that at least what I take to be the minimum change – editing templates and informing proposers – is going to be done. Even that, however, should be made policy, not left to the discretion of whoever happens to be around. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 18:10, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Blimey. That doesn't sound like a lot of fun. Mel, can I offer my services if this situation happens again? I think that if you have a couple of willing helpers you can get on with just fixing it and we can do without the (erm, slightly insane) process that seems to be involved? Or am I missing something? This seems awfully straightforward. The category has a small but embarrassing mistake in its name, so somehow we need to go in and change it in each instance. I'm not really understanding the debate over that. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7EReverse_Gear_8b83.html" title="User:Reverse Gear">Reverse Gear</a> 09:31, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the response. There are two main issues (three, if you include the lack of courtesy, but let that pass). The first is that I'm an admin, so I <i>can</i> do the renaming myself. A non-admin who spots an error could post it in the Speedy Renaming section, only to find the proposal suddenly vanish, with no explanation, and no indication as to where it's gone — and when it's suddenly rejected (despite being obviously correct), she's left bewildered, angry, and unable to do the job herself. Secondly, anyone visiting the category and following the link to the discussion will find that there's no discussion there; it's been moved, but again, with no indication as to where. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 10:11, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whilst we could agree that logs should be published, or widely available, in <b>future</b>, I would have strong objection to any <b>retrospective</b> change. I've chatted personally, and given some details of my family on IRC. I chose to do that on the understanding that a few dozen people, all of whom were named and understood IRC rules, might overhear. But the notion that the logs of such conversations might be published (and searchable) on the open web, or given to people not party to the conversation was not part of the deal, and if allowed retrospectively is an horrific invasion of privacy. Change the rules for future use if we must (although I'll probably stop using channels that are that public), but not retrospectively. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 16:01, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>People should treat IRC like a very large conference call. On-wiki actions which arise out of IRC discussions should be justifiable in absence of any agreement or discussion on IRC (ignoring <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> actions for the moment). Then again, the same should really be said about the Mailing Lists too.</p>
<p>As for the #wikipedia-en-admins IRC channel, in spite of its apparent lack of confidentiality it continues to be a useful forum for messages like "I'm having some trouble with vandals on <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Irwin_a65f.html" title="Steve Irwin">Steve Irwin</a>", which obviates the need to interrupt the usual gutter talk in #wikipedia. Sure, there is a multitude of pages on Wikipedia proper which serve such functions, but to be honest, over my dialup connection they usually take ages to load, because the people who haunt such pages (including this one) have a tendency to write essay-length posts about absolute wank. IRC is much easier on my connection than pages like WP:AN, and much more interesting at the same time.</p>
<p>If #wikipedia-en-admins were to be shut down, it would simply shift the "sensitive discussion" to less publicised forums, and make it more cliquey (rather than allowing access to all admins). I think that would be counterproductive, but that looks to be the way it's heading.</p>
<p>For those of you who are desperate to know what goes on in #wikipedia-en-admins, you'll be disappointed to know the conversations therein are quite similar to those in #wikipedia, and only half the time are they actually on-topic. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 16:42, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my opinion, we need a massive thrashing out of this somewhere—not necessarily to get a conclusive ruling (impossible, anyway, because people are free to do and say what they like off Wikipedia), but because I'm sure it will result in an informal code-of-conduct and some principles of etiquette (and hopefully moderation) emerging consensually among the majority of administrators which will serve in future to stifle most outbreaks of nastiness, sneakiness, or inappropriate specificity on a small group of agreed channels. The nasty few will have less effect on Wikipedia if their behaviours are as a result of this wised-up moral majority pushed off into channels where they are unlikely to mix with most decent-thinking administrators. But this discussion does, in my opinion, need to be centralised somewhere (if it already is, could someone guide me there, please). <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 16:51, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>IMHO, the problem with the #wikipedia-en-admins is not the medium itself but that it is too big and important a forum to ignore the discussion there and at the same time it is protected from scrutiny.</p>
<p>I would suggest: to allow postings of logs (obviously sanitized from the personal info and WMF legal business) if it is needed to assess onwiki activities. It could apply to any off-wiki communications (including various chats, blogs and E-mails). A usual off-wiki <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html#Off-wiki_personal_attacks" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA#Off-wiki_personal_attacks</a> principles would apply: you cannot be blocked only for the off-wiki activity but the good faith of your actions may be evaluated based on the off-wiki evidence. E.g. if an admin on IRC was searching for a "clean kill" instead of solving a disruption problem, then his or her block may be seen as issued in the bad faith.</p>
<p>The other problem is that a few extremely productive users see the #wikipedia-en-admins as the place there a clique is plotting intrigues against them. I would guess that the easiest solution would be just to invite the editors to the channel. They could see the matter for themselves as well as solve their problems from within. As I understand very productive editors are more rare species than admins, they also tend to be devoted to editing rather than chatting, so I do not think their inclusion would significantly increase the noise level on the channel. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 02:51, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In principle, yes. I could see the consequences of that heading in either of two diametrically opposed ways. Either he sees that nothing much really goes on there, or he blows his top completely. At the end of the day, much as people have been arguing on the Esperanza MfD, people editing Wikipedia have to be able to cope with the environment. As a community, we should try and keep the environment as pleasant as possible, but there are limits and people have to insulate themselves to some aspects of the environment (ie. ignore some things as beneath them, or whatever). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 03:59, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I have no opinion toward Giano, and have tried to stay out of this topic as much as possible, I would not support Giano being on the channel; while he's certainly a productive user, there are occasionally sensitive topics discussed on the channel; I can think of at least one discussion regarding a sensitive office action that I was involved in, with Jimbo and many other admins. As far as I've always believed, access should be granted to people we trust not to leak logs or publish sensitive information; while I don't think Giano would, I think he has been involved in enough conflicts that his trust would be questioned by at least a few admins, which I think would lead to more back-channel discussions outside of the main channel. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 10:48, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The way you say that bothers me. It gives the impression that the bulk of these people aren't commenting on the IRC question on wiki for themselves—in which case, why not? It adds to my paranoia to think that our discussing this stuff on Wikipedia is a waste of time because the "real" discussion may be somewhere else: that's almost the essence of what worries people about IRC in the first place. I don't go on IRC, so I can't judge, but so far I have been willing to believe the assurances here that most admins are simply using IRC to speed up and improve their efficiency, in which case I don't see why the question whether Giano had access or not would bother them. I can only really assess what IRC users think by what they say for themselves on wiki: is that naive? <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 18:24, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A note about -admins and Giano I am an IRC user of that channel and yes I dont support the request to have non-admins in the channel. there have been Times where I will go there an seek advice from other admins. There are times where I am unsure of what to do and I dont want my asking about it or other request to affect the users in question or how the Issue is finaly issued. there was a case about how to handle some admin actions in general and some specific advice on other areas but sometimes these conversations can feed a vandal or make the situation worse if some of the involved parties find out that you were thinking about taking one action, but when I discussed with people in -admins I decide to take a different action. My first action Could have made the situation ten times worse. But in any given situation if a user asks me about a event that happened on IRC that I was involved with I will freely post the given conversation IF AND ONLY IF I have the consent of the involved IRC parties. I have done this already with one BRfA. I would have done so in the Giano case but due to technical reason I was unable to retrieve my logs and review the situation and get consent. I think that there should be a policy that users in good standing may request the conversation, But the admin in question must get consent from the involved parties and should edit out all conversation not within the scope of the event in question <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 23:32, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As a non-admin, how would I even know that an admin's actions are the result of an IRC discussion in order to request the log? If you decided you choose option A instead of option B, why is the rationale behind that decision secret? If your actions are consistent with policy and practice, explaining your motives shouldn't reveal anything that isn't already described on-wiki somewhere. In my view (as a non-admin), <b>all</b> potentially controversial on-wiki decisions resulting from <b>any form</b> of off-wiki discussion (IRC, email, AIM, telephone, what have you) should be accompanied by an on-wiki explanation, accessible to all users. It could be as simple as posting a summary of the discussion on your own talk page. This is an action that admins can undertake right now to increase transparency and trust and debunk claims of conspiracy. <span style="color: #F06A0F">–</span> <small><span style="border: 1px solid #F06A0F"><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#F06A0F">&#160;Anþony&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony"><span style="background-color:#F06A0F; color:white">&#160;talk&#160;</span></a></span></small> 11:04, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>It is sad that IRC people does not want to invite Giano and could solve a chronic problem and benefit the project. Betacommand's idea of a system to officially request logs (probably sanitized from the personal info and WMF business) might be useful in some cases: suppose a friend of a user reads the IRC log and suspect something fishy was going on, then requests the official log and starts and ON-Wiki process. To be workable this solution at least require an IRC culture of inviting diverse productive users instead of kickbanning them. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 11:28, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page has a history of many different anon's repeatedly replacing the page with linkspam, going back to October. I have no idea why this page was targeted, but as far as I noticed, every single time new spam is added it is by a new IP so blocking users won't do anything (unless it is determined that these IP's are all from an open proxy). I would request page protection but it is doubtful someone responding will protect the page, even with the history this page has. (Usually people will only sprotect if a page has lots of vandalism in a short time frame).

I had always thought that that was the appropriate course of action of you actually wanted a speedy to go forward if say a page eligible for G10 is nominated or an author blanks a page while it is at AfD (G7). That way admins who do CSD patrol and see the page and evaluate it in a timely fashion (either deleting it or removing the tag and letting the AfD continue). Otherwise a speedy delete "vote" is unlikely to be acted upon because AfD's are very often not very active between days 2 and 4. What is the consensus of admins in this area? <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 16:51, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If it is a clearly speadyable item then most admins think nothing of closing the AfD early with a speedy delete. I don't think putting the speedy notice there is wrong as long as the AfD notice stays. After all, if it qualifies for speedy deletion then the discussion is not relevant.

<dd>If it's at AFD I think you can add speedy tags to it. Just make sure that as an admin you close the AFD at the same time as "speedy delete". There's nothing against speedying an article under discussion at AFD. AFD doesn't exempt an article from speedy deletion. -<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">Royalguard11</a><small>(<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_4f58.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11">Talk</a>·<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_Desk_a7bb.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11/Desk">Desk</a>·<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_ER_5b7b.html" title="User:Royalguard11/ER">Review Me!</a>)</small> 20:32, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's okay, but I'm wondering if it would be worth trying to discourage it. One would think that, if it's made it to AfD, the tagging person did not feel it necessary to rush it, so why should we, especially when we might learn something? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:34, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It depends on the speedy criterion I would think. I purposely didn't use A7 as an example because I agree that little to nothing is gained by speedying on notability rather than waiting 5 days since new evidence might emerge. I do, however, think that there is a real gain in speedying a G10 rather than letting it wait and the same applies to, say, G1. The deletion debates are pretty crowded and there is no need to clutter them up with easy cases. And thanks to eveyone for the feedback. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 22:01, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Some of them are just because someone has gone to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> or some other page and seen "<i>Articles</i> for deletion" and thought it was the appropriate place. Something being on AfD does not necessarily mean that the nominator was familiar with the speedy deletion criteria or thought that the deletion would be controversial. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 11:04, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I'd say that tagging an article on AfD for speedy deletion is indeed appropriate in cases like this, where the article turns out to be speedy deletable for some other reason than what it was put on AfD for. However, if the article is on AfD because it's not clear whether it meets a particular speedy criterion or not, I'd recommend expressing your opinion on the matter on the AfD page. Generally enough admins do look at recent AfD nominations that any "speedy delete" comments there do get noticed and acted on fairly promptly. Of course, if it does happen that an article lingers on AfD for more than a day with a clear consensus to speedy delete, tagging it with something like "<code>{{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>|see AfD page}}</code>" may be a good idea. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 20:36, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If speedy was already considered by an admin and declined and proded or AFDed instead, then don't tag for speedy deletion again. If new information has come to light, for example that it was newly discovered to be a repost or blanked by the author, then tagging for speedy is appropriate. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-01-01 22:36Z</small></i></span></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think that adding a speedy tag to an article undergoing an AfD process is an open invitation to delete the article out of process and leaving this door open is an invitation to conflict. However, as there is wide consensus here that it's ok to have an article coexist in multiple deletion processes, I won't act in a manner conflicting with that consensus. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 01:27, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Speedy deletion is a process too, so provided the article meets the criteria for speedy deletion, I don't see how speedying an article while at AfD is "out-of-process". The speedy criteria are intended to describe the sort of articles that we <i>do not want under any circumstances</i>; if an article meets the speedy criteria, it should be deleted – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 20:43, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unfortunately some Iranian wikipedians has started another wiki for Iran related articles. The reason seems to be that wikipedia guidelines and policies was not tolerable for them.

Before I came, all of Iran's articles were mere stubs or non-existent. You can check my <i>content</i> edits, which near 20000. So the least I expect, if not any gratitude for helping turn WP into the first source of information for Iran, is for people to stop using WP as vehciles of personal vendetta against me. (Ive already posted an example of admin <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmandeh_d115.html" title="User:Armandeh">User:Armandeh</a>'s vulgar posts to me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Khoikhoi#An_observation_regarding_User:Armandeh" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Khoikhoi#An_observation_regarding_User:Armandeh" rel="nofollow">here</a>). If you want to accuse me of something, at least have a good reason, and accuse me of <i>something</i>, not because I helped expand WP and WikIran.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 03:55, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Darkest Hour. I have avoided editing the article so far so do not really need to cool down. The other people who have edited are an unregistered user and "strothra". If anyone would care to go through the discussion page they will see that I have had lengthly discussions with those who disagree with me. I have outlined my position and where I believe undue weight policy supports it. I think it would be more useful for people to contribute to the discussion and address the issues on policy, rather than locking the article. --Guardian sickness 21:04, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It should be pointed out that this issue arises from the article on the racist killing of <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriss_Donald_bff5.html" title="Kriss Donald">Kriss Donald</a>. An unregistered user had been reverting this article, which I have contributed to in a lenghtly discussion. I am still learning about Wikipedia and its policy, but have never come across a user like Strothra. He has threatened to have me blocked from editing for removing information which does not conform to the undue weight policy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Guardian_sickness" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Guardian_sickness" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>]</p>
<p>He seems to have contributed about 8 or 9 words to the discussion and considers himself not just beyond reproach - but beyond discussion. It just won't do. I have tried for many months to achieve balance in discussing this article with those who disagree with me, but Strothra and an unregistered user have other ideas on "civilised discussion". --Guardian sickness 20:53, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As a yank, I am unaware of the circumstances surrounding this murder; however, based on the article itself (the sections OTHER than the one disputed), it seems that removing an entire section based on the debate regarding racial motivation is NOT in line with the undue weight policy (at least, not in the way you are applying it). It seems to be far too long in comparison with the rest of the article and should be trimmed and significantly rewritten, but I don't think it should be removed entirely, unless your position is that a negligible number of people call the murder racially-motivated, which if true makes the uncontested sprinklings of racial motivation/tension throughout the article incorrect as well. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 21:30, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I re-read that and am not entirely sure I conveyed what I wished to express clearly. Basically, it's okay to have minority viewpoints in articles as long as they are sourced and they are not misrepresented as majority viewpoints. It seems that your argument has been that the views are so far in the minority that they should not be represented, but the section you have removed cites some fairly notable sources espousing that viewpoint. Thus, they should be represented, but the section should be slimmed down significantly.

<p>Hi Bbatsell, you will see in the discussion that I have taken issue with the inclusion of those who claim the murder was not racially motivated on the grounds that they are a tiny minority. Wikipedia policy states “If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents.” The crux of this issue is whether one professor of politics, and one BBC investigative journalist can be described as "prominent". My contention is that they are not prominent and in the waves of coverage surrounding the case in the UK their views constitute those of a tiny minority.</p>
<p>The policy seems quite explicit and I do not believe my interpretation of it is flawed. I would like to ask you and anyone else who reads this how that section of the article can possibly be consistent with the above Wikipedia policy on "prominent adherents"? I just don't see it and have consistently argued my point based on policy. --Guardian sickness 22:01, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I guess it would depend on how prominent those two particular people were (if there really are no other people espousing that viewpoint). I did completely misread your position, though; I thought you were advocating that the majority position is that the murder was was <i>not</i> racially motivated, so for that I apologize. I think a <b>small</b> section on the opposing viewpoint is going to be the easiest solution and will garner consensus, as long as (as I wrote above) the text does not represent that the debate is a large or contentious one, but rather one held by a few, and then they would be named. I think the reason this particular debate became a larger one is because the section (which was long) was removed entirely, rather than edited down to be a more accurate representation of the truth. That is what I think is the best course of action to take. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 22:12, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This is not the first time that I or others have done so. Many of you have unblocked this IP in the past, no doubt with the best of intentions. It is true that we generally do not block shared IP addresses for long periods of time, and certainly not indefinitely. This, however, is a different situation. This is where the real Willy on Wheels edits from. If you unblock this IP, the real Willy on Wheels will create accounts and vandalize Wikipedia. I cannot put the matter any more plainly than that. Now, it is true that this is a shared IP address. However, I and other checkusers can verify that there is little to no activity from this address that does <i>not</i> come from Willy on Wheels. Most of the unblock requests are from Willy's socks. If you really feel that you must tinker with this block in any way, please contact a checkuser and got his or her permission before doing so.</p>

<dd>Mackensen, I suggest that you put a specific note to this effect on the talk page and in the block log, as otherwise no one will remember which specific IP you warned about. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:31, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I copied the above note there. However, I've done that before, and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassandra.html" title="Cassandra">been ignored</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 03:35, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Good ... except I equally doubt that admins expect to find useful content on an IP's userpage, so they're not going to look for that either. I suggest an entry in the block log itself along the lines of "Repeated creation of Willy on Wheels accounts, should remain blocked indefinitely, see user page for info" or something like that—in that location, an admin considering unblocking would certainly see.

<dd>You might also want to change the userpage, which says "This IP address has been blocked <i>temporarily</i>."[Emphasis mine] 68.39.174.238 04:48, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've left a better block message. Hopefully nobody will unblock after that. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 04:16, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure all caps all the time is the best block message, it's hard to read and I suspect it will send some people into vandal-reversion mode. 68.39.174.238 04:45, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
