<dd>I've reviewed checkuser evidence in this matter and I do not believe that there is any sockpuppetry going on. The secondary evidence is also weak. I strongly urge an unblock and an apology. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 05:30, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kelly, there is extremely strong linguistic evidence, combined with the fact the we know that Giovanni has a record of using puppets, and there is a long history of new users turning up, supporting Giovanni, reverting to his version, following him from one page to another, and using the same linguistic idiosyncrasies. I will e-mail you the linguistic evidence. Obviously, I do not want to make it available in public, as that will alert him to what he should avoid with future puppets. The admin who blocked was not aware of the linguistic evidence, at the time of blocking, though I have since e-mailed some of it (not all, as I was changing from one computer to another). Deskana and some other admins are also aware of it. I will also post a fuller statement here when I get time. I would urge that nobody consider unblocking without reviewing the evidence, which I am willing to e-mail to any administrator on request. When he first arrived at Wikipedia, he did not know about userchecks. Now that he does know (having been caught out after putting on a pretence of not knowing BelindaGong, while she was following him around, reverting aggressively to his version, taking advantage of our reluctance to report new users), he is unlikely to make that particular mistake again. By the way, Giovanni is claiming on his user page that I'm not a linguist, and don't have any degrees in lingsuitics yet. I'm also willing to e-mail evidence of my bachelor's and master's degrees and several diplomas in language studies and linguistics. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 08:22, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>AnnH is entirely correct that the linguistic evidence alone strongly indicates that these posts, as well as those of MikaM, Kecik, etc., propagate from one real-world user. Please do accept her offer of e-mailing the details. Combine this with the editing patterns, and the presumption of reasonable doubt is no longer tenable.Timothy Usher 08:33, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Giovanni also claims that he's never used sockpuppets before. To be frank I'm getting sick of cases like this. It's clear that at the very least Professor33 is a meatpuppet, due to certain things which I've observed which cannot be just random chance. I refer to the evidence that AnnH speaks of. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Lord Deskana</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">Dark Lord of YOUR OPINIONS</a></sup> 08:29, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do <i>not</i> endorse this block. Kelly Martin has performed the checkuser and there is little solid evidence (read: something that you can prove) to that these two are related. Professor33 sent me a polite e-mail last night asking for help in this matter, and I agreed to look in to it. In addition to the checkuser showing negative results, the "linguistic evidence" that was used was sketchy at best. I am not convinced that these two are the same. I am going to look into this further, but I am heavily leaning towards unblocking this user. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (<a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">AAAA!</a>) 13:04, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Hello, Eugene,<br />First off, I would like to note that a "CheckUser" has been performed on both your account and 
Giovanni33's account. The results were not similar at all, so there is very little "solid" evidence
that you and Giovanni are one in the same. If you wish to provide further evidence of who you are, 
such as some type of identification, feel free to email me and I will forward it as necessary.<br />Secondly, in the interest of full disclosure, I am a devout Christian. That, however, does not 
affect how I edit articles. I intentionally avoid most Christianity-related articles, and therefore 
I can not say anything one way or the other in regards to any Christian-focused cliques, extreme or
otherwise.<br />Reviewing your edits, I must say that you could have made better usage of the talk pages. When I say 
"better usage", I am refering to the multiple reverts that have taken place. It appears that you 
have been involved in a few edit wars which could be viewed as disruptive. Although you are probably 
not connected to Giovanni, edit wars are bad. Try to seek a clear consensus before doing something 
that a number of people disagree with. If this fails, I suggest that you seek mediation. Also, don't 
be afraid to walk away from an article for a while. If you let things cool down a bit, you'll find 
that people are easier to deal with.<br />At this point, I will suggest that you are unblocked pending any concrete evidence of sockpuppetry. 
My suggestion is to tread lightly when you are unblocked, and do not be afraid to ask for advice 
and/or help if and when you find yourself in a dispute.<br />If you have any further questions or comments, please feel free to e-mail me.<br />Regards,
Alex Schenck

<p>Hello, Linuxbeak. First of all, I wonder what you mean by saying that "the [checkuser] results were not similar at all". Have you <i>seen</i> the checkuser results? I thought only people with usercheck privileges saw checkuser results, and Kelly didn't say that they "weren't similar at all". She said she did "not believe that there is any sockpuppetry going on". She didn't say that they were in completely different areas. I never expected Giovanni to be caught a second time with a checkuser — he <i>knows</i> about it now. He didn't know at the time when he either registered a second account as BelindaGong or got his wife to join in order to get an extra three or more (often more, as we didn't want to report newcomers) reverts per day, and to follow him around, support him on talk pages, and vote on issues he was voting on. Do the checkuser results show that it's so far away that it couldn't be his work address, or another place that he drives to in the morning? The receent pattern has been that the last edit as Giovanni33 each morning is around the time that he would be leaving the house for work (according to his time zone), and then Professor33 logs on about an hour or two later, logs off around the time that he'd be finishing work, if he's in Giovanni's time zone, and doesn't edit at weekends. Giovanni then logs on as Giovanni33 around the time that he'd be getting home from work, and then edits in the evening and the night. Also, if his story that Freethinker99 is a separate person is true, we know that he's capable of getting a friend to join in order to revert to his version (which is still a violation of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>. When he accidentally signed while logged on as Freethinker, he claimed that he was over at his place, and was showing him how to use Wikipedia (i.e. showing Freethinker how to revert to Giovanni's version while Giovanni was blocked).</p>
<p>Secondly, what do you mean when you say, "The linguistic evidence that was used was sketchy at best"? The linguistic evidence has not been made public, and can't be, as it would alert Giovanni to idiosyncrasies that he should avoid in future, so how can you know that it's sketchy? I will e-mail you the evidence if you send me an e-mail requesting it — on condition, of course, that it is not made available to anyone other than an administrator. Please note that Giovanni has a history of puppetry, gross violations of 3RR (I mean REALLY gross violations, continuing defiantly after warnings — on one occasion making 11 reverts within 19 hours, despite warnings — not the kind of accidental fourth reverts that could happen to anyone), and gaming the system, taking advantage of our reluctance to report a newcomer; and that several new users have started reverting to his version and supporting him on talk pages straight after registering.</p>
<p>Please note, as well, that Giovanni publicly acknowledges his IP, and on any occasion when one of the suspected puppets made a not-logged-on edit and acknowledged it, it was <i><b>always</b></i> geographically close. Please see also <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Giovanni33_93a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Giovanni33">Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Giovanni33</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Talk%7EChristianity_Archive_24_2edf.html" title="Talk:Christianity/Archive 24">Talk:Christianity/Archive_24</a>. Also, when he was blocked after the BelindaGong puppetry was revealed (they had put up an active pretence of not knowing each other while she was reverting to his version and following him to different pages, voting for what he wanted), <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreethinker99_5e1e.html" title="User:Freethinker99">Freethinker99</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreethinker99_5091.html" title="User talk:Freethinker99">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Freethinker99_e0a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Freethinker99">contribs</a>) arrived at the Christianity, talk page, said he was new but had read the talk page and agreed with Giovanni (first edit)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39651101" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39651101" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and then reverted back to Giovanni's version (second edit).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39651383" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christianity&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39651383" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> He was asked to review <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>, and said, "I have.

<p>Various explanations were given — he was married to Belinda, and had not wanted to make that public. He was a friend of Freethinker, and was at his house, showing him how to use Wikipedia. When he denied having any connection to any of the editors about whom he had been asked, he had not seen Freethinker's name, which had been added to the original question later, but had been on his talk page for fifty minutes when he answered, and was <i><b>DIRECTLY</b></i> above the first words of his denial while he was typing.</p>
<p>It is extremely disturbing that Kecik has 40 reverts to Giovanni33 out of a total of 45 article edits, that his seventh edit was a vote for something Giovanni wanted<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36669860" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36669860" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> at a page he'd be unlikely, as a new user, to find by chance (and he didn't have "e-mail this user" enable), and that he was here for nearly four months before he made his first edit to an article that Giovanni was not looking for support at (and then only after I had commented so many times on the pattern of his contributions) — and that nothing has been done about this. MikaM's contributions are similar — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36751905" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transubstantiation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36751905" rel="nofollow">this</a> vote is his/her <i>sixth</i> edit, and as with Kecik, e-mail was not enabled, and it's unlikely that a brand new user, who was supporting Giovanni at <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, would find that page just by chance.</p>
<p>And yes, I stand by the linguistic evidence linking Giovanni33 not just to Professor33 but also to eight other users. I strongly urge admins to e-mail me for the evidence before they consider unblocking. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 14:10, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I brought the block here so that it could be reviewed. Personally, I believe he's a sock, and don't have access to checkuser. Kelly and Linux are respected admins, and if someone decides to reverse the block I'm not going to be upset. However, even if <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor33_6069.html" title="User:Professor33">User:Professor33</a> is unblocked, I do think that <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">User:Giovanni33</a>'s block should stay, and have said so to him in reply to him via email. This was his 5th unique 3RR block by 5 different admins. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Giovanni33" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Giovanni33" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and perhaps a week will be a wakeup call. I considered a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a>, but the notices at the top gave me the indication that I should not do that given the evidence I had. If people are interested in the emails I have sent to both the Professor and Giovanni, I will happily post them, but they don't say anything I haven't said in public. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibofh_f636.html" title="User:Wikibofh">Wikibofh</a><sub>(<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibofh_5845.html" title="User talk:Wikibofh">talk</a>)</sub> 14:22, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well, <b>I</b> have seen the checkuser evidence, and it's certainly not inconsistent with the idea that they are sockpuppets. Moreover, I've seen the other evidence as well, and some of it is quite compelling. Please remember that checkuser is not a magic crystal ball; it can certainly be helpful in proving or disproving sockpuppetry, but ultimately decisions about sockpuppeting are made the old-fashioned way. As has been the case in the past with Giovanni33, there's either standard sockpuppetry or meatpuppetry going on here, and the evidence indicates to me that it's far more likely that it's plain old sockpuppetry. In my view the block is justified. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 14:55, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Comparing the edits, it's clear to me that Professor33 is Giovanni33. The writing style, word choices, and habitual errors are all consistent. His timely arrival to support Giovanni just when he 'runs out' of reverts is icing on the cake. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 15:26, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm certainly totally satisfied that they are sockpuppets, or perhaps meatpuppets. You can't really accuse me of sharing a Christian POV either. Although I attend a Catholic college and was born and raised a Catholic, I am most certainly an atheist. The linguistic evidence is far too compelling for it to <b>not</b> be a sockpuppetry case. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Lord Deskana</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">Dark Lord of YOUR OPINIONS</a></sup> 22:04, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've seen the linguistic similiarities, which can't be made public, and it seems clear that the Giovanni and Professor accounts are connected. IP evidence is only ever a part of the total evidence, because people can use different IP addresses for different accounts, but the linguistic evidence would be hard to explain away. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:41, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I concur that <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor33_6069.html" title="User:Professor33">User:Professor33</a> is a sockpuppet account of <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">User:Giovanni33</a>.

<dd>I endorse the block. It seems highly likely that <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor33_6069.html" title="User:Professor33">User:Professor33</a> is a sockpuppet account, or at the very least a meatpuppet, of <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">User:Giovanni33</a>. I see no need for an Rfc if the block is upheld. If not, then an Rfc would be strongly indicated.

<dd>Threatening death or rape is a felony in virtually all U.S. jurisdictions (and probably most other countries). This psychopath is hopefully only a slight physical threat to any Wikipedians but he is likely a dangerous presence in his local community. I doubt his antisocial behavior is or will always be confined to Wikipedia. Even if he never acts on threats, this behavior is chilling to people when made by someone locally -- that's why the law treats even threats of this sort as serious crimes. He should be reported and I'd be happy to do so. Does <a href="../../../l/e/g/WP%7ELEGAL_8608.html" title="WP:LEGAL">WP:LEGAL</a> still apply in this sort of case?

<dl>
<dd>A few thoughts:
<ul>
<li>WikiProjects, despite being informal, are generally regarded as a basic and quite legitimate form of editor collaboration within Wikipedia. Further, the use of talk page templates to advertise WikiProjects is a long-standing practice.</li>
<li>The question of WikiProject scope is somewhat tangential to this. I cannot recall any limitation on the potential number of articles a WikiProject can deal with, and cannot fathom why such a restriction would be beneficial, in any case.</li>
<li>Aside from advertising the existence of the WikiProject to editors in the applicable subject areas (which is quite important in its own right, since projects that fail to recruit editors effectively tend to wither and die in short order), the tags also serve to introduce articles into the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Index_of_subjects_99d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Index of subjects">bot-assisted article assessment program</a> run under the guidance of the <a href="../../../1/2E/0/WP%7E1.0_7d3d.html" title="WP:1.0">Wikipedia 1.0</a> project.</li>
<li>The question of whether AWB is used seems rather unimportant, in my opinion. So long as the tagging itself is legitimate—and I'm not aware of any complaints in that regard—the use of a tool to make the admittedly monotonous task easier seems perfectly acceptable. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 19:55, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To what Kirill said, I'll add a few things to explain:</dd>
<dd>I've just went through ~300 articles of a military-related category. Only 61 were tagged and 2 ignored because they were not military-related. Meaning there was ~240 articles in this category that were <i><b>already tagged</b></i>, through infinite pains, by hand, before that (and not by me). So it is a matter of being methodic: why <a href="../../../2E/4/4/.44_Magnum_d5f0.html" title=".44 Magnum">.44 Magnum</a> was tagged and <a href="../../../2E/2/2/.22_Long_Rifle_91c3.html" title=".22 Long Rifle">.22 Long Rifle</a> was not? What is the logic?</dd>
<dd>I'm not a bot and I'm not applying tags blindly. If an article is really out of scope, I don't tag it.</dd>
<dd>I do <b>exactly</b> the same job as was done before, only it goes 10 times faster. I <b>really</b> don't see what the problem is. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 20:01, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unlike most of the project tags kicking around, these ones are preset to allow for notes about quality rating, completeness, importances, etc. The project is pretty active, and seems to have a good deal of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Military_history_Assessment_a1c0.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Assessment">article rating/validation/etc going on</a>; it seems to me that this sort of thing is greatly helped by identifying and tagging articles for people to get to, since it allows category sorting, report generation, etc. (In many ways, it's probably better than slapping "This x-related article is a stub..." in the main namespace)</dd>
<dd>(Yes, indiscriminate bot-adding is a bad idea, but it's hard to distinguish between indiscriminate and eyballing-and-approving each time. Were any of the marked pages inappropriate?)</dd>
<dd>To my eyes, it's not "advertisment", it's infrastructure for the development of articles. Yes, it's not much use to start with, but people can't go and work on articles before someone's found them... It seems to be working fine; I say leave them to it. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 20:03, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>(multiple edit conflicts) The problem is there are so many different WikiProjects out that if all of them went around tagging related articles en masse, the average article's talk page would be flooded with half a dozen advertisements for various WikiProjects. Look at the huge list of WikiProjects <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_WikiProjects_8c26.html" title="Wikipedia:List of WikiProjects">here</a> and tell me it wouldn't be a bad thing if even 10% of them went around tagging all articles that were possibly related.

<dl>
<dd>Most of the WikiProjects on that list don't use tags. Most of them are also quite catatonic. Care to guess at the relationship between the two?&#160;;-)</dd>
<dd>(This aside from the fact that even double-tagging tends to be rare, and is becoming increasingly rare as smaller WikiProjects are being absorbed into larger ones. I don't believe I've <i>ever</i> seen a talk page with more than two WikiProject tags on it.) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 20:07, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "spamming" problem from having five or six tags seems more due to the size and style of the templates. If this *does* become an issue, reformatting the project tags might prove a good idea... but this is useful infrastructure, and people do seem to be using it to build an encylopedia. So why make their lives harder for something that isn't a problem yet? <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 20:12, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>The addition of the tags seems proper to me. This is a very active project and the scope of the project seems to be all pages that have a military topic. As such, then all these articles should probably be tagged as such. I do note, however, that looking into the far future, we may have problems with articles tagged by a dozen different wikiprojects. (E.g. As it stands today, a military war-ship made by a prominant manufacturer in Texas could conceivably be tagged by wikiprojects on Military, Ships and Texas. How many more wikiprojects might the same ship fall into next year or ten years from now?) Just the size of the cumulative talk page tags could theoretically be a problem. My opinion is that this hypothetical problem is not serious enough to attempt to solve ahead of time before it actually exists. Let's let these projects grow and tag articles and see what happens. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 20:08, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>"The scope of the project seems to be all pages that have a military topic" -- hrmm, yes, because they're defining their own scope. What happens when WikiProject United States comes through, with an acknowledged scope of the United States, and tries to tag hundreds of thousands of articles? I just don't see why it is necessary that every single article in the encyclopedia dealing with military history (we must have over 10K such articles) needs to have a tag advertising this WikiProject. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 20:16, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Might we think of a better infrastructure than having each WikiProject tag each article they have identified as being somewhat related to their topic area? This just doesn't scale well at all. That's the reason I brought this here ... for community review. I still don't think that having WikiProjects tag each article they're even tangentially related to provides enough benefits to outweigh the signal to noise decrease inherent in adding more colored boxes to the top of talk pages (once it gets past two, does anyone even read them?). I've thought this for a long while and haven't said anything, but when I ran across the massive addition of tags today, I felt like I had to say something. Hopefully we can come up with a better system. Why not have all of the article assessment ratings on a centralized page? Why should it all be scattered around on individual articles? WikiProjects are project-space stuff ... can't they do it in project space and project talk space rather than spreading their colored boxes all across <i>article</i> talk space? --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 20:22, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll point out that nobody has really offered an argument against the fact that advertising relevant WikiProjects—even in the absence of any other purpose for the tags—is a very useful thing (assuming that you like having active WikiProjects around, obviously). WikiProjects that fail to recruit editors die; there's simply no way around that fact. That's why the idea of talk-page tags was developed in the first place. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 20:29, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My thoughts on the subject - it wouldn't be a horrible idea to restrict the WikiProject tags to those articles where either (a) your project makes up a substantial portion of the editors of the article, (b) the article is obviously inextricably linked to your project (eg <a href="../../../n/f/l/WP%7ENFL_68e4.html" title="WP:NFL">WP:NFL</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a>), or (c) the article is an abandoned stub or short article relevant to your project that you intend to improve. There was one case a few weeks back with <a href="../../../c/a/l/Talk%7ECalvary_Chapel_cb46.html" title="Talk:Calvary Chapel">Talk:Calvary Chapel</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Charismatic_Christianity_771d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Charismatic Christianity">Wikipedia:WikiProject Charismatic Christianity</a>. The issue more or less dropped because it was really just two of us arguing and the the project basically has such a broad definition of what "Charismatic Christianity" is that if you have ever met a Charismatic, you probably qualify ... it really wasn't worth it to me to continue debating the issue. Still, I would use this as an example of something that should NOT be tagged. Nobody from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Charismatic_Christianity_771d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Charismatic Christianity">Wikipedia:WikiProject Charismatic Christianity</a> has contributed to the article itself. The link between the two is tenuous (<a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Smith_a273.html" title="Chuck Smith">Chuck Smith</a> was once involved in a charismatic movement, therefore <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvary_Chapel_f14c.html" title="Calvary Chapel">Calvary Chapel</a> must be a charismatic church, even though they never self-identify as such). At any rate, this is more along the lines of a policy proposal than an administrative issue, but I would definitely suggest restricting tagging in some fashion. If nobody from your project is going to touch the thing, it doesn't need to be tagged as belonging to them. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 20:50, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that might be more of an issue with the particular WikiProject you mention having a somewhat unusual (or controversial?) scope.

<dd>That's a good question. Looking at the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_WikiProjects_8c26.html" title="Wikipedia:List of WikiProjects">list</a>, there aren't that many where inclusion is overly debatable.

<dd>It seems to me that there are two opposing risks to allowing projects like MILHIST to tag the approximately 11,000 relevant pages they estimate exist. If this is permitted, there is a risk that some pages might eventually have several tags from several projects. If not, it's likely that more pages will be orphaned than if not. I tend to think that allowing an active project like MILHIST to tag thousands of pages will do more good than harm, although maybe there needs to be some procedure to remove tags from dead projects. A lot of projects are doing great work, and MILHIST is one of them. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 20:55, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think these wikiproject tags are almost always useless and almost always harmless; if it makes people happy to add them, so be it.

If there are several WikiProjects that could have "jurisdiction" over an article, And yes, Cyde, I really don't see a problem with all of them tagging the article (which won't happen, because not all WikiProjects tag pages, and not all WikiProjects are even active). More eyes looking at one article → better article.

<p>Freakofnurture brought up an interesting point on IRC. Whether or not the talk page tab at the top of the page is red is useful feedback to the reader. Oftentimes I find myself wanting to know if a page has any discussion on it; if the tab is red, I don't even have to load a separate page. However, if all of these articles are going to be tagged en masse with this WikiProject banner, then none of the tabs will be red any longer, and some reader feedback will be lost. Also, I question the value of putting a banner on a page with so little traffic/interest that it doesn't even exist. What do you guys think about only putting the banner on talk pages that already exist, and not creating the ones from scratch that don't? --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 20:25, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, there would be three main reasons why we would prefer the banner even on empty talk pages:
<ul>
<li>The article rating component of the tags applies regardless of whether there's any other discussion going on.</li>
<li>Many of these pages are <i>extremely</i> low-traffic in terms of actually having discussion (some manage to make it up to FA status without any comments there). The banners still provide useful links for both the editors of those pages and other people (who are often more likely to get assistance with the article from the project than merely by posting to an empty talk page.</li>
<li>This will require a dedicated effort of trying to keep track of newly created talk pages so that we can tag them, rather than tagging everything in one go.</li>

<dd>(edit conflict) Indeed. The reasons <i>for</i> such taggings seem to heavily outweigh the reasons against (one or two folks don't want to load a talk page to find just a WikiProject banner). I reiterate that since this is currently the way things are done, and we're quite deep into Wikipedia 1.0 assessment now, this isn't the correct forum either. If this is a genuine issue affecting many editors (and I don't think it is) let's have a policy debate. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 20:40, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article rating component only applies if you're actually <i>rating</i> the page. I don't see the point of turning a red talk page blue with an empty rating slot. Yes, if you want to take the time to also make an assessment of the page then it's a different situation. Also, I can't believe that an article has made it to featured status with a red talk page. Can you give me any examples? I still don't think the questionable benefits of having a WikiProject banner on a previously nonexistent talk page outweigh the loss of feedback provided by that talk page's nonexistence. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 20:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know how the assessment system works (when the assessment is left blank it's put into a "to be assessed" category, right?). I just don't think it's worthwhile creating talk pages out of nothing to put them into a blank category.

<p>(Sorry, me again) Actually, I would like to add that prior to the W1.0 assessments scheme I would, in the case of very large Projects, agreed to you. I remember creating new articles on albums and shortly afterwards a {{<a href="../../../a/l/b/Template%7EAlbum_172c.html" title="Template:Album">Album</a>}} template would appear saying "this is part of WikiProject Albums". I remember thinking at the time "who the hell are they, why are they taking credit for work they had no part in, and what use does that tag serve appearing on thousands of talk pages?". I do believe that the W1.0 assessments changes things considerably, however. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 20:59, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind having these ratings for every article but I don't see why they should have to get there through a single very active project - the importance and quality of an article aren't tied to a particular project. And, as others have mentioned, things are being tagged that seem rather marginally related to military history - I noticed <i><a href="../../../%C3%A1/g/r/%C3%81grip_af_N%C3%B3regskonungas%C3%B6gum_c98a.html" title="Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum">Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum</a></i> was tagged. It could just as well get a tag from a WikiProject on Norway, or on the Middle Ages or on literature. Couldn't we just have one generic talk page template for people who want to rate articles for quality and importance? We could still have a parameter allowing us to specify individual projects or "task forces" that could help with the article. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 21:00, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Quality: perhaps. But importance, at least the way it's set up, varies from project to project. Something very important within the topic of "Norway" might not be that important within the topic of "Middle Ages", and vice versa. And there are also other things like project peer reviews/collaborations/etc. being listed in these tags. I think that trying to combine them all would be far too chaotic to bother (not to mention resulting in a template that would freeze the database anytime it was edited). <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 21:03, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am supposed to be on wikibreak, and about to be away from the computer for a week, but I thought I should chime in, since I wrote a bot (<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatchlistBot_8f1f.html" title="User:WatchlistBot">User:WatchlistBot</a>) to maintain a watchlist for a project. I was inspired by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Hawaii_79c1.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii">Wikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii</a>, and used it for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Numismatics_4cfb.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Numismatics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Numismatics</a>. The bot can also tag all articles in a category as belonging to a project. This feature worked well for the main Numismatics articles (not Exonumia), but it ran into trouble in the Exonumia directories so I'm not using that feature now. I started this because I wanted to be able to watch what was happening in the Numismatics project, and had no awareness of 1.0. You can see the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchangeslinked_Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Numismatics_Articles_0d47.html" title="Special:Recentchangeslinked/Wikipedia:WikiProject Numismatics/Articles">watchlist</a> if you want. The {{<a href="../../../n/u/m/Template%7ENumismaticnotice_d2b0.html" title="Template:Numismaticnotice">Numismaticnotice</a>}} does not include a rating, but I find it useful anyway.

<dd>I would say "fortunately" rather than "sadly" as that essay is a terrifically bad idea. As I said in the talk there, tagging articles, including tagging by multiple projects, is terrifically valuable, and the advantages, short and long term, far far outweigh any minor inconvenience that having them might entail. The fact that <a href="../../../m/i/l/WP%7EMILHIST_2318.html" title="WP:MILHIST">WP:MILHIST</a> has taken an amazingly large number of articles under its wing, and is steadily improving them, is something to marvel at, not something to consider harmful.

<dd>You shouldn't have blocked him over this. First off, the photo is a copyrighted by the Canadian government and is the official picture of the Canadian prime minister. A strong claim could have been made that the use of this photo to illustrate an article about the prime minister is valid under fair use. In short, this wasn't a nonsense fair use claim and you should not have blocked the user for disagreeing with you over it. In addition, I find it distaste that you blocked an editor over what was an editorial dispute you were involved in. You should have gotten another admin to do that.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 18:46, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You seem to be confused about two things here. The first is that I didn't block someone for a lousy fair use claim. I blocked an account that was replacing a free image with an unfree one. The strongest fair use claim in the world wouldn't matter -- <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">we don't use unfree content when we have free, reuable content</a>. The second point is that there was an editorial dispute. My first edit was to revert back to the free image -- I'm not involved in any sort of "editorial dispute", unless enforcing <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">Wikipedia:Image use policy</a> and our <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">fair use criteria</a> is now an editorial decision. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 19:04, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Aside from the (admittedly not very applicable in this particular case) general point that determining whether a free image adequately replaces a fair-use one is, in some respect, an editorial decision, I am uncomfortable with the fact that we're handing out indefinite blocks to editors in good standing without even a warning. Unless the editor is actually refusing to follow image policy when asked to do so, there is no need for an indefinite block to be imposed. Indeed, in a situation like the above where the violation is very limited in scope (a single image on a single article) and the editor is not causing any substantial damage, I am unconvinced that we need apply a block at all <i>before</i> asking/warning/instructing them as to the relevant policy. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 19:13, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We should all note – in general, and not just specific to this situation – that there is a distinction between an <i>indefinite</i> block and a <i>permanent</i> one. While both are implemented the same way technically, they can be handled very differently in practice. A permanent block is imposed on an editor who has exhausted the community's patience or by decision of the ArbCom; such a block is accompanied by the sentiment 'Good riddance, you're not welcome back here' (if not those precise words). Other indefinite blocks may be placed to mean 'You're doing something that you shouldn't be doing, after you've been asked to stop. Once you agree to stop, you'll be unblocked; I had to block you to get your attention.' Such blocks are meant to be lifted quickly and by any admin as soon as – but not before – the appropriate condition has been met. Particularly since we have the {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} template, such 'indefinite' blocks should represent a small inconvenience for the blocked editor. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 20:14, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Except that such subtle semantic games are rarely a consolation to the target of the block, particularly when we use overly formalistic languaged like "revoked the editing priveleges for this account".</dd>
<dd>In general, requests and suggestions should be preferred to warnings, which should be preferred to blocks; not because it's any more difficult to remove blocks from a technical standpoint, but because of the effect of harsher measures on (usually) well-meaning volunteer editors. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 20:20, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I actually agree with you – and with Jkelly's revised opinion – that the block was hasty in this case. But I don't think that any 'subtle semantic games' are being played here. Jkelly provided clear conditions for the lifting of the block, and was clearly monitoring the situation—Jkelly attempted an unblock eight minutes after Michael Dorosh agreed to abide by the policy. (I also applaud Jkelly's decision to post a notice on <i>this</i> page, so that other admins could review the situation.) If we're going to talk about the language editors use, I'd say that the intent and meaning of Jkelly's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Michael_Dorosh&amp;diff=62411525&amp;oldid=62384764" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Michael_Dorosh&amp;diff=62411525&amp;oldid=62384764" rel="nofollow">whole comment</a> – particularly the part that reads "One such a commitment is received, any admin should return editing priveleges immediately." – are clear. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 20:36, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand why you replaced the image and I agree it was the right move (assuming a better quality version of the pic can be found). The problem is that <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">User:Michael Dorosh</a> made what appeared to be a good-faith edit, reverting the image for a better looking one which had a valid claim at being fair use.

<dd>I agree that he should have been warned first. I don't know if it is true in this case, but people frequently don't read edit summaries or the talk page before editing or reverting. Also, if he was aware of the message(s), he may have thought that he had a legitimate fair use claim when he reverted.

<dd>That there is confusion is the point and we should consider that users may not have read things like Wikipedia:Fair use criteria. <i>I am not arguing that the content should have not been removed</i>. I am arguing that an indefinite block without warning was a bad idea. A user may think that he or she is correct in replacing poor quality free content with high quality unfree content that he or she thinks it can be used under fair use. It does not matter if the content cannot be used under fair use because that only tells us that the content should be removed. It does not tell us whether an indefinite block without warning was the correct thing to do because that depends on the user's intentions, not whether they are right or wrong about a fair use claim or a policy. That is why I think a block without any warning, especially an indefinite block, is a bad idea in this type of case. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 20:33, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Consensus does seem to be that a note at the article Talk page was insufficient warning that blocks might happen. I'd like to invite further discussion about whether page protection or revert warring are better alterantives. I'm concerned that there seems to remain some confusion about whether or not reverting unfree image cleanup is some kind of individual judgement call, and that we should treat replacing freely-licensed content with unfree content casually. All of that said, if consensus is that blocks shouldn't happen without significantly more warning, I'll commit to not blocking for image use violations without a warning on the user's talk page, and consider this to be a bad block on my part. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 19:48, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that part of the issue is confusion over the meaning of "alternative" in the criteria; this can be interpreted as meaning either <i>any</i> free image, or <i>only</i> a free image that is a suitable replacement within the context of the article. In other words, it may be unclear whether we should prefer free images even where there are concerns that their quality is so deficient as to make them useless; or whether we can temporarily retain the fair-use images (in places where we have legitimate claims for such, obviously) until a <i>suitable</i> free image can be obtained. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 19:59, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the general issue of use of the free image, I feel the standard should be: would we use the free image as the lead photo, if there was no alternative? If the answer is yes, we should only use a free image. The free image does not have to be as good as the non-free image. That's an impossible standard. Very few people/organizations are going to donate professional studio quality photographs to Wikipedia, and we shouldn't pretend they ever will. Also, I concede the low quality of the free image. But that's fixable by a industrious Wikipedian either taking a new photo of Harper, or getting somebody who has a photo, to donate it (e.g. a supporter who wants their leader to look good). There's no incentive for such hard work, if we're unwilling to give preference to free images. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">User:Michael Dorosh</a> is demanding the free image be as good as the non-free image. But that's unreasonable. It need only be "good enough". Also, I note there's <a href="../../../s/t/e/Image%7EStephen_Harper_voa.jpg_f349.html" title="Image:Stephen Harper voa.jpg">this public domain</a> option as well. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 04:57, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article on <a href="../../../i/n/a/Inayat_Bunglawala_ecce.html" title="Inayat Bunglawala">Inayat Bunglawala</a> was edited by an anonymous user, who inserted links to the far-right, racist British National Party and included POV statements like "claims to be a moderate but revealed himself to be a born jihadist." It also included unsubstantiated claims of death threats made by Bunglawala to the anti-Islamic far-right weblog Little Green Footballs, which have not, as far as I'm aware, been discussed anywhere but on the aforementioned weblog.</p>
<p>I request that the administrators look over the edit history of the article, investigate the links to the British National Party and Little Green Footballs, and take appropriate action against the user: 24.79.43.137.</p>

<dd>Looks to me like simply inputting information that isn't reputably sourced. As offensive as you may find it, in my (non-admin) opinion, its no worse than any other article being edited with nonverifiable content and this user shouldn't be punished more strictly simply because what he input was pov and sourced to a weblog, or deemed anti-islamic. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 19:22, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, logging in as anonymous user to input links to racist organisations (namely the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">British National Party</a>, which has leaders convicted of race-related offences as well as links to Holocaust denial and violent groups) in order to support Islamophobic comments, I believe, is significantly more than just using "nonverifiable content."

<dd>I have contributed to this article, as have a number of quality editors... The other person reverting, has made no contributions to Montanism whatsoever, but just waded in out of nowhere a couple days ago, and announced that he says the article is no longer "allowed" to start off with "Second century AD" - but rather, must say only "Second century" - leaving the reader to figure out from the context that it is AD and not BC. He has made all kinds of ultimatums to me, including on my talk page, and when I don't answer all of his petty arguments quickly enough or to his satisfation (I really have several much more important tasks than minor details like this), he starts reverting again. Unfortunately, none of the other actual contributors to the article beside myself seem to have noticed, perhaps they are all on vacation this summer. I would love to see what some of the other people who actually wrote the article think about this. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 01:10, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia (and this article in particular) is not of your property. This means that a right contribution made by anyone has the same value as your long-standing contributions. Your complaint, however, shows the way you work. You immediately revert my edits, but "have several much more important tasks than minor details like" answering my comments. Only recently, and after reverting your reverts, I got some kind of attention from you. You gave your points, I countered them (I would say I showed they were wrong or of lesser importance, but this is POV) and you simply told me to wait for "other people who actually wrote the article", after reverting, of course. Is this your way to settle the matter, ignoring other's comments but reverting their edits?--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanairjdde_99b7.html" title="User:Panairjdde">Panairjdde</a> 01:26, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well I don't know. But the fact is I have have not "ignored", but have replied to each and every one of your comments, as the record will show. I guess I just didn't respond to your satisfaction. I consider this an minor irritating nuisance over something quite petty, that is beginning to get more than just a little out of hand. I know this article is not my property, and never insinuiated that it was. I am only asking you to please chill out until we can get a third opinion besides yours and mine, preferably from someone who has actually had something to do with the actual article.

<li>Unfortunately, a look at this editor's contributions has shown that he has now taken it upon himself to go all across wikipedia, making sure that "AD" does not appear in any article. Is this not defeating the spirit of the rules regarding Eras??? AD is customary, traditional and explicitly allowed by the rules, it specifies what calendar is being used, even when it is obvious, that's just the way its always been done. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 21:21, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dear Mr. ፈቃደ,</dd>
<dd>I would like you to understand what other people are doing, before attacking them. I have been removing redundant ADs and CEs, as well as uniforming usage in the articles. I think I need to tell you (because you claim to have no time to read my posts or understand my edits, but you have plenty to revert my edits) that this means that I remove AD/CE where not necessary, inserting them where necessary, and making articles that use both AD and CE to use only one of the two formats (apart special articles that use both, of course). This does not mean that I am deleting AD from all the articles. I also noticed in your talk page, that you have several problems with dealing with others' edits about AD/BC/CE/BCE matter, so, before claiming I am going "spirit of the rules regarding Eras", understand what the MoS says, and meditate on it.</dd>

<li>Indefinitely block all the sockpuppets and leave the main account active. While having sockpuppet accounts is fine, using multiple sockpuppets for the purpose of having additional commentary is not. He's been using these multiple sockpuppets to participate in AfDs &amp; DRVs, and he's also been launching personal attacks against the "evil deletionist cabal". Definitely not good faith. Note: only for accounts that are either self-admitted or confirmed (by CheckUser or whatever). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 14:14, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Mark is disputing some of the sockpuppet accusations (on the Unblock mailing list). I haven't confirmed it with him, but it appears as if he is admitting to <a href="../../../c/l/u/User%7ECluePuppet_b050.html" title="User:CluePuppet">User:CluePuppet</a> and User:Advocron (User:MarkSteere and User:Mark Steere would be assumed).

<dd>I was a co-moderator of this forum (ie. stacking games at Yahoo!) and revived it after there was not a single post for 11 months. You (ie Mark) posted racist remarks about Russians to which I objected. However, the owner of the group defended your actions, so I left the group simply because I didn't want to be part of a group in which racism is acceptable. After that you started to "stalk" my e-mail account with numerous abusive e-mails using pseudonyms, but all sent from your computer.</dd>

<p>I had a request on my talk page to take a look at <a href="../../../a/d/e/Category%7EAdelaide_Football_Club_4bf7.html" title="Category:Adelaide Football Club">Category:Adelaide_Football_Club</a>. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESeth_Cohen_c3d0.html" title="User:Seth Cohen">User:Seth Cohen</a> has created an individual page for the team roster of every season (Adelaide Crows 1991 Playing List, Adelaide Crows 1992 Playing List, and so on). Now, my question is, can these be speedied (for having no real content)? Or do they need to go through AFD? I'm inclined to apply common sense and speedy them, but last time I did that, I got no end of grief.

<p>Hi folks, things aren't working the way I thought they would. It seems that <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Brooklyn_Beckham_2f81.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brooklyn Beckham">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brooklyn Beckham</a> is a nomination closed on 20 March 2006. When this article was renominated, the nominator didn't create a new AfD, rather, he cleared out the old page and replaced it with a new AfD. I tried to split the two versions by deleting the page and restoring all the edits from 20 March 2006 and back. I then moved this page to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brooklyn Beckham (old nomination), and restored the latest history to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Brooklyn_Beckham_2f81.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brooklyn Beckham">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brooklyn Beckham</a>. However, things didn't work the way I thought they would, and after multiple attempts to delete, move, and merging histories, I am now left with the old 20 March 2006 AfD, and while the AfD says that there are deleted edits in the article history, when I try to restore the edits, it says that there are no edits in the history! Can a more MediaWiki-savvy admin take a look at this and fix it, then tell me what I should have done?

<p>As entertaining as <a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html#Civility" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">this one-sided discussion is</a>, I think it needs an external eye. I have also received an Email from ghirlandajo regarding is "eff off" edit summary, how necessary he is to the project and similar matters, which I will disclose if requested. Ghirlandajo has been warned before (notably in an ArbCom case) about his confrontational editing, uncivility and personal attacks. <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 18:25, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wouldn't necessarily have issued a block of any length for this, but he is being overly aggressive and confrontational. It's clear that you are not in a content dispute (in particular, you did not reinstitute your edit after blocking him), but it would have been better if someone other than the person the "eff off" comment were directed at had conducted the action, since it could be seen as an impassioned response to an insult. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 19:01, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's quite necessary to impress upon Ghirlandajo the fact that nobody—no matter how many articles they've started—is exempt from the requirement to stay civil. It will be regrettable if the only way to do this is through blocks—it would certainly be much easier for everyone involved if he were to change his behavior of his own volition—but, if nothing else works, I suppose there's not much else to be said. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 19:17, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you may congratulate Circeus that he saved Wikipedia from such a rude person and disgrace as myself. Either you create an encyclopaedia or a talk group of well-mannered pansies. If good manners are more prized here than content creators, I shall depart gladly. Just make sure there is a good substitute that will write articles about Russian history and art for myself. Since I joined the projetc in 2004, nobody has emerged to claim the place. Moreover, a large portion of my 2,500-entry watchlist doesn't figure in the watchlists of any other editor. Unlike manga or Star Wars articles, the topics from Russian history and art do not attract much interest from admins. It's enough to scan my watchlist to see numerous articles vandalized during my brief absence from WP. But it was your choice to oust me from this project and you have to live with it. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 15:35, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, the regretable and totally inappropriate "Fuck off" comment was from months earlier. Please do not use it to justify anything here. Second, eyes at the talk page provided by Circeus are invited indeed. I think admins should avoid borderline actions in cases where they are involved, especially since user:Circeus admits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Briangotts&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62603026" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Briangotts&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62603026" rel="nofollow">here</a> that he <i>"mostly hasn't been doing much user-related stuff since becoming an admin and that he needs guidance, so he wants to get some guidances"</i>. Blocking is the most serious punishment available and one has to be absolutely sure when using it, especially due to an issue where the user involves himself. I regret that Circeus lost temper. I suggest he removes his block himself and if he after <a href="../../../t/e/a/WP%7ETEA_9830.html" title="WP:TEA">WP:TEA</a> thinks the block still may be warranted, refers it to other admin's attention at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:50, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I then agree the remark was inappropriate. The rest of my message stays then, see above. Your referring the case to experienced and uninvolved admins at WP:ANI would have been the proper thing to do. I think you are taking this personally. You have the full right to do so, but not to use Admin tools while at it. Is there any reason not to have others decide on the issue? Please think of it calmly. Whether you self-revert your block or not, I think this is truly a borderline case and you should have posted it to WP:ANI for others to act on it. I do not accuse you in acting unethically. I think you simply lost the temper, also judging for your entries at talk, but that's just my opinion. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 20:05, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My point is, JK, that even if it was done with the best of motives, it seems more like a revenge block than anything else. As there was interaction (i.e. conflict) in an article editing capacity, I think C was perhaps too involved to be issuing unilateral blocks. IMO he shouldn't have blocked, but asked someone else to review the situation (you maybe). --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Tēlex</a> 20:11, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's very borderline whether there was an edit war; certainly the cause of the block is only tangentially related to the Spanish Baroque article itself.

<p>I suggest we brush the motives aside. Circeus was right to refer the case to this board. More correctly, he should have gone to WP:ANI and let others, with experience and uninvolvement, to sort it out rather than using the strongest possible tool in his disposal. There is no foul play here. We all loose temper at times.

<p>Somebody do something PLEASE!!! He is edit warring with me over the article <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">Paul of Tarsus</a>. He wants it to say Paul was born in 9. How is anyone supposed to deduce from that whether Paul was born in 9 AD or BC? I wouldn't even know myself. In the past 20 minutes alone, AD has disapeared from another whole slue of articles. His interpretation of the MOS is overly rigid. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 23:35, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is an example of CS way of thinking. If I write Paul was born in 9, what does it means? According to Manual of Style, AD/CE year does not require tags, and in this article no other year is BC/BCE. What should I do, stop editing because CS loves to see AD everywhere? As regards Paul, I left AD for the year of birth, as a compromise, but this is going to be ridiculous.--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanairjdde_99b7.html" title="User:Panairjdde">Panairjdde</a> 23:40, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Read it more clearly. AD is acceptable. It is also traditional practice. And the MOS makes a point of saying that crusading across the wiki invading articles and messing with it is seriously frowned upon, because it starts edit wars, as we are now seeing everywhere. Even on the Montanism page where this all started, consensus is to keep the AD. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 23:43, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>It seems that the entries for <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon_Novak_7eca.html" title="Brandon Novak">Brandon Novak</a> and Matt Belitsky are virtually identical. An IP editor brought it to my attention, and he's right - we've got the same text in both these entries, with the only difference being one says 'Novak' and the other says 'Belitsky.' I think that Novak is the real guy described in the text, but I'm not sure.

<p>I've seen a few unblock requests, and no consistent way of handling them (from a simple technical standpoint, what to do with the unblock request template). I made {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_denied_b21f.html" title="Template:Unblock denied">Unblock denied</a>}} as an idea for how to handle this - replace {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} with {{{{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_denied_b21f.html" title="Template:Unblock denied">Unblock denied</a>}} and add the reasons for declining. This keeps the unbblock argument intact and removes from the unblock category.

<dl>
<dd>Yes, this is a thorny problem. Another question is how to handle repeated unblock requests from the same user. To my mind it is reasonable for a blocked user to request a second opinion after one admin has rejected an unblock request but when two or more admins have declined it I suppose it's reasonable to short-circuit further appeals (keeping in mind that the blocked user can still post to the mailing list). <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 19:02, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rather than 'number of admins' I'd suggest some sort of 'passage of time' measure. If a group of ordinary users get into a content dispute with some admins and are blocked for it they shouldn't be barred from requesting unblock because the involved admins declined their request (which I have seen done). Maybe put a timestamp on 'unblock' that expires (and removes them from the category) after 12 hours or somesuch. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 19:07, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Additionally, for the above situation... it should probably be clarified (in the blocking policy) that handling an unblock request ought to be done by an uninvolved admin. People are going to differ about how involved is uninvolved and so forth, but it should at least be established that in the "ordinary users in content dispute with group of admins" case described above, it's unseemingly for someone from that group of admins to be the ones who reject an eventual unblock request. There are many, many admins on Wikipedia, and no pressing reason why an involved one would need to <i>reject</i> the request, since it hardly matters if it takes a few hours more for a request to be rejected. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 00:03, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like the idea. People declining requests are often leaving the unblock template active to allow for a second opinion. If we add a category for declined requests to your template, then we can decline an unblock, use your template, and still allow for someone else to come around to give a second opinion. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature11_bf0f.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature11"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 19:10, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The problem is that when you do that you remove the user from the category, so if you use the category to find who is requesting to be unblocked, this user will no longer be listed. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature11_bf0f.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature11"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 19:58, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's rather the point—it keeps the category from getting clogged up. An editor can seek a 'second opinion' by restoring the template with an explanation why the first admin's review was mistaken, or can pursue any of the other methods of requesting an unblock (email the blocking admin, email to the mailing list, query on IRC, etc.) <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 21:16, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think I finally managed to find the correct place to ask this question. Basically, I'm not exactly sure what your website does and I wasn't sure it was true you could simply go edit a page. I gave it a go as a sort of test and some "messages" flagged up saying I was a "vandal" for just trying something out and got ordered to go to some "sandboxes". I wasn't linked to the said "sandboxes" and I had a look around but I couldn't seem to find any "sandboxes" or what exactly they entail.</p>
<p>I'd also like to ask what "vandalism" is in this regard. I've also envisaged vandalism to be ostensibly linked with spray cans and walls. If I caused some kind of permanent and serious damage by trying things out then you have my apologies.</p>

<dd>Sandboxes are test pages where you can test things without affecting "real" articles. There's more than one because there are many users, if they'd all use the same page for tests there would be conflicts. Registered users get a user page, and then they can use this (or subpages) for tests. As long as you have no account go to <a href="../../../s/b/_/WP%7ESB_c0d8.html" title="WP:SB">WP:SB</a> - that's a shortcut for "Wikipedia sandbox".

<p>I was working on the George W. Bush article in the discussion pages. I noticed that Queen Of Sheba left a remark calling for the death penalty for the president. I believe that is illegal and should be removed from the discussion.</p>

<p>It is not illegal to either publicly or privately call "for the death penalty for the president". But it is trolling. Joking about assassinating him is also legal, but can result in a talk with the secret service who will wish to make sure that it was indeed a joke. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 13:47, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anons and one off accounts keep on adding a "internet fame" paragraph to this article. Of course, it's an absolute crock of shit, referring to newgrounds flash animations created by the "Barney Bunch". Notable? Hell no. But I can't be bothered to keep such a contentless article on my watchlist. Can someone look at the article, look at its history and see what the editing is about. As it's a content thing, I haven't given out vandal warnings to the other editors, although that's what it basically is, vandalism.</p>

<p>User Gibnews has been persistently censoring the <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> article. His behaviour falls short of outright vandalism but it consists of imposing his NPOV view on all other users by daily revertals and refusal to engage in constructive discussion or consensus building. He accuses all wikipedians who do not agree with him on a number of issues (a majority of editors of the Gibraltar article) of being "pro-Spanish" and spreading "lies and propaganda".</p>
<p>The main problem with his behaviour is that he has erased dozens of respectable sources included in the article by a number of users over the past months. He considers they are not worthy of being included in the article since they contradict his biased POV. He has even gone as far as erasing the disputed tag from the article while imposing his view on all other users who disagreed with him.</p>
<p>A number of users (including myself, <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion">user:Asterion</a>, <a href="../../../e/c/e/User%7EEcemaml_a689.html" title="User:Ecemaml">user:Ecemaml</a> and many others) have given up on contributing to the article but I have noticed that others (such as <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanchurret_b95f.html" title="User:Panchurret">user:Panchurret</a>) continue to contribute sources which are promptly erased by user Gibnews.</p>
<p>I am suprised that he has not be banned (or atleast warned) by Wikipedia administrators as <a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibraltarian_6c70.html" title="User:Gibraltarian">user:Gibraltarian</a> has.</p>

<dd>The simple fact of the matter is that there is a concerted campaign by entities in Spain to blacken the name of Gibraltar. Wikipedia is yet another media where this is practiced.

<p>This note being posted because of his extremely subtle approach to extremely destructive vandalism, and the way he gradually drives <i>bona fide</i> editors off Wikipedia. He is almost impossible to spot (appears to be "just another POV editor or clique with personal attack tendencies and extreme views") unless you have seen his "style" elsewhere before. Editors ultimately burn out either from AGF, from wikistress, or from rebutting personal attacks.</p>
<p>Please <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELong_term_abuse_HeadleyDown_75af.html" title="Wikipedia:Long term abuse/HeadleyDown">read the LTA article on him</a>, to become familiar with his approach, in case articles you work on (or try to resolve disputes on) are affected in this manner.</p>
<p>User has gradually tried (successfully) to destroy a number of articles, and burned out a number of administrators and article mentors, before being identified as a specific problem. With a long history (18 months+) of this activity, two RFArb's, and having just been removed from two articles, there's little doubt he plans to continue if he is able. Hence this post.</p>

<dd>In part because he's only this last few weeks finally been recognized <i>generally</i> as a significant vandal (as opposed to a problem on one article). Before that he seemed to everyone, just another POV/NPA problem on one article. It took a lot of checking to document the scale and <i>modus operandi</i> and show he is a significant vandal. He fooled Arbcom twice, and dozens of experienced vigilant editors who were suspicious and <i>saw</i> his attacks play out for months on multiple articles, but <i>still</i> couldn't "prove" anything more than usual problematic conduct. That said, his preference is for long term POV/dominance of articles/sock-rule, so being aware "this could be HeadleyDown's work", as opposed to "just another typical POV/3RR/NPA editor" and blocking on sight solves much of it. If caught he will deny and counteraccuse, playing the game that not giving good faith to his edits shows extreme bias.</dd>

<p>Hi Guys. HeadleyDown here. I'm just following up on FT2's propaganda campaign. I left Wikipedia quite a while ago, but with some fair concern over FT2's propagandist editing.</p>
<p>You should know that I (and the Hong Kong skeptics society) left Wikipedia on fairly good terms overall. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:HeadleyDown" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:HeadleyDown" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> We edited exclusively from Hong Kong. IP checks can verify this. The HK skeptic soc improved the article using very solid verifiable fact, well supported and corroborated in the literature. Those facts were added under the helpful and strict scrutiny of mentors Woohookitty and Katefan. We most certainly never committed any vandalism whatsoever. FT2 is working to remove verifiable facts in favour of pro-NLP argument.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:FT2/djgvasejrh" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:FT2/djgvasejrh" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:FT2/NLP_new" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:FT2/NLP_new" rel="nofollow">[51]</a></p>
<p><br />
Woohookitty can give his version of the story if you seek a neutral source on this matter. Here is how Woohookitty actually left the NLP article:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=59414038&amp;oldid=59411009" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=59414038&amp;oldid=59411009" rel="nofollow">[52]</a></p>
<p>Woohookitty left the article a few days afterwards complaining to FT2 that there are too many meatpuppets (the NLP group also have proven meatpuppets that were never blocked (eg Comaze, and GregA, who worked together with FT2).</p>
<p>FT2, it turns out, is strongly biased towards NLP, is certified in the subject, and is willing to selectively edit (as seen in my talk page), post his own opinion, and generally add argument and promotion to any article that takes his fancy.</p>
<p>I know I'm no saint, but FT2 is here to abuse Wikipedia extensively by including most facts but arguing and promoting his own agendas (hard to detect but undeniable when detected). In short, I wish to extend the goodwill that I left Wikipedia with, and urge you to scrutinise FT2's edits as they are highly biased towards his own agendas. He also seems to be compiling a list of unrelated editors that he wants to conflate with me. He is abusing Wikipedia. Regards. HeadleyDown (Wei).</p>

<p>Hey -- Interesting situation here, and I'm hoping for some more input. This user left me a message on my talk page; when I went to respond to him, I noticed that he had formatted his talk page with an unclosed &lt;div&gt; tag that formatted the text in a way that I can best describe as completely and utterly unreadable. To summarize, it's a very small font with medium-dark purple text on a dark purple background. Even when I select the text, I couldn't read it because it was too small. I first removed this formatting, he replaced it, and then we started talking. His side of the issue is that, for whatever reason, normal formatting is too big for him to read comfortably, and that since <i>he</i> can read his user talk page, that's the important thing. I think this might be an issue with his browser settings, but that aside, I feel like the communication the user talk page is there for is a two-way street, and something this unreadable just goes too far. I'd like some input from others about this; the relevant bit of policy is, from <a href="../../../t/a/l/Help%7ETalk_page_601e.html" title="Help:Talk page">Help:Talk page</a> under "Etiquette": <i>Feel free to decorate your personal pages as you see fit, but keep in mind that your user talk page has the important function of allowing other editors to communicate with you.

<dd>Per the initial comment: I am quite embarassed, a female (not a "he"), and felt quite violated by this disruption over such a petty thing that in no ways has helped to improve the quality of articles on WP, hasn't any consideration for my eye-sight, was previously discussed and mentioned that I did <b>NOT</b> wish to be singled out in any fashion, especially <b>not</b> to be made a personal issue of, and this discussion could certainly have taken place among administrators without the necessity of bringing my talk page to the attention of abusive trolls which distrupted any plans of mine to work on articles this evening. I was told by the admin that such a discussion would take place, but I was not invited to the discussion, nor was it pointed out to me and I found it on my own. If any of you would like to take the honor of giving me medical advice on how to retain what is left of my eyesight after 30 years of working with computers professionally, please go right ahead. I will ignore your advice however, and wish you the best of luck with your own eyes. As I previously advised the admin that brought me to everyone's attention, if you wish to create a policy discussion on the matter, please do so, change the current documentation, or whatever else you like. Just leave me out of it, but be guaranteed that I will be aware of it when it changes.

<dd>There's _nothing_ inconsistent about it. Ireland doesn't "use British spelling"; rather, Britain and Ireland share the same spelling system. The OED, for example, regards the English of Great Britain and that of Ireland as one variety of English, with its own regional dialects (Southern England, Scotland, Ireland, etc.). Those "various anon users" are most likely the same user, who, btw, is apparently wikistalking me. Anyway, we have worked out a compromise, as you can see if you take a look at that page and history thereof. The Commonwealth column has a {{fact}} tag, since it's unsourced, unlike all the others---and therefore I still think it should be removed, but I don't care that much, I prefer to constructively contribute to the encyclopedia. Someone else <a href="../../../m/y/r/User_talk%7EMyrtone86_1f23.html#Aboriginal_vs_Indigenous_in_Canadian_English" title="User talk:Myrtone86">pointed out to you</a> that each country has its own spelling system, but you apparently didn't get it. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber"><font face="bookman old style"><i>JackLumber.</i></font></a>

<dd>No what I was saying is that you seem to think that spelling in UK and Ireland is "the same" but yet consider every English speaking country beyond the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> to have its own (unique) spelling system, I didn't realise that you and those users have found a compromise, so I will remeber that for next time. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrtone86_be3b.html" title="User:Myrtone86">Myr<b>tone</b></a></dd>

<p>Lets be honest, finding/proving a copyright vio is a complete bitch. You copy random strings from the article into Google, put some quotes around them, and spin the dice. No longer! Break free from your chains of boring grunt work!</p>
<p>I have come across many admins and users who don't know about this site, and I think they should.</p>
