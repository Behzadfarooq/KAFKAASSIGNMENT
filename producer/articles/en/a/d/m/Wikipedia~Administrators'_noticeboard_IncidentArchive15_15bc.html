<dd>The talk page shows that repeated warnings (it consists of nothing else but) and at least one 24 hour block (iirc the block log showed another couple of short blocks for that IP that wasn't mentioned on the talk page) haven't stopped them. There have been a large number of edits, all vandalism dating back to January iirc. After reading dab's comment above I realisd that a permanent block as I initally suggested wasn't apropriate, but given the user's history a prolonged block (in the order of 1-2 months) is entirely apropriate imho. I'm not an admin, but if I were then I'd probably have placed a block of about that timeperiod on the user. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 23:00, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 3RR doesn't say that successive blocks are given for each revert over three. It says one block up to 24 hours for reverting more than three times in a 24 hour period. As short as it was, John served a block already (which should illustrate why 30 minute blocks are lame). I think we'd all suggest trying to work out the dispute, rather than gaming the 3RR system and continuing to engage in your revert war. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 03:01, 2005 Apr 7 (UTC)

<dd>The point of the 3RR blocks is to dissuade multiple reverts. Should the user come back and create a new violation, which an additional revert in the period is, this seems to me to be a new violation that requires more forceful dissuading. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 03:11, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since #4 says "RV" in big letters in the edit summary, I'm not sure why you're questioning it. As for #3, it removes the same section as #1. How is this at all unclear? And yes - I waited the 40 minutes. And then I removed what I believe to be bad faith additions from a user who's contributions are largely personal attacks and POV pushing.

<li>Netoholic, there is no need to add that to 3RR. Admins can already choose not to block under the 3RR or to lift any block, at their discretion. Quoting from the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocking policy</a>, "<i>Sysops must use their common sense and good judgement</i>". There is no need to codify this practice in the policy wording itself, except for clarity. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 01:50, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>This bot is transwiki'ing articles to Wiktionary, which is fine, but it is leaving behind <tt>{{deletetranswikied}}</tt> notices, which is not always OK. Among articles which were marked for speedy deletion are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../f/a/g/Fag_hag.html" title="Fag hag">Fag hag</a> (the current article is well beyond a mere dicdef)</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/f/f/Affluenza.html" title="Affluenza">Affluenza</a> (an entire book was written about it, so it's hard to argue that an encyclopedic article could not be written).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some admins have acted on these speedy-deletion notices. I have restored:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../v/i/r/Virility.html" title="Virility">Virility</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigilography.html" title="Sigilography">Sigilography</a> (certainly an encyclopedic topic just like <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numismatics.html" title="Numismatics">numismatics</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philately.html" title="Philately">philately</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Articles with encyclopedic potential shouldn't be speedily deleted merely because the current version is a stub. The fact that a dictionary definition may be applicable does not exclude the possibility that the topic may be encyclopedic as well; there are many topics which could have both obvious one-line dictionary definitions and long encyclopedia articles, such as "astronomy" and many others.</p>

<p>Actually, Template:Deletetranswikied itself was only created recently (March 25). However, being a dicdef stub is actually not one of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion criteria</a> and was explicitly voted down in the latest proposal to expand speedy criteria, so the very existence of this template is a bit contradictory... one could argue it should be proposed for TfD.</p>
<p>At the very least, it should be used with care and applied only to page that currently are mere dicdef stubs and "obviously" have no encyclopedic potential. It doesn't seem that a bot can make this call. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 02:36, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, to help clear this up. The bot does not decide wether to put the delete notice up. In fact, the transwikifier is not really a pure bot at all. I have put my eyes on all 1000 or so articles that have been transwikied. <b>I</b>, and not some automated bot puts the delete tag on pages that I thought should be deleted. I put it on articles that are dicdefs about non-nouns or that are articles about <b>words</b>.</p>
<p>I am not an administrator and I don't make the final determination on if the page should be deleted or not (even if I was an admin I wouldn't make that determination). Several times people have come behind me and instead of deleting the articles, they've removed the delete tag. To make sure everyone understands, it is <b>not</b> a bot deciding to put the delete tag on the page.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, this transwiki process has been more trouble than it's worth, and the next time there is a backlog of 1000 articles to transwiki I think I'll leave it to someone else. I've spent hours working on it, I've gotten a <b>TON</b> of grief and no love, <i><b>I'm done with it</b></i>.</p>

<dd>OK, sorry for the misunderstanding then, but since the edit that places the deletion notice is done in the bot's name (eg, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fag_hag&amp;diff=11937430&amp;oldid=11931179" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fag_hag&amp;diff=11937430&amp;oldid=11931179" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>) it can certainly leave the impression that it's done automatically without human intervention.</dd>
<dd>I certainly don't object to your efforts in general, it's quite commendable. The main problem is the speedy deletion notices that should probably be much more conservatively applied, if at all (technically, these should all be VfD's). Maybe the bot (or you) could leave some kind of milder notice in its wake. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 04:20, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Half the time the bot doesn't leave any kind of notice except a notice on the talk page that the article has been tranwikied. If I ever run it again (doubtful) I'll just not tag any of them for deletion. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Rector_8ca0.html" title="User:Kevin Rector">Kevin Rector</a> 04:49, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've had <i>my</i> appreciation. You've saved me a <i>lot</i> of transwikification work that I would otherwise have been doing by hand. (In fact, a few times I've just left an article in <a href="../../../c/o/p/Category%7ECopy_to_Wiktionary_3d71.html" title="Category:Copy to Wiktionary">Category:Copy to Wiktionary</a> alone in the hope that <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinBot_f44e.html" title="User:KevinBot">User:KevinBot</a> would sweep it up, which it has duly done.) And the fact that I've followed the 'bot (although I've been a bit busy with Wikinews over the past week and haven't been able to) has been partly to shield you from hassle. (Both I and <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">User:Kappa</a> have been keeping a watch over the process.) The bot has certainly done a <i>much</i> better job that some of the hand-transwikifications (from third parties) that I've had to clear up after over at Wiktionary. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:43, 2005 Apr 6 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>incorrect blocking is a very good reason. If you don't like your blocks being pulled then I would advise you against blocking under the 3RR because your blocks are likely to be pulled by many people for any number of reasons.

<dd>This is a very large dialup range and shouldn't be blocked.

<p>I protected the page instead; chasing some anon over a large block of dialups is a waste of time (in addition to all the other reasons to prefer that solution).

<p>This is still going on. I've blocked one IP for 24 hours following four additions of the text, but now another has come along. I've therefore protected it for a short time, though without the tag (it seems daft on a talk page because of the talk:talk: link).

<li>It's especially bad to post such things on TBSDY's talk page if he's not there to respond. We could just protect and redirect users here if they want to contact him.

<p>I noticed a recent sudden flurry of votes to delete on the listing for autofellatio 2. Investigating, I note that <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">User:Achilles</a> has spammed the user talk pages of people who voted delete in another recent IFD listing of a similar picture. He has made no genuine attempt to inform other users, only those whom he must have believed would be likely to vote to delete.</p>
<p>Between 21:05 on April 6 and 04:41 on April 7 Achilles made some 57 comments on user talk pages with the title "Images and media for deletion votes", containing the text:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I am contacting people who previously helped to vote to delete a generally objectionable photograph by a vote of 88 to 21, and who might be unaware that immediately after that image was voted to be deleted someone posted <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html#Autofellatio_2" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">another which was very similar in content.</a> My objections to this, and the previous image that was voted to be deleted might be based upon reasons far different from any that you have, but I <b>do</b> object to it, and consider the posting of such images to be acts of asinine stupidity, which burdens the project and its major educational aims in ways that they should not be burdened, and can be extremely detrimental to the acceptance and growth of WIkipedia's use and influence. Thus far those who I believe to be in the extreme minority of Wikipedians who would like to include these images, many who have been channeled to the voting page from the article with which it is associated have dominated the voting, 23 to 12 (as of the time that I composed this message). I would like to be somewhat instrumental in shedding a bit more light upon the issue, and if possible, helping to turn the tide against its inclusion. It might also be necessary to begin making an effort to establish an explicit Wikipedia policy against explicite photographic depictions of humans engaged in erotic, auto-erotic, or quasi-erotic activities. To my limited knowledge such images have <i>not</i> been accepted as appropriate <i>anywhere</i> else within this project, and frankly I can agree with those who are casually labeled <i>prudes</i> for opposing their inclusion, that they should <i>not</i> be. <b>Vitally important information that might be unwelcome by some is one thing that should never be deleted, but <i>un-needed</i> images that can eventually prevent or impede many thousands or millions of people from gaining access to the great mass of truly important information that Wikipedia provides is <i>quite</i> another matter.</b> There are vitally important distinctions to be made. Whatever your reasons, or final decisions upon the matter, I am appealing for more input on the voting that is occurring at <b><a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html#Autofellatio_2" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion</a></b>. ~ <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">Achilles</a> <a href="../../../a/c/h/User_talk%7EAchilles_ced4.html" title="User talk:Achilles">†</a></li>

<p>I'm not sure how to treat this--I wouldn't take action in any case as I've voted on that listed item so I'm an involved party.

<dd>Although I wasn't contacted directly, I only found out about it because of other peoples' talk pages on my watchlist.

<dd>My concern is that it was not an honest attempt to draw public attention to the vote. This could be done on Village Pump.

<dd>Certainly, although I did not do that myself. We do not vote on classes of image, but judge each one individually.

<dd>These 2 images are essentially the same issue, and I probably would have missed this new image if Achilles had not brought it to my attention. My point is, we've already voted on this issue. The nays had a large majority. Just because the image is slightly different, it does not change the outcome. Thus, I think it was fair to request that the people who voted before vote again, especially considering how easy it is to miss these votes. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETrampled_da74.html" title="User:Trampled">Trampled</a> 12:20, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We have not already voted on this issue. This is evidenced by the number of people who have voted differently on the two distinct images, and those who observing the different circumstances have explicity chosen to abstain (a couple of people have asserted that they did this, in the course of this discussion.</dd>
<dd>And again you miss the point that this was not an honest attempt to publicize the vote. It was specifically targetted at people who voted delete in a similar case. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:27, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The people who voted differently voted to delete because of the copyright-vio issue. They did not make up the majority of nay voters however. I would concede that it would be unfair to only ask the nay voters to vote again if the images were quite different and Achilles was seeking to promote a POV view. However, these images are near identical, and can't be considered to be two seperate votes. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETrampled_da74.html" title="User:Trampled">Trampled</a> 12:57, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I received one of these requests to vote. I chose not to vote, as I see this image as being less offensive than the previous (but not so much so as to vote the other way). I'm also concerned with a message going only to those who are likely to vote in a particular direction; if Achilles had suggest to all those who voted either way in the previous vote, that would have been fine. I also have no problem with someone approaching a small number of people with whom they have had significant contact with in the past, but Achilles is a stranger to me.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 10:17, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well we're not supposed to be using Wikipedia for political campaigning. I hadn't heard of the "schoolwatch" thing and it sounds like another disturbing sign.

MacGyver, I cannot believe that you're actually suggesting that I should imitate such actions.

<dd>Well I think I'm more concerned about the spamming issue than anything else. Vote packing I'm confident the people who do VfD and IfD duty are well able to take into account, but the possibility of our accepting spamming user talk has a bad smell to it in the long term. I don't want to give commercial spammers a yellow light (which is all they'd need) to start using wikibots to spam editors whose profiles indicate a possible interest in X or Y. Oh well, death of Wikipedia predicted, film at 11 and all that, but I do think we should look at this from the point of view of policy.</dd>

<p>Personally, I am glad I have been notified about the new vote on the autofellatio image. I am strongly opposed to inclusion of such explicit material - this is an encyclopedia, for crying out loud! I see it as a legitimate method of campaigning for votes.

<p>Can I take the opportunity to ask how <i>either</i> the copyright status, <i>or</i> the content in Autofellatio 2 is different? (a) both images are copyrighted, and (b) both are gay porn.

<dd>Virtually all images on Wikipedia are "copyrighted" in that someone holds the copyright. The holder of the copyright of the latter image had explicitly granted a right to use it, with author credit (which we always give anyway where possible), for any purpose at all. Whether the image was or was not classifiable as "gay porn" is neither here nor there. The images were sourced differently, showed different people and different occasions. They are different images. No you cannot apply one IfD vote as if it were a vote on a whole class of images. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:52, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Achilles should have been more careful in how they worded what they said, but I for one am very grateful to him for contacting me. I had already voted to delete the previous example.

<p>First of all I'd like to note that the two images are different and merit different IFD votes. I voted delete on the first and keep on the second. Uploading autofellatio2 was entirely within rights and decency. My main point, though, is to note further instances of "vote stacking" with regards to this issue. I was fortunate enough to receive two "spams" on my talk page, both of which influenced my vote. First, on March 22 <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">User:Limeheadnyc</a> (Timbo) contacted me (he indicated it was because I voted to keep autofellatio inline in the article) to inform me that the image was up for IFD. I doubt he contacted those who voted against inclusion of the image. Next, <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">User:Quadell</a> contacted me March 27 to inform me of the changed copyright status of the image. I suspect I was not the only one he contacted. So <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">User:Achilles</a> is not the only one who may be at fault here, nor is it confined to those on one side of the issue. Personally, I think contacting people based on how they voted on very similar issues is acceptable, but I would draw the line at contacting people who have not expressed an opinion on a very similar issue. <a href="../../../l/i/z/User%7ELizardWizard_a997.html" title="User:LizardWizard">LizardWizard</a> 18:43, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I noticed Quadell's notices for the original autofellatio image. He was tallying votes and asked several people questions for clarification. In particular a number of people had said "keep if it isn't a copyvio" and he wanted to make sure that, the image having been found on a porn site, the voter wanted to change his vote to "delete". That isn't campaigning, it's conscientious tallying.</dd>
<dd>On investigating I find that it is true, however, that on March 22-23 <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">User:Limeheadnyc</a> contacted some people who had voted inline on a poll on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">autofellatio</a> and notified them that the image had been put up for deletion for the fourth time. In addition to you, he contacted <a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAustin_Hair_324b.html" title="User:Austin Hair">User:Austin Hair</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">User:Christiaan</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">User:Improv</a>, <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">User:OldakQuill</a> and User:Postdif.

<dd>I did indeed contact some people about Autofellatio.jpg. I was (or thought I was) familiar with those editors' views on the subject through various means, and although I had perhaps not interacted with them on talk pages before, I thought they would appreciate the note. One should also note that, had I wanted to influence the outcome of that vote (which was already quite lopsided), I should have contacted many more people! As it were, I was more contacting them to see if they wanted to <i>contribute</i> to the discussion – I felt like there were some rampant misunderstandings and half-truths (or zero-truths) in the discussion, and I didn't have the stamena to keep up a balancing viewpoint. I think all of the users I contacted (save Austin Hair, though I could be wrong) did indeed contribute to the discussion wonderfully. So in that sense I was trying to promote discussion rather than overtly engineer a specific outcome, but I can see the similarity. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">T<small>IMBO</small></a> <a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimeheadnyc_9f02.html" title="User talk:Limeheadnyc"><font color="black">(<small>T&#160;A&#160;L&#160;K</small>)</font></a> 22:52, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>I don't have a problem with Achilles message to me at all. First, given that the new autofellatio image was posted after a very large majority of people voted to remove a similar image (by both absolute numbers and percentages), a certain amount of outrage on his part seems somewhat justifiable. I must say that for the handful of people who insist on having these images in the Wikipedia, contrary to the clear consensus, to start yelling "vote packing" when they are caught trying to upload/keep another one also seems a bit outrageous to me. I suppose that if the vote had gone by unobserved with the result being "keep" that tne next thing to have happened when the image was more widely noticed would be for its proponents to express shock and outrage when someone put it up for IFD again. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:10, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your comment is filled with loaded language. "caught trying to upload/keep another one". Is that how you regard other editors' attempts to make Wikipedia a better encyclopedia? You may disagree with them, but there are people (at least one arbcom member among them) who genuinely think this campaign to rid Wikipedia of encyclopedic images of an unusual, extremely rate sex act is wrong. You say "if the vote had gone by unobserved". But the listing was made openly by <i>a person who wanted the image deleted</i> on the appopriate forum. This was not done in darkness but in the full light of day.</p>
<p>I regret that tonight, against my express opposition, another person has taken to spamming supporters of the keep vote. I hope both he and the original 50+ talk pages spammer are severely reproved for their action. I am truly saddened by this divisive and unconscionable activity. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:27, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>and, if you are referring to the last vote, there was one full IFD, with very few participants, followed by two IFD's which were aborted prematurely. This was followed by the vote in which 81% of the votes, with wide participation, wanted the image deleted. Tony insists on characterizing this sequence of events as putting an image up for deletion as many times as it takes. By the way, even if that were an accurate characterization of events, I don't see anything wrong with holding repeated votes as more and more people become aware of an issue, until sanity prevails. However, that isn't actually what happened in this case. There were two votes: one sparse, a few months later, another one. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:55, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>BM, you're fooling yourself if you don't see a pattern here. The original autofellatio image was summarily deleted several times, overwritten by a drawing, and even replaced by a much-degraded copy of the same image, without a single vote being taken. It was also listed for deletion four times, and a number of anti-image people did indeed characterize it as <i>as many times as it takes</i>. I also note your loaded use of the word "sanity" to describe your own opinion, forgetting that many other wikipedia editors have different opinions. Shame on you. Shame on you.

<dd>If 80% of wikipedians truly want this image deleted, why are you having to fight so hard for your opinion? If it was that clear cut then there wouldn't be any need for you to have spammed in excess of 50 talk pages and you wouldn't need to battle - each time it would quietly get voted out. In the previous vote many people it seems voted against the image because of its non-free liscence not its content. From what I can see of Tony's conduct in this debate, it has consistently been of a higher standard than yours. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 23:32, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to be clear, it was Achilles who posted messages on Talk pages calling attention to the new vote. But I don't blame him. As for why his message was needed, IFD is not a place to which a lot of people regularly pay attention. When their attention is drawn to issues that arise there, it seems there is consensus that images such as these do not serve any useful encyclopedic purpose.

<dd>My appologies for confusing you with <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">Achilles</a>. The previous consensus showed that <i>that</i> image was not suitable for Wikipedia, in no small part due to its copyright status - indeed at least one voter has stated that was the sole reaosn behind their vote. If you ask a non-representetive sample of any population you will get a biased result. Taking an analogy of a real-world analogy, if you are conducting a survey of people who happen to be in a shopping centre one afternoon and asking their opinion on whether <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> is a good prime minister or not. For the first couple of hours that you're there you notice that the reults are showing that most people think he has been a good PM. Because you came here with an agenda to show that Tony Blair is not good at his job this worries you, so in order to make sure you aren't proved wrong you phone up a load of people who you know went on the anti-war march and who you know voted for the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Democrats_8c75.html" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> in the last election, and ask them to come to the shopping centre and take part in your survey, some of Mr Blair's supportser might here about it from their friends, but by the end of the day the results are going the way you want them to, and so you call it a day and publisbh the results you got that show that Tony Blair is widely viewed as a cheating-lying-bastard. Don't you think that the Labour party would have a very justified complaint that the vote wasn't fair? Inviting only those people who will vote the way you want (plus any that accidentally overhear or wander past) to take part will not produce a valid consensus of the population supposedly represented. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 00:02, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There was no question of "vote packing" on the previous vote. Copyright was an issue in that vote, true, but it was not the main issue. If there were people who voted delete because of the copyright question who would have voted keep otherwise, it wouldn't have changed the fact that there was an overwhelming consensus to delete the image. Those favoring retention of the image set the bar at 80% to delete it (as opposed to 66% on VFD), and it is possible that that threshold might have not been achieved except for the copyright issue. But there was still a significant consensus, and soon after it was expressed, someone saw fit to post a similar image, essentially thumbing his nose at the consensus. In that situation, I can't see a thing wrong with Achilles seeking to alert the people who voted the first time that their intent had not been fulfilled. I am amazed and dismayed that deleting pornographic "shock" images is even controversial on Wikipedia. Jimbo has made it clear that he trusts the consensus to do the right thing with these images, and the last vote showed his trust was not misplaced. However, there seems to be a determined minority, including administrators, who are so set on making Wikipedia a beacon of their concept of freedom of speech that they will defend, even advocate, the posting of pornography in an encyclopedia intended for general usage. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:25, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>There was no question of "vote packing" on the previous vote.</i> This is false. Anthere pointed out that an unspecified number of users of the French Wikipedia had answered a call to visit the English Wikipedia solely to vote to delete the image, which was at that time being used as spam. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 10:50, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have several objections here
<ul>
<li>What is wrong with making wikipedia a "beacon of free speech"? Why don't you want that?</li>
<li>The image is not pornographic in the context of an encyclopædia arcile about autofellatio. In a different context it could be, but then in a different context <a href="../../../r/e/d/Image%7ERed-thigh-high-boots-dubidub.jpg_68a1.html" title="Image:Red-thigh-high-boots-dubidub.jpg">Image:Red-thigh-high-boots-dubidub.jpg</a> could be pornographic and nobody is objecting to the inclusion of that image.</li>
<li>This encylopædia is for general use, but what is wrong with images in context? The article about pornography is encyclopædic, and I would much rather have in-context images of a pornographic nature than images of a fatal car crash for example. However this issue is not relevant to this image because it isn't pornographic.</li>

<dd>I remember a <i>great</i> number of people who at least included copyright consideærations as part of their votes. Some also commented on the poor quality of the image as well as the vandalism that it was being used in. In fact, I think it was a <i>minority</i> who resorted to the "no porno" argument. For the second image, there are no copyright issues, the image is of decidedly good quality (even if you're personally disgusted by it), it does a better job of depicting the subject (I believe one anon crudely said the first image should be called "auto-facial" because the shaft wasn't really in the mouth), and the vandalism with which it was used has now been fixed in the wiki software. (The vandalism entailed bombing user_talk pages by placing double-redirects like <a href="../../../../fr/a/u/t/en%7EAutofellatio.jpg_94cb.html" class="extiw" title="fr:en:Autofellatio.jpg">fr:en:Autofellatio.jpg</a>, and affected other wikis by placing single redirects to Autofellatio.jpg. Those redirects are now disabled – see, for example, my sandbox <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_Sandbox_9829.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc/Sandbox">User:Limeheadnyc/Sandbox</a>.)

<dd>ok, assuming we are in the clear copyright-wise, a new vote seems to be in order, since a number of delete votes were clearly based on the image being a copyvio alone. So it seems the re-upload may be considered "within rights". We will be mercifully silent on whether the upload was also within "decency". Nobody answered whether it would be within rights and decency for me to upload "autofellatio" numbers 3 through to 23, and / or "double penetration" numbers 1 through to 25, as well as "scatophilia" numbers 1 through to 12, all depicting preciously rare sex acts. The annoyance everyone is exposed to over this makes very clear that such images do not "make a better encyclopedia". People in the keep camp seem to honestly and sincerely devoted to making Wikipedia a better porn host, and in the spirit of npov and cultural relativism I am not passing judgement on that cause. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 09:19, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>I have made no effort to disguise my opinions on this matter, on the posting of what I consider images that are detrimental to the overall value of this project, nor to hide my actions in contacting others. So far as I am aware, prior to my efforts at notifying others whose votes and opinions upon such matters were almost immediately dismissed, disregarded, and ignored, the only other prominent notice to the voting, outside of the vote page itself was on the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Talk%7EAutofellatio_3258.html#More_image_deletion" title="Talk:Autofellatio">Talk page</a> of the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">Autofellatio</a> article, and about the image that had immediately been posted once the previous one had overwhelmingly been voted to be deleted, it read:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>More image deletion</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The new image, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Image%7EAutofellatio_2.jpg_af8c.html" title="Image:Autofellatio 2.jpg">Image:Autofellatio_2.jpg</a>, which is copyright-issue-free and much better in quality and depiction of the subject (IMHO) has also been listed for deletion. Heads up. TIMBO (T A L K) 01:39, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Other</i> than those who already have the article on their watch list, or who are <i>otherwise</i> drawn with some interest to an article on the self-entertainment of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">Autofellatio</a> who exactly was this <i>targeted</i> at? It immediately produced most of the great number of Keep votes which occurred, and (so far as I am aware) it remained the only prominent notice of the issue for nearly a week.</p>
<p>I think it somewhat disingenuous of a few people to seek to censure me for expressing my honest opinions, when I have made no effort to insult them for expressing theirs, no matter how much we might disagree on any matters, nor for what reasons. I might occasionally descend into a sarcastic or derisive expression about certain opinions, or the apparent logic or lack of it involved in them, but I fully do respect the right of anyone and everyone to have their own opinions on things, and to disagree with me as much as their own levels of reasoning impels them to do. ~ <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">Achilles</a> <a href="../../../a/c/h/User_talk%7EAchilles_ced4.html" title="User talk:Achilles">†</a> 17:22, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Achilles, you know full well that there only two problems that I have with your activities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your use of spamming to further your campaign</li>
<li>Your decision to contact *only* people you thought would agree with you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Had you genuinely wanted to publicise the IfD further, you would have done the obvious thing: write a note on the Village Pump. I think it's obvious that you didn't do that because you are determined, not to have an honest decision on whether we have a consensus to delete a certain picture, but to sabotage the poll by packing it with people who you were sure would be in favor of deletion.</p>
<p>Just to show you that I'm not all hot air, I'll draw your attention to the fact that, in the original poll on whether to inline or link the picture, it was I who publicised that poll on the Village pump. I am certain that an honest poll will always be against deletion of this picture, but if I were not I would still not try to sabotage a poll as you have so blatantly and shamelessly done. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:27, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Though I fully <i>expected</i> to encounter some exceptions I confess that I did make an effort to contact people I thought would be inclined to agree with me on the matter, because it was so <i>obvious</i> an effort to circumvent the decisions that had <i>already</i> just occurred, and I am sure <i>most</i> of them might have thought <i>settled</i> the matter, for at least a little while. I have no apologies to make for an honest effort at notifying most of these people that their votes and opinions had effectively been disregarded. To characterize the mass-messaging that I engaged in to contact them as "spamming" is your right, but as I noted previously: I was not "selling" anything to anyone, and the only thing that I was "advertising" was the fact that something had occurred which I considered an act of injustice and insolent disregard of their views. BOTH Justice and Liberty are proper concerns of every ethically responsible person, and those who seek mere freedom for themselves without regard to justice and the proper freedoms of others, make a mockery of all that is fair and noble within the capacities of every human being. ~ <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">Achilles</a> <a href="../../../a/c/h/User_talk%7EAchilles_ced4.html" title="User talk:Achilles">†</a> 17:49, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because you're so fond of using the word, Achilles, I'll employ it in a particularly apt situation: your above comments reek of steaming <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshit.html" title="Bullshit">bullshit</a>. You were "spamming" by selling your case to <b>57</b> user_talk pages (maybe more?). I believe Arbcom has come down on this issue before with <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">User:IZAK</a>, who had a similar taste for spamming all over the place. Your justification is laughable: I suppose because one image was deleted, and you wanted it deleted because of one particular reason, then everyone must agree with you. What gall, then, must Christiaan have had to go to the trouble to secure a better photo with permission and upload it! Even more, all of us keep voters must be proving a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>! And all of those users you contacted who voted keep? My, they must be off their rockers (or perhaps we infected them with some sort of homosexual-porn-fiend virus in preparation for the Autofellatio_2.jpg upload).</p>
<p>What a good call – notifying those logical voters (for the keep voters certainly don't understand logic) in order for sanity to prevail. Your intervention was obviously needed, since the vote wasn't going your way (meaning the right way). I won't even get into your reasoning and the many aspects of the Autofellatio_2.jpg debate you omit. I've said them ad nauseum, and if you don't recognize that, you're either not capable or not willing.</p>
<p>I conclude my rant with a question: what would have been better (ethically, procedurally, practically, etc.), spamming 57 sympathetic talk pages with your pleas to delete one image, or actually establishing at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Talk%7EAutofellatio_3258.html" title="Talk:Autofellatio">Talk:Autofellatio</a> that there is consensus to have no images (not even linked). If there were that consensus (which there is not), image deletion would be an afterthought – orphaned images get deleted all the time, and there's nothing any of us insane keep voters could say. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">T<small>IMBO</small></a> <a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimeheadnyc_9f02.html" title="User talk:Limeheadnyc"><font color="black">(<small>T&#160;A&#160;L&#160;K</small>)</font></a> 22:20, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I confess that I am not fully familiar with all the options that are available here. The dialog on this matter has proceeded onto several different pages and forums of discussion, which makes a cohesive response to it very difficult. To help save my own time, and that of others, and to avoid needless duplication, I will respond to many of the general issues being raised upon my talk page, and occasionally respond to specific queries where I encounter them. There are certainly many matters to attend to, and I recognize that a proper resolution of the disputes will require much further discussion, and patience on the part of all involved. ~ <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">Achilles</a> <a href="../../../a/c/h/User_talk%7EAchilles_ced4.html" title="User talk:Achilles">†</a> 21:48, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Treat them in the same way and they get really miffed. They break 3RR and it OK because they are them, any oneelse and they are blocked. Even if yuo don't break £RR they can still block.

If you look at Irate's last fifty edits, he's been editing so fast he can't be bothered correcting typos while accusing <i>any</i> edit he doesn't like of being "vandalism" - not a sign of sufficient care and attention, more one of going utterly batshit IMO - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 21:49, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, I don't know how else to put it. John seems to have found a new category of mischief.</p>

<li>His mailing list complaint said Snowspinner should be blocked permanently. That's ridiculous.</li>
<li>He has reverted as "vandalism" perfectly reasonable comments from Snowy about policy.

<dd>This seems like a quite extreme injunction. Since it is essentially a personal attack case against him, it would seem that a personal attack parole would have been more in order until the case was decided. Irate seems volatile and easily provoked and is very prone to personal attacks and insults, especially as regards certain articles and his own Talk page. This violates Wikipedia policy, and he should be disciplined for it. But in the months he has been a Wikipedia editor he has also made thousands of useful edits in the main namespace including on numerous articles which are not controversial at all. I don't see why he should not have been allowed to continue with that editing. He should not be treated as a troll. Hopefully the Arb Comm case will proceed quickly. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:49, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BM, he's also been a major PITA during that time, too. And I doubt you've been on the receiving end of his abuse, or you might be a little more understanding of people who are tired of dealing with him. Look, nobody on Wikipedia is indispensable: whatever their expertise, there's someone else out there somewhere who knows it too. (This is particularly so as Wikipedia draws in a wider and wider circle of contributors). Irate's contributions just aren't worth it in terms of the price we pay for them - the aggravation and hassle.</dd>
<dd>Good people are burning out and bailing on this project all the time (see <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMissing_Wikipedians_2d19.html" title="Wikipedia:Missing Wikipedians">Wikipedia:Missing Wikipedians</a> - or look at something like <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConfessed_Wikipediholics_7ac0.html" title="Wikipedia:Confessed Wikipediholics">Wikipedia:Confessed Wikipediholics</a> and see how many are still contributing), and dealing with people like Irate is a good part of the reason why. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 16:21, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not arguing the merits of Irate's case. As I said, there seems to be a good case for disciplining him for personal attacks. However, the "injunction" seems to prejudge the outcome of the case and is effectively blocking him totally from the Wikipedia now even before he has answered the evidence against him. That is not a correct procedure. The injunctions in Arb Comm cases should put the minimum restraints on people until the cases are resolved, especially as they can take a long time. A more conservative approach in this case would have been a personal attack parole. Once again, I am not picking my battles all that well. Irate has already provided further evidence that he is volatile, and his "defense" will be to challenge the legitimacy of the Arb Comm, and generally make himself a PITA. But nevertheless, I do demur at the procedure being followed. The Arb Comm has set itself up as a quasi-judicial forum, but whenever someone points out that they are not proceeding very judicially, the answer is "Well the person is a PITA". That being the case, why not just let the AC summarily discipline people, and eliminate the pretense? Having essentially committed itself to blocking Irate from the project after at most a few hours of consideration, the Arb Comm should finish the case quickly. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:40, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comments:</b> User seems to have a <i>problem</i> with the sub categories and their being added to articles, as shown by his edit history. On the <a href="../../../a/n/f/Anfield.html" title="Anfield">Anfield</a> article, did some selective editing in order to subvert the 3rr, after which he reverted back to his edits. Seems to also not know with <i>vandalism</i> is, in considering being <i>bold</i> in editing as being vandalism, where as his own reversions could also be considered vandalism in their own right. I would guess that Irate will refute these claims, but considering that i have asked for a reason for his edits and have yet to receive a response as well as his continuing to revert similar articles, it seems that user wish to engage in a petty edit war, and i would not put much creedience in his response. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">comhrÚ</a> 21:11, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Xed apparently contacted several admins and asked that they remove his User and Talk pages. I have reverted those deletions, because, as is clear from the Block log, Xed keeps attempting to return to editing. It appears to me, at least, that his requests to have his pages deleted were attempts at deleting his existence so that he could then return to Wikipedia. If he refrains from attempting to edit, so that his name doesn't show up in the Block log every day, then his pages should be deleted. It seems to me that, no matter what day it is or what time of the day it is, both Xed and Gzornenplatz's names are at the very top of the Block log, because they have once again attempted to evade their bans and tried to edit. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:04, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You know, if either of them really wanted to edit, creating a new account or just logging out would take seconds. Other reasons for continuing use of a blocked account are possible: I suspect the difficulty of rebuilding a large watchlist is one of them, but that's just a guess. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv">&#160;<sup><small>(Mirv)</small></sup></a> 23:10, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why is his ID being blocked when he attempts to read only? I don't belive that for a minute. He would not be showing up in the Block log if all he was doing was reading. And Block log entries for IDs of previously blocked named Users disappear after 24 hours, that's why he only shows up twice. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:56, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Maybe he's asked for his user page to be deleted because he thinks that will stop the bug from auto-blocking him. Whatever his reason, he doesn't seem to be doing anything wrong, so he's probably within his rights to ask that the pages be deleted. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:01, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Contrary to RickK, I believe that he is only reading. In any case, I don't see any reason to revert to pre-block version. If Xed expresses the wish for his pages to be blanked, that wish should be granted. I for one don't like deleting the pages because red links are distressing (and his name appears in a few places) — but I'm blanking the page right now. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 00:10, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see anything wrong with attempting to edit, anyway. When I've been blocked (for which RickK has been the culprit more than once), I've always attempted to edit while blocked, to see if perhaps some kind soul had unblocked me.

<li>Xed is subject of an Arbcom ban. I think we should keep his talk page as a historical record, so non-admins can read back discussions with him. Why does he want to have them deleted anyway?

<li>He's contacted me, too. Look, he's being decent about respecting the ban / block. Why not "unblock" his account, giving him a "parole" on the condition that he refrain from editing any pages but his own user page and user talk page, and the usual clutter of RFA, RFC stuff regarding his case? (I'm going to go ahead and unblock his account, but if he mistakenly interprets this as a unilateral pardon I'll re-block him. Okay?) <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 16:22, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I object strenuously to this. Xed is banned. Xed's ban did not come without warning. Xed could have tidied up when the measure was proposed, or when it passed, or when the motion to close came. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 17:39, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As far as I know, Xed was banned basically just because you decided to go after him. Isn't it just great to see an attempt at a reasonable solution aborted because one other user holds a grudge? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 00:29, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, he was banned for making a personal attack about one edit in five, because he was convinced anyone who disagreed with him was evil and to be treated with bad faith. He is not an example to emulate - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 00:46, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Would Xed agree with this description of his actions and views? And I'm not emulating him, I only make personal attacks once every six or seven edits. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 01:18, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Probably the absolutely key point here is that whether Xed agrees or not is immaterial - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 01:32, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's pretty important, because then you have two different views that contradict. Personally, going by my own experience, I think I'd be much more inclined to trust Xed over the ArbCom. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 01:44, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether you trust the arbitration committee or not is immaterial. If you feel you have the right to unblock an arbcomm-banned User, or do anything else in contravention to an arbcomm ruling, then it might be time to get another arbcomm ruling on you, and get your sysophood removed. If you're just saying that you disagree with the arbcomm ruling, then again, it's immaterial. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 06:53, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm aware. The point is, you talk about me needing to be desysoped, but I've done next to nothing controversial with my admin powers in the year that I've had them. You, on the other hand, do controversial things on a nearly daily basis. No, I don't generally agree with ArbCom decisions because I reject punitive logic.
