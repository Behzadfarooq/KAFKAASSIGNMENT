<p><i>Everyking voluntarily agrees to avoid commenting on, second guessing, or otherwise alluding to Snowspinner or Snowspinner's actions anywhere on the Wiki. Everyking will, in short, pretend Snowspinner does not exist. Everyking may politely converse with Snowspinner on user talk:Snowspinner or user talk:Everyking. Everyking is also free to bring an RFC or Request for Arbitration against Snowspinner if he so chooses. Beyond this, Everyking's editing privileges will not be affected</i></p>
<p>Because someone is bound to mention it - yes, we realize there is no enforcement clause. Everyking is on his honor to abide by the agreement.

<dd>I agree (in what is I think an almost identical response to the last time I commented on EK on this page) that this is not the place for this discussion. Whether or not EK should have gotten this clarified prior to making the agreement, I can live without settling (though I do think that would have been a good time to raise the issue). What I am positive of is that a question should be directed directly to the AC on an AC page (perhaps the talk page linked to in Raul's comment, but I don't think anyone need follow my advice to that level of specificity). I'd like to see this section of the AN not become a battleground, and I feel that's a reasonable hope? <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 09:22, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>in any case, my (unasked for?) advice to Ek would be to consider the agreement to last for a year. If you can really keep out of another arbitration case for a whole year, I am sure everybody will be very happy and pleased, and if you <i>do</i> jump at Snowspinner's throat exactly 356 days from now, well, it will at least have been 365 days' respite for everyone. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 09:26, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It isn't up to me to say whether there'll be another case before then. Well, there will be another case in the sense that I have an appeal coming up in October, but I mean aside from that.

<dd>no, I don't pretend to know anything about the case. If you prefer you can parse my comment as, 'if you ignore Snowspinner for one year, he will hopefully have no pretext for picking on you'. The upshot (assuming he will ignore you, too) will be a year without rehashes of this arbcom case, which will be a good thing. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:10, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1) Can an administrator use the term "disruption" (without providing evidence to back up the term) to block and/or censor an editor they dislike? 2) Where can an editor notify about Admn. disruption and abuse? 3) Can I file a formal complaint?

<dd>Well reallize that the evidence is in the edit history both ways. Both the disruptive edits, and the blocks. Presumably this is about the blocks by <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">User:Jayjg</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a>. It appears they have some good evidence of personal attacks and other disruptive behavior. And to answer the question you wrote but removed "Can an Admn. block, based solely on the editor, but without focusing on actual edits themselves?" is yes, absolutely they can. If you don't want to be blocked simply follow the policies, use common sense, and make all good contributions. It's not really very hard. I presume they have some pretty good evidence, and I'd like to see some of it, because if they don't, then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=20354234&amp;oldid=20354181" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=20354234&amp;oldid=20354181" rel="nofollow">removing your comment from AN/I</a> is improper. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 20:55, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank You, Taxman. You are damn right their conduct is improper. These two editors (and usually Jpgordon following not far behind) have been abusive and utterly dishonest. They have been WIKI-STALKING me for the last week, reverting edits without discussion. The issue in a nutshell is they believe that one must have their imprimatur to edit topics they guard POV on, viciously and jealously. They are controversial administrators, I am not the first editor to note it, I will not be the last. I have been editing in good-faith, they have not. Let's review these so-called disruptive edits. Each and every single block has been disruptive and dishonest. For some reason, these three have targeted me. Nobody else seems to want to Wiki-stalk me but them. 69.209.223.68 22:49, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm not familiar with this case, but just for the record I'd like to point out that 'wikistalking' isn't disruptive per se, nor is it a violation of anything. Everyone's edit history is a matter of public record, and you can't blame people from looking through it. That said, reverting without discussion <i>is</i> a <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_thing.html" title="Bad thing">bad thing</a>, as is guarding POV. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 07:44, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Rollbacks of edits on sight, without reason or discussion, automatic IP bans in clear violation of WP rules, are what <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">jayjg</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> have been doing. Please take the time to review, if you can. I ask any Admn. to review this. Some of my comments from the Incidents board have been deleted.

I have asked repeatedly for some Administrators to review the situation. Taking a fly-by stance against an "Anon" without reviewing the facts, is what I have been saying happens all the time. Look at the fly-by criticism of Func. He has no idea of what we are even refering to. Nobody looks at the facts. Look, I know that I have been repeatedly harassed and disrupted by these editors/admns. About a week ago, after a month-long vacation, I returned to editing the encyclopedia. Immediately these 3 editors targeted me, and that sums it up. Let's see the so-called disruption they are talking about. Now, please....one more time, can anyone kindly reference what is so "disruptive" about my edits? Let's look at them and please lets see some proof. I'd like to get back to editing an encyclopedia, not deal with Jayjg's hatreds.69.209.216.128 07:41, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm curious about an aspect of VfD closing. When I run across a VfD where the consensus is to merge, but I don't feel qualified to do the merge, is it proper to close the VfD (adding the tags to the VfD page, removing the tag from the article, etc.) and put the merge template on the article noting that it needs to be merged per VfD? If it's going to be merged, then it won't be deleted (have to keep the page history) so couldn't the contributors do the merge, set the redirect, and save having it on the VfD to-do list for six months? What's the rule on this? -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 13:03, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, you can simply tag the article for merging (I've done it more than once) and close the VfD debate. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 14:14, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the record, I really don't have an issue with the vast majority of Mel Etitis' edits. The revert today, which Mel Etitis view's as stalking, was down to Mel Etitis getting over-carried away reverting a POV warrier en-masse, consequently actually undoing one good edit, which I therefore restored. I have no-idea what POV Mel Etitis may or may not have, or whether it overlaps with my opinions in any way, or not, nor am I interested in the subject areas that Mel Etitis <i>seems</i> to edit. On the other hand, Mel Etitis <i>does</i> seem to have a problem with me, and is still adamant that I am a sockpuppet of <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">User:Lir</a> (the sole reason being that my username can be considered an anagram of Lir, as would also be User:Rli, User:Lri, User:Irl, and User:Ilr) despite this question being raised some months ago, and David Gerard stating that I am not. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 20:08, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>-Ril- has been stalking me for approximately 2 weeks (I would have to check for sure) and reverted me perhaps going on a 100 times by now. He intentially targets you. I am not much in the way of battling (I think I had enough of it) him myself. I have attempted to get others to assist, but it is difficult because he is obstinate and threatening. He totally ignored SlimVirgin when she was trying to be helpful. I will put together those 100 edits and intentional targeting to assist if necessary (it really is unpleasant since he targets you, and it does not matter how much you attempt to discuss any issue, because he does not care about the issue, he wants revenge or something). --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 16:46, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

SimonP moved a tag on that page to the talk page. I considered it inappropriate, and went looking to find out why he was doing so. Discovering him doing this en-masse, I resolved to revert these changes as there is no consensus for it. After Theresa Knott stepped in, I raised the issue as a survey of Wikipedians, the current state of that survey is, as I had thought, and acted upon, that there is no consensus for mass-moving the particular template in question from articles to their talk pages. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 20:08, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I started with a block because I felt the username was inappropriate, like User:Cunt and User:Buttfucker. Granted, Cunnilingus is not as offensive a term as those two, however, I still felt that a username that was a direct effort to invoke a sex act was inappropriate and should be blocked. If we saw the name Felleightio, we'd block that too, or even something like SassHole. It was pointed out that someone else with a name that mimics Cunnilingus has been allowed to edit for some time, and as such, I felt it was inappropriate to have a double standard. Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors where it hurts our mission, but in an area such as usernames, absolutely nothing is hurt by avoiding the appearance of obscenity when possible.

<dd>Given the circumstances, I think that Steverigo has broken at least the spirit and maybe the letter of the policy as they are involved in the conflict - a request should have been made here and a note on the talk page posted to explain what they wanted and why, and get another administrator to do it.</dd>
<dd>I am therefore going to block Steverigo for 48 hours. As I only have intermittent access to my email at present and I am not going to be online this evening (Wikimania party night!) I am going to request them to make any points they want to on their talk page. Please could others watch this as well.</dd>
<dd>Separate from this, I am going to propose an amendment at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EProtection_policy_9b85.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Protection policy">Wikipedia talk:Protection policy</a> to say that every edit to a protected page, other than adding the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProtected_7bf5.html" title="Template:Protected">protected</a>}} template, must be noted on the talk page. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 17:20, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What a mess.

<p><i>what absolute twaddle!</i> -Ril-'s complaint is about as good-faith as his "sneaky little bastard" one above. This isn't a 'mess' at all, nobody has recreated any content, and if Ril has indeed an Rfc coming his way, I will be glad to add this silly campaign to the list of grievances.

Ed Poor had no hand in this at all, this is an entirely valid article I have created at <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_Islam_770a.html" title="Opposition to Islam">Opposition to Islam</a>, and for which there was consensus to move it to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Islam_00d9.html" title="Criticism of Islam">Criticism of Islam</a>, that's all. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 21:20, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that -Ril- is, as usual, acting in bad faith. However:
<ol>
<li>I also believe that the VfD vote for delete wasn't merely for the content, but for an article with that title (this has come up and been extensively discussed before); mere disagreement over content isn't good grounds for deletion, and one can vote for "merge &amp; redirect".</li>
<li>Significantly new content under a new title, on the other hand (as with <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_Islam_770a.html" title="Opposition to Islam">Opposition to Islam</a>) is perfectly OK. If -Ril- wants to propose it for VfD, he can (I, for one, will vite for keep, incidentally).</li>
<li>It's clear that <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> is completely innocent of any deliberate ill-intention in all this. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:26, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>yes, the vfd process is broken. In a perfect world, the vfd result would mean that there should never, ever be an article with the title <i>Criticism of Islam</i> on Wikipedia, even if it was a brilliantly academic piece. That's of course not what the vfd was about in this case. People voted to have the awful writeup deleted that happened to be under that title, at that time. Clearly, if there can be an <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_Mormonism_ccb0.html" title="Opposition to Mormonism">Opposition to Mormonism</a>, there can also be an <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_Islam_770a.html" title="Opposition to Islam">Opposition to Islam</a> article. Opposition is stronger than Criticism, so <i>logically</i> if there can be an article on 'Opposition', there can also be an article about 'Criticism' (since any opposition presupposes criticism, one should think). In fact, pro-Islamic and anti-Islamic editors have <i>agreed</i> that 'Criticism' is the more fitting title in this case. The only person turning this into a 'case' is Ril, apparently a troll with too much time on his hands. I <i>may</i> have been over-bold in unilaterally making the blank-protected page into a redirect (although I do not think I was). If that action was inappropriate, the <i>move</i> should be reverted. That is different from <i>deleting</i> the article, which is out of the question, much more <i>speedy</i>-deleting it. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 21:38, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, in a perfect world, once an article had been deleted after a VfD, another article wouldn't be allowed with that name until a process of discussion had taken place. The people involved in the discussion would sensibly and maturely decide whether the new article was just an attempt to get round the VfD or a genuinely new article which wasn't foreseen by the VfD. In this case, I'm sure that they'd decide that the article was fine. But I don't think that that decision should be taken by dab or me alone. That's all I'm saying here.</p>
<p>If other admins disagree with me, then I'll apologise — but I was acting in good faith, in accordance with policy as I understood it. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 22:58, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>that's right, no harm was done, and admit that I may have done better by taking the time to put a note on vfu. I thought the announcement on the article's talk page was sufficient, but I recognize that this was incorrect by the letter of policy. The right reaction to this (by people perceiving my move as a blunder and wishing to correct it) would still have been to move the article back to where it came from rather than deleting it. As I said, no harm was done, there are certainly no hard feelings on my side, and I apologize if my reaction yesterday seemed hysterical. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 18:04, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We'll see just how good their service is at responding to this sort of thing - we should be supporting any company that assists us. Therefore, I'm hoping that the Wikipedia spirit of cooperation and immense amount of volunteers will help with tracking down vandal edits.</p>
<p>If Ozemail gives a good response, we can use them as an example of a good ISP, and maybe even shame AOL into assisting us (we get lots of vandalism from them).</p>

<dd>I thought it was generally reckoned that the source of the vandalism from at least most of those IP addresses was that they were a round-robin proxy server for a school or schools. So I'm not sure what exactly Ozemail can do about it, compared to the situation where one of their customers was vandalising Wikipedia. I mean, I don't think they're going to cut off a school's internet connection because some students were abusing it to write nonsense in Wikipedia articles, are they? —<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 05:49, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They would have records of who used the ip address and when and could alert them of the problem. If nothing is done within a month, I would strongly advise the MediaWiki board to make a ruling that this subnet be blocked due to the amount of vandalism that is occuring.

<dl>
<dd>Should <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantus_1468.html" title="User:Cantus">Cantus</a> edit any article from which he is banned he may be banned from Wikipedia for a short period, up to a week for repeat offenses.</dd>

<dd>I'm guessing this serves as a definition, since "banning from Wikipedia" is a technical ability.

<p>I thought this up while reading a recent RfC. I think it expresses a difference of attitude well. It may also be a simple small/large dichotomy. I'm not a sociologist or a psychologist, and maybe someone else has said it better before. I still wanted to share it with the rest of you. The exposition is intended to be neutral; I'm not trying to imply one is right and the other is wrong—as presented I'm pretty sure they're <i>both</i> wrong when consistently applied, for different reasons.</p>

<p>Can an admin review the incident at <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_desk_5342.html#Imposter" title="Wikipedia:Help desk">Wikipedia:Help_desk#Imposter</a>? There, I confirmed that a person editing from the IP address was indeed the "real" Rajan R after sending him an email through his blog. Thus, I must conclude that <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajanr_c0e0.html" title="User:Rajanr">User:Rajanr</a> is impostering the real Rajan R. I have promised the person Rajan R. a ban on <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajanr_c0e0.html" title="User:Rajanr">User:Rajanr</a>. I feel that a 48 hour ban at first is appropriate, to give him time to respond, and because the user has not, in essence, violated any Wikipedia policy. After that, then possible an indefinite ban? I request that an admin first review the discussion, and then if s/he concurs with my judgement, block <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajanr_c0e0.html" title="User:Rajanr">User:Rajanr</a> for 48 hours.

<dd>That looks reasonable. Since the user in question has apparently <i>mis</i>represented himself as another individual (even being so bold as to link to the 'real' Rajanr's blog!), the block is legit.</dd>
<dd>Note that coincidentally sharing a screen name with some random blogger isn't sufficient to get an account blocked. There has to be–as there was in this case–a deliberate attempt to impersonate.

<p>Just a friendly reminder to all admins who do speedy deletions: When you view the article, please pay extra attention to whether there is a VfD notice on the page. A lot of VfD entries are being validly speedied (which is great, because it reduces the VfD load), but the Vfd pages aren't being closed. (The archive tags need to be inserted so they will show up on the subpage.) I'm grateful for the opportunity to artificially inflate my edits by closing these out, but it would be simpler if the deleting admin would make a special effort to close the VfD if they speedy a page with a VfD notice.

<p>I almost listed this for VfD, but thought I would get some further input from other users.

<dd>Any single <b>List of [insert your favorite religion/sexual orientation/political party here]</b> is relatively harmless. However, the information, unless the listing criterion is tied to the individuals listed in some substantive way, just doesn't belong in any encyclopedia.

<dd>There's a difference between warning a one-shot anonymous moron who inserts "PENIS" in an article and an editor who goes around making borderline edits, ticking off people, and attracting a host of others with vested interests in one thing or another in the process (and who is moreover happy to indulge them).</dd>
<dd>What you did was fine, but you could have done without dropping the v-word. Calling someone's edits vandalism (or "perilously close" to it), even if it's dead on the mark, will almost never get you an insightful or friendly response, so don't expect one. "You are wasting people's time when you do things like this: I don't like being left to clean up after you." We can sympathize, but you shouldn't be surprised when this gets you a hostile and thorougly unproductive response.</dd>
<dd>If you see a vandal, revert. Do you then also notify? It depends. For the "PENIS" variety, it's optional. Many admins don't feel like spending the time, others dutifully insert {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}} or other boilerplate in the hope that the vandal is a newbie who can get a clue. Recently I came across an IP who immediately started off inserting penis images in templates—this is quite obviously not a newbie, so I blocked the address without further ado. Even then it would probably have been better of me to put the blocked notice on the talk page, if only to stop others from wasting their time.</dd>
<dd>However, if you're reverting any edit from a registered account with a non-empty talk page, then you at least know this editor has been hanging around for a longer time. Not saying anything when reverting or using rollback should be reserved for absolutely clear-cut cases of vandalism, and even then you should at least ask what the hell is going on (paraphrased).</dd>
<dd>If you see someone doing something dubious or harmful, it is absolutely a good idea to inform them in addition to reverting. You should be prepared for any response, though. In the context of your remark (so it's not an incident report, whatever&#160;:-) I'd say you got the sort of response that could be expected. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 08:46, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When I am using the test templates for anonymous newbie vandals, I usually sign with ~~~~~ so there's a date stamp to help other Admins figure out the history but I am not <i>obviously</i> identified.

<p>I was going to say the very same thing; Stormie edit conflicted me. The test templates are always a good idea for vandalism cases, as are notes in general. While they may not get the editor to stop, it will certainly get them blocked faster. If I see a page full of warnings, I feel comfortable blocking. If I see an empty page, I feel the user should be warned rather than blocked, unless they are doing something particularly nasty. In most cases, warnings serve as a courtesy to others more than a courtesy to the user, as it makes our job much easier when we have to decide to hit the block button. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 09:13, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I suppose that the use of the phrase about "perilously close to vandalism" was a bad choice (though I still believe it was true). And I think in the future when I encounter this sort of thing, I'll usually just make an edit summary, not specifically leave a message on the user talk page. In this case, all it seems to have done is bring the person back promptly to re-assert most of his version, frivolous subheads and all. I'll be damned if I'm getting in an edit war over this, but I think the result is detrimental to the article. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 16:41, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can't decide where it is best to put this, so I'm putting it here, and if you think it must be moved, please do so. Tonight I made an error in judgment in refusing to promote Lucky 6.9 to admin (wiser heads soon prevailed and the promotion has occurred). I made this error by acting too hastily, and not considering fully all of the possibilities and elements involved in the decision. Afterwards, I reflected that "be bold" is clearly a poor guideline....I couldn't figure out why this principle is a foundation of Wikipedia when it has lead to many bad decisions here (and is seemingly increasingly invoked in defense of poor, hasty decision-making).</p>
<p>So I read the page and realized that this principle is used in the wrong context half the time, and I think admins should all remember it. The policy page is <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages</a>. <b>Updating pages</b>, mind you...not "in making administrative decisions". I imagine some of you will disagree with me, but I think the policy is written this way for a reason. In pursuit of accuracy, in a search for the right phrasing or article flow, in an attempt to add a cog to the great machine of Wikipedia, boldness is a virtue. Policy is silent, however, on the virtue of boldness when making decisions on deletion, blocks, protection, promotion of admins, etc. I think it is silent for a very good reason. I'm not pushing this on anyone else, but I know I personally will adopt Wikipedia:Be circumspect and thorough in acting as an administrator from now on, and I encourage others to join me.&#160;:-) My apologies once again to Lucky and the community for my initial poor judgment. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 07:31, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I half way agree with you. Certainly we shouldn't hand out blocks with the same forethought with which we correct typos. However, the purpose of that policy, to some extent, is that this is a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a>, and as such it's perfectly fine to learn by mistakes, since it's all reversible. In my view, the same basically holds true for admins (and bureaucrats). It's almost all reversible, and admin mistakes are even easier to spot and correct. Go easy on yourself, I doubt anyone faults you for what you did. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 08:10, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Admins wouldn't be elected if they didn't have common sense, and are expected to use it. As such, they can be bold if they know what they're doing, and we have enough community and mechanisms to call them back if they're going to far (such as the three recent RFCs on admin actions). Usually they come to realize they were wrong and apologize, as JWR just did, and I think that's good behavior.

<p>I appreciate vandals, socks, trolls, and wackos are a problem, and I have no problem <i>whatever</i> with admins blocking them. In cases where an IP has a history of problem edits, I don't have any problem with long (weeks or even months) blocks. I appreciate that some users can change IPs easily, and I don't have any objection to appropriately applied rangeblocks. I'm not questioning the rationales of any of these blocks; I trust you guys. I don't mind at all if the people who were the intended targets of these blocks can never edit wikipedia again, and suffer horrid bowel spasms if they even think about Wikipedia. I'm only concerned about legitimate users (ongoing and particularly future) who may be affected by these blocks.</p>
<p>All of these blocks seem to me to be placed under a fallacious principle: we know MrBad can change IPs fairly easily, yet we permanently block IPs that we know he isn't using any more.</p>
<p>I just can't see the sense in this at all. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 23:47, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See also the recent blurb I posted, though it's mostly about ISP proxies. In most cases, indefinite IP blocks are indeed pointless and potentially harmful. Just don't do it; it will rarely keep the vandal out and can hit innocents. Only major rotten elements with static IP addresses should be considered for this "honor". <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 00:01, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was a conversation on IRC about this last night; I was trying to determine the status of an IP which was eventually determined to be a static IP. Perhaps in cases where the IP was determined to be static it would be helpful for the blocking admin to include a "static IP" note in the block summary? -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 02:29, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The big problem here is determining what is "static" or "dynamic".

<dd>Even "static" IPs may be re-assigned, if for example the original user changes ISP and a new user gets it. "Indefinite" blocks are a bad idea. Blocks of say 6m or a year as a maximum would be plenty. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 21:25, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not even that. Long-term blocking IPs (proxies excepted) is simply a very bad idea. One week tops. It might feel good to put a long period of time in the box - but potentially blocking legit users is something that should be avoided. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDan100_803a.html" title="User talk:Dan100">Talk)</a> 20:17, August 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're a little new to realize how persistent some vandals can be. Long blocks (up to a year on IP's) in confirmed cases is the best practice, but avoiding them for borderline cases is best too of course. A truly legitimate user would simply request that the IP be unblocked. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 18:08, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What should be done with an IP which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolves to a hostname that can be found on google to belong to a shared web hosting</li>
<li>When accessed with a normal web browser, returns a <a href="../../../c/p/a/CPanel_3fbf.html" title="CPanel">cPanel</a> page, which also shows it belongs to a shared web hosting</li>
<li>Has only ever edited a single article, known to be the focus of a user blocked for malicious editing and 3RR block violations</li>
<li>Its edits to said article have the same POV as the user cited above</li>
<li>When said user has used at least ten different open proxies in the last couple of days, all being of the "CGI proxy" variety (while ordinary proxies can be uncovered simply by telnetting to the right port, with "CGI proxies" you have to go to a URL; for instance, <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymizer.html" title="Anonymizer">Anonymizer</a>)</li>
<li>I cannot find definite proof is really an open proxy (like an open proxy interface on some site on that IP address, or an open proxy interface which uses that IP to access external sites, or something like that)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm in doubt if all that is enough to block an IP address for being an open proxy, even if it's hard to believe a normal user (which happens to edit just like the mentioned user) would use a shared web hosting <i>server</i> to edit Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 00:25, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>nmap wouldn't help at all. The user in question has been using CGI proxies, which all work off a normal web server. The shared web host in question has, of course, a web server. But unless I get the proxy's URL, I cannot prove it's also an open proxy. It would be possible, if I somehow managed to get a list of all the domains on the server, to look it up on google, but I believe that's not something publicly available.</dd>

<p><a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> and I have been facing a curious problem in <a href="../../../r/o/h/Rohingya.html" title="Rohingya">Rohingya</a>, which I describe below.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate if you look into the mess created in the article <a href="../../../r/o/h/Rohingya.html" title="Rohingya">Rohingya</a>. This is quite an interesting issue; a few months ago, I removed the copyvio and then organized the article into sections and cleaned up the links. For some reason, several anon editors in the block 212.138.47.* seem to take offence at my "touching" "their" article, and started vandalizing my user/talk pages. Some of these vandals were blocked by other admins.</p>
<p>Last week, these vandals created several sockpuppet accounts, including Antirajib (<a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntirajib_f229.html" title="User talk:Antirajib">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Antirajib_6dae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Antirajib">contribs</a>). You can see from the account name what its purpose was. The user vandalized my user/talk pages besides leaving abusive comments. The user was blocked immediately.</p>
<p>Yesterday and today, there has been a parade of sockpuppets all directed at either launching personal attacks, or avoiding <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a>. You can find several incoherent rants in <a href="../../../r/o/h/Talk%7ERohingya_53b7.html" title="Talk:Rohingya">Talk:Rohingya</a>, my talk (<a href="../../../r/a/g/User_talk%7ERagib_5643.html" title="User talk:Ragib">User talk:Ragib</a> and Mel's talk <a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis">User talk:Mel Etitis</a>. The language constructs and the irrational attitude ("how-dare-I-touch-their-article-being-a-Bengali" etc) points out a single user behind all these.</p>
<p>I find the following accounts as sockpuppets of the same vandal from the ip block 212.138.47.*, especially (212.138.47.13/14/15/16/17/18/21).</p>

</ul>
<p>I urge everyone to take a look at the page history, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rohingya&amp;curid=1918632&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rohingya&amp;curid=1918632&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rohingya&amp;curid=1918632&amp;action=history</a> . This is not even a dispute over content! I have not added or deleted any content other than the initial copyvio. I simply organized the article with sections, and cleaned up the external links. One of the links point to a blog, which the vandals ferociously object to as being termed a blog. I've gotten literally tired of the abuse these vandals launched on me. The level of racial and personal abuse is quite hard to take. The sockpuppets have gone to the length of, a) accusing me and Mel to be sockpuppets, b) accusing us of abuse of admin power (which we have NOT used at all) c) Leaving racial slurs in my talk page/<a href="../../../r/o/h/Talk%7ERohingya_53b7.html" title="Talk:Rohingya">Talk:Rohingya</a>, commenting on my national origin. Since it would be a conflict of interest in my part to take actions against these vandals, I would request you to look into this issue and decide.</p>
