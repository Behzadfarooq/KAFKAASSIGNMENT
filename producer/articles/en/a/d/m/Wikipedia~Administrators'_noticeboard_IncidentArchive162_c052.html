<p>A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>both "users" seem to be interested in where I live.</li>
<li>both "users" are obsessed with the fact that I'm <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic.html" title="Agnostic">agnostic</a></li>
<li>Kumarator posted "Jai Hind" at the end of one of his comments,the same word this "second user" has used for a user name.</li>
<li>This "new user" seems to know quite a bit about adding templates to his page for a "new user" as he claims to be.</li>
<li>The "new user" hasn't really contributed except for attacking me.</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/u/m/User%7EKumarnator_0da6.html" title="User:Kumarnator">User:Kumarnator</a> is one of the few people that edited his user page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jai_Hind%2C_Jai_Bharat&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jai_Hind%2C_Jai_Bharat&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jai_Hind%2C_Jai_Bharat&amp;action=history</a></li>

<p>I can't tell for sure if it's fake or real, but what I can say is that if it <i>is</i> a fake, it's a <i>damn</i> good one, and someone must've spent a significant amount of time getting the details (such as paper translucency) right. If it's a fake and whoever faked it is reading this, congratulations! However, a rather different issue is that the image file contains a JPEG comment saying "Copyright 2006. All rights reserved." Given that someone must've deliberately inserted that comment there, I would take the uploader's GFDL-self claim with a <i>very</i> large grain of salt. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 00:30, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since people are apparently curious to know the truth - no, the picture is not a fake. After the closing ceremonies of Wikimania 2006, as people were leaving, I had an idea - I wanted to win the Wikitruth scavenger hunt. So I got everyone who hadn't left together, called Jimbo's cell (he was in his hotel room about to take a nap) and told him to come back to the auditorium pronto. We posed for photos (Greg Maxwell took the one here) and everyone did laugh very hard. (If any Wikitruthers are listening - I WON YOUR CONTEST) I also got Jimbo on video saying "tell the Wikitruth" and (to get even more wikitruth scavenger hunt points) "Tell the Wikitruth, dammit!" Afterwards, we all went out for dinner. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 07:24, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This last block of CltFn's for 3RR is his sixteenth block in his time here at Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:CltFn" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:CltFn" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. His last block before that was for 2 weeks for a pattern of edit warring with no sign of stopping. After that block, CltFn sent me an email indicating he intended to turn over a new leaf, and so I removed the sockpuppet tag from his user page and let him start over. He didn't though; the disruptive behavior continues. He has, since then, continued to engage in edit warring especially on the same old articles. His current block for 3RR on <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat_Ye%27or_8c52.html" title="Bat Ye'or">Bat Ye'or</a> is almost a year after is first block for 3RR in that article. I'm convinced that he absolutely will never change his ways, that his disruptive behavior is a serious drain on the community and good editors that have to deal with it, and that sixteen blocks is many more than enough to exhaust the community's patience. Consequently, I've extended the block to indefinite, but this action is, of course, up for review. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 10:51, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>3RR is one of the many infractions CltFn has committed. NPOV violations, edit warring non-stop, sockpuppetry (see his sock <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmenra_4591.html" title="User:Amenra">User:Amenra</a>), copyvio, personal attacks, harassing admin.

</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm not sure what you're suggesting we <i>should</i> do, as <i>not</i> blocking him when he engages is revert warring doesn't strike me as likely to be a worthwhile strategy. Absent a suggestion for a better way to handle CltFn, I endorse blocking him indefinitely—until such time as we admins get our acts together and develop tools for allowing him to edit productively. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 16:29, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Though it's moot (he's already blocked) as one of the previous blocking admins, I endorse this block as well. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">RyanG</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">rbil10</a><small><a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanGerbil10_836d.html" title="User talk:RyanGerbil10">(Упражнение В!)</a></small> 20:11, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Have you even looked at the videos you delink? In the Barrington Hall case, the video is not some talking head talking about Barrington Hall, it's a video of the actual building; it is by its very nature, a reliable source. The restriction on personal websites, besides being controversial (see the WP:EL talk) is also a <b>guideline</b> to the potential reliability of a link. The guideline is titled "Links <b>normally</b> to be avoided". It does not read "Links <b>always</b> to be avoided". The guideline assumes (not entirely justifiably) that in the "normal" case, most personal web pages are not reliable sources, but it does not ban such links.</dd>

<dd>MOST links on wikipedia to YouTube should be removed. (Yeah, not all... but most). It is not ok to copy a music video, upload it to YouTube and add a link to it from an article. That’s copyright infringement and that’s basically what 9 out of 10 YouTube links on wikipedia are.

<dd>We have two problems, first we cannot be sure that whoever uploaded the video is actually the person who shot the video, making it so we cannot confirm copyright status. The goal is more then just not being liable, but on building an encyclopedia with content that anyone can use freely. The other problem is blanket rules being applied blindly. Considering some publishers and people have put work on YouTube, to state that everything on it is copyright and can be removed is also false and quite disruptive. Those who decide to take up the task to remove an item need to research it and find out who made it as best they can and if it was put on YouTube as an advertisement etc. If the person is not willing to do this correctly then they should not do it at all. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 17:43, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, there is no verifiable information to show that the uploading user is in fact the copyright holder of the footage.

<dd>I can't speak for anyone else involved in the YouTube cleanup project, but I review the link in the context of the article. If it looks obvious (like, 10 min clip from The A-Team) then I nuke it(WP:C). If it's redundant to other links, I nuke it(WP:EL). If it's irrelevant to the article(WP:NOT), I nuke it. If it doesn’t provide any new information for the article I nuke it(WP:NOT). If it's being inappropriately relied on as a source, I nuke it(WP:V). If it's not obviously inappropriate, I look closer. I've found very few that are truly legit. The best I can usually get is "likely legit." So I leave... 1/50 usually... and I'm the most liberal of the 4 of us.</dd>

<p>I left a talk message for User:Mahlenmahlen who supposedly made the Barrington video, suggesting s/he GFDL the video and upload it to Commons, but that user hasn't logged in for a while so might not see it soon. I think the video is of interest for the article. It documents the subject and it provides a unique resource beyond what the article would contain once it becomes a featured article (<a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>). There isn't a serious WP:RS concern since as someone explained, it's a video of the building itself, like a photo of the White House. I didn't notice anyone questioning anything about its content, just that it's hosted in a "ghetto".</p>
<p>I'm not a YT fan but I don't believe there should be any type of project to remove every YT link from Wikipedia blindly, since that's what the spam blacklist is for. There are occasional situations where they're appropriate and the deletion frenzy seems to be a bit much. We import suitably licensed pictures from Flickr etc. all the time without going berserk about verifying the licenses unless we have some reason to think something is amiss. We similarly allow totally anonymous contributors to insert potentially-copyvio text directly into the wiki. We should not link to known copyvios but we are also not in the business of finding every way we can to protect the interests of the MPAA.

<p>There is no project to remove YouTube links blindly. A bot could be made to do that, but AWB is not a bot, it is a program designed for user oversight. Any editor removing links for it is responsible for what they remove. Having said that, the video in question <i>still</i> has no licensing information, so, while I'm not interested in arguing about it, and while I'm not going to make any reverts myself, I don't mind it being delinked. I'm not going to waste much time on this single link, though. The bigger problem is blatant copyvio like music, TV, and movie clips, of which there are probably still thousands on Wikipedia. Attacking the project to help that is counterproductive, especially for one borderline case. Giving vandalism warnings for it is offensive and uncivil, and will probably get you blocked if you continue. Part of the problem I've noticed is people who respond with an argument like "no one's going to sue us or we're not legally responsible for linking to copyright infringements"; no matter how true this is, it is absolutely opposed to the Wikimedia vision, to create reusable and <i>free</i> (as in speech, not beer) content. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>•<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:33, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe you are being willfully obtuse if you believe that "(t)here is no project to remove YouTube links blindly."

But most is not <b>all</b>, and your project is encouraging people to remove <b>all</b> YouTube links, without any checking.

<p>...you are <i>way</i> out of line talking to Argyriou that way. First of all, his vandal warning was clearly given in good faith. Bringing the issue here is precisely what he should have done, and also done in good faith, not "pointing out incivility." Moreover, you are not The Arbiter of civility (and I have personally noticed Argyriou to be more civil than I have noticed you to be). Last but not least, it is a <i>gross</i> failure to AGF to decide that you will ignore a reasonable request/refuse to engage in reasonable discussion "as an authority" because of something you have decided someone did in a previous conversation (i.e., if Argyriou had been <i>blocked</i> and returned, that would not be sufficient reason to render any reasonable edit he made "ignorable," now or in the future, as you are well aware.) The fact that the whole YT issue is something in which you are very subjectively over-enagaged makes this much worse, in my opinion. This is the second time I have observed you to be rude and threatening to someone over YT, and I believe that you may be so ill-equipped to objectively assess any situations in which YT is involved that you should recuse yourself from acting as anadmin with regards to YT disagreements.

<li>Hold your horses right there, buddy! CNN, BBC, New York Times *hold* the rights to the content they host on their pages. Either they secure the contents (media files, pictures etc.) by the way of journalism or by providing the appropriate remuneration to the original holder of copyrights. Many of such news agencies have general tie-ups with other news agencies such as <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reuters.html" title="Reuters">Reuters</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> etc. In this way, we are properly accrediting them with their work, hence none of the copyrights are breached. The case is not the same yourself with "YouTube – Broadcast Yourself", any person with an internet connection has the ability to upload any kind of media, without seeking any kind of permission. Although, YouTube discourages uploading copyrighted videos of any kind.

<li>seems like there's a lot of resistance from contributors to your policy. is there no way we can challenge what we view as overly conservative policies? why not assume good faith w/ the linkers and remove only the links that are proven to be copy vios? u are basically convicting based on the assumption of guilt rather than the assumption of innocence. moving away from the copy vio issues, if u're talking about reliability, all the information from the liquid and glowsticking articles can't be easily verified from published sources b/c they are, by nature, underground activities performed by a smallish group of ppl. the videos linked in those articles is about as concrete evidence as you're going to find as to their existance. all other evidence exists in the form of forum posts on various streetdance websites. why not just go ahead and remove those articles completely since contributors can't find a source that's reliable? the reasons given by <a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpartaz_4c0a.html" title="User talk:Spartaz">User_talk:Spartaz</a> for keeping the <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquid_dancing.html" title="Liquid dancing">liquid</a> videos while removing the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glowsticking.html" title="Glowsticking">glowsticking</a> video is completely arbitrary.

<li>Nick, there is no reason to believe that Mahlenmahlen is not as he claims the copyright owner of the film. If we followed your logic, we would have to delete nearly every user-made free-licensed photo in Wikipedia, since there is no way to <i>prove</i> that the user actually made the image instead of stealing it. Tell me how these two cases are different:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>A wire story owned by the AP is hosted on the CNN website, per an agreement between the AP and CNN, and Wikipedia links to it;</li>
<li>A video owned by Mahlenmahlen is hosted on the YouTube website, per an agreement between Mahlenmahlen and YouTube, and Wikipedia links to it.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>So since we accept on faith, absent reasonable evidence to the contrary, MahlenMahlen's claim of authorship of the video (just as we accept on faith the claims of authorship on user-made Commons images) and since there is no difference between the two examples above, your proposal is inconsistent. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 19:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We, on Wikipedia do not assume things. The law does not assume or make any kind of presumptions. Please see my comments below. When we upload an image on Wikipedia, and if it is any kind of copyright violation, we treat it as plagiarism – and the user gets blocked along with his IP (in cases of long-term abuse). This happens when some other entity claims that they hold the copyright over the works. Ask Mahlenmahlen to assert on this <i>YouTube</i> page that that those are his contributions and that he has no objection for their usage anywhere in anyform. — <a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_ae26.html" title="User talk:Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington"><font color="black"><b>Nearly Headless Nick</b></font></a> 10:07, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are still asking for a standard in excess of what the law and Wikipedia policy requires. For <b>links</b> to external content, Wikipedia must not <b>knowingly</b> link to material which is in violation of copyright. To protect Wikipedia from the copyright lawyers, I'm happy with a policy which requires delinking to things which a reasonable person would infer are violations of copyright - major media outlets don't give away their rights, and anything from a major studio or tv network or major record label which appears on YouTube is likely to be copyvio, and any reasonable person would know that. However, there is a large class of "small-time" content producers who are willing to allow free distribution of their content, most of the time because the exposure to people who might give them paid work in the future is worth more than the (probably zero) income they could obtain from their productions marketed on their own. Such content appearing on YouTube is not something which a reasonable person would infer is automatically copyvio, and therefore does not violate the DCMA or Wikipedia policy, until someone reliably asserts that the linked material is copyvio.</dd>

<p>Per discussion at EL, it should be a <i>user conduct</i> RFC against Nearly Headless Nick, Dmcdevit et al.

<dd>Cindery, would you mind letting the RfC <i>on the issue</i> proceed to some conclusion first? And then waiting a bit to see whether user conduct conforms to that consensus? Who knows, by then the conflict might be over.</dd>
</dl>
<p>...the conflict has dragged on FAR past the point that it is a gross disruption which is harming Wikipedia, wasting huge amounts of time with circular evasive arguments.

<dd>Otherwise, certainly nothing prevents you from filing your own RfC on user conduct right now, without asking Argyriou to withdraw his issue-oriented RfC... but I think reviewers might hesitate to judge conduct by compliance or non-compliance with a guideline still being discussed. <small>– <a href="../../../s/a/j/User%7ESAJordan_b760.html" title="User:SAJordan"><i>SAJordan</i></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/j/User_talk%7ESAJordan_266c.html" title="User talk:SAJordan">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SAJordan_0c1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/SAJordan">contribs</a></sub> <i>07:03, 22 Dec 2006 (UTC).</i></small></dd>
<dd>Before you start accusing other editors of poor conduct I suggest that you review your recent contributions and ask yourself whether you are entirely blameless yourself.

<p>Whatever, spaz. "My style is intentional" means "I am rightfully pissed off and grossed out "--and, I am rightfully pissed off/grossed out.

<dd>Its not harrassment to drop you a note drawing your attention to a criticism I made about your your agressive tone and uncivil comments. Its actually good manners because I think its really bad form to criticise people behind their back. If you check J.smith's talk page you will see that offered to help out with the link review campaign after he asked for a review at AN.

<p>Note that I am not the only person who thinks I should be annoyed, and that the annoyance is justified. You have been told: "the way you are conducting the porject seems designed to cause upset, and you should desist and apologize." Re mytalkpage, you <i>repeatedly</i> posted after I asked you to stop. And: read convo between Barberio and JSmith at the pump re whether discussions at AN/IRC are "consensus" to proceed. Answer is: no. The problem with you is that you were <i>already involved</i> in deleting when you posted in response to my first ANI complaint re the project--you said, hmmm, as long as the links are being checked, I don't see a problem with this. Instead of: I am actively deleting these links, and might have a reason to be defensive about it--that foreclosed open/honest discussion/my trust in you.

<p>At the recommendation of admin <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve Block</a>, I'm asking on behalf of <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">User:CovenantD</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">User:Doczilla</a>, other editors and myself who have tried many times and ways to talk and work with a persistent rogue editor, <a href="../../../a/s/g/User%7EAsgardian_37db.html" title="User:Asgardian">User:Asgardian</a>, over his repeated wholesale reversions to several sites in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_b2cf.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics">WikiProject: Comics</a>. He insists he doesn't have to follow the comics <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_exemplars_601d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics/exemplars">project exemplar</a>, he reinserts misspellings and other erroneous edits, he removes authoritative reference sources that I and others have used and cited, and he won't give straight answers to our questions and comments.</p>
<p>There's some discussion about all this at <a href="../../../a/w/e/Talk%7EAwesome_Android_%28comics%29_9b3e.html" title="Talk:Awesome Android (comics)">this article's talk page</a>. There <i>had</i> been much more criticism of his edits at <a href="../../../a/s/g/User_talk%7EAsgardian_36b6.html" title="User talk:Asgardian">User talk:Asgardian</a> — with other editors complaining about his clumsy wholesale edits of <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactus.html" title="Galactus">Galactus</a> and other articles — <i>but he erases all comments.</i></p>
<p>Could you suggest a way to go on this? Maybe have a third party compare, for instance, the properly formatted and written version of the short "Awesome Android" article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Awesome_Android_%28comics%29&amp;oldid=93264597" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Awesome_Android_%28comics%29&amp;oldid=93264597" rel="nofollow">here</a> and Asgardian's consistently reverted, "nyah-nyah-nyah" version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Awesome_Android_%28comics%29&amp;oldid=93337888" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Awesome_Android_%28comics%29&amp;oldid=93337888" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Just by skimming, not needing to know details of the character, the differences are obvious to the naked eye.</p>
<p>As you can see from these comments he erased from his talk page and retrieved from its History <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Asgardian&amp;oldid=92465904" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Asgardian&amp;oldid=92465904" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Asgardian&amp;oldid=84962421" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Asgardian&amp;oldid=84962421" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Asgardian&amp;oldid=90912078" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Asgardian&amp;oldid=90912078" rel="nofollow">here</a>, other editors have tried to speak with him about his wholesale reversions that go against both consensus and editorial policy/guidelines/exemplar. The word "stubborn" comes up a lot in these posts. Several editors are at their wits' ends.</p>
<p>What can we do? Please help us: Dealing with him is taking up so much of so many people's times that could be put to good use writing and helping to improve Wikipedia articles.

<dd>Sometimes he responds. It's sporadic. Sometimes he takes a lesson to heart when it's explained in great detail. Sometimes. And sometimes he just repeatedly blows off style guidelines no matter how many people disagree with him. I first got drawn into his mess because someone else in WikiProject Comics begged for people to come take a peek and try to help find a way to resolve Asgardian's relentless edit wars over the Thor articles. At that point, he'd only been at it for a month. I think it's been three months now, fighting the same edit wars. See how he stubbornly insists on reverting <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hercules_%28Marvel_Comics%29_0bd5.html" title="Hercules (Marvel Comics)">Hercules (Marvel Comics)</a> to tightly in-universe perspective. One night I spent hours trying to edit his version bit by bit to give him a chance, then he just redid all the same mistakes and guideline violations. It wears you out. So many of us got so tired so long ago of fixing his edits that we just can't devote the energy to selectively keeping his good edits when he makes so many bad ones, therefore a lot of people have to revert articles even when it means reinserting some problems he'd fixed because he did more damage than good. Several of us repeatedly advised him to make one edit at a time so he could learn from each. It's just bizarre. There are now at least two competing versions getting edited, bouncing back and forth for almost every article he keeps hitting. He has some good information. He makes some good edits. He's just so amazingly stubborn.</dd>

<dd>He got warned about 3RR. He got blocked for violating 3RR. I saw other times I could have reported him for violating 3RR after that, but chose not to because I really was trying to find a way to work with this intelligent, knowledgeable person despite how aggravating it could be. He deleted WikiProject Comics notices about his edit wars until I warned him very strongly that to do so was deceptive when he knew darn well that edit wars were going on. Lately he hasn't been as overtly contentious. Lately he simply hasn't been replying to people as often. Admittedly, a lot of us have given up on explaining all of our fixes to his edits when we've already offered the same explanations repeatedly. I still think there's hope for him. I really do, based on the times he has learned lessons, but after this much time, I question whether he's worth the effort because he creates so much work for so many people voluntarily helping edit Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 02:52, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>He isn't responding (well, severely unresponsive) to light methods of behavior correction.</li>

<dd>He's doing no good and shows an obvious disinterest in collaborative efforts.

<dd>I stumbled across this user's edit war with Covenant D over the <i>Thor</i> comics articles about two months ago. Sadly, since that time, I have seen little progress, only regression. The edit war still continues and has expanded to other comics articles. I reported the disputed articles on the WikiComics Project notice board in order to get more people involved and, ideally, settle the dispute. However, rather than trying to work toward consensus, he erased my notice. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Comics/Notice_Board&amp;diff=85180514&amp;oldid=85178987" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Comics/Notice_Board&amp;diff=85180514&amp;oldid=85178987" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> I know that we have to assume good faith, but actions like this strain credulity. Nonetheless, I have tried to work out compromises by changing problem sections within disputed articles in a piecemeal fashion, rather than a wholesale reversion. Initially, this seemed to be effective, but things eventually degenerated back into blind edit warring with little to no discussion. Occasionally, he will justify his edits on an article's talk page, but he is more likely to ignore or erase requests for discussion. When he does comment on talk pages, he is frequently incivil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Galactus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91735981" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Galactus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91735981" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CovenantD&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91737693" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CovenantD&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91737693" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Shoester&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87303342" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Shoester&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87303342" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> and more than a little combative. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Shoester&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88737505" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Shoester&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88737505" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Brian_Boru_is_awesome&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=84964873" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Brian_Boru_is_awesome&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=84964873" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> Sadly, he actually makes some valid points in his arguements, but they are all but lost in the edit wars he provokes. Like Doczilla, I, too, had hope for Asgardian. But that hope is fading. --GentlemanGhost 08:57, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The posters here assume a great deal and present a fairly weak case. On behaviour, their own has been self-righteous and condescending on more than one occasion. Citing users such as CovenantD is also not a good idea given his track record and some of the comments he has made (such as "as long as that silly list appears, it gets reverted"). As for deleting comments on my user page, what of it? At least two of the persons cited do it all the time - as is their right. As for the argument that I am lowering the quality of the articles - I believe that's a very silly thing to say. They both know I have <b>created</b> over half a dozen sourced entries on characters that did not exist. Not for my benefit, but for the everyone's use and enjoyment. I have also added references and tidied up many, many more. They KNOW some of the entries were a mess prior to the fix. Rather, we are tussling over fine grammatical points, NOT revised articles per se (example - much of the Thor article is my version).</li>
</ul>
<p>On co-operation - the posters here seem to have missed the discussion on Galactus, another comic character. I trimmed it back to an acceptable length, and was acknowledged by some as being quite good. Others responded with petulant insults. It is here that many posters fail - it is NOT about who knows more but the enjoyment factor, and of course presenting the information within a "Wiki context." I then offered another poster a chance at presenting his version of the Galactus article. I don't think he's been able to repost yet, but true to my word I've stayed off the page until he has had his chance and we can then discuss it. If that's not co-operation, I don't know what is.</p>
<p>As for 3RR, the first time was simply an experiment. I wanted to see if Wikiepdia followed through (I wrote a paper on Wikipedia and procedues). The second time I believe the moderator got it wrong - I was editing and improving on an article, not swapping backwards and forwards three times or more times. I explained this and simply received a "you should know better." I actually expect better from a moderator.</p>
<p>I am happy to discuss this, but there needs to be more objectivity and less exaggeration. At present, some of the argument smacks of "X must be stopped!" and is a tad immature. The fact that certain users have followed me to pages they had never previously visited speaks volumes (or those that I've created). There needs to be a little less "my way or the highway" from everyone, not just myself.</p>
<p>I won't be making any edits for the next fews day or so, but would hope that when I do that a discussion can follow - not a simple revert and complaint. They are simple grammatical issues that can be thrashed out courtesy of the Exemplars. So long as people are reasonable and a little less self-righteous, then a compromise can be achieved. I'll start with a topic over there in about two days and hopefully some positive change can come of it.</p>

<li>Re: "As for deleting comments on my user page, what of it? At least two of the persons cited do it all the time - as is their right." Actually, I stopped deleting comments on my talk page because a remark someone else made on your talk page made me realize that wasn't how Wikipedia does things. (I'd thought of it like deleting old e-mail. Somehow I'd missed that Wikipedia policy along the way.) The one exception to this in the last several weeks was to revert a heading Asgardian should not have added to my note about my own talk page. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 06:31, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wait a minute. It just hit me: Asgardian, you just said you deliberately violated 3RR as an experiment while writing a paper. You're not editing much this week because you're taking finals, aren't you? Did you start these edit wars <i>as an "experiment"?</i> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 06:40, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's it, isn't it? That would explain the thing that has baffled me beyond all else about you. Why else would anyone spend three months making nearly two thousand edits (seriously) on the same bunch of articles over and over, editing, reverting, defying Wikipedia guidelines, reverting, and reverting without branching out and taking an interest in other articles any more than you have? <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 09:08, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Three editors here and a larger number throughout the affected Talk pages are all corroborating the extent and the nature of Asgardian's behavior. I don't know if he's been behaving as he has for purposes of some Sociology or Media class project, but it's extremely unfair to let him continue when so many responsible editors are spending so much time and effort on him. I don't want to give up on the Comics Project, but all it takes for his kind of behavior to flourish is for good Administrators to stand by and do nothing. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 22:28, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The comments are still somewhat self-righteous and quite a few assumptions have been made once again. I suggest more discussion on character pages where needed. Have there been any reverts of late? No. Cooperation? Yes - see Galactus. Some of the articles mentioned still need work (eg. Awesome Android) and some will also have to accept that a touch up is inevitable. I'll start with an Exemplar discussion today as some of the "accepted" features need to be readdressed. See you there.</li>

<p>"Have there been any reverts of late? No." How can you say that? Here's the most immediate example of how that's just not true: Your last four edits before this noticeboard report were all reverts.</p>

<p>Yes, this is an Admin Board, and this information is for the benefit of whichever admin looks at this because they'll be unfamiliar with what you've been doing, even though I've worded these newest remarks in second person to Asgardian. I say them to you because part of me still hopes you'll work with other editors (remember, I personally made sure you knew about this so you could contribute to this discussion), even though experience says how stubborn you are about not taking other people's remarks to heart. I haven't forgotten your edits. I know you've reworked a lot of things, and I've tried to incorporate your better changes to see if you'd accept that as the compromise you mention further above, but you just don't back off. You've kept reverting and kept reverting for three months. You've got your own version of each of those articles. Someone reverts your version, other people edit, you revert back to your own version, it gets edited, it gets reverted. Notice how many different people have been reverting away from your version. You're the single person repeatedly reverting back to your version in spite of all the reasons people have outlined over the last three months regarding what's wrong with your changes. Yes, some of the edits in your versions still need to be added to the version everyone else is working on. I've entered some of your edits into the other version of some articles and I've left some for you, hoping you'd start working with the other regular contributors to those articles. It's just not working. If you really want a compromise, act on the suggestion that several of us have made: Make one edit at a time and learn from other people's responses to them. There have been good edits I'd have backed you up on if you hadn't made twelve bad edits at the same time.

<p>So let us begin with Exemplars. One final observation I will make is that the more serious contributors seem to fall into two groups - those that focus on technical edits, and those that contribute creative edits (I'd be the latter. I'll let anyone else reading decide what camp they sit in). Marrying the two together seems to be the challenge, which is not always easy. <a href="../../../a/s/g/User%7EAsgardian_37db.html" title="User:Asgardian">Asgardian</a> 07:00, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I find it interesting that when you refuse to follow the consensus or the exemplars, you dismiss it as a "technical edit".

<li>I have to disagree.</li>

<p>"Erroneous" is an assumption on your part. Analysis of many of the comic entries shows that some contribute via a technical "dotting the i's and crossing the t's" edit, while others are creative and may rewrite or create an entire new entry. Edit Histories will show this. It is certainly not a "nonexistant" line - people are different, and their contributions will also differ accordingly. Neither is better than the other, making your claim that it was ever a "futile attempt to demean other editors" a tad ridiculous. As for marrying the two together, not so easy with the comic entries. There's often a greal deal of passion involved but not as much logic. Just study the entry for Thor. It took months to get that article to the standard it is at now. People with pet fetishes, people wanting it to look like a fan site, people insisting such and such happened in issue X and so on. <a href="../../../a/s/g/User%7EAsgardian_37db.html" title="User:Asgardian">Asgardian</a> 06:48, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

The last time it went three days (two whole calendar days) without edits was also when Asgardian refrained from immediately undoing someone else's reversion of his work. That just happens to be the only page my watch list includes from Asgardian's edit war list. I expect this phenomenon can be found on other pages he has kept at. This illustrates what I have kept saying about how much work Asgardian creates for other people. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 07:28, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You make a good point and a not so good point. The "fictional" issue needs more discussion over at Exemplars (after all, of course Thor is fictional!) as do 1-2 other terms that aren't too clear. As for creating "work" for other people, you again sounding a tad self-righteous. Please remember no one owns Wikipedia, and that some changes are inevitable.

<p>For me, yeah, it is just a hobby (more like a habit), one I wish I'd spend less time on. Its being a hobby is a strong reason not to make waves (or at least not massive tidal waves), a reason to defer the exemplars, policies, and guidelines set by those who devote more serious time to it and to the consensus of contributors in general. If I disagree with an exemplar, etc., I shouldn't inflict my will on the articles. I should investigate the logic behind them and then, if I still disagree, I should discuss changing the exemplar. I'm puzzled by Asgardian's talking about the exemplar talk pages here when we've previously told him to take up these issues over there and yet he continues reverting to versions for which he has been repeatedly informed that they violate the Wikipedia way of doing things. Are you saying that you will now only take up these issues at the exemplar talk pages? Are you promising that you will finally stop making changes that you have been told violate the exemplars, policies, and style guidelines set by consensus? And beyond that, what about non-policy/exemplar-related changes you want to make that umpteen other people disagree with? Doczilla 01:23, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Why don't you contribute to the Exemplar discussion I've started? Two others are participating and some progress has already been made on an issue. Also, Tenebrae - I am not demeaning your contribution when I say "hobby" , but in all fairness we have all gone a tad too far before now. I am the first to admit this. Yes, Wikipedia is important in it's way, but it is not life and death when we are arguing over whether Thor has super speed or not. There is also someone who to judge by their entries sits in front of the computer hour after hour, watching for the slightest change. Condemn me if you will, but I believe that is going too far. In fact, in the interests of OH &amp; S perhaps users should only be able to tweak a finite no. of entries in 24 hrs? It may help reduce edit wars and sometimes, obsession (another Wiki-related sin). Anyway, a good thread has been started at Exemplars. See you there.</li>

<p>I've also encountered User:Asgardian, and typically in the middle of a reversion war of some kind (<a href="../../../r/a/d/Radioactive_Man_%28Marvel_Comics%29_ca45.html" title="Radioactive Man (Marvel Comics)">Radioactive Man</a>, for example). I have to agree that the user has added quite a lot of information to Wikipedia (the quality of which, I'll leave to others to determine). To give some benefit of the doubt, attempting to ascertain who's doing what is often difficult because often those who he is in reversion war with do <i>not</i> use edit summaries, or he and they may use the edit summaries to merely attack each other, (which still does not describe the edits in question. and in most of these cases, rather than discuss on the talk page of the article in question, it often becomes a multiple user talk page assault. Imo a <b>LOT</b> of this disruption would be averted if both sides would recall that <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">being bold</a> also means not being disruptive. I think a potential solution (if wanted), would be to suggest that if someone has an issue with a change, a single reversion, with a suggestion that both (and any other interested parties) begin a <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> discussion on the article's talk page.

<li>Why would we abandon this dialogue? It has actually been quite useful. There have been a few candid admissions from several posters. I've also made no edits for the duration of this dialogue and created a discussion at Exemplars. You also seem to be overlooking the number of articles I've created. I'm going to raising issues on the appropriate discussion boards where I feel it necessary, but beyond that will not play with the agree structure. That said, some creative changes (eg. images, reworking information) are permissible and indeed expected - and can be discussed, rather than being a source of outrage. I also believe that using the term "obsessive" is dangerous and a two-edged sword. There are several posters who have been a tad obsessive from time to time, not just myself. I suppose it is the nature of the hobby.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, I find the suggestion of a ban to be premature. I also have to say that I am concerned that someone who professes an interest in comics on their homepage chooses to get involved. Given that the subject matter is comic-related, objectivity cannot be guaranteed.</p>

Given the history, though, we need some strong assurance. One week of backing off (a week when Asgardian had already said he wouldn't be editing much), well . . . it isn't a lot to judge by when weighed against three months of edit wars, is it? I would certainly support a ban IF that mess resumed. His apparent lack of humility (telling other people to be smarter, calling other people self-righteous or rash when his repeated edits have worn out their civility, lack of acknowledging that he has been pushy no matter how many people oppose his edits) can make it hard to want to work with him. If we were going straight to a ban, though, I'm not sure why he'd have been given the opportunity to discuss things here and change his actions. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 09:35, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you for the being the voice of reason, Doc. I think Steve block's suggestion is after the fact, given that you and I have just cooperated on and improved two entries. I also don't think Chris Griswold even read the rest of the discussion. At any rate, I think this has gone on long enough and needs to be resolved. As previously indicated, my edits of late speak for themselves.</li>

<dd>Like <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a>, I remain skeptical. Are we going to have to go through this again in another month or two?

<dd>One has to go through with things or else some people will always call your bluff. A month or so ban to show how seriously the rest of the community takes Asgardian's actions would drive the point home once and for all.

<li>I'm not interested in calling anyone's bluff. By the by, you should avoid making comments on behalf of everyone else. "The rest of us can get some rest" is a tad melodramatic. Again, just follow the recent edit trail.</li>

<ul>
<li>But you didn't address Tenebrae's point. (Admittedly, a lot of points have been brought up, and not every one has to be addressed directly <i>as long as the key issues get covered.</i>) The recent edit trail is a spit compared to the bucket of nearly two thousand prior edits. You still haven't addressed the concerns regarding (1) showing concern for what you should have done differently over the past three months and (2) what you're committing to doing in the future aside from discussing exemplars. Again, some assurances in these areas would go a long way to help smoothe things over, to help convey that you're not just making nice again for a couple of days only to go right back to the edit wars when the heat's off. I hope that's not the case. You're the only one who knows your intentions. So please help clear this up: What are they? Without some clear and strong assurances, a ban of a month or two from the pages you've edited most seems likely to be pursued soon. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 07:57, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I would think that my actions of the past few days speak for themselves. Nothing has been a blind revert. If in doubt, I have discussed - you know this. Given that I've changed some of the articles, and others have made some additions which I've then added to, it would be counter productive to revert. Close examination reveals that most of the entries are still my words anyway - I was just getting stuck on the minor points, which can be discussed (eg. fictional). This will be my modus operandi in future. What WOULD help, however, is if we all took this a little less personally, which might make the discussions a tad easier.</li>

<li>I think perhaps a probation might be the best move then. I suggest a probation of two months whereby Asgardian is to discuss any changes, to avoid reverting and is to follow civility and good faith assumptions. Does that cover the behaviour? If an admin deems Asgardian has breached the probation, short blocks can be imposed. Maybe we should consider the idea of mentorship, too. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 15:09, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed. Doc will attest to the fact that I have already been doing this. As for probation, I would have assumed I am already on it, yes? At least three people seem to keep track of my movements. That said, I think this has gone on long enough and business as normal can resume (if there is such a thing on Wikipedia). The only thing I would ask of fellow posters (the reasonable ones at any rate) is that there is a little lessv "the sky is falling" if edits are made on some entries (someone recently said that their edit on an entry was more or less perfect, which I can't agree with as nothing is perfect and change is inevitable on Wikpedia) and more discussion.

<li>Wikipedia has a probationary status? Where can we find details on how that works? One might argue that an example should be made to deter other edit wars (and it can be a strong argument), but if that were the only acceptable outcome to this discussion, then the step of coming to this page should have been skipped. Tenebrae's question was "What can we do?" not "How do we get rid of him?" Given that people bothered to come here instead of going straight to ban discussions, probation seems appropriate and Asgardian has indicated willingness to work with that. If he continues as he has for the last several days, he will make useful contributions to Wikipedia. If he's just lying low as some suspect and waiting to resume old behavior, he'll get busted out for violating probation. (Boy, that sounds dramatic, but those are the words, aren't they?) As for the "mentorship" suggestion, it would need to involve an objective party who hasn't been particularly involved in this along the way. And how does <i>that</i> work? Where is a link for information on Wikipedia mentorship? <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 01:37, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProbation_b453.html" title="Wikipedia:Probation">Wikipedia:Probation</a> details probation, which "generally follows an Arbitration Committee finding", but if it helps avoid taking this to arbitration, and all parties agree, then I don't see why it can't be adopted here as a community probation. We have community bans after all, listed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_banned_users_3583.html" title="Wikipedia:List of banned users">Wikipedia:List of banned users</a>. Mentoring is described here, <a href="../../../m/e/n/Wikipedia%7EMentorship_190c.html" title="Wikipedia:Mentorship">Wikipedia:Mentorship</a>, but it appears the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Wikipedia%7EMentorship_Committee_9b60.html" title="Wikipedia:Mentorship Committee">Wikipedia:Mentorship Committee</a> has shut up shop, so that may be a blind alley, although maybe we could see if anyone is willing to take on the role.

What I'm proposing, though, is that if all parties agree, I can take the agreement to the admin's noticeboard and get a consensus on whether it should be adopted. I can't see why it shouldn't. It basically establishes what sort of behaviour is expected anyway. Once it is accepted, any transgression of the probation should be reported here, I would think. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 16:21, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First, I would like to believe that everyone has the best of intentions here. And I have empathy with the idea that being "on the stand" can start to feel like everyone is accusatory, and standing against you. But I think that at least some of the Wikipedians above have concerns, and are looking for a way to balance the several sides of "what's good for the encyclopedia". I think we all would rather that you have the continued ability to positively edit this encyclopedia that anyone can edit, but at the same time, we all really need to find ways to hopefully avoid these continued disruptions to articles and altercations with other editors, and hopefully start working together towards consensus. (I think there is a rather large difference between having a heated talk page discussion, and the disruptive <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> reversion wars that have been occurring of late.)</dd>

<dd>I think Steve block has a rather good idea. If the community can ban, the community should be able to suggest probation. This would seem to be the perfect "middle-ground" for this situation. That said, we should lay out some very specific points in relation to the probation, so that Asgardian isn't unduly attacked with just the reason (excuse) that he's on probation. I believe Steve block and CrisGriswold are the current administrator members of the Comics WikiProject, so I think that they would be the ideal choice for monitoring the situation, with notices here, should the situation warrant. And if unacceptable behavior continues, then I think there would be no choice but to submit a request for arbitration. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 21:47, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>jc37, I have to commend you. You must be one of the most reasonable posters I have encountered on Wikipedia thus far. What I can gather, the probation process needs to be pioneered as it doesn't exist. I can only say again, that I am in effect already on probation as at least one poster would be watching. No one seems to have had issue with the edits, which have helped improve several articles. jc also raises a good point about undue attacks. I think some edits are reasonable, and should not be seen as outrageous and a cause for confrontation (in theory anyway, but I'm sure it's happening on a few comic pages somewhere). I would hope that when there is a need to discuss issues in future, people will be reasonable.</li>

<li>The probation process doesn't need pioneering any more than anything else on Wikipedia does. It's an established process, and monitoring user behaviour is part of the admin role. There's nothing being stretched out of place here, and if there was, it would have been pointed out by now by another admin. And discussions hang around as long as people discuss them. They are archived after no-one has posted to them for a set number of days. Since all people have agreed that probation is an acceptable outcome, I think we should move ahead on that route. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 09:23, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to disagree. I am also concerned about objectivity here. You came out of nowhere and proposed a ban and are now trying to drive the consensus toward a probation. As I've already stated, I'm on virtual probation and are no doubt being monitored. The fact that no one else has responded would seem to suggest that there is hardly a cast of thousands pressing for this. Once again, the edits from the last week speak for themselves. Even if it came to such action (which is unnnecessary) I would have to insist that a person who was not associated with comics - and therefore objective - made the ruling. I really think this can be dropped now.</li>

If, as you claim, you're already on "virtual probation", then I would think that an "actual probation", following the extant and existing rules thereof, would be a preferrable solution. But then, once again, I'm <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith here</a>. If one's interest was to "game the system", then of course that person would prefer a "virtual probation" under which wikilawyering and obfuscation would be possible. I'm not saying that that is your (Asgardian's) intent, but it <i>would</i> explain an interest to wish to keep this from becoming "official". In any case, I support Steve Block's suggestion that "we should move ahead on that route" (towards probation, community or otherwise). - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 09:27, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, as you say, if your edits continue along the path already trodden in the last week, there is no issue. And to your last point, any admin who is not in a conflict with you is free to discharge their admin duties in matters in which you are involved. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 17:00, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'd appreciate more opinions on this, especially since I may not have time today to look more closely into the situation. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> 17:00, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Both blocked as falsely representing authority, clearly the same person. I have put {{spa}} templates by their posts on the article's talk page.

<p>It is difficult to determine whether someone is who they say they are or not, and this sometimes impacts on editing around an article. For instance, at <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_ancestry.html" title="Cosmic ancestry">Cosmic ancestry</a> one particularly large edit was conducted with the accompanying edit summary "founder of theory clarifyies (sic) and expands entry" and the username associated with the edit is logical to be associated with the founder of the theory (User:Bklyce). Further, this edit is being used as the basis to propose the article for deletion, saying that the article is, as a result, a 'vanity' piece. However, there is no verifiable association between the editor and the actual identity of the authority figure. I think this is certainly not the only such case, but I have no idea how widespread this potential problem is ... <i>potential</i> misappropriation (I'm not saying the person is not who they say they are - merely keeping up healthy doubt) of authority figure identity to influence (for good or ill) article content. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 17:43, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looking through the users' contributions I think it is clear they were 2 accounts created by the same person pretending to be in charge here. Also being an expert, or even the founder, of a subject does not give anyone special privileges on Wikipedia, they must refer to verifiable published sources like everyone else. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 17:46, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes.

<dd>Sigh, so I have to not only add this tag to all the images and hope he doesn't revert this time, but also go to all the articles and insert a template, and list them all on that page?
