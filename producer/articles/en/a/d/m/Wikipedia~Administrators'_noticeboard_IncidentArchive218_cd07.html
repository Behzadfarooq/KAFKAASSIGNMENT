This is disruptive behavior. He has been blocked repeatedly for 3RR, incivility, and personal attacks. The grand sum of his argument is that the templates are "POV" and "wrong". Yet, he will not explain why they are wrong, will not contribute in discussions on how to improve them, and continues to delete them from the article. The undiscussed deletions fly in the face of consensus, as a number of people have continuously reverted this deletion and implored this person to find a diplomatic solution to his grievance. Instead, he deletes the table, claims IT is "POV" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_Army&amp;curid=25682&amp;diff=117022635&amp;oldid=116866299" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_Army&amp;curid=25682&amp;diff=117022635&amp;oldid=116866299" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and won't discuss.</p>
<p>This editor is constantly trying to push a Ukrainian nationalist agenda at the expense of verifiable information and hard facts. He accuses an admin of making "unsolicited POV changes" and reverts again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_Army&amp;curid=25682&amp;diff=117055405&amp;oldid=117025823" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_Army&amp;curid=25682&amp;diff=117055405&amp;oldid=117025823" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. He acknowledges his participation in the edit war <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Red_Army&amp;diff=113700543&amp;oldid=113324777" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Red_Army&amp;diff=113700543&amp;oldid=113324777" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>I told him that I would report him here if he did not contribute to a rational discussion of the templates and he did not respond <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Red_Army&amp;diff=114540264&amp;oldid=113700543" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Red_Army&amp;diff=114540264&amp;oldid=113700543" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>This nonsense is ongoing. If Ukrained has an issue with content, he should discuss and reach consensus on the talk page, which he has not done. Something should be done about this editors constant use of edit warring to push his agendas. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheQuandry_2564.html" title="User:TheQuandry">TheQuandry</a> 16:51, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If this were just an editor being disruptive, I wouldn't raise it at AN/I, but this is an <i>administrator</i>.</p>
<p>I never edited a climate-change article before yesterday, and I probably won't ever again. I came to this article because of an RFC over the question of whether a documentary should be called a documentary. After responding to the RFC, I read the article, noted some severe problems with <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a> that resulted in a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and tagged the article and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Great_Global_Warming_Swindle_9f8a.html#WP:OR_and_WP:NPOV_violation" title="Talk:The Great Global Warming Swindle">provided a lengthy explanation for the tags</a>; when it appeared that people were misunderstanding my use of the {{or}} tag, I <a href="../../../s/y/n/Template%7ESyn_a06c.html" title="Template:Syn">created a {syn} tag</a> to describe <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a> problems. Some editors edit-warred to remove the tags, and two editors stepped in to restore the tags, including one editor who initially disagreed with my placement of the tags and then changed his mind after discussing <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a> with some administrators.</p>
<p>The problems were being discussed civilly on the talk page, when William M. Connelly swooped in, deleted all of my tags, announced that he did so because there wasn't a consensus to keep the tags. Worse, he responded to the "documentary" vs. "polemic" issue by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Great_Global_Warming_Swindle&amp;diff=117285986&amp;oldid=117283215" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Great_Global_Warming_Swindle&amp;diff=117285986&amp;oldid=117283215" rel="nofollow">replacing the adjective "documentary" with "propaganda."</a> And after that all heck broke loose and now there are personal attacks on the talk page.</p>
<ol>
<li>Now, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding of Wikipedia tagging is that a tag reflects a lack of consensus, and the consensus question comes to bear when the decision is made to <i>remove</i> a tag. It certainly doesn't get removed when multiple editors are discussing the validity of the tag. Shouldn't an administrator be aware of this?</li>
<li>The edit and talk page comments show a distinct disregard for <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and other Wikipedia editing policies.</li>
<li>Isn't it a bit disruptive for an administrator to participate in edit-warring, simultaneously remove an NPOV tag while adding POV on an issue being discussed in an RFC?</li>
</ol>
<p>WMC is obviously very knowledgeable about this subject, on which he has written about widely, including one blog post that he added to the Swindle article. (I don't object to this; notwithstanding the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> issue, his contribution was a notable POV and satisfied RS.) I do object to the <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">ownership attitude</a> exhibited by an administrator, however, especially when I was once threatened with a permanent ban if I ever slipped from NPOV in editing an article about legal topics.</p>
<p>A personal attack from Skyemoor has successfully convinced me that I don't want to get involved in improving this category of articles, and I'll withdraw from this one. But I think administrators should be trying to cool disputes and reach consensus rather than fanning flames. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 20:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are some areas were mob rule on wikipedia is a bad thing.

<dd>I don't. There's a reason why <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">Global warming</a> doesn't have more than 4 words noting the controversy behind it, and it's the same reason that we've had to deal with edits where a documentary film is changed to "propaganda film" by an adminstrator who should know better. NPOV applies even to people who work in the field. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If anyone on wikipedia were to wish global warming were false, it would be me. I tended to be a skeptic myself, mainly because I didn't want to believe it. The only controversy that it isn't true would be the one being fostered by special interests groups who have actively campaigned using millions of petro dollars to spread misrepresentations about the issue. This is the same kind on nonsense I see all the time dealing with conspiracy theories regarding 9/11.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 20:45, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Certainly. This isn't the same as a bunch of loons coming to provoke, him, though. Hell, I couldn't even tell you the global warming position of any of the other editors, save myself and Ed. However, when an administrator, of all people, adds a link to his own blog and then makes massive POV edits to an article simply because he believes the subject and its agenda to be false, there's a problem no matter which way you want to look at it, whether you're Al Gore or an Oil Exec. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:48, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

I'm being attacked even though I agree that there is anthropogenic global warming, simply because I asked for <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> to be applied. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 20:44, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I also agree with Mongo's assessment and know that Connolley goes to great lengths to be civil and patient with disruptive newbies, but expects them to eventually learn and understand WP policies and guidelines. Others abuse the policies by leveraging them in a skillful manner to push POV. I encourage you to examine Ted Frank's <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Great_Global_Warming_Swindle_9f8a.html#WP:OR_and_WP:NPOV_violation" title="Talk:The Great Global Warming Swindle">"lengthy explanation for the tags"</a> to see if he really does provide specific supporting rationale, or whether it's vebose fluff. And note that he is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a 'think tank' which has received at least $1,625,000 from Exxon alone, and is virulently anti-global-warming in their stance. Perhaps Ted really does believe that humans are causing global warming, but I have a hard time believing that on 'good faith' alone. Is this a personal attack, Ted? <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyemoor_c5a1.html" title="User:Skyemoor">Skyemoor</a> 21:07, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

William Connelly is both well-informed and more than qualified to assess the neutrality of climate change articles. The fact that he views anthropogenic climate change as an established fact is not a problem, because that's how the scientific community views it as well.

<dd>Fascinating.

But if a left-wing administrator does it, it's okay by Guy--unless he makes his point simply to attack me without bothering to look at the merits. I apologize: I wasn't aware that the "N" in NPOV stood for "William Connolley's preferred position" and that the "N" in NOR stood for "William Connelley's views." I've made hundreds of edits cleaning up after vandals, created templates to fill tag gaps, have never had an article I created deleted or even nominated by a third party for deletion, but I'm a disruptive influence because I responded to an RFC on an article I had never seen before and noted a violation of <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a> that several other editors, having the policy pointed out, agree is a problem.</dd>
<dd>And not once has an editor who objected to my pointing out the NOR violation responded by defending the text under Wikipedia policy, instead simply responding "It's okay because it's true," an exception that I have not seen in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy.

<dd>The edits in question were political edits: is it NPOV to call a controversial documentary "propaganda" in the first sentence of the article?

<dd>And is that a good reason to allow vicious personal attacks on his/her talk page to stand, Chuq? I notice you restored the comments that Riana deleted.

<dd>Her, Jeff&#160;:) and while I can appreciate how frustrating this editor's behaviour has been, I don't believe 'do us all a favour and die' should be allowed to stand. – <span style="font-family:trebuchet ms"><a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_7579.html" title="User:Riana">Riana</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/i/a/User_talk%7ERiana_2fc6.html" title="User talk:Riana"><font color="seagreen"><big>ঋ</big></font></a></sup></span> 13:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry for the misunderstanding, i didn't mean to imply that I supported the comments, however due to the history of this user, I totally understand how Dibo &amp; Tancred would be driven to make them. Removing the comments completely removes all evidence that there was a problem - yes, people <i>can</i> check the history, but most people wouldn't. Anyway, the point is moot now, as the IP has been blocked by another admin. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 21:28, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You should be <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blocked.html" title="Blocked">blocked</a> for your bad faith assumptions none of which you have provided are legitimate sources, they barely explain or describe his origins, Eupator is justified into reverting your revision of Armenian history, sadly Armenian history is long and it will stay that way your suppression of Armenian kings, dynasties and empires is absurd refrain from your POV edits. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtaxiad_296b.html" title="User:Artaxiad">Artaxiad</a> 19:05, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One can easily look at the talk pages for all the articles and clearly see that I showed plenty of good faith initially even though it was obvious that user AdilBaguirov was merely disrupting the articles with pov intepretations of various literature. All of his pov pushing has been rebuffed on each of the talk pages of the articles not only by myself and user TigrantheGreat but also by third party editors such as user Aldux and Ali among others. Read the talk pages and make your own judgement. Good faith was thrown out of the window after a month or two of discussions. Notice that not even Adil's allies have supported him in these attempts of disruption. Since registration this user has made no positive contibutions to wikipedia. None whatsoever. Created no articles. Reverted no vandalism. Helped no users. He has concentrated all his efforts to one goal, that is the disruption of various unrelated Armenian historical articles. After almost a year, nothing has changed. I could have easily turned each of those articles into an FA article like I did with <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tiridates_I_of_Armenia_2604.html" title="Tiridates I of Armenia">Tiridates I of Armenia</a> from scratch had Adil ceased his disruption. --<big><b><a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator"><font color="#00N510">Ευπάτωρ</font></a></b></big> <sup><small><a href="../../../e/u/p/User_talk%7EEupator_d1d3.html" title="User talk:Eupator"><font color="#974423">Talk!!</font></a></small></sup> 19:33, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have entered the fray incidentally upon finding the content of several articles I was monitoring being hit with throwaway accounts intent on making the same vanity-page type insertions regarding content about an officer named Michael Satter. Did do a traceroute upon the one numerical address, and it seemed to end in a police server farm in Minnesota. Perhaps the easiest way to resolve this is to do a complete Checkuser analysis, and simply call up the guy's supervisor. Looks like either Michael Satter, or perhaps his significant other, is intent on promoting Mr. Satter through vandalizing Wikipedia. <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">Yaf</a> 02:38, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've got the AfD itself sorted out but I can't solve the mystery of how those editors knew where to go to&#160;!vote, except for the&#160;!vote that was copied from the article's Talk page. I'm sure the closing admin will note the nature of their arguments and their other contributions (or lack thereof). Like many high school articles, this one's been a handful and I've largely given up trying to keep it neat - it's a thankless, uphill battle against high students with more time and energy than this one editor. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 04:17, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

I looked through a random selection and many of his removals were relevant external links that happened to be usenet posts, not cited as sources.

He opposed my rfa because I wouldn't agree with his block first, ignore their begging later policy towards usernames he considered inappropriate.

<dd>It is unreviewed innapropriate link cleanup. If he were manually removing the links, I would have no issue with it. There is a reason there is a bot approval process, an average edit rate of 28 edits per minute for the last 500 edits is insane.

<dd>Indeed. While many or most of these should be removed, taking them out blindly (some exceptions <i>might</i> be reasonable) and cutting templates in half isn't good.

<dd>I guess, what draws the line? In 1bout 15 minutes, over 500 links were removed, and as far as I know, none of them were reviewed. While some may have been valid removals, others have been demonstrated as breaking things or the links may have been valid. What draws the line between a Bot and a script, especialyl when they can both do the same amount of damage?

<dd>Good work. This kind of out of control admin behaviour is just why some people are leaving wikipedia (if you read the en. mailinglist you understand). This is just power misuse. YES, there is a lot of cleanup to do, but cleanup does not and has never meant automatic deletion. Bot work should be supervised at all times, and in this case it was clearly a case of run a query and dump them all in the bot. VERY VERY VERY BAD. If this was a company, said person was fired. And that has nothing to do with if I like the user or not. In general I have been very happy with the work of Betacommand, but this is just not acceptable. The Council was very unhappy as well because a lot of assessment categories got deleted for instance. I went trough the deletion list of betacommand, and in my opinion the whole thing should just be reverted and someone else who does review all the categories listings can try again. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDJ_515e.html" title="User:TheDJ">TheDJ</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheDJ_8bc8.html" title="User talk:TheDJ">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheDJ_82c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheDJ">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WikiProject Television</a>) 04:23, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

It would also help greatly to get a second hand opinion on this or ask an administrator or another editor who can translate to confirm what the user is saying or add a reference on to the page of where you found the translation then if it confirms that it was an attack against you then I would suggest leaving {{<a href="../../../a/t/t/Template%7EAttack_5010.html" title="Template:Attack">attack</a>}} or he may be blocked if he has made other personal attacks.

Recently, A Wiki Camp was held in Chennai on 25th February, 2007, and Jimmy Wales spent a whole day with more than 300 participants. Participants discussed many issues related to use of wikis and building communities around wikis. The event was widely reported in Indian print and electronic media:<br />

We all are aware that wikipedia is a live example of creating a repository of knowledge by eliciting support of people like you and me. The Wikipedia Community is very vibrant. I feel that in order to understand emergence of such vibrant communities, I have been trying for last several weeks to contributing to Wikia as indicated on my wikipedia user page. You may be aware of for-profit project named Wikia and I have been contributing to three of such Wikias (<a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Wikia" class="external free" title="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Wikia" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Wikia</a>) (out of several 100s), namely, Finance (<a href="http://finance.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://finance.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://finance.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page</a>) and DIY (<a href="http://diy.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://diy.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://diy.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page</a>), and World (<a href="http://world.wikia.com/wiki/World_Wikia" class="external free" title="http://world.wikia.com/wiki/World_Wikia" rel="nofollow">http://world.wikia.com/wiki/World_Wikia</a>). By the way, I am also administrators in all these Wikias.<br />
I solicit your wikipedia experience to contribute a little to Finance Wikia or any other Wikia of your choice.<br />
Let us watch and participate in this way in a live experiment to build wiki communities around Finance / other wikias. I am sure that it will be an interesting thing to experience.<br />
Please respond by registering and contributing. Even a little bit shall be of great help.<br />
With regards,<br />
Bhadani</p>

<p>This email sounds like a scam, since the wording, tone, etc., sound like a solicitation from <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advance_fee_fraud.html" title="Advance fee fraud">African scam</a> artists. Instead, it's a request to work on a commercial site, which I don't want to do, and as far as I'm aware is a violation of Wikipedia's rules.</p>
<p>I'm also concerned that I'm not the only one who has received a letter of this type in my email.</p>

<dd>10 too much? Absurd. How do you know this was a "mass-spammings"?

Even if it was 20, isn't the e-mail function to contact other Wikipedians about their work on Wikipedia and improving this site (or that's what it's supposed to be used for) and having other wiki-related discussions privately? If Bhadani has his goal set on improving a Wikia, I don't think we should fault him for doing so. It wasn't the best way of sending the message, but would you have rather him send 20-30 messages to individuals by e-mail or by sending the messages on-wiki? I still don't see the point in bringing this topic up here and there is no admin intervention needed. — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 02:43, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is nothing in that email that is private. It's a form letter. If it was really something private, it should have been written specifically to the user about something the user had specifically said, and shouldn't have been a sales pitch unless the user had somehow indicated interest. If it wasn't something private, and was legitimately Wikipedia-related, it should have been done on-wiki, either through the portal talk page or user talk pages. However, it's non-private and non-Wikipedia-related, which is to say it's spam. 64.160.39.153 02:50, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In case, the mails have caused consternation, I do apologize for the same though I am afraid we do not have set rules for use of Wikipedia mails. Nevertheless commonsense implies that the feature should be used in connection with matters relating to wikipedia, and wikipedia being the biggest wiki in the world, wikipedians should allow the use of the feature for seeking assistance for development of other wikis. The goodwill and credit shall flow directly or indirectly to wikipedia and the community of wikipedians. I have posted my replies to the messages received on my user page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hires_an_editor&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117197877" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hires_an_editor&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117197877" rel="nofollow">[77]</a> and a similar reply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Qxz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117197989" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Qxz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117197989" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I didn't exactly count the mails though I marked copies to me for the sake of records - and it is around 75 users. I also received responses from around six or seven users and expect to receive more. In this connection, one should also think that the entire WikiCamp in India (which was also featured on the Signpost), a one day event in which Jimmy spent a whole days was to create awareness about wikipedia and wikis, and use of wiki in other fields. Wikipedia has shown the way, and requesting our editors to to do a little edits to other wikis may sound a little strange, but attempting to understand the emergence of online community by requesting editors to participate in other wikis is not so bad as it may look. I am not defending my action - I am trying to clear the doubts and intentions about my action. You see my talk page - some one invited me and three or four other users to do edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bhadani&amp;diff=115587221&amp;oldid=115519893" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bhadani&amp;diff=115587221&amp;oldid=115519893" rel="nofollow">[78]</a> for another wiki (not-for-profit). Would you ban that user for doing this? I think that I have clarified the points raised.

<p>Adil knows why I have removed it(and I advice the administrators to verify in the talkpage), he distorted an authors words. The source he provided does not say what the article claims it say(check the summary of my removal, it is quite implicit), we've been there already. Adil provided the quote and I asked him where on that quote he said it, he repeated that it was on that quote, I requested then, two times, where. No answers. It won't be the first time he misrepresented sources. Khoikhoi did not oppose my revert, actually Khoikhoi edited their edits with wordings questioning the Armenian genocide. Tat was mostly the subject of Khoikhoi edit. He worked on the main to neutralise that part, but did not support Adil addition. There remained one quote from Azerbaijan's president. It will go on the lead, when the Iranian president words go on the lead of an article like the Holocaust. Azerbaijan president beliefs is not called "some sources", it does not fit as a reliable source. The only time the author called genocide an event in that book was when he covered the murder of Talaat in which he accuses Talaat of being responsable of the Armenian genocide. The only time in the entire work in which the author claims genocide happened it was in connection to the Armenians. In the talk also, Adil is yet again manipulating the sources, he volontarly removed a very important section of a sentence and replaced it with (...), I requested him to be humble enough to add it, made that request on various occasions but Adil refrained from doing so. If I were to report each of Adil unjustified edits, I will load this page. But again, I am not suprised that Adil is abusing the Administrators' noticeboard.

<p>I just sent this case to CheckUser. Please send all death threats in the future to CheckUser because most jurisdictions consider issuing death threats as a type of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault.html" title="Assault">assault</a>, and therefore the police should be notified of this crime.

<dd>If Amarkov is even half-right, then I plead IAR. Would it be a legal possibility for the checkusers to checkuser under these circumstances? Looking at the meta privacy policy, at any rate, it would be Wikimedia policy not to checkuser and release the result. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 15:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I see someone else has restored the request. Let's leave things there for the checkusers to deal with.

<li>It is my understanding that for a posting on the internet to be considered a credible and actionable threat, it must be unequivocal, immediate, and be directed at a specific identifiable person. For example: <i>I'm coming over right now to kill you, Jimbo Wales</i> is a threat. <i>If you do that again, User:Wikinony, I will dedicate my life to tracking down who you are, and beating the crap out of you</i> is against Wiki policy, but not necessarily a credible threat as far as law enforcement is concerned. (equivocal "if, then", anonymous target, non-immediate threat). I could be completely wrong, but that is how I have always seen it handled in the www world. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 15:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>It doesn't matter, nothing will come of it, and it's a waste of time even theorizing over a checkuser spending the kind of resources involved in tracking down this random person.

<p><a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">User:Jeffpw</a> is attacking me in the edit summaries on his talk page, and making threats as well. I made one attempt to address the fact that he and another editor were discussing me on the page, and was summarily accused of <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">stalking</a> him. When I politely responded that I reviewed the page on stalking/harassment, and responding on someone's talk page didn't qualify, he proceeded to blank my response, and left a message telling me to "f-ck off" his talk page. It was this edit in which he left the vulgar edit summary.

<dd>Yup, I told you once politely to stop bothering me on my talk page, and you then left two more messages; so I left a message you would be sure to grasp. Further, I never said you were stalking me, I said I was feeling stalked. Stop manipulating my words. your edit warring and wikilawyering on the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Buchanan_f59c.html" title="James Buchanan">Buchanan</a> article and talk page are bad enough.

<dd>I was simply responding to the fact that you and and another user were discussing me on your talk page. I have every right to do that. You do NOT have the right to attack people, call them names, and threaten bodily harm. Additionally, saying you "feel stalked" when there's no basis for that (at that time, I believe I'd left one message on your talk page), is a nice semantical way around actually ACCUSING someone of that without merit, I guess. One way or the other, calling someone a "useless dickhead" and saying that they deserve to be "thrown off a bridge" is a clear violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>.

<li>I'd like to take this opportunity to point out that the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Buchanan_f59c.html" title="James Buchanan">James Buchanan</a> page could use some admin attention. I no longer watch the page because it's too frustrating. The issues are over rumors and speculation that Buchanan was gay. Both sides of this issue have come to consensus about 90% of the issues to craft a paragraph they agree with, but there remains a contentious issue over a reference/source. Meanwhile, the page remains protected and other editors have attempted to make substantive changes unrelated to the controversy. Since we are all adults, I proposed that the page get unprotected, and the agreed-upon information be put in the article with the source debated on the Talk page; however, this suggestion fell flat. It's bad when pages remain protected for so long; it in fact defeats the purpose of Wiki. Especially when there is so much agreement. The page is off my watch list, but it could stand to have an admin or two who are impartial to step in and tie things up - it's gone on long enough, and the arguments are just regurgitations.

<dd>Cutting and pasting another editor's comments (with sig) from one page to another is a rather bad idea and I'd suggest our IP friend not do that again (if the future, just do a diff to the comment you want to reference). That said, I don't think it was done maliciously and the point stands that editors, IP editors included, are free to remove messages from their talkpage. No further action or discussion is really necessary at this point.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:55, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Biophys, I think your article has become a victim of the kind of friends you don't want to have despite their having common with you POV.

<dd>I mostly agree with Irpen on that.

And the controversy over possible 'canvassing' was not helpful, nor the use (or attempt to use, or attempt to portray the article as being used) the article as a tool to attack some editors is only good for ensuring people will want to salt the earth on the article as quickly as possible.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 21:29, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is currently a heated dispute on this page, regarding the sexuality of America's 15th president. I know content disputes don't belong here, but the issue has become one of WP:V|verifiability.

<p>User ZayZayEM has been <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalking.html" title="Stalking">stalking</a> me. Around a week ago, I created several new pages and began entering new materials at <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_opposition_to_evolution.html" title="Jewish opposition to evolution">Jewish opposition to evolution</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_reactions_to_intelligent_design.html" title="Jewish reactions to intelligent design">Jewish reactions to intelligent design</a>. In the process, I was also making some edits to <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natan_Slifkin_dd94.html" title="Natan Slifkin">Natan Slifkin</a>.</p>
<p>Every time I made a change, <a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">User:ZayZayEM</a> would be there, often just a few minutes later, trying to modify it. If I wrote a caption for a picture, he would want to re-write it. If I put a picture on the left side, he would want it on the right side. I would write a paragraph, and immediately he would want to rearrange it, or put it somewhere else. He followed me from the first page page that I was working on to another, to yet another. I consider this is <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberstalking.html" title="Cyberstalking">cyberstalking</a>.</p>
<p>This user is not here to contribute. He wants somebody to squabble with. He constantly quotes Wikipedia policies and procedures, which he knows upside down. It's impossible that he knows them so well, with his limited record of edits. I suspect he has other identities, and has been kicked off the site before.</p>
<p>The edits he wants do not improve the page. These are pages on somewhat abstruse subjects, about which he has no knowledge, such as philosophy and theology.</p>
<p>Suddenly I found myslef forced to spend all of my time trying to answer ZayZayEM. We had edit conflicts (where I would try to save the page, and it would turn out I couldn't because he had just saved the page in the time since I had done it). He clearly wanted to draw me into some kind of edit war or procedure war.</p>
<p>I kept asking him to just leave, and come back later, if he felt that he had to edit my work. But somehow, ZayZayEM felt that that was not acceptable. He had to be there in real time editing and changing what I was doing while I was doing it. I suggest that if he had a problem, both of us could leave the page for a few days or a week, and allow people who actually are capable and know the material to see it. I asked numerous users who are acquainted with Jewish philosophy and thoelogy, and who could judge the material on its own merits, to come and have a look. Some did. I don't think many of them saw the forest through the trees.</p>
<p>This was not an edit conflict. The real problem was that ZayZayEM was not there to improve wikipedia. He was there simply to create contention and harrass me as I worked on the page. I tried to go there at odd hours when I wouldn't encounter him. He would rearrange materials right as I was working, ignoring my pleas for him to leave.</p>
<p>I feel personally threatened and scared. This was an obtrusive and unwanted relationship. This user had no interest in and no knowledge of Jewish theology or philosophy. He was there purely to harrass me. --216.89.203.226 22:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's correct. Both IPs are me. They are alternate ports in a company firewall, which has several hundred computer users behind it. I can log in VPN, or at my office. I feel better about using my own user name now, rather than an IP address. I'd like to address this stalking incident instead as an incident of disruptive editing, although I do feel that there have been elements of stalking in it, and those elements have made me very uncomfortable. Certainly, it was a scary and unwanted personal intrusion to have him showing up and making changes everywhere I went, often within minutes of my arrival.

<p>Shkëmbi 22:53, 23 March 2007 (UTC)Dear sir, Last night, I could not find my article "Tsyam" in the Wikipedia Website. I do not know the reason why it had already been removed. However, I proceeded to edit and enter a few sources on the "edit this page" in the original version of the article under my name. After I was done and clicked on "Save", a "spam link" page showed and all my editing and sources I had entered, were deleted. Since I do not know how to deal with this situation and the reason behind it, I am writing to you for advice, guidance and a solution to the issue.

<li>You had nominated a couple of porn star articles for deletion before the speedy deletion of the Sharday article on 16 March, but almost immediately following the speedy of that article, you began a deluge of AfDs for any porn star of even VAGUELY questionable notability, making arguments directly to the contrary of arguments you had made <b>in favor of keeping</b> very similar articles prior to the speedy of the Sharday article. It would take me awhile, but I could come up with a very nice list of diffs based on your user contributions to that effect. Or do you mean to tell me that you were planning on doing this all along?

<p>Folks, <b>please</b>, stop the fighting just a bit. There's no need for this. We're all here to make the encyclopedia better, and the primary way we do that is by writing good articles. Infighting helps no one. Say that half of you get banned out of this (which is apparently what people are going for), in what way is that going to make more good articles? Let me wave around what credentials I have here. I've been here for a year, I've been made an admin, I'm a somewhat prominent member of <a href="../../../p/2A/_/WP%7EP__934d.html" title="WP:P*">WP:P*</a>, I've written articles, deleted articles, saved articles from deletion, nominated articles for deletion, got one article on the subject to <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a>, helped make <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">the notability criteria</a> a guideline, blocked accounts, and unblocked accounts. Please, folks, if <i>any</i> of that means anything to you, trust me: fighting other well meaning contributors is not the way to make the encyclopedia better.</p>
<p>Epbr123 is, in a way, trying to help. So he's a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/deletionist" class="extiw" title="m:deletionist">m:deletionist</a>; it takes all kinds. A reasonable number of the articles he's nominated for deletion <i>are</i> deserving of deletion, so some of what he is doing is actually useful. And the fact that he isn't just doing it at random, and can be reasonable, is shown by the fact he can change his mind and withdraw his nominations at times. (See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Maria_Swan_1ee6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Maria Swan">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Candy_Manson_%282nd_nomination%29_fc76.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Candy Manson (2nd nomination)">here</a>, for example.) So please, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> here, and don't harass him, try to work with him, rather than against him. Some of the comments made to him on AfDs, on his talk page, and here <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">aren't the most polite</a>. If he nominates an article, don't try to get him banned, try to address his points by improving the article. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amanda_Lexx&amp;diff=117189825&amp;oldid=117176033" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amanda_Lexx&amp;diff=117189825&amp;oldid=117176033" rel="nofollow">This is an excellent example -it may or may not be sufficient, but is certainly an order of magnitude better than the article was before.</a> That will not only be more effective, it will help the encyclopedia - and that is what we are all here for, isn't it?</p>
<p>Epbr123, however, is not blameless either. Many of his nominations are insufficiently researched. The fact that half or so of them are kept, and that he himself changed his mind about several shows that too. Ebbp123, while technically it is the responsibility of the article's writers to defend the article, if you are making a whole Wikipedia career out of cleaning up poorly written porn star articles, it is at least a good idea to see if you can improve the articles yourself instead of nominating them for deletion. In the end, it will take less effort from everyone concerned, will hurt less feelings, will get you "good press" instead of the attacks you're getting here, <i>and</i> we'll have a better encyclopedia. Isn't making a better encyclopedia your real goal? Might even earn you a few <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia%7EBarnstar_aa89.html" title="Wikipedia:Barnstar">Barnstars</a> - I've gotten more of those from saving articles than I ever had from deleting articles or blocking users. Try it, it's fun! Since you've had your own articles on the subject attacked or deleted, you must know how painful that is. Please don't spread that pain to others unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Epbr123 is also unquestionably rude in deleting comments on his user talk page, especially in those deletion summaries. Ebbp123, <a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html#Deleting_sections_from_user_pages" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">while you may technically have that right (and that is disputable)</a>, it certainly isn't the best way to get along with people. Many of those criticisms are quite constructive, and if you want people to assume good faith about your actions, you really should assume good faith about theirs. By the way, Ebbp123, one of the reasons I, and presumably others, are writing this here, so publically, where hundreds of people will read it, instead of on your talk page which only the people really involved are watching <i>is</i> that you delete things from it all the time. Think about that. If you really don't want your dirty laundry hung out in public, you're not achieving your goal. AN/I is read by a lot more people, many of them carrying mops. Because people can't write on your talk page and be sure their comments will stay up for any length of time, you are getting a bad reputation, not just among the few people interested in porn star articles, but among people interested in the way admin work is done; there are a lot more of those, and they are a lot more influential. Also Ebbp123, consider how many people there are opposing your current actions to at least some degree. In the end, things at Wikipedia are done by consensus, getting the people involved to agree. So far, you are mostly getting people to agree that, while some of your goals may be well intentioned, you're being disruptive in the way you're getting them.</p>
<p>By the way, so there isn't any uncertainty about whether or not I'm making <i>veiled</i> threats here. I really don't like blocking people, and will try really hard to avoid it. I still think this can be settled peacefully. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Epbr123&amp;oldid=117132028#Please_slow_down." class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Epbr123&amp;oldid=117132028#Please_slow_down." rel="nofollow">This looked like a really good start</a> - before it was deleted, the fight came here to AN/I, and half a dozen other article nominations were made! Instead, this is now escalating fairly fast from both sides, and if it keeps getting more rude and more disruptive, and I have no other way out, I absolutely will block half the people involved. And this is, of course, only if someone else doesn't do it first! There are a lot (up to a thousand!) other admins reading this board, and if I know them, many will now follow the contributions history of people involved here for at least the next few days. Many of those admins have shorter fuses than I do, and more than a few bear at least the unstated opinion that the encyclopedia would be better off without any pornography articles at all, or people working on them, so will <i>happily</i> block people who not only work on them, but are disruptive doing it. And frankly, at this rate, that looks like it includes people from both sides. So please, folks, try to settle this without the use of admin tools: if you get that, it probably won't be what you want. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 14:09, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Then, there's also the AFD on the Yulia Nova, in which he assume that a caucasian model must be famous in Europe or North America in order to be notable.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do guess that, when we discussed too much, he will begin to feel the pressure. On the other hand, I would like him to calm down, especially on cultures that he have know absolutely nothing about, such as the Japanese culture; I already seen applying the American-centric standards on RX-78 Gundam, which is one of the longest but yet most ridiculous AFD I ever saw.</p>
<p>However, I will have to say that, there ARE quite a few models out there that perhaps do not deserve their own pages. So I propose the following truce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept that Epbr123 is an extreme deletionist. We cannot change his mind. While I believe he have WP:POINT on most deletions, there are quite a few that certainly does not deserve their pages.</li>
<li>Try not to eliminate models that are famous in only or mostly in Japan. Wikipedia is American-centric enough already. Also, remember that Japanese's way of doing things are completely different from us, and thus, while both may seems notable, they may see notability standard differently. HOWEVER, I would suggest that putting up prod would be acceptible.</li>
<li>Work with the <a href="../../../p/2A/_/WP%7EP__934d.html" title="WP:P*">WP:P*</a> people.</li>
<li>Let his talk page off. There's a warning from AnonEMouse, and the message here is public enough and long enough.</li>
<li>Try to think clearly on his AFD, and try to think clearly on pages to be created.</li>
<li>Don't go doing WP:POINT ourself. Trust me, all it does is ambarassing yourself (As I did to A-wing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly: Don't forget that pages can die and reborn. That's some of the philosophy of deletionist: They know it's notable, but if it got start completely anew, people will actually think and write clearly instead of depending upon past poor writings.

<p>I think we need to do something here. This is getting to be quite a bad pattern. I propose that</p>
<ol>
<li>Betacommand agree to revert the removal of the USAID links, all of them. In individual cases they can be debated one by one on the article talk page, but the overwhelming majority of which have so far been shown to be appropriate.</li>
<li>I'd appreciate if Betacommand revert the Michael E. Grost links. I think he's shown as a "recognized authority", since he's treated as that by a large number of sources, including those as respected as <a href="../../../p/b/s/PBS_66e9.html" title="PBS">PBS</a> and <a href="../../../u/c/_/UC_Berkeley_d44e.html" title="UC Berkeley">UC Berkeley</a>.

That can be debatable, but given the circumstances of repeated mass removals without sufficient consideration, I think they should be debated before being removed, not after.</li>
<li>Any AFP/<a href="../../../a/g/e/Agence_France_Presse_1cfa.html" title="Agence France Presse">Agence France Presse</a> links removed (didn't see any, but there's <a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html#Why_do_you_think_the_AFP_is_.22not_reliable_source.22.3F" title="User talk:Betacommand">a complaint on his talk page</a> about them as well, and I didn't look through his whole spree) should also be restored, and individually discussed. They're a highly respected source.</li>
<li>Most of the Yahoo Group link removals seem to be appropriate per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html#Links_normally_to_be_avoided" title="WP:EL">WP:EL#Links_normally_to_be_avoided</a> #10, "discussion forums", so can generally stay; individual cases where the links were appropriate can be restored on that specific article. But that seems to be a rare appropriate exception to this spree.</li>
<li>Most importantly, Betacommand needs to agree not to go on undiscussed mass information deletion sprees, bot-assisted or not, again. <i>Ever.</i> No deletion without prior discussion on that article's talk page. If he really feels the urge to go on a deletion spree, and simply can't resist, he needs to discuss with another highly experienced user, and that user needs to essentially take the responsibility for this, publically (such as at the Administrators' or Community noticeboard).</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, much to my regret, since he's clearly a well meaning editor, not a vandal ... I'd support the community sanction. Removal of adminship wouldn't affect this, neither would removal of bot rights, so this is all we'll have left. Even though he is well meaning, the amount of damage that can be done in just a few minutes of edits here is impressive. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 16:58, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right. I'm hoping Betacommand will agree, and we won't have to take it that far. This isn't a proposal for community sanction, this is a proposal to avoid community sanction. Bc is well meaning, and clearly a whiz at coding bots, so I don't want to lose him, but he's now caused a lot of disruption in just a few days. I really don't want it to happen again, and hope this way we can avoid it, and keep him. Since he is well meaning, I will take his word for it.

<p>Guys, banning is not a cool game to play w/. This is an established editor and his intention is not to vandalize or to push his POV so loudly. The guy thought he may be enhancing wikipedia.

<dd>Don't know if you (or JzG) think I'm a troll, but I'm quite serious. This is twice that he's gone on a huge spree in two days - I'm not sure you understand just how many articles got hit each time, just how many editors complained, or just how many forums are now devoted to discuss these two days of work. I thought he understood after he self-reverted yesterday, but after he started again today, I'm going to have to insist he specifies he won't do it again, or I will support community sanction.

<dd>I agree with AnonEMouse here, this is the 2nd time in a week.

As per the nature of the work there will be mistakes made. In regard to usaid that was an error on my part. the issue with the 15+ rate was a fluke when clearing a site. External link quality is an issue that needs to be addressed and taken care of. I can stop if you wish, I will still gather data and compile things that need fixed.

<dd>I dont think anybody is arguing that spam and crap links need to be addressed. I think what the problem appears to be is your interpretion of spam or crap. A site that is 85% spam, is a crap site to you from what I have read. 85% does not justify removing every single link to the site. I have no problem with external link removal, and i doubt many of us do. I think what the issue is blind removal of links that may hold verifibale, reliable, external sources. Again, this is not a black and white situation where you either have to delete them all or you dont do anything at all. Take a minute, review the link, make sure it is spam before deleting it. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 19:16, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Same. I don't think Beta is acting in bad faith, it's more an issue of disagreement as to whether each link should be checked or not.

<dd>Endorse RM above; Betacommand should absolutely stop removing any links of any kind for the time being, manually or automatically, unless he first gets consensus for removal of each specific link in question, either on the talk page of the affected article or at someplace like WP:WPSPAM. I know about WP:BOLD but it assumes at least a minimal level of judicious editorial consideration per edit, which Betacommand is clearly not exercising, so the principle should not apply to him.

<dd>I hate jumping on the bandwagon, but I respectfully request that you stop using this tool permanently. This tool has made literally thousands of edits. I've studied the last 1000 edits by this bot and a good 5%+ of the edits are in error. The tool creates empty sections, the tool creates broken lists (two examples of the twenty so I fixed: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Major_League_Baseball_on_CBS&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116818918" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Major_League_Baseball_on_CBS&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116818918" rel="nofollow">[101]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mellin_transform&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116819202" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mellin_transform&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116819202" rel="nofollow">[102]</a>) and in two cases that I could see the tool deleted whole sections (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mexicali&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116822066" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mexicali&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116822066" rel="nofollow">[103]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_transport_topics&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116820621" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_transport_topics&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116820621" rel="nofollow">[104]</a>). You also kept running the tool after the initial March 21st incident after it was obvious that the tool was broken in many cases recreating the exact same collateral damage that was fixed two days later (today). <b>~a</b> (<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArichnad_d429.html" title="User:Arichnad">user</a> • <a href="../../../a/r/i/User_talk%7EArichnad_2e77.html" title="User talk:Arichnad">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arichnad_abd7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arichnad">contribs</a>) 02:46, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And this has maybe gotten outside the scope of ANI. It may be time for someone to open an RFC. At issue is Betacommand's refusal to recognize that Wikipedia editing policies are not algorithms and can neither be programmed into computers nor carried out by people acting like computers. They are the distilled results of applying Wikipedia principles to 1000's of editing debates. However, they can only be applied with the principles in mind, not blindly, whether using a bot or by hand. In particular, uncontroversial, non-COI content that normally wouldn't provoke debate doesn't weigh much into policymaking, and therefore really has to evaluated by principle rather than by algorithm, and policy interpretation should be a bit loose with such content. As an extreme example mentioned above, following policy strictly would demand deleting <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hessian_matrix.html" title="Hessian matrix">Hessian matrix</a>, which is completely unsourced, and which like a lot of our other math articles is loaded with <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a>---but it is a good article.</p>
<p>So if <b>~a</b> (above) found 50 of Betacommand's bot's edits that actually broke something, there are certainly 100's more that are bad edits from a content point of view and should be reverted. All link removal decisions of that type have should have been made on a case by case basis with some care, not reflexively or mechanically. At most, any reflexive edit (that means any edit made without careful examination of what it does for the article in terms of Wikipedia principles) should have an edit summary saying the edit is a maintenance action and the article's regular editors should feel free to revert it. 64.160.39.153 04:27, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wonder if it shouldn't be a general policy to delete those edits from the histories, to avoid reverts and such? and to avoid having it there for someone to point to as a problem? It's not like we're covering it up, a note can be left on the talk athat a problematic edit was deleted as a BLP vio, and that's that... <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 04:17, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No don't. Just revert edits like that unless there's actually bad stuff in the them from a BLP point of view (i.e. damaging allegations or privacy vios), not silly vandalism. Use edit summaries explaining that it's reversion of false rumors/vandalism. 64.160.39.153 05:17, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"unreasonably fast new user complaint time" is totally false. There were FOUR HOURS between which I made my first edit and I made the edit to this page. Part of the reason for the duration is because i was looking for a place to report this incident. I eventually found that place at ANI.</p>

<p>A disturbing situation is reflected in the discussion at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Gordon_James_Klingenschmitt_3857.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gordon James Klingenschmitt">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gordon James Klingenschmitt</a>. Mr. Klingenschmitt, who by policy can probably be considered a notable person although not overwhelmingly so, is requesting the deletion of the article about himself. His request is based largely on the ground that it is being used as a vehicle through which opponents are harassing him, including through the posting of personal identifying information such as credit card numbers. Two issues are raised: first, the perennial topic of when, if ever, the views of a BLP's subject are relevant in making a keep/delete decision, and second, the need for many of us to watchlist or consider protecting this article to address the harassment. I will add that the AfD also contains a legal threat; under the circumstances, I thought it sufficient simply to advise the subject of our policies in this area. Further input both here and in the AfD will be appreciated. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:18, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>(edit conflict) I have extended an existing semiprotection of the article, that was going to expire, and also semi'd the talkpage. In doing so, I found an extremely vicious personal attack on the article subject (currently the last item on the talkpage), which I would simply have reverted, except that in reviewing the contributions of User:Commanderstephanus, who clearly hates Rev. Klingenschmitt, it appears that Commanderstephanus is one of the major contributors, if not the major contributor, to the article. It looks like we are caught in the middle of a major real-world feud here and the situation is ugly indeed. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:40, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Blocking someone's username isn't nearly as bad as publishing potentially libelous information about their person, is it? Your comment is appreciated in the spirit it was made, but is still misguided. Was Mr. Klingenschmitt given a "shape-up-or-else warning" before we allowed pseuds to slander him? Why extend to transparent single-issue attack-only sockpuppets/meatpuppets considerations we won't extend to real live people (who may not even edit Wikipedia)?</dd>

<p>An IP user came on to that article and heavily edited it placing a speedy deletion tag on it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Bradford_%28professor%29&amp;diff=117462844&amp;oldid=115021953" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Bradford_%28professor%29&amp;diff=117462844&amp;oldid=115021953" rel="nofollow">[116]</a> I removed the speedy deletion tag because it was an invalid reason for speedy deletion (the IP claimed it was "an attack page". I then looked on the talk page and saw the following comment from the IP who edited that article. He claims to be the William Bradford and requests that his article be deleted:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Please delete and preclude any future such articles about me. I am the subject of this grossly inaccurate and harmful page, and on behalf of myself, my wife, and my family, I would like to see it removed permanently.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Why? For the following reasons. My CV is and has always been accurate and has never, save for in the context of this article, been questioned in any way. The article claims that I made claims about my military service, specifically that I "claimed [I] served in the infantry and military intelligence during Desert Storm and Bosnia conflicts, that [I] eventually became a major in Special Forces, and was awarded the prestigious Silver Star." It claims that I "frequently wore a Silver Star lapel pin around campus and had a major's gold-leaf insignia plate on his vehicle." Although I did in fact serve in military intelligence, the particulars of my service and of my honorable discharge in October 2001 were and remain classified, and I have never discussed them, nor can I now discuss them, with persons who lack the requisite clearance and need-to-know. Although various media sources have reported various things about my military service, and have attributed to me various statements or claims, I have not been the source of any such claims, nor have I been accurately named as the source. As to the wearing of a "Silver Star lapel pin around campus," this is also false. The only lapel pins I have worn in the last ten years are the American flag and a rape survivors pin in honor of my wife. As to a "major's gold-leaf insignia plate" on my vehicle, that too is false. I have a Hoosier Veteran plate and a VFW plate, and nothing more.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>At to the visiting professorship in New Zealand in the spring of 2006, I did indeed have conversations with Victoria University, but never finalized an arrangement. Again, the article is written in such a manner as if to suggest that I fabricated this also. Nothing could be more inaccurate.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Finally, the article states that my intent--as if anyone other than me could know my intent with certainty--is to serve as "manager of [my] tribe's up-and-coming casino." This is news to me, as my tribe does not have a casino, nor land upon which to build it. The viciousness and vitriol is unrelenting.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Most or all of these unsubstantiated and unsubstantiable alleged claims are the product, I believe, of those who opposed my quest for tenure two years ago and demonized me for having refused to sign a petition in support of Ward Churchill, the former University of Colorado professor who likened the victims of September 11th to Nazis. Although I was a somewhat prolific legal scholar, I never sought, nor did I achieve, the status of public figure, nor did I wish to become either the champion of the academic right or the whipping boy of the academic left. While I wanted to be treated fairly and granted tenure at Indiana University, I ultimately concluded that I could not and thus elected in September 2005 to resign, effective January 1 2006. It is tragic to think that all it takes for one's character, reputation, and professional life to be destroyed is for opponents to deliberately release misinformation, attribute blame for the misinformation to the subject, and then post articles far and wide across cyberspace condemning the subject and impugning his character. Yet that is precisely, and tragically, what has happened.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>I can't help but believe that the article on Wikipedia and secondary citations to the article are injurious to me in my professional life, and I know quite certainly that they are terribly upsetting to my wife. Last summer I wrote to the author of the article, Joshua Claybourne, requesting that he remove it. It was his wish that the article be removed. However, other persons prevailed in preserving it in its terribly inaccurate and deeply hurtful form. I believe that reasonable persons, in examining the article, would reach two conclusions: 1) it has been shaped by those who intend solely to cause me harm, and 2) although I had some success in legal academia, I am not sufficiently notable to merit inclusion in an encyclopedia. At best, I was a footnote to the Churchill story.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>I am now an MBA student hoping to develop skills that will benefit my tribe, and I ask that you remove this article so that my family and I can be relieved of the anxiety and stress this very inaccurate and hurtful writing imposes upon us. Simply viewing the article and writing to you know is tremendously stressful and damaging to my health, and I have been advised against even thinking about it by my physician. I write only because I wish to regain my privacy and to be able to work for the benefit of my family and tribe unfettered by ongoing attacks such as this. I would also ask that you take whatever measures are possible administratively to prevent my attackers from simply reposting another article about me.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Recent articles in the Wall Street Journal and in other mainstream media outlets have identified a general decline in civil discourse, particularly given the anonymity of cyberspace, and attacking the reputation and character of people through this new medium has become almost a sport. I know that the founder of Wikipedia has pledged his interest in protecting the integrity of his company by being very careful in regards to biographies of living persons in order to prevent the sort of harm that is being inflicted upon me now. I believe that if he were to read my request of you that he would be inclined to grant it. I hope you are of the same view.</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:William_Bradford_%28professor%29&amp;diff=117455368&amp;oldid=115384140" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:William_Bradford_%28professor%29&amp;diff=117455368&amp;oldid=115384140" rel="nofollow">[117]</a></dd>

<dd>The pre-cleanup version had some criticism sourced to a credible, signed article from the Inside Higher Ed website, 12/05/2006 <a href="http://insidehighered.com/news/2005/12/06/bradford" class="external autonumber" title="http://insidehighered.com/news/2005/12/06/bradford" rel="nofollow">[118]</a> that describes the controversy over Prof. Bradford's military credentials. This was removed along with the cite. I didn't track down the reason for removal, which was not mentioned on the talk page. While maybe someone could contest the citation based on parsing WP:RS, Inside Higher Ed seems to be a serious academic site and that Prof. Bradford didn't address the article is cause for concern, to the point that I think I would have to reserve AGF while checking out the claims. A few other cites to the same publication are still in the article. It also seems to me that the current version of the article is excessively SPOV (sympathetic point of view) and I'm concerned that it's misleading. I'll be away for the next few days but may try to spend a little time on this next week. 64.160.39.153 09:55, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My feeling is that if someone comes off a block for personal attacks and continues with the same sort of behaviour, they should be re-blocked. I don't think that I should be the person to do it though, because he is already prone to yelling about persecution. I think that if I were to block him, his behaviour would probably escalate. At the same time, I think that he should be blocked, since he came off a block and returned to the same behaviour that caused the block in the first place. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 07:17, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This user has been blocked several times before.

<p>I think we should just let the matter drop this time, In fact I don't think he should have been blocked over this in the first place. People should grow slightly thicker skins.

<dd>In general, I'd agree with you, and I do get tired of seeing a post here every time (it seems anyway) that someone says something slightly uncivil. However, Rbj has quite a history of making personal attacks, cursing and taunting other editors, restoring the edits of a banned user, and the like. At some point, isn't it time to say enough is enough? <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a></sup></small> 08:49, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Theresa that blocks aren't generally appropriate for personal attacks.

<dd>As one of his more common PA targets, I have to say I'd prefer if he'd knock off all the disruption, and if it takes a longer block to help him get the message, I'd support it. We're here to write an encyclopedia, not babysit those who chronically resort to trolling when they become frustrated that their opinions fail to gain consensus.

<dd>Look, I'll admit to being a bit snarky at times (usually when I'm ticked off), but rbj goes way beyond being snarky, he/she is visciously nasty.

<li>I have protected the article and blocked the sock. I have a sneaking suspicion that this is related in some way to Bridgeman's rather good website, which lifts the lid on sellers of fake peerages, but it could of course be any one of a number of other people he has pissed off. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 12:27, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thanks Guy. I've been in correspondence with Bridgeman about another matter (the recent vandalism/sockpuppets at <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_Templar_f717.html" title="Knights Templar">Knights Templar</a>). He says that his own Wikipedia account is Helper2007 (<a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHelper2007_d1ec.html" title="User talk:Helper2007">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Helper2007_375f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Helper2007">contribs</a>), and that he believes that the recent vandalism on his bio is from his ex-wife, who lives in Bangalore. I'd say the "ex-wife" theory is pretty plausible, judging by the kinds of edits that have been going into the article. I recommend that we reduce the protection to semi for now. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">El</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">on</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elonka_1320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elonka">ka</a> 17:24, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For background: Malber was engaged in sockpuppeting. I posted relevant evidence on his talkpage in the form of a combined contribution log of the accounts in question, and Netsnipe commented on that data. In his comments Netsnipe mentioned WHOIS findings regarding Malber's IP, which Malber had disclosed during an earlier auto-unblock request. Malber was upset because he saw that as a violation of his privacy. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 20:30, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess its so they can request unblock of their IP if their a legit user - not everyone knows there IP if they're autoblocked (well I wouldn't!) <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite">Ryanpostlethwaite</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">talk</a> 00:54, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think Kirill's point is that an admin could lift the block by block number instead of IP number. It's a good idea from the privacy point of view, although might be a technical challenge; this sounds like a question for VP:T or a developer at this point. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 00:58, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>True (as you can tell I haven't branched into unblocking autublocks yet!), but it also allows admins to identify similar IP vandalisms compared to the autoblocked user <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite">Ryanpostlethwaite</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">talk</a> 01:00, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I guess in a perfect world it would be set so that the admin could check the number. Except that violates the privacy policy ... but privacy is breached when the autoblocked editor has to post the IP anyway.... Complicated! <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:02, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It could also be because no one thought about it. Unblocking users via <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ipblocks_table" class="extiw" title="mw:ipblocks_table">ipb_id</a> isn't that difficult from the technical point of view; we already do so for autoblocked users.

<p>Hi Quarl, I am Revivo formerly known as Brasileiro. I am asking you to unblock my Brasileiro1969 account as I am not associated with those other users as you think or like to believe.</p>
<p>You seem to have acted on "complaint" from aLii on your page about me. Alii's comment reads a bit like a footballer who is begging the ref for a red card after one of his fellow players (stubacca) claims to have been fouled.</p>
<p>The comment I removed from you (with explanation) on that SP allegation page, looked like you were necessarily trying to inflict damage to my position, with just saying sonmething along the lines of 'I agree as per above and he deleted one of my edits as well'. That does not strike me as very constructive towards a proper decision by a neutral party. Why am I not allowed to delete one of your entries? Where is the vandalism and disruption in that? Where was the warning from you if you really felt that strongly about the comment you added?</p>
<p>I merely had a content dispute with Stubacca and a discussion with aLii on his wholesale changes to an article without debating first. In my discussion with aLii, though pointed at times, I have done nothing wrong and he tried to leverage the false allegation Stubacca made and discredit me (an allegation which Stuba made as he could not further an edit based on his POV only, which also happens to be your POV on the matter I have read)</p>
<p>And with you as admin involved in this case, you should not be the one who is the accuser and judge rolled into one. An unfair principle, don't you think?</p>
<p>More reasons for you to reconsider what you have done, in my view. I am waiting for your response, which I expect to be balanced, open, honest and with a degree of self-reflection.</p>
<p>I ask you or a truly neutral admin to unblock me and let me be and feel free to keep following me in my tracks as I am not a SP.</p>

<dd>That's true, although everyone's agreeing with the CfD nom for completely different reasons than the original nomination. Even so, I don't think it's ok to delete categories from pages before the discussion is closed. People might wander over there and think it should be speedied as a de-popped category.

<dd>Do you think he even care, I have a contribution of over 2 years here, have had minor problems, have been thanked for my contributions on various occasions with barnastars. They come in, disturb, dusturb and disturb and now I am proposed for a ban. I don't know if it makes any differences to note that the "psychosis" refer to his constant allusions on every given occasion on unrelated articles about how the Armenian genocide is a fake, how it is the product of professional forgers. An event in which both of my grandfathers have lost their parents, brothers and systers. I agree, perhaps I should go write uncontroversial articles, that was my intention, why should I bother being threatned for a ban like this when I have been contributing here for over 2 damn years and have never been blocked for edit warring, kept 2RR as policy for myself, discussed more than enough every of my insignificant changes and I am thrown in the same bag as those who have done absolutly nothing other than edit warring, sock puppeting. Atabek will be back during ban, with a new sock. I won't. The evidences presented here does in no way represent my contributions on Wikipedia, the evidences presented against Atabek does, as he was a new user who came here specifically to creat problems. I do not say I should not be banned, probably I've gone a little to far with my personal attacks. But 1 year is long, very long when you've been here for a long time, 3 months would have been more than enough. He should be more than happy to get veterans banned with him, he did more than enough with this. Sorry for the ranting. Just to throw me in the same bag as Adil, Atabek, Artaxiad and Dacy, is more than I could handle. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 14:46, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In that arbitration case, users who merely revert warred are proposed to be placed on revert parole, while users who have edit warred <i>and</i> engaged in personal attacks are proposed to be banned. This distinction is important, as personal attacks degrade the editing experience for everyone. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:48, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you Thatcher131 for some attention to fairness. Regarding FuturePerfect's comment, so what you're essentially saying that it's OK to commit a violation against a party in ArbCom case? Can you please, point me to a Wikipedia rule that says the user in ArbCom case, even in the last hour of editing permission, somehow has less rights than ordinary editor? I assumed Wikipedia is not a dictatorial environment for "summary executions". After all, I reported a disruption, which is irrelevant of the fact whether the disruptor is in ArbCom or not. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 11:55, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't put words in anyone else's mouth, but my take is as follows. You're about to be banned by the ArbCom for a year for a history of edit warring, personal attacks, and sockpuppeting. You've absorbed a tremendous amount of the community's time, resources, and goodwill already. I have three thoughts.</dd>
<dd>First, your newfound respect and appreciation for our policies is heartening, but looks suspiciously like you're trying to use our rules to fight the same old battles. Please pardon my cynicism. Second, we don't generally like to block parties to an in-progress Arbitration, except for conduct that becomes harmful and disruptive beyond the bounds of the Arbitration. It tends to complicate and lengthen what is already a slow process. Seek a temporary injunction in the Arbitration: a short-leash personal attack parole for some or all of the involved parties.</dd>
<dd>Third, you seem to have confused Wikipedia with a court of law or a democratically-run judicial system. While occasionally our actions may seem to reflect a desire to assume innocence until proven guilty, to punish people who violate our rules, or to treat every editor as equal under Wikipedia policy, this is a coincidence. Our first, foremost – and indeed only – goal here is to build an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 12:57, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This looks like forum shopping. There was clear consensus at the deletion debate that the article could be kept but the links to extremist sites had to go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_attacks_by_the_Armenian_Secret_Army_for_the_Liberation_of_Armenia" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_attacks_by_the_Armenian_Secret_Army_for_the_Liberation_of_Armenia" rel="nofollow">[149]</a>. The same consensus appears on the talk page, with only Cool Cat arguing to retain them and trying to get rid of any warning notice about their content too. The sites linked appear to be self-published attack sites of no scholarly value. Note: I am neither Armenian or Turkish nor do I hold any brief for long-defunct Marxist-Leninist "guerrilla" groups. I was alerted to this page during its AfD and I noticed that the primary concern of some of its editors seemed to be soapboxing rather than providing accurate, encyclopaedic information. My suspicions were further aroused when I tried to ensure the information provided was more accurate and I was accused of "vandalism" and "disruption". Come on, this is the kind of thing that gives Wikipedia a bad name.

<p>Hi Quarl, I am Revivo formerly known as Brasileiro. I am asking you to unblock my Brasileiro1969 account as I am not associated with those other users as you think or like to believe.</p>
<p>You seem to have acted on "complaint" from aLii on your page about me. Alii's comment reads a bit like a footballer who is begging the ref for a red card after one of his fellow players (stubacca) claims to have been fouled.</p>
<p>The comment I removed from you (with explanation) on that SP allegation page, looked like you were necessarily trying to inflict damage to my position, with just saying sonmething along the lines of 'I agree as per above and he deleted one of my edits as well'. That does not strike me as very constructive towards a proper decision by a neutral party. Why am I not allowed to delete one of your entries? Where is the vandalism and disruption in that? Where was the warning from you if you really felt that strongly about the comment you added?</p>
<p>I merely had a content dispute with Stubacca and a discussion with aLii on his wholesale changes to an article without debating first. In my discussion with aLii, though pointed at times, I have done nothing wrong and he tried to leverage the false allegation Stubacca made and discredit me (an allegation which Stuba made as he could not further an edit based on his POV only, which also happens to be your POV on the matter I have read)</p>
<p>And with you as admin involved in this case, you should not be the one who is the accuser and judge rolled into one. An unfair principle, don't you think?</p>
<p>More reasons for you to reconsider what you have done, in my view. I am waiting for your response, which I expect to be balanced, open, honest and with a degree of self-reflection.</p>
<p>I ask you to unblock me and let me be and feel free to keep following me in my tracks as I am not a SP.</p>
