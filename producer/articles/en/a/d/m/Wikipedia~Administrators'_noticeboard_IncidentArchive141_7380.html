<dd>Brevity isn't my forté. The three articles are Shays, Farrell, and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut_4th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006.html" title="Connecticut 4th congressional district election, 2006">Connecticut 4th congressional district election, 2006</a>. I left a summary of the current situation on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FloNight#Escalation_on_Farrell.2C_Shays.2C_CT" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FloNight#Escalation_on_Farrell.2C_Shays.2C_CT" rel="nofollow">FloNight's</a> talk page, but the situation has escalated since I last heard from her: I don't know her timing or if she's around. We have issues of civility, BLP, poorly-sourced edits not using reliable sources, and the latest is the insertion of almost direct copies of Farrell campaign ad material into Shays' article. (Shays should be scratching his head at why we allow that.) With the election in 3 weeks, and BLP issues occuring, mediation might not be the most effective option. There is currently an almost copy of Farrell campaign material on Shay's article: my attempt to remove it and start over was reverted. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 07:42, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm honestly not sure what the issue is. What Sandy calls "Farrell campaign material" consists of three reliably-sourced Shays quotations on the War in Iraq she says are taken out of context. Yet when asked to place them in context or amplify his views, she resists. Instead, we have massive reverts of sourced information, and ceaseless appeals to multiple Admins to block good faith NPOV edits. Fortunately, Wikipedia doesn't have to answer to the Shays campaign, but even if it did, I'm not sure what WP would have to apologize for. Moreover, these quotations are absolutely necessary: Chris Shays has congressional oversight over the Iraq war, as the chair of a top congressional subcommittee, and his views on Iraq are extremely important. These quotations explain those views. It is silly to remove NPOV information about the Iraq war views of a top Congressman with oversight over the Iraq War, just because the Iraq war is a topic in the campaign.<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 07:49, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have not resisted anything: my only edit was reverted, after long talk page discussion of an accumulation of things that needed to be addressed. Yes, Wikipedia does have to answer to any living person, which is why we have <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. The section (Views on Iraq) is written from and structured after Farrell's campaign ad, including direct quotes presented exactly as in her ad, POV and all, with no attempt at encyclopedic tone, neutrality, or balance. It does not behoove Wikipedia for a candidate's article in a widely-watched race to copy, parrot and summarize his opponent's campaign ad material: Farrell campaign material (not a reliable source) is used to source other edits in the articles, in addition to the BLP problems that are occuring. The article cannot be structured to parrot Farrell's campaign ad; I reverted to a previous version to provide a better place for starting over. This is separate from the civility issues, including labeling my attempt to remove the copy of the ad as "vandalism", ongoing failure to assume good faith, and repeated BLP issues. The current content is far from NPOV: it is an exact copy of quotes taken out of context from Farrell's campaign material, with no attempt at context, balance, or neutrality. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 08:16, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The "direct quotes" are direct quotes from Chris Shays, cited and properly attributed in the article to the Connecticut Post and CNN, not from a Farrell Campaign ad. No commentary or POV is added. As for my use of the word "vandalism," it concerned Sandy's removal of a large portion of sourced text here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Shays&amp;diff=81160687&amp;oldid=81156105" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Shays&amp;diff=81160687&amp;oldid=81156105" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I also think this conversation (at least from our end) is probably better suited for the article's discussion page or arbitrartion.<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 08:23, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Direct quotes exactly parroting Farrell's ads. Verbatim. Farrell campaign POV, no balance, no context. The entire section written to parrot her ad. My edit *moved* a lot of sourced material around to accomodate other problems (discussed on talk), and only deleted the section parroting the Farrell ad. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 08:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sandy has been invited repeatedly to provide exactly the context she's talking about. She hasn't done so. These quotations are straightforward -- they aren't "gotcha" quotes by any stretch of the imagination -- and if Sandy feels they need contextualization, she should provide it. Instead, she's trying to turn this into a revert war. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 08:57, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They still aren't completely cited, but I'm about halfway through finding and filling in sources and full text: they are all selective, biased, out of context portions of Shays' quotes, creating POV. "CNN 8/31/2006" is not a reference. So, I'm doing the research to correct a copy violation that wasn't mine. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 10:38, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem this creates for Wiki isn't that hard to understand. You turn on your TV, you see an ad where Farrell is attacking Shays' record on Iraq. You read Shays' Wikipedia article, you see the exact presentation, the exact words, in the exact same order, you just saw on TV in a 30-second sound bite. You realize that Shays' entry in Wiki is Farrell's campaign ad. How can that not cause a problem for Wiki? How do we let that happen? In five years, how does it happen that the only things that Shays has said about Iraq to the press happen to be the exact things, in the exact order that Farrell is saying on TV? Wiki is an encyclopedia: we don't parrot campaign ads. We report the issue neutrally, and comprehensively, without selective quoting resulting in "spin". We need to fix this: Wiki cannot be a copy of a TV campaign ad. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 08:48, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, if "in five years" Shays has said other things of note (which I'm sure he has), then Sandy should by all means post them to his WP article. I did create a "Views on Iraq" section, but by no means am I pretending it's comprehensive. This isn't a problem for wiki, this is a problem for two posters with obvious differences of POV. Again, I'm sorry we're debating this here, rather than in arbitration or better yet on the article's discussion page where I think it belongs.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 08:59, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Who's for protecting both articles? Or should we just block the warring parties util the election is over? Incidentally, Francisx, "some critics" is a weasel term. Name them. Better still, merge both articles to the election article because this is all specific to this year's campaign and is thus getting undue weight on the biographies. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 09:14, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For historical context, to see where these articles are likely headed, look at this beauty of an article: <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_primary%2C_Connecticut_United_States_Senate_election%2C_2006_9269.html" title="Democratic Party primary, Connecticut United States Senate election, 2006">Democratic Party primary, Connecticut United States Senate election, 2006</a>.</dd>
<dd>(<a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Lieberman_34c5.html" title="Joe Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a> was the same after the August primaries: I cleaned it up last week.)</dd>
<dd>At least protect the candidate articles, so they aren't trashed as Lieberman was. (The copyvio/Farrell promo needs to be removed from Shays' article.) Warring parties? The article hasn't suffered much: I've been investing a lot of time on the talk page, just trying to hold down the BLP violations. The weasly "some critics" statement is sourced to the Democrat campaign website, which is partisan, and isn't a reliable source. I changed it; my change was reverted. And the fun hasn't even started: if it's anything like the August primaries, the anon POV and vandal edits will hit the articles hard a few weeks before the election. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 09:47, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>1. If you actually read <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Shays_d751.html" title="Chris Shays">Chris Shays</a> there is little evidence that the article has been trashed. On the contrary, uncontroversial NPOV information on the Congressman has been added. Sandy seems to be trying to wash several politicians' bios.</dd>
<dd>2. Despite oft-repeated claims to the contrary, there is absolutely no copyvio here -- all quotations used are from independent media sources and are clearly fair use. The constant reverts and tags and appeals to admins are highly disruptive and have a chilling effect on WP.</dd>
<dd>3. As for historical context, I had absolutely nothing to do with the Connecticut Senate primary articles, and I think Sandy knows that. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Shays_d751.html" title="Chris Shays">Chris Shays</a> is not <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Lieberman_34c5.html" title="Joe Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a>. The information Sandy is targeting at <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Shays_d751.html" title="Chris Shays">Chris Shays</a> is sourced, NPOV and highly topical.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 19:17, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Correction: as the diffs show, you inserted a direct quote and attributed it to Shays, when the quote you attributed to him was in fact a CNN headline, not words ever used by Shays at all. Reverted per BLP. You can't attribute words to Shays he never said as a direct quote by him.

<dd>If you have issues on the Shays article with wording why not fix the wording? You did so on the Farrell article to ensure criticism stays.

<dd>No, I didn't do that on the Farrell article: you are mistaken.

<p>Perhaps the optimal solution would be for an admin to revert all negative information introduced into any of these three articles between now and November 7th.

<dd>I'd definitely support that, although it depends entirely on your definition of "negative." I don't see how a section outlining Chris Shays' views on Iraq -- the specific grievance here -- constitutes a "negative" addition. As always, the insertion of POV material should be unacceptable. But the candidates' statements and actions are not only fair game, they're essential. The Farrell article especially needs work (it was only recently undeleted) and I don't think a general block on new information would help things.<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 19:28, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I'd rather that both the Shays and Farrell articles be overly positive than to have new edits that could be even <i>potentially</i> considered as containing negative POVs. Sure, all this stuff is fair game in general, but at the end of the day, we're an encyclopedia, not a news service. (In my dream world, all articles about incumbents and candidates would be locked down 60 days prior to an election. Truly important breaking news would always be an exception of course (e.g. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Ney_9284.html" title="Bob Ney">Bob Ney</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Reid_979b.html" title="Harry Reid">Harry Reid</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Foley_ac4b.html" title="Mark Foley">Mark Foley</a>), but run-of-the-mill campaigning would be out.) --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 20:22, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Run of the mill campaign information belongs on the campaign page.

<dd>Okay, three things. 1) Francisx please cease POV-pushing. It is good you are adding sourcing, but the article is about the man not about his Iraq views.

He has a history of posting inflammatory comments to <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html" title="Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenians.html" title="Armenians">Armenians</a>, and their associated Talk pages, including proposals to cite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Armenians&amp;diff=81239736&amp;oldid=81142601" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Armenians&amp;diff=81239736&amp;oldid=81142601" rel="nofollow">Nazi literature</a> to prove his point. The community has taken to simply removing his comments in many cases. His agenda seems to be to prove that Armenians should not be considered Europeans.</p>
<p>I opened a dialog with him hoping to help him understand that this agenda is incompatible with Wikipedia, but he doesn't seem much interested in that. He did, however, seem agreeable to be more civil in attempting to discuss his views and even to filing an RFC.</p>
<p>However, other editors of those articles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aguerriero&amp;diff=81247063&amp;oldid=81239245" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aguerriero&amp;diff=81247063&amp;oldid=81239245" rel="nofollow">brought to my attention</a> that he has a sockpuppet, <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaligvla_061d.html" title="User:Caligvla">Caligvla</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECaligvla_a27d.html" title="User talk:Caligvla">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Caligvla_e0cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Caligvla">contribs</a>). I didn't block it because he didn't use it to evade his other block. He has recently started posting messages to editors' Talk pages though, requesting support of his issue. I have asked him to stop, and file an RFC like I suggested.</p>
<p>Anyway, anyone think this can be salvaged? Would someone here have just indef blocked both accounts? --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 18:18, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ditto. I would also like to point out some of his other edits which included blaming Armenians for "80% of all crime in Glendale", California along with an "outbreak of savage murders". I would also like to mention that Aguerriero is not the only one who assumed good faith and tried to reason with the above user to no avail, <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">Dbachmann</a> and <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> tried to reason with him without any results as well.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 18:47, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>1) I have never once used Nazi materials, Eupator's defination is if a Nazi once read a certain book then that book is now a Nazi book. His comments are abusive.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2) I have tried several times to speak with Eupator directly and offer a rational and polite converstation, his response has been, blanket deletions, constant reverts, and racist accuasions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would still like to discuss the matter with him 1 on 1, I am a fair and open minded person.</p>
<ul>
<li>3) The vast majority of crime in Glendale, CA is caused by Armenians that is a fact. You can contact the Glendale California Police Department at +1 (818) 548-4840, There have been over 20 murders in the last 18 months all of them caused by Armenians. However, I agreed that it was the wrong section to distribute this information as I later found plenty of articles on <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_power.html" title="Armenian power">armenian power</a> etc... they seem to cover the topic fairly. My intent to add the information was not to disparage Armenians but to contribute information that was unique to the Armenian presense in Glendale, CA. Prehaps responsible Armenians in other communities who were unaware of the problem would have great interest and get involved in a group to help reduce the problem.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>4) My only goal is to be honest and truthful, and Armenia is not located in Europe, to propagate this POV is an injury to the European commuinty. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaligvla_061d.html" title="User:Caligvla">Caligvla</a> 01:17, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As far as I can tell, this user is simply angry about her username being used, as it is apparently her real name. I see no 'harrassment' on Richard's part (although he has been incivil in a few cases), but merely an attempt to prevent the confusing removal of the username from talk pages. Frankly, the only harrassment I can see is on Lauren's part, which seems to skirt <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a> more than once.

<dd>Um, it's a him, not a her. Laurent is a chap's name, and in any case it seems to be his surname.

<p>There appears to be quite a bit of sockpuppetry/meatpuppetry going on here. I ran whois checks on two of the IPs (84.77.74.235 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.77.74.235_985a.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.77.74.235">contribs</a>) and 84.77.93.205 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.77.93.205_7f07.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.77.93.205">contribs</a>)), and they're both based on the same ISP (fairly obvious, but I had to doublecheck). These anons are also posing as nonexistent users, and all of them are trying to keep the article, which has been deleted at least six times under various titles. There are also a few votes from brand new users (with no other edits). Would a RFCU be appropriate here? --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><font color="green">des</font><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat">at</a></b> 19:28, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>These edits show a continuing pattern of injecting unsupported assertions into articles, reverting insertion of <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags to these unsupported assertions, using extremely hostile language in his change comments, and confusion of POV statements with what he refers to as "undisputed facts". He seems to think that the burden is on other editors to disprove his assertions, rather than on him to support them. This user also seems to feel that he "owns" certain articles: see his comment to "STOP VANDALIZING MY ARTICLES". This behavior has continued despite repeated attempts to point him to Wikipedia policies on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> etc. Please could an admin do something about this.

<p>This is a bit of a long one, but I want to lay out as much evidence as possible. This fellow was recently given a 2-day block for legal threats, but I've discovered that a year ago, while he was editing under <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.48.73.93.html" title="User talk:68.48.73.93">an IP</a> on the deletion page for his bio, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jean-Pierre_Ady_Fenyo_cfed.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo</a>, he made several legal threats:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gamaliel/Archive_7&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29690054" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gamaliel/Archive_7&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29690054" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>: "I may yet have you investigated for any prejudices you might harbor against any persons, ethnicities or other, in case I may have to seek legal remedies"</li>

</ul>
<p>It is certain that the IP and User:Lightning-Feather are the same. When editing under an IP, the user identified himself as Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo. On his <a href="http://www.infinitysocietyindia.org/jp_fenyo.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.infinitysocietyindia.org/jp_fenyo.htm" rel="nofollow">website</a>, Ady says that his "Native American name" is Lightning-Feather, and on the userpage for this account he again identifies himself as Fenyo.</p>
<p>Strangely, this man was never blocked for legal threats while editing under the IP, even though even a legal threat usually gets an immediate block. The IP was, however, blocked for "mass spammings", which he has kept up under the username (just look at the contribs). Since his activity both then and now was dedicated solely to writing biographies of himself on WP and citing himself as a philosopher in other articles, and since he loves to make legal threats, I suggest he be permanently blocked. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">CRCulver</a> 21:59, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Funny that he accuses me of anti-semitism in his letter too. In his addition to my user-page, he claims that he knows just from looking at the portrait picture of me on my website that I "hate Muslims and Jews". If you look at the AfD discussion from a year ago, you can see that back then he was tarring all who disagreed with him (even Jewish editors) as anti-semites. Yet another reason to have him blocked, he's plainly not a civil editor. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">CRCulver</a> 22:16, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

Look at the edits of the spawner, and edits of the spawned. It's that kid we used to call the "North Carolina Vandal" -- he's <i>imitating</i> Mike. The writing style wasn't quite right anyway, and Mike can spell better than that ("prestegious").

<dd>Probably not. <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">wikipedia:username</a> prohibits usernames which are that of "well-known living or recently deceased people ... unless you are that living person". So if she's the artist, there's no violation. If she isn't , we've still taken a pretty high standard for "well known" (and this artist is well below that, I think). For borderline cases the behaviour of the account can be a giveaway - if they're pretending to be Minor Politician Jim and they're editing suggests it's someone trying to make the real Jim look bad then we'd block and ask for verification that they're really Jim. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 00:12, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not certain if this is the proper place to address this; please redirect me if so. I saw a speedy delete tag put on <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slide_%28guitar%29.html" title="Slide (guitar)">Slide (guitar)</a>, which seemed odd I and started looking into things. The user that had put the tag on, <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeadog.M.S_7661.html" title="User:Seadog.M.S">Seadog.M.S</a>, seems to have something of a history making disruptive and/or vandalizing edits, at least anonymously through 201.248.204.176. This sort of research is a little beyond my proficiency at this point, but it seems this user has been previously blocked and appears to have sought to suppress this information, if I am not mistaken. I wanted to alert those familiar with the user's history so that fitting response is possible.

<p>I would really appreciate admin intervention in restraining this banned user's disruption.

<dd>One problem is that there usually isn't more than one edit per article per day, which doesn't really meet the threshhold for semi-protecting a dozen or more articles. Because Leyasu uses disposable British Telecom IPs, there's no point in blocking once he had logged off for the day. For example, this morning he was at it from 81.156.152.0 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.156.152.0_a3df.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.156.152.0">contribs</a>), but is gone now. Your best bet would be to post to AIV (or maybe here, in case the AIV patroller is not familiar with the history) to block the IP as soon as it starts up. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:28, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><del>Just to catch this on the head. Deathrocker and Danteferno have been banned from changing the article versions until they provide counter sources. Thus, no vandalism.

"Abraham Lincoln was one of the greatest presidents." One DOES NOT have to provide a source for such a statement!!! There is where y'all are a little unclear about the rules here. To even attempt to name "one source" for the above comment about Lincoln is ridiculous. If, instead, you know of a source that contradicts it, it <i>is</i> your onus to find one. Perhaps you also disagree that Lincoln was the 16th president. If you think he was the 15th or 17th, <i>go prove it.</i> Slapping <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> here and there might be enjoyable to you, but that is not the appropriate response to accepted fact.

<dd>Abraham Lincoln is a bad example - he's guilty of winning a Civil War apparently costing more than twice as many lives as Saddam Hussein's Iraq Civil War in 1991 (Saddam's Civil War was imposed on him - I suppose it's possible that Lincoln was in the same position).

<dd>Your example stating that Lincoln is one of greatest presidents is simply an opinion. It's a widely shared opinion, but it is not an "accepted fact". Accepted by whom? Him being the 16th president on the other hand is a fact found in most general reference sources and is easily locatable by anyone - it's undebatable and will never change. Greatest president on the other hand is, as I've mentioned, simply the opinion or the Point of View of a large number of people, and even that could be subject to change. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYankees76_f29c.html" title="User:Yankees76">Yankees76</a> 21:28, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nick, this seems like a classic <a href="../../../p/e/r/WP%7EPERF_8d3b.html" title="WP:PERF">WP:PERF</a> issue... I tend to doubt that Alkivar's signature is really destroying the Wiki, but if it (and others) were having any significant impact at all the <b>devs</b> would deal with it. Trying to make policy on the basis of 'this is better for performance' has consistently caused nothing but aggravation and thus is itself strongly discouraged. As is repeatedly arguing a point and/or threatening users. Have you clocked the nanoseconds 'wasted' by Alkivar's signature image... and does that add up to more or less than the wasted time and aggravation being caused by your argument over it? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:02, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>1st note, i've not read any of the comments above... so this is a straight braindump. Anyway, my take is that there are bigger problems..., but the wacky sigs do piss me off from time to time. Pissing time away talking about images and the like isn't useful. We need to revert to a standard sig, including at least user page and talk page to meet the main reasons for non-std sigs.

<p>It's strongly discouraged to use images in signatures these days. They should ban all images in signatures, though this is only a guideline NOT a policy. I hope Alkivar will remove his image in his signature and just have text in it. I support any ban on images in signature, as it can be irritating.

<dd>The image in Alkivar's sig is not a 600x525 image that is being shrunk to 18x16. It is an 18x16 image, and its file size is 2k.

This subsection of <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> in which we discuss the server implication of such sig images, is several times larger, byte-wise, than the image in Alkivar's sig. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a> 23:51, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Er, that information that you get from right-clicking just means that an 18x16 image was sent down to your browser. It doesn't tell us what had to happen server-side to generate that 18x16 image.

<p>My one and biggest consern with regards to images in signatures is what happens when the image is to be deleted (eitehr since a better one have replaced it or it has been given a "better" name and so on, granted this seems unlikely in Alkivar's particular case but still, if we allow some images as "safe" it's hard to deny others based on that presidence). This have happened several times in the past for example images of national flags have been revamped and renamed to various standards several times, and flags that where often used in signatures therefore where a LOT harder to replace in articles and such because the file links where absolutely bursting with talk and AFD pages and so forth (agrivated by the fact there there is still no easy way to see more than the "top 500" pages an image is used in). <i>Personaly</i> I can live with people having 5 lines of markup as theyr signature (but I would ask them to trim it down), but I don't think images should be used. Granted Alkivar's use is fairly "safe" it's a "stable" image not likely to be deleted any time soon, but still generaly speaking images in signatures are <i>bad</i> that's why we have a guideline that strongly advice against it, and when people see and amin using an image anyway, <i>any image</i> it will undermine what little "power" than guideline has because people will figure if it's ok for an admin to do it they can too. Trying to explain to people why theyr image is bad while other images are ok is hard work, and I would ratehr not wake up one day and find flashy animated gifs runnign all our talk pages, and the "myspace generation" do love theyr flashy stuff. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 11:21, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this matter has been blown way out of proportion. What could have been settled with a few lines of civil dialogue, has now escalated into messy ego-brawl. The image in Alkivar's sig definitely isn't going to crash the servers. However several rookie users look up to the conduct and actions of experienced users and admins for guidance and mimic it themselves. I used to have a image in my signature which I copied (quite ironically) from nathanrdotcom's who helped me out in my initial days. Similarly several newbies may look at Alkivar's sig and say "Hey that looks cool!" and decide to put flashy images in their own signatures which <i>will</i> cause a drain on the servers and subsequent uglier problems. I feel the involved people should take their egos off the line and try to reach an amicable compromise.

<p>As one of only three people in this section to use a standard signature link (and having never ever used a custom signature), I feel I am qualified to tell everyone here that your signatures mostly look crap. You should all get on with writing encyclopedia articles instead of stuffing around trying to outdo one another with more garish colours, superfluous images and unintelligible links to random pages like policy statements, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_59cc.html" title="Special:Blockip">Special:Blockip</a> and your contributions. Images should go because they are ugly and temporary, not because of their server load. Having said this, a year or so ago there were terrible problems with the image server, and images used across the 'pedia (like on templates) had to be removed for a while to ease the server load. So it's not entirely implausible that this may cause problems in the future. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 15:43, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It took me way too long, but I did just read this entire thread. I have no problem Alkivar's use of <b>that</b> image in <b>that</b> specific way. The number of other images that I find appropriate for use in signatures is very small. I agree that Alkivar's use is not directly hurting the project. That said, it does set a precedent if an admin has an image in their sig. I have had problems with radioactively unstable images in sigs before (see my talk archives, pun intended). Unless there is a protected list somewhere of images deemed appropriate for use in signatures and a policy behind what is included in said list, I think it would be best if there were no images in signatures. I understand Alkivar's wanting to keep the same sig and would be interested to know what Alkivar and others think about Freakofnurture's suggestion.—<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a>•<a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian">(talk)</a> 19:45, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Images might not look like a big deal with only a single user having them in their signature; but it definately would not help the project if they are used by a number of users.</li>
<li>Newbie users and non-admins can be persuaded when they are told that it would be difficult for them to secure adminship by the way of RfAs; because there stands a high probability that they will be opposed for violating <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">WP:SIG</a> guidelines.

<li>I propose that this be moulded into a policy and a precedent be set regarding this.</li>
<li>After having a talk with an experienced commons user, I can definately add here that – When they try to delete or move an image, they will not be able to do so easily if that image is all-over the place, as in case of signatures.

<dd>Yes. That would be the "vague speculation" I alluded to earlier. If you want me to take you seriously that this is a serious problem, you need to provide credible <i>evidence</i> that this is a serious problem. Not "Well, a lot of users have images in their sigs, so it's <i>obviously</i> a problem." It's not "obviously" a problem.

<dd>Not at all. It contributes significantly to the topic.
<ul>
<li>Keiichi having and maintaining Lind's an angel is one of the most signigicant events involving the character. Hence it meets #8. I can make a detailed analysis per fair use imaged used on OMG articles here but I'd rather write that in the actual articles.</li>
<li>The style of the series drawing was altered significantly on the past two decades. Having an image per animation generation is only approporate. Featured article <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> for instance has multiple fair use images. Hence it meets #3.

<dd>I concur with Cyde -- we should use fair use images minimally. We can't have galleries, and don't need to illustrate every tiny detail - to be safe (and remain encyclopedic), the idea of one or two fair use images per article is pretty safe. Anything more goes against both safety and is overdoing it, especially for these kinds of articles. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 00:17, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree entirely with AMIB. Overuse of fair use images within an infobox is not acceptable and does fall foul of WP:FUC #3 and #8. If we allow such things to occur then it is simply opening the floodgates to potential copyright infringement problems.</dd>
<dd>It comes down to whether or not those images are significant enough to be included. If they are then they should be included within the article along with, as AMIB states, commentary (which should explain why they are significant). Doing it via infoboxes does not allow for such commentary.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 21:25, 14 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that images were deleted without a discussion. I can put the images outside the infobox with ease however a wikipedia bug is making me hesitate. Section edit links are misaligned when multiple thumbnail images are used.</dd>
<dd>That still does not explain the two deletions.</dd>

<dd>I concur with Cyde here. AMIB did the right thing, indeed. Fair use images should be minimally used. I see no reason for decoration of the article pages with unneeded images. I suggest that <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">User:Cool Cat</a> must discuss on relevant talk pages before reverting the actions of an <s>administrator</s> an established user.

<dd>Ah. I see. The complaint is that AMIB is very very closed to a discussion and that he is taking actions without a discussion to the point of endorsing his actions by using admin tools. His actions on the template have nothing to do with copyrights since the template itself is released under GNU.</dd>
<dd>Weather each fair use image is approporate or not should be investigated on a case by case basis. The "number" of images used is irrelevant, few is of course better and 2-5 is what I'd call "few". The copyright issues can be subject to a debate and this isnt the approporate place for that.</dd>
<dd>A further note. AMIB being an administrator means absolutely nothing to me. Wikipedia is an anti-elitist comunity, infact that is the foundation of our comunity.</dd>

But first, it needs a major cleanup.

<dd>This is a content dispute - not something requiring admin attention. Stop attacking each other and just write out the fact that the name 'Chatham' often gets used to describe what might more precisely be called 'Chatham borough', 'Chatham township', and/or BOTH of those together. Put a nice explanation like that on each page, have 'Chatham, NJ' itself as a disambiguation page to the two articles, and off you go.

<p>The battle should be in the spring. I do not want to participate or even watch. I want to eat all the mulberries I can get ahead of the birds -- it has been a (long ) lifetime habit to wait for them to turn from green, to white, to <i>purple</i>... then eat all within reach! The town? <b>Chatham, New Jersey</b> -- renowned for the best mulberries along the entire railroad, and the reason that <b>Chatham Township</b> never had a "town"! Revert the name, this is nonsense, borough is a definiton of the form or government, the borough of -- you guessed it -- <i>Chatham</i> -- since the 1800s when a village called Chatham withdrew from a township along with two other villages that were along the new railroad -- and population increased greatly in all three. Read the history if you must -- resort to the facts -- seems to be a novel idea among some of the participants in <i>this</i> dispute, but it still remains a handy tool for people building articles in an encyclopedia!</p>

<dd>Hi, I updated several external links to libcom.org because it's been updated to a new structure and several were broken (i.e. more than about 30 iirc, and none originally added by me), while I was doing it, I browsed from those articles and noticed others where relevant links might be added. As stated by a previous poster, most are to articles or biographies of individuals - often the only on-line version available (or at all) and on subjects where they may often be very little material. I therefore do not consider them to be spam and am disappointed that the time I spent correcting broken links has been wasted by what seems to be to be over-zealous editing. -- oops, had to learn how to sign: <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatch_1677.html" title="User:Catch">Catch</a> 17:27, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Clearly a case of WP:POINT? The user signed up in December 2005, over four months before wikitruth.info came into being. You're indef blocking someone because a website came along later and used their name? Mexcellent 00:35, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I, for one, was not claiming WP:POINT. I do, however, think it would (now) prove difficult for the user to operate effectively with such a wikisensitive username. This will probably help him/her in the long run. Note that the account only has 30-or so edits. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 00:43, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It certainly would be hard now, since he's been blocked through no fault of his own. Why not let it go until it actually becomes a problem? This kind of action is what turns people off to contributing. Why don't you suggest a username change and guide him through the process, rather than just blocking him? Or better yet, just leave him be, since he hasn't caused even the slightest amount of trouble. Mexcellent 00:51, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

Blocking him for such a silly reason only reinforces the idea that Wikipedia is as messed up as [wikitruth.info] says it is.

<p>There is still a lot of argument on its talk page that this cannot be a guideline because (1) it didn't follow the proper process for making guidelines, despite the fact that we have no such process, (2) people allege that Wikipedia uses voting all the time (such as in AFD) and therefore we may not advise against voting mentality, or (3) it is said that Wikipedia should adopt more formal mechanisms related to strict voting and that therefore we may not write down current practice.</p>
<p><i>Voting mentality is harmful</i>. Calling for straw polls at arbitrary times is also harmful, as it tends to preclude discussion and compromise. Not using (majority) voting is a long-standing practice. An <i>essay</i> against voting is not going to help because most new users ignore essays as "just a random user's opinion".</p>
<p>I would really appreciate some experienced people giving feedback on the subject on the talk page here; last time I asked, I had about a dozen admins chiming in but their words have basically been ignored, so please try again. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 08:19, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Seems to me that the negative in the title is a problem. If it were "Discuss more, count less" or something, there would be a greater likelihood of overcoming resistance. We do vote, and we do discuss, and our discussions carry with them votive matters and judgments, so it's sort of impossible to tell anyone not to vote. So long as "don't vote" can be read, by either those who hate "process" or those who believe in "process," as "Do as you will shall be the whole of the law," it's going to be a monumental effort to try to move forward. On substance, we might all even agree that we take into consideration all voices, compare them to policy, and then act in a way most likely to generate consent, but if that is called a vote or a discussion will enable bad actors on either side. For every person wanting to halt proceedings to say, "But you failed by 69/31%," there is someone wanting to say, "Notavote! I am elect." In other words, the wording is very important and highly charged, even if the actual ideal practice is entirely rational and beneficial. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:53, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I hear alot of people complaiing about voting, but all the "<i>votes</i>" I see around here are not votes. They are polls so that people can clarify their opinions. In most cases it is a boolean problem siuch as featured picture, approve or don't, or AfD, delete or don't.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even then, the tally is not treated strictly mathematically, but instead the value of the arguement is taken into account. It seems to be that there is not <i>voting</i> going an here and that we are, and have been, acting by consensus. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 16:20, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>My point is that you need to define "vote" and then understand the <i>connotations</i> of "vote" for all users. The arguments aren't about votes. They're about what votes mean connotatively. I am against any AfD, for example, where people say "delete" or "keep" and then sign. That's a vote. I think everyone has to provide a rationale. Having done that, it's not merely a vote in a strict sense, but a vote coupled with a discussion. On the other hand, some people want no restraint on the actions of those who they consider "higher up." Thus, they might cite "not a vote" as a justification for deleting an article against an overwhelming consensus to keep on an AfD. (I'm sticking to AfD as the least controversial. It all gets worse from there.) Therefore, I might say that "AfD is not a vote" and mean one thing, and another person might say "AfD is not a vote" and mean something almost 180 degrees from me. Similarly, if I see someone trying to codify "we do not vote," I might be so resentful or fearful of those 180 degrees from me that I oppose it, even though, in essence, we are almost all in agreement. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:59, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I have told him to stop issuing legal threats and to stop playing internet detective. <a href="../../../j/b/k/User%7EJBKramer_42bf.html" title="User:JBKramer">JBKramer</a> 18:00, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Smart_5ab0.html" title="Derek Smart">Derek Smart</a> article has been a source of edit warring for a long time. A major contributor has been Supreme_Cmdr <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Supreme_Cmdr" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Supreme_Cmdr" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> who is a SPA <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Supreme_Cmdr" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Supreme_Cmdr" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. Numerous discussions on the Derek Smart talk page have centered around the discussion as to if Supreme_Cmdr is Smart himself<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Derek_Smart" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Derek_Smart" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>. As such when Supreme_Cmdr's IP address was posted on his page, a traceroute revealed that both Supreme_Cmdr and Derek Smart have the same ISP. Given the background to the above long discussions to the identity of Supreme_Cmdr, I felt that posting the above information would be relevant.</dd>
<dd>However once JBKramer pointed out that is not acceptable according to wiki guidlines, I have indicated by willingness to stop posting the above information about Supreme_cmdr.</dd>
<dd>The legal threats were not against the wikipedia, it was said in a matter of fact way as regarding to Supreme_Cmdr's serious allegation of racism and racist discrimination <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ADerek_Smart&amp;diff=81204271&amp;oldid=81201968" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ADerek_Smart&amp;diff=81204271&amp;oldid=81201968" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> against me. No action was taken against Supreme_cmdr, and I was feeling bitter about it. I come from a poor third world country and I am not at all capable of legal action against anyone, so that should put that matter to rest as well.</dd>

<dd>I'd like to know who this 'higher authority' he claims to have referred this to is, as that alone makes me think an indef block is in order. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 19:47, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The 'higher authority' was Cowman109 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cowman109" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cowman109" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cowman109&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81631235" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cowman109&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81631235" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>. I see that it was my choice of wording 'higher authority' means probably god to the westerners, whereas to us it is exactly as it suggests indicating someone senior. No offense was meant to anyone.<a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerr_avon_f75a.html" title="User:Kerr avon">Kerr avon</a> 23:46, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I was more concerned you meant some legal body. I have a feeling if you had appealed to God I wouldn't have much say in the matter. No harm done. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 13:25, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerr_avon_f75a.html" title="User:Kerr avon">Kerr avon</a> has compounded his error by repeating the allegation here. We do not attempt to "out" the personal identities of users. Furthermore ... as someone previously uninvolved, I had a good look at this article and its talk page. The article needed cleaning up for such things as grammar, spelling and style, which have been neglected while edit warring has been going on about peripheral issues to do with the the fact that the person who is the subject of the article has evidently been foolish enough to become involved in on-line debates defending his game products against the criticisms of certain games fans. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 11:58, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I closed this deletion debate early after massive sockpuppetry. Of the 80-odd contributions it received in the 36 hours it was on AfD there were about eight good-faith contributions.</p>
<p>In particular there were a number of accounts with nonzero edit histories that just happened to crop up in this massively sockpuppeted vote. I am wondering whether this organisation has actively infiltrated Wikipedia with sleeper accounts, or whether this is coincidence; and also what other action if any we should take. (Of course some of the accounts listed below may be good-faith users who just happened on the discussion). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 20:22, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Aye, probably should have taken it here for someone else to nix, rather than doing so yourself. In any case, this is indeed <b>incredibly</b> fishy. Especially if it continues to a DRv, I'd take it to the sock board or to CU (code D).

<li>The article was about a radio show, so it's easy for them to tell people to go and&#160;!vote in a discussion. The ones that already had wikipedia accounts (active or not) would've been more inclined to go and comment in the first place.

<p><a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">User:Nlu</a> have abused his or her administrator's right when editing the Korean histories.</p>
<ol>
<li>Especially, the editing of <a href="../../../w/i/m/Wiman_Joseon_57ff.html" title="Wiman Joseon">Wiman Joseon</a> by hairwizard91 is more confident and reasonble because it includes more references. But Nlu have reverted the article of Wiman Joseon to the previous one, which has <b>NO</b> reference, and then you added the category of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArticles_lacking_sources_5f50.html" title="Category:Articles lacking sources">Category:Articles lacking sources</a>. His or her editing of the articles about Korean histories were not fair and violate the <b>POV.</b><br /></li>
<li>For <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_History_in_Manchuria_989a.html" title="Korean History in Manchuria">Korean History in Manchuria</a>, hairwizard91 added the category <a href="../../../h/i/s/Category%7EHistory_of_Manchuria_bf77.html" title="Category:History of Manchuria">Category:History of Manchuria</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/r/Category%7EKorea_d0d1.html" title="Category:Korea">Category:Korea</a> , but Nlu reverted it again. I think that <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_History_in_Manchuria_989a.html" title="Korean History in Manchuria">Korean History in Manchuria</a> is related to <a href="../../../h/i/s/Category%7EHistory_of_Manchuria_bf77.html" title="Category:History of Manchuria">Category:History of Manchuria</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/r/Category%7EKorea_d0d1.html" title="Category:Korea">Category:Korea</a>. He considers that <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_History_in_Manchuria_989a.html" title="Korean History in Manchuria">Korean History in Manchuria</a> is not Korean history and History of Manchuria.<br /></li>
<li>For <a href="../../../b/a/e/Baedal.html" title="Baedal">Baedal</a>, it is myth nation of Korean history. So, hairwizard91 added the category of <a href="../../../k/o/r/Category%7EKorean_mythology_0db3.html" title="Category:Korean mythology">Category:Korean mythology</a>. But, Nlu removed the category of Korean mythology.<br /></li>
<li>For <a href="../../../h/w/a/Hwanguk.html" title="Hwanguk">Hwanguk</a>. Hwanguk is also mythical nation. So, Hairwizard91 added <a href="../../../k/o/r/Category%7EKorean_mythology_0db3.html" title="Category:Korean mythology">Category:Korean mythology</a> to Hwanguk. But Nlu revert it without even reading the article.<br /></li>
<li>For <a href="../../../g/o/g/Goguryeo.html" title="Goguryeo">Goguryeo</a>, his editing does not follow the rule of POV. As everyone already knows it, Goguryeo is still controversal nation that is Korean or China. But, he added the following sentencen. <i>The term 'Goguryeo' is the revised term based on the changes in the law of Romanizing Korean language,Hangul, in 2000. The Chinese pronounciation of the word 'Goguryeo' is 'Gao Gouli'. But since most people in the world recognize the Goguryeo kingdom by the name 'Koguryo,' the old way of Romanizing Goguryeo, the Chinese utilized, for their benefit, the Korean pronounciation 'Koguryo' in order to register Goguryeo tomb sites as Chinese in 2004 and to validate their assertion that Goguryeo kingdom is part of Chinese history, not Korean.</i>This sentence is too subjective, and should not be used if following the rule POV. Because hairwizard91 removed his sentence, the artifle of goguryeo is semi-protected. It is not the right way of an administrator.<br /></li>
<li>For <a href="../../../d/o/n/Dongyi.html" title="Dongyi">Dongyi</a>, Hairwizard91 added the historical Chinese records with <b>correct citations</b>. But, Nlu blindly remmoved the article with correct citation.<br /></li>
<li>For <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nangnang.html" title="Nangnang">Nangnang</a>, there are actually two things; one is <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nangnang_nation.html" title="Nangnang nation">Nangnang nation</a>, and the other is <a href="../../../l/e/l/Lelang_Commandery_12b3.html" title="Lelang Commandery">Lelang Commandery</a>. Hairwizard91 added two redirections for <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nangnang.html" title="Nangnang">Nangnang</a>, but Nlu modified the redirection only to Lelang Commandery, which is established by ancient China. Nangnang nation was established by Korean. He may not want to progress the article about Korean history.<br /></li>
<li>For <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jin_%28Korean_history%29_92a8.html" title="Jin (Korean history)">Jin (Korean history)</a>, I dont understand the article is semi-protected. Nlu have justed blindly semi-protected the article. The sentence added by 67.38.248.16 is followed the history book of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseon_Sango_Sa_77c1.html" title="Joseon Sango Sa">Joseon Sango Sa</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As my examination of Nlu editing, he or she removed and reverted the article if the new sentence or content is the Korean history that is not taught in <b>China.</b> He did not follow the rule of <b>POV</b>...</p>

<p>I am not against NLU but you want cooperation and then ban the user, thats not really in the spirit of cooperating, you also sprotect an article without discussing it with the person you were keeping from the article, also not very in favor of discussion. I believe Wikipedia is a colaborative project, as such reverting an article without explanation on talk or even in the edit summary isnt really working in that spirit. Also since one article was sprotected, this is a matter for AN/I and not just mediation since it then involves admin tools, including the wide spread ban above to a anon user, who when asked to, made an account to discuss this issue here.</p>
<p>I guess the main question is, are they mythical nations, if so why remove the cat, if not then is there any proof? --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 13:45, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I tried to reason with the user (see, in particular, the discussion on <a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">User talk:Nlu</a>) after the user initially indicated that he/she was willing to abide by <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>.

<dd>The reason why I reverted the user's edits was because he/she made so many, there is no way to go back and pick out the one or two good edits and let them stand. The user is effectively going, "I may have made a bundle of bad edits, but let my 1% of good edits stand!" Well, this is similar to the vandals who put in sneaky vandalism; there is no good way to distinguish the good with the bad. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 15:57, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly, don't bother blocking this IP since it belongs to a public library and I don't intend to sock puppet this thing. I needed a to give my view etc and so forth.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>1) Last I checked nearly every comic book image on this site is a copyright violation. Also last time I checked, Jeff Christiansen (founder of marvunapp) doesn't own the images, Marvel does. Hence, why I said that they were from Marvel. Marvel = owner of pictures, not Jeff. Also I put the pictures up in good faith. I didn't realise it was gonna coz such a fuss. So listen up. Khlog - it was summarized somewhere else actually and extended it. It's not my fault that Khlog also has a page on the Appendix. I only got his bibliography using a mixture of the appendix and the chronology project. Ditto with Orrgo. Fangu, yes but I was changing that one back. It was to prove a point that he wasn't such a menial character. Kraa the Unhuman I did not abbreviate or slightly reorder. I extended it since that how he was summarized. As for the have the master guide on it. I was using it as storage as I was just bloody reading it. Correction, I used the bibliographies from marvunapp, marvel, the handbooks and the chronology project. How is this a copyvio? Good God are you not seeing the same site as I am. Everything is a violation. The summaries of episodes, the list of characters, pictures from the WWE which are property of the WWE. EVERYTHING! And like I said I didn't "purloin" anything from any other site without stated that the image was in fact owned by Marvel. Under fair use Marvel Comics are the owner, not the fansites I "purloined" them from. And I stated when uploading them that they were indeed from Marvel. But how about looking at the comic project properly, and you'll notice basically every image is taken from another site.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Having looked through a few of these examples, I can say that the issue is really fair use of images, not misuse of copyrighted text. All those images are appropriately marked as fair use: the question is whether or not Wikipedia is willing to defend that fair use now that someone is complaining. I wouldn't have made the indefinite block myself, but if it helps to appease Marvel while we clean this up, I think it's okay... and the Fangu case shows that Originalsinner is still violating copyright, it's not just something that happened 9 months ago. I myself think we have pushed fair use a little too far here. I think it's reasonable to include frames of comics in order to illustrate characters we write about... but using the same images as the Marvel Universe appendix over and over is not okay: there's creativity in the choice of which image we use, which we are also copying, and I don't see any fair use justification for that. Also, there's the issue of who actually owns the scan of the image, but I'm not sure if that matters. And this is Marvel we're talking about: the only thing they actually <i>own</i> are their copyrights -- we have to be careful dealing with them. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:12, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Are Marvel complaining, or just the person who initially scanned the images and placed them on the web? Any copyright violations of text from the www.marvunapp.com site should obviously be removed. The images, I'm a little less clear on. The site itself is, as far as I can see, a fansite. It's not affiliated with Marvel, and seems to claim no copyright on anything, although the copyright notice displayed there is badly worded. I guess I can see the problem with using the same images over and over, but I think it may be best to get a proper opinion on this. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 12:39, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just adding though, that we have written some guidance on the fair use of images sourced from comics, and we do guide that people should list the web-site they source the image from when they upload it, if they haven't scanned it themselves. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_copyright_ae12.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics/copyright">Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics/copyright</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 12:43, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem is not the fair use images from Marvel. As pointed out, these are fair use and I don't think they pose a problem. The problem is the text. In at least some of the cases that I've investigated carefully, there has been a problem with paraphrased text that constitutes a copyvio. The fact that it is paraphrased makes it hard to find, because a google search comes up empty. But the sentence and paragraph structure is the same with only slight changes in word choice, in the cases I've seen, and there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that these have been copyvios. As I see it, that establishes the credibility of the complaints from marvunapp.com, and since Originalsinner has done nothing whatsoever except mutter obscenities in response to concerns, it is up to us to clean up the mess.</p>
<p>And that's time consuming because the only way to do it is go through each and every article marvunapp.com has complained about and try to look for parallel text in Originalsinner's contributions to it. In some cases we might conclude that there is enough departure from the original marvunapp.com text that there isn't a copyvio. In other cases we will have to decide whether to remove the affected text or revert to the pre-Originalsinner version, and either way there is still the potential problem of copyvios in the history.</p>
<p>I do want to make the point that marvunapp.com has already gone to considerable trouble to identify and communicate the cases they're aware of. While I realize that there may well be some false positives in their list, it really isn't their job to police <i>our</i> articles once they've established a pattern of copyvios.</p>

<p>Since I was the person who brought up the copyright violations and image pilfering, I hope no one minds if I chip in here.</p>
<p>Regarding the examples of plagiarism, I am happy that Wikipedia as a site deals with them and appreciate that its difficult to police the users. Its your choice to decide to do what you want with regards to blocking or not blocking Original Sinner; from where I stand though, I asked Wiki moderators to tell him to not take from the Appendix on multiple occasions, I have no reason to doubt this was indeed done, and he has persisted doing so. I'd rather not waste my time or anyone else's with having to constantly police his articles and request they be removed when and if he copies again, BUT I will do so if I have to.</p>
<p>Regarding Original Sinner's older edits. I don't expect any of you to have to go back through them. I accept there may well be more plagiarised material there, but I don't hold that against Wikipedia. I don't actively hunt through Wikipedia looking for plagiarism, but I do browse the site, and I know the Appendix style well enough to spot most cases of copying. If there's other stuff Original Sinner has posted in the past, leave it there for the moment, and I will find it sooner or later, and at that point flag it up for checking and removal.</p>
<p>On the images: as I've said EVERY time I have brought up images being taken from the Appendix, I accept that we don't own the copyright, Marvel does. However, while I generally don't mind the odd image being taken from another site, its the sheer extent of the copying from the Appendix which gets me. We don't maintain that site just so other sites (or their contributors) lazier than ours can plunder us willy nilly because they can't be bothered to do the work themselves. Its just plain incredibly rude, and I'd hope Wikipedia would be better than that. I'm sure Original Sinner knew he was being out of order taking so many images, based on his claiming the source was Marvel.com rather than the Appendix - "And I stated when uploading them that they were indeed from Marvel" - well, no he didn't because Marvel.com is a specific site, and while owned by them, is not the same as Marvel the comics company. That was, to me, a clear case of obfuscating where he got the images from, and I can think of only one reason to do that; he knew we'd not be happy about it. Can I force you to remove them under threat of legal action? Tricky, and I wouldn't want to go down that path even if I was certain I could (but fair use can fall down dependent on volume taken from another source, so I might have a case). But can I ask, as a simple case of good manners, for those images to be removed? Yes, and I am asking. If people want to use images from our site, then they can ask, and we usually give permission, so long as we get credited and it isn't a wholesale taking of every image they can lay their hands on. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.12.174.51 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.12.174.51_7785.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.12.174.51">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I've just blocked this IP address as it has been clearly carrying on the edits of User:Fmaack. His edit pattern involves the article on Andrew Nellis (also Andrew Bruce Nellis) and their DRV debates. I blocked Fmaack for a week for trolling after he did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Nazi_Party_leaders_and_officials&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=80686545" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Nazi_Party_leaders_and_officials&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=80686545" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which itself didn't occur in a vacuum: Fmaack had previously been blocked for personal attacks. Fmaack got pissed off at this and ended up leaving an unblock message that got him blocked indefinitely. While I don't disagree with that decision, what I stand by for sure was my 1-week block for trolling, which was being evaded via that IP address. Still, I would appreciate review from others: should this user really be blocked indefinitely?

<p>Dear Jimbo Wales,</p>
<p>I'd like to request a comment from you concerning THC's role as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. I think this discussion (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alzheimer%27s_disease#THC" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alzheimer%27s_disease#THC" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alzheimer%27s_disease#THC</a>) could provide interesting insight into how Wikipedia really functions and could be used for future references. If you consider the discussion worth commenting, I'd appreciate it if you would have time to read through the entire thread about the subject and give an opinion about what is about to happen there.</p>

<dd>Do you mean advertising THC? That is not my point. As I said, I might be wrong. I am sorry if turning to Jimbo Wales seems strange to some of you, but people who I am having this debate with turned to the person responsible for the medicine Wikiproject who I consider pretty highly respected person too as far as Wikipedia persons go. I'd like an opinion from someone who doesn't see THC as nothing but a substance. In my opinion the last sentence in the comment by JFW in the discussion thread showed that his view on this is biased. --Jnx 13:31, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Everything in science is based on scientific studies, which are used as sources on Wikipedia articles. Please read the discussion thread, this case needs someone who is objective (and possibly not from the medicine Wikiproject) to take a stance. My point is not to turn this into 'who can appeal to the highest power', I'd just like to find someone who really knows how to be objective. --Jnx 14:33, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do realize that I went overboard with my theories about hiding this fact but I got angry when I tried to make a discussion and the arguments from the people whose opinions differed from mine were absurd. You are right about letting go though. Maybe it's better to concentrate on something else now. I just thought I saw something here that wasn't what Wikipedia is about. You can remove the THC study from the article as far as I am concerned. --Jnx 15:07, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Now, most of them have been deleted, apparently for no reason. Please advise me on what to do now. Regardless of what happens, I think this is a perfect example that there needs to be some mechanism to keep administrators such as Freak of Nurture accountable for their actions. Right now, there appears that there is no accountability for his actions, and I'm worried for the project if there are other users that act in a way like this, let alone several. -- People Powered.</p>

<p>A user, in good faith, uploaded Image:Jennifer Aniston.jpg. The source for this particular image, flickr, claims that this image is licensed under the Creative Commons license. However, the uploader on flickr (<i>not</i> the person who uploaded the image to Wikipedia) has a number of other images which he similarly claims are licensed under CC while being blatantly obviously untrue. I believe this image also was not licensed under these terms. The person who uploaded the image to the Wikipedia claims rightly that I need to provide some evidence that the image was not released under the CC. Aside from the flickr page itself, I can't find this evidence. Can someone help me out? --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 16:52, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I disagree this image can be kept. I did a search through the public domain commercial usable images. Wikipedia states if an image is found there it can be relesed. Until that image is removed from Creative Commons it is allowed to be used on Wikipedia or a citation is needed proving that that specific image is not open source. My proof is that it was found on Creative Commons commercial section: <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/?q=Jennifer+Aniston&amp;commercial=on&amp;engine=flickr" class="external free" title="http://search.creativecommons.org/?q=Jennifer+Aniston&amp;commercial=on&amp;engine=flickr" rel="nofollow">http://search.creativecommons.org/?q=Jennifer+Aniston&amp;commercial=on&amp;engine=flickr</a> <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 16:32, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My evidence, by the way, is that the flickr uploader also uploaded other pictures such as DVD covers that are blatantly obviously not licensed under the CC. And this image is very similar to standard Friends promotional images (albeit cropped) which have never been released by NBC under the CC license. The creative commons search page simply takes as accurate the license that is attached on the flickr page. If the uploader uses the wrong license, as seems to be the case here, the image will still show up. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 17:14, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There has been a weeks-long campaign to inject promotional material from Linda Christas International Schools into dozens of existing articles across WP (+ creation of new single purpose articles), using a large number of sockpuppets, including attempts to get around deletions. Linda Christas is currently protected from being re-created, although at last check, Linda Christas International School was still up. These editors have spammed dozens of articles, and it's increasingly difficult to keep up with them and their new sock puppets. Currently deleting AFD tags as well. Certain articles that are being targetting multiple times daily, including <a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Grafton_a580.html" title="Sue Grafton">Sue Grafton</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Boone_7b0f.html" title="Pat Boone">Pat Boone</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Spellings_dc3f.html" title="Margaret Spellings">Margaret Spellings</a>, <a href="../../../e/f/r/Efrem_Zimbalist_58c0.html" title="Efrem Zimbalist">Efrem Zimbalist</a>, and <a href="../../../e/f/r/Efrem_Zimbalist%2C_Jr._5b73.html" title="Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.">Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.</a> need to be protected.

<dd>With respect Gnevin, I'd suggest you may have been a little over-sensitive to this particular 'incident'. Being from Northern Ireland, I found feline1's comment to actually be slightly humourous. You were right to correct him/her with regard to your userpage (on which I saw one "emblem" which I don't regard, in its context, to be 'Irish nationalist' at all). His "some proddy git", I would have thought, would be more deserving of a polite reminder of WP:CIVIL. Unless s/he makes another, similar remark, I would suggest that it be forgotten. I honestly don't think they meant to cause any real offence with that initial remark.. at least, it was more of the style "a pox on both your houses". Just my thoughts on the matter - I've seen much worse. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 05:01, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>JS, even if they are blocked here, it doesn't prevent them from requesting passwords due to a bug in the mediawiki software. So yes, until that's fixed setting up a filter is a good idea.

<p><a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochdale_5ee1.html" title="User:Lochdale">User:Lochdale</a> is repeatedly deleting whole paragraphs and relevant passages from the Elvis Presley article.

I don't know for what reason he is doing this, but there can be no doubt that his primary aim is to constantly harass me by removing my contributions, wrongly calling them questionable or original research. See also the history of this user from the beginning. In fact, my contributions are well sourced, as everybody can see, as I have used many independent sources, among them mainstream biographies and university studies. The activities of this user are not acceptable. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 23:08, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As soon as User Onefortyone's most recent probabtion (for the same article. An article that he has been banned from several times) was lifted he went right back to editing the Presley article. Once again, the same use of selective quotation and questionable sources have been used to support his original research. Indeed, both his mentor <a href="../../../2/2/0/220.html" title="220">220</a> and another editor <a href="../../../2/2/1/221.html" title="221">221</a> told him to stop (in no uncertain terms it might be added). This user's entire reason to exist on wiki appears to be to get as much scandal and gossip written about Presley as possible. The materials you quote are either take out of context or are selective. I think your own mentor put it best (and if I can be forgiven for quoting him here) when he said: <b>— Just because something is sourced does not mean that it belongs in the article</b> and <b>Wikipedia is not the place for revelations about Elvis Presley's sex life. Wikipedia is not interested in obscure and rather tenuous factoids or inferences about a dead rock star's sexual relations.</b> Emphasis his, not mine. <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochdale_5ee1.html" title="User:Lochdale">Lochdale</a> 23:15, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are repeating yourself, Lochdale. Did you actually read the passages you have deleted? I don't think so. Otherwise you would not have written such things. The majority of the material you have deleted does not deal with "revelations about Elvis's sex life". I hope that some administrators will have a close look at the material you have removed. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 23:21, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most of what I removed was relating to Presley's sex life (your favorite topic). I do hope an admin looks at your editing history and sees how it focuses almost exclusively on Presley or on people who may be related to Presley (whom you then try to cross-reference in the main article). [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurens_Johannes_Griessel-Landau" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurens_Johannes_Griessel-Landau" rel="nofollow">Here</a>]you basically create an aticle and then try and cross-reference into the main Presley article. Or [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Adams" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Adams" rel="nofollow">here</a>] where you have heavilly edited another article all to suggest that Presley was homosexual. You have been banned from this article before because you have an agenda. The section of the "Elvis Cult" was so POV and disjointed that it warranted removal. As I noted, even an admin and your own mentor noted that that section was not relevant to the article. <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochdale_5ee1.html" title="User:Lochdale">Lochdale</a> 23:28, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are wrong, Lochdale. You have deleted material concerning the Elvis cult, the FBI files on Elvis, etc., all of which is well sourced. Another user said on the <a href="../../../e/l/v/Talk%7EElvis_Presley_f65c.html" title="Talk:Elvis Presley">Talk:Elvis Presley</a> page that the paragraph on the "Elvis Cult and its Critics" includes "a lot of great information" but needs some rewording. So other users think that the paragraph should not be removed. By the way, you should also have mentioned what administrator NicholasTurnbull said on August 4, 2006:
<dl>
<dd>Lochdale:, it does ... seem some of the edits (but not all) that you have made are not strictly in line with WP:NPOV, which I hope you will work on satisfying in the future. I might also ask whether you would be willing to enter into a voluntary hiatus from editing the article for a period of time until the dispute has settled a little. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 23:37, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my opinion, Lochdale, you are part of an Elvis fan group that endeavors to suppress well-sourced information from the article which is not in line with the positive view you have of your favorite star. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 23:44, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please do not try and deflect from the real issues at hand here which is you pushing your agenda. It appears that anyone and everyone who disagrees with you is part of this "conspiracy" (a "conspiracy that your mentor and an editor have told you to drop). It's a favourite and rather unpleasant tactic you routinely employ. The article is choc full of negative comments about Presley including his heavy drug abuse so don't try and suggest that the article is a puff-piece without your edits. Do remember, this is an entertainer we are discussing. Not a politician or a religious figure. <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochdale_5ee1.html" title="User:Lochdale">Lochdale</a> 23:54, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Intrestingly, adminstrator Turnbull never banned me from the article and has been quite clear in his concerns over your edits. I would note that when you were banned (again) from the aticle that there didn't seem to be any edit wars at all concerning the article. Every other wiki contributor managed to edit the article without issue. <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochdale_5ee1.html" title="User:Lochdale">Lochdale</a> 23:58, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Policy is meant to protect the <b>encyclopedia</b> not 'users we like' over 'users we do not'. Any user, whether 'we' like them or not, who calls someone an "asshole" is clearly violating NPA and should be asked to stop... because WP:NPA exists to protect the encyclopedia itself, not so that we can pick and choose which users are allowed to behave badly. When we act that way rather than being civil it is disruptive and damaging to the project as a whole. This should be obvious, but somehow we always get these ridiculous arguments that 'it is ok for admins to be incivil to the users they are blocking for incivility'. It is <i>understandable</i> for people to slip up from time to time when provoked/angry, but it should never be allowed / accepted. Users are routinely blocked for comments like those from several people above. We either need to start blocking 'favored' users like admins just as routinely (which would generate more conflict but at least be less hypocritical) or extend the same leniency to regular users who get angry / lose their cool from time to time. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:49, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fine, CBD, but stand that on its head.

<dd>I'm with CBD here. Although, yes, Jaranda was dealing with trolls, it's not appropriate to use personal attacks against them. It encourages their trollish behavior. I know that's not really the reason we have <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> in place. Plus, admins are supposed to set a good example, so violating NPA at all (even towards bad-faith users) should be strongly avoided. In the end, though, we can't make a big deal about it: an ordinary editor would just get a warning. I'm more concerned about Jaranda quitting than anything else. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:02, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Admins are human (shock). I'm very concerned that Jaranda didn't feel he could reach out for support from other admins. I have to wonder if the somewhat poisonous environment on this noticeboard is part of the problem. Anyone who comes here with this kind of situation will be lectured for daring to slip up and exposed to public humiliation. Not from me--I'll block the sockpuppeting troll and call it a job well done.

<dd>Jaranda had left before anyone said 'boo' about it... and given that we expect regular users to somehow deal with the much greater "public humiliation" of being blocked, your classification of gentle 'um, you should not do that', type comments to admins as too "poisonous" to endure is an absurd double standard. If we expect them to deal with it we ought to be tough enough to do so as well. You pull out the old false dichotomy of 'do you support the troll or the admin' again above... I support Wikipedia and the civility policy which helps keep it from being a snarling mass of obnoxious behaviour. <b>Anyone</b> who violates that should be asked to stop. Tolerating or excusing it from admins serves only to make claims of bias <i>true</i> and <i>promote</i> attacks and burnout of good users. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 15:28, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Idiot isn't a strong personal attack. In some cases, frankly, it's descriptive. The later comments came after harrassment via the talk page and email.

<p>Please look at this. I don't believe it qualifies as a personal attack but this user is over the edge - repeatedly suggesting and inserting into articles that an organization (PLANS) (an organization I am loosly associated with) that is critical of Waldorf Education (another organization I am associated with) is a "hate group". This has been going on for months. The article "PLANS" contains many edits where he continually included this language and the talk page has more of this. These claims spill over to the Rudolf Steiner article and the Rudolf Steiner's Views on Race and Ethnicity article.</p>

<p>Amazingly, he supports this "hate group" claim with links to his OWN diatribes both here at Wikipedia and on his OWN personal websites. We've put up with this for a long time.

<dd>The italicization issue is the least of it--in fact I think Brya has a (very narrow) point on that subject. What is of more concern to me is Brya's unwillingness to cooperate, tendency to claim ownership of articles, and abusive behavior towards several other editors (not just me) who have dared to try to edit those articles in any way. See discussions in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Tree_of_Life_7339.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tree of Life">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tree of Life</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Plants_7183.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Plants">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Plants</a>, particularly with regard to the <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomen_nudum.html" title="Nomen nudum">nomen nudum</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomen_conservandum.html" title="Nomen conservandum">nomen conservandum</a> articles, for the tip of the iceberg.

<dd>I agree with the block. It should be long enough to at least assess and correct all the damage done. As there are few botany editors this might take a while. I think Brya's one supporter shows a serious lack of integrity, almost as if Berton is trying to show how poorly even Brya's supporters think of her, so should not be taken too seriously as a supporter, but also not as evidence of a single, negative, type of support for Brya. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 18:48, 17 October 2006 (UTC)~

<dd>Tajik appears able to speak for himself quite well, and others at <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> agreed with my concerns about the seriously Iranian POV of the article, not just NasarKhan, and ultimately Tajik left many of the edits stand and is actually trying to make things work out--what one should try to do--in spite of his frustration, well placed, at NasarKhan's edit style, and in spite of disagreements about content with NasarKhan. You might want to compliment them on how much they are trying to do, rather than criticize. I suspect that after the holidays the two and others concerned about Afghanistan articles at Wikipedia will work things out, as everyone is actually trying to do over their now, in spite of thousands of years of disagreement.</dd>

Possibly this is just a misunderstanding due to language barriers. However, your presenting these side arguments just like Brya does have made me change my mind about calling for only a temporary ban on Brya, and I now vote for a permanent one. If you want to discuss Tajiks, Pashtuns and Iranians, take it over to the many lively discussions on the various Afghanistan and South Asian boards right after the holy days and see how things work out. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:21, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The biggest issue with Brya is his/her disruptive effect on other botanical editors, through (1) reverts, (2) snarky edit summaries, and (3) comments on talk pages that disparage the works of other editors and push his/her POV. I think the "palaeodicot" issue is overblown, but it is precisely because of the climate that Brya has fostered that other editors would see an insidious aspect. And in some cases Brya's legitimate corrections have fed the controversy, whereas the same corrections from a less contentious editor would have been easily accepted. I support a block, to allow other editors to sort out the issues without interference. I won't support an indef ban, but I fear that when Brya returns, so will the problems.--<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurtis_Clark_2ae7.html" title="User:Curtis Clark">Curtis Clark</a> 13:53, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not "arbitrary" when the editor has repeatedly been disruptive, uncooperative, rude, insulting, and abusive towards numerous other editors. It is not "arbitrary" when the editor has repeatedly pushed a particular POV in articles, and refused to let others express another POV or even a NPOV. It is not "arbitrary" when an editor has repeatedly asserted ownership over articles and refuses to let any other editors touch them. It is not "arbitrary" when all of these behaviors have been observed, documented, and commented on by numerous other editors. It is not "arbitrary" when it has been corroborated by third parties not involved in the disputes. It is not "arbitrary" when Brya has been treated with kid gloves for well over a year, and given a second chance many times over. Like Curtis Clark, I have no doubt that when Brya returns, he/she will continue to edit and behave in exactly the same fashion. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 14:24, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Berton, while it is certainly unusual for someone to be 'community banned' without ever having been blocked before... Brya's comments had become increasingly condescending towards many users and Wikipedia in general. Do you see any chance of that changing? Because if not I don't think there is much hope of a long term future here. Brya took the position that the majority who disagreed with him were wrong and that Wikipedia suffers from allowing their views... which is never going to fly in a consensus driven project. Sooner or later that's going to lead to a community ban. If he were willing to compromise his preferences in favor of reasonable standards adopted by consensus then past contentiousness could be forgiven, but consider the APG III issue... clearly a standard which doesn't even exist yet cannot be 'verifiable' and has no place in determining the content of Wikipedia articles. No? Yet I haven't seen Brya agreeing with that seemingly inescapable truism. Instead, he has suggested that APG III <i>will</i> exist and will follow the standards he has argued... which may well be very reasonable guesses, but still are clearly 100% unverifiable. That can't work. Wikipedia can't be a diviner of what the future holds or an arbiter of what the best nomenclature system is... that isn't and should not be our purpose. We document current views of the world, whatever they may be, but Brya seems to want to instead document the 'correct' view. There needs to be some kind of change in his approach, and I don't see any indication that he agrees with that. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 19:01, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did not know that Brya had never been blocked, and this surprises me. However, when someone is allowed to continue disruptive behavior, that person can escalate the disruptive behavior directly as a response to being allowed to do so. This is my opinion, of course. But I see it a lot in web communities. My suggestion is ban Brya for as long as necessary to clean up or verify all of her pages, then allow Brya to return, if that is what Brya desires. Other posters may be right that the disruptive behavior will return right along with Brya, but if it does then just implace a permanent ban.</dd>

<dd>May I politely ask that we refrain from calling other editors a <b>monster</b>? Imho this is against wikiquette. <a href="../../../t/e/u/User%7ETeunSpaans_fef5.html" title="User:TeunSpaans">TeunSpaans</a> 08:35, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To have "created a monster" is a figure of speech in American English (not sure about elsewhere) that has certain connotations, often used self-disparagingly, or disparaging the creator of the "monster". One more example of across-language misunderstandings, which I think have contributed to this whole fiasco. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 13:11, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I favor the indefinite ban also, I keep running across random plant articles that Brya has scrambled in one way or another (entirely deleting genus list from a family article?), and it's going to take a while to clean up. Also, I would want to hear evidence of a change of heart about how to interact with other editors. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 13:05, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This ban proposed by Petaholmes it is a blatant attempt lynching of user Brya that a long time passed making great contributions mainly in the areas of Taxonomy and Botanical Nomenclature, and with me this user always went gentile and I never had problems with him (unlike novices).<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerton_d054.html" title="User:Berton">Berton</a> 13:21, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Keeping me involved in this is simply seen by Brya and her supporters as an invitation to continue personal attacks on me to guarantee that only Brya be allowed to dictate how the Botany community on Wikipedia is run. Any responsible new editor to Wikipedia Botany will see their duty to correct misinformation Brya has sent through Cyberspace with the Wikipedia stamp on it and will start changing them. Then, after they have made hundreds of edits, many to Brya's false references, fake groups ("APG III"), and spurious remarks about time frames, they will be personally and falsely attacked for their low number of edits in a vicious and disingenuous manner by Brya until they leave.</p>
<p>If you attack newbies for their low number of edits you are doing far worse than biting them, you are outright giving them notice that Wikipedia does not welcome newcomers or want the contributions of anyone who cannot spend all day and all night contributing.</p>
<p>The Botany pages at Wikipedia need a lot of work to be useful to the Cyber-community. Until they have been attended to they should come with warnings about potential misinformation.</p>
<p>And, as long as Brya is in here personally attacking people, even while being blocked, they should come with warnings that newcomers will be personally attacked in a visious manner by Brya and her supporters for their contributions.</p>
<p>And, by the way, to the Dutch-Brya supporter, Brya introduced spurious references to APG II in the Dutch Wikipedia also.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia Botany community has worked hard over the past year to maintain Brya as a high contributor of personal attacks, point of view, and edit wars. Well, keep Brya, then. But warn newcomers of the potential consequences of attempting to contribute to the plant community on Wikipedia and warn Cyberspace communities that use Wikipedia about her speculation, point of view and false references.</p>
<p>I posted this in the ToL project and my talk page. Brya should rest assured that she has won this battle, as she has won all of the others. She would be right in every things she has called me, especially her personal attacks on my reading ability, intelligence, number of edits and fear of facts, if I kept contributing to Wikipedia in light of her and her supporters' treatment of me and any newcomer who edits and points out her false information all over Wikipedia and Cyberspace courtesy of Wikipedia and Brya.</p>

More than five of the images he uploaded have been found on other websites - not like Getty Images where it would show he was the photographer, but on personal webpages at tripod or geocities where the photographers are unlikely to notice or complain. Four of these images were also uploaded to other websites claiming to be from various people - for instance, a photo of children from Georgia originally posted in 2005 to a homepage hosted at tripod was uploaded by Ldingley to Wikipedia last month claiming the author released into PD and listing the author as Rebecca James - source was given as trekearth, another site where the same picture was uploaded at the same time but under a different name; the photo has also been found on two other photo sites, all uploaded around the same date. As much as I'd like to assume good faith here, I find it hard to understand how he could have accidentally uploaded several photos from personal homepages, not his own, mistagged them, attributed them improperly and now claim that he buys said images for upload? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShell_Kinney_fd26.html" title="User:Shell Kinney">Shell</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">babelfish</a></sup> 20:25, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please dont call me a rat, its not nice and your tone if not really constructive. Please present evidence where I stole photos from "geocities" or "tripod." (I need to see them to charge their owners with photo theft). The children photo was actually by Mike Bugneri and Rebecca James. It is my fault that I didn’t include Mike. However, do not accuse me of image theft from geocities (actually maybe they uploaded my images which are available online) and call me a rat. Im sorry but im not a rat and you are smelling something else.

<dd>One example is Image:Georgian kidssvanetia.jpg and Image:Georgian kids.jpg. The first image listed the source as trekearth.com (which calls Mike Bugneri the photographer) and the second <i>identical</i> image was listed as being from your personal collection. The image, in fact, comes from <a href="http://svanetitour.tripod.com/" class="external free" title="http://svanetitour.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow">http://svanetitour.tripod.com/</a> and has been on the web since 2005 at that location. Some of the other images I deleted came from news agencies, which which were also claimed as "in your collection". Third, your most recent upload which you listed as public domain and are now claiming that you have permission for may have been copied from a book (I'll have more details as soon as I verify my source is correct). I'm sure I'll find more examples as I continue to review your contributions.</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry if you've been told by people that they are selling you these images with their copyrights; this doesn't appear to be the case in any of the instances I've come across so far. While it is taking some time, I have found an online source for each photograph I've reviewed so far.

<dd>I'm going through recent changes to Images by anons, and found several where the description has been modified, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Svanetiabeauty.jpg&amp;curid=5934973&amp;diff=82516667&amp;oldid=75297230" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Svanetiabeauty.jpg&amp;curid=5934973&amp;diff=82516667&amp;oldid=75297230" rel="nofollow">this change</a>. Here are the changes by the anon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Svanetiabeauty.jpg&amp;curid=5934973&amp;diff=82516667&amp;oldid=75297230" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Svanetiabeauty.jpg&amp;curid=5934973&amp;diff=82516667&amp;oldid=75297230" rel="nofollow">[88]</a> to images uploaded by Ldingley. I reverted a few of the anon edits before I realized this a problem, and the anon might be correct. I reverted those back to the anons. version pending further examination of what the actual source (TrekEarth) is. If TrekEarth is the source, these are copyrighted, not free to uses here, and need to be deleted. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 02:15, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think this a good reason to ban this user for not assuming good faith. I don't know where he gets off accusing me of being a troll. Not only that, but I haven't done anything wrong. All my edits are in trying to get rid of a user's negative comments about wikipedia. MathewFenton keeps adding back the user's negative comments because they were friends. I have checked the history and I see that they are good friends. He is showing biased toward the user and doesnt' care about wikipedia. I have even given explanations in attempt to talk out why I don't like the user's negative comments. Mathew Fenton continues to erase them without any explanation and then continues his unacceptable behavior by coming here and slandering me. I think this is calls for a ban. He also has erased my comments from Charlesknight's page repeatedly. You are not allowed to erase comments from pages and I have had to add them back several more than 3 times.

<dd>I would have contacted you directly, Crimsone, but figured you would want some other admin to throw the switch this time.

<dd>Thanks Newyorkbrad - much appreciated. As you say, his pattern of behaviour really was beyond the pale, so I figured that it made sense just to mention it to Centrx, who'd blocked him earlier. On the upside though, it's always nice to be called welsh! The blnking of warnings wasn't really the problem, but he'd blanked quite a lengthy page, even after telling him that he should arhive rather than blank (I wouldn' mind betting he already knew that mind.</dd>

<p>Hmmm. Seems that even as an indef blocked user, he's insiting on blanking the talk page and re-inserting the "<i>glossary</i>", even after centrx's revert.

<p>So this 82kb and growing behemoth has been open for 9 days and was relisted at AfD today for further consensus. At this point it is either a <i>keep</i>, <i>delete</i>, or <i>no consensus</i> and keeping it on AfD is just increasing the pain for the admin who eventually has to read through and close this... so any takers on puting it out of it's misery now?

<p>I thought I could protect these pages by putting the protection tag on them myself, but I guess there is more involved than that. These pages are vandalized on a regular basis.

<p>Sometimes, the people will erase the entire article and just leave a single <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">profane</a> word in its place. Other times, they just rewrite paragraphs, throwing in raunchy words to make the subject look like a sex-starved pervert, especially in the <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashi.html" title="Rashi">Rashi</a> page.

<dd>I see you've directed Kingboyk here, but I would strongly recommend asking him privately on his talk page first and giving him a chance to reply before posting on ANI in the future. I've also taken a cursory glance at the situation, and I don't find anything wrong with the unprotection. The article, a relatively high-profile one, had already been semiprotected for over two days; semiprotection is not meant to be used generally for lengthy periods of time.

<dd>Thank you for your comments. This article is regularly vandalized by various anon vandals about ten times a day every day whenever it is not semiprotected. What in your opinion should be done in such a case? Blocking individual IPs does no good, because the vandalism comes from <i>many</i> different IPs. I fail to see any reason against long-term semiprotection—particularly for a high-profile article. If nothing can be done, good editors will just take problem articles off their watchlists, the vandalism will go uncorrected, and the reputation of Wikipedia will suffer. --<a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a> 01:43, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is explicitly in violation of the spirit of Wikipedia to have any page protected or semiprotected for a great length of time. Unfortunately, this means that very high-profile pages get vandalised often, but high-profile pages also tend to be the most watched, and thus the vandalism is always fixed within a minute or so. Except in the case of sudden and extreme onslaughts of vandalism, pages should not be semi-protected at all; in the case of concerted vandalism efforts, blocks combined with day-long semi-protection nearly always solve the problem. —<a href="../../../c/u/i/User%7ECuivienen_fddf.html" title="User:Cuivienen">Cuivi</a><a href="../../../c/u/i/User%7ECuivienen_Esperanza_0e62.html" title="User:Cuivienen/Esperanza"><font color="green">é</font></a><a href="../../../c/u/i/User_talk%7ECuivienen_9aca.html" title="User talk:Cuivienen">nen</a> 02:36, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see no mention (or implication) in <a href="../../../s/e/m/WP%7ESEMI_521e.html" title="WP:SEMI">WP:SEMI</a> about “sudden and extreme onslaughts of vandalism” or “day-long semi-protection.” What it does say is “A page can be temporarily semi-protected by an administrator in response to serious vandalism, in which the page is getting a large number of vandalism edits from so many different anonymous … accounts that blocking them individually is not a solution. … Semi-protection is a temporary measure used to stem vandalism on a page until the attack of vandalism is regarded as over. Some articles with a history of vandalism, such as <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> or <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a>, may be semi-protected on a continuous basis.”</dd>
<dd>It seems to me that this applies to <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>: The page is getting a large number of vandalism edits from so many different anonymous IPs that blocking them individually is not a solution. Any time semiprotection is removed the vandalism returns shortly; so the attack of vandalism cannot be regarded as over. Like <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a>, the article has a history of vandalism, which suggests that it be semi-protected on a continuous basis.</dd>
<dd>If is not fair to the editors who watch an article to rely on them to revert vandalism that you could easily block. If this unprotection stands, I for one will stop reverting anon vandalism on this article. And I suspect that a lot of other resident editors will feel the same. --<a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a> 07:11, 18 October 2006 (UTC) modified --<a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a> 22:13, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a>, I'm sorry the vandals are bothering you. :-( Having our articles open for editing without an user account is an important Wikipedia philosophy. Many of our most experienced editors started out by fixing a small error in an article as an IP address. Semi-protection was primarily intended for articles with few people editing them. They might have a defamatory text or blatant vandalism added and no one would notice for months. This is not a problem for high profile articles like Edison. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 01:00, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Rather, this is a rehash of the ongoing <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Removing_warnings_45df.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Removing warnings">debate</a> whether removing talk page warnings is a blockable offense. Reid's version of the templates isn't very nice, but neither is "stop this or we'll block you". I would likely have unblocked if not for the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:John_Reid&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=82167578" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:John_Reid&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=82167578" rel="nofollow">Reid asked us not to</a>. Instead, I would suggest mediation between Reid and 254. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 09:56, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>From what I can gather Reid objected to the 'you may be blocked for removing warnings' wording on the grounds that it isn't true (admins seldom block for such - especially as alot of users place highly questionable warnings). In place of that he was trying to redefine the purpose of these 'do not remove warnings' templates to cover people who habitually remove perfectly valid warnings and then continue the disruptive behaviour. His wording was over the top and I tend to think that such people are rare, blocked repeatedly, and thus don't really need to have warnings displayed on their talk page to identify them as trouble... it's all in the block log. Personally I'd like to see these templates go away and would have said so when they were TfD'd had I known about it. Every other day we have some kind of problem related to this 'users cannot remove warnings' philosophy coming up on this page. User talk pages exist to promote discussion... not for harassment or as a 'wall of shame'. The whole concept is just wrong. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:35, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If someone were to TfD them again, I wouldn't mind either. A note here would be wise since the people who actually have the power to enforce the template language (but don't) hang out here. I don't see how it helps to have warning templates that threaten blocks that most admins do not support. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 11:50, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The problem with TFD is that, in this case, it's backwards. There appears to be no consensus on this issue either way. That means that we cannot make it policy (which would require consensus in favor) and neither can we delete the templates (which would require consensus in opposition). The prime solution, of course, is rewording the templates to match reality. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:45, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This isn't quite picking up trash, either. This is more like someone from Nebraska arriving in New York City for the first time and making corrections to the bus schedules. Helpful indeed, but not typical behavior for a tourist. There are a couple of issues here. One is that bots require approval; to keep them from running too fast, to have someone else review the code, and to make sure there is a human available in case the bot screws up. A second issue is that <b>if</b> this is Maru, he has been warned repeatedly about unauthorized bots, and some of his bots in the past have made mistakes, that he was rather indifferent to. Further, Maru is a few days away from an Arbcom decision that he may not use a bot. (Which could have been avoid entirely if he had been willing to go through proper channels to have his bot approved; which mystifies me entirely.) I don't have a particular opinion about this bot, or even if it is a bot, but if it is a bot it should go through channels and if it is Maru, he should have to follow the ruling in his arbitration case. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:46, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To address what some people have been saying. Bots are not always fully automated and unsupervised, it can be just someone running some manual scripts but editing at a fast rate. These all need community approval (<a href="../../../r/f/b/WP%7ERFBOT_2557.html" title="WP:RFBOT">WP:RFBOT</a>) to make sure that there is no harm, which obviously has not ben done here. Apart from flooding <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a> together with the other user I mentioned, and causing a massive backlog, there was no damage done in the current redirect tagging (all deleted now) - but what if he would have misfired? Or if at that pace of 9 redirects per minute would have continued for much longer, <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a> would have been so completely overflowed that other pages needing speedy deletion (perhaps more urgently that dead redirects) would have been left undeleted for longer. Maybe it would be much more beneficial to just get admins to go through the redirects themselves without filling up <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a>. Of course this issue was not discussed at all, while of course it is a good faith editor he needs to go through the proper channels for approval.--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konst.able</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/n/User_talk%7EKonstable_e0b7.html" title="User talk:Konstable">Talk</a></sup> 21:48, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm... a few days ago we had an apparent bot doing rollbacks on wikibooks (from an admin who had otherwise been MIA for many months). Kinda looked like a test to me (though again, it wasn't an unreasonable series of changes that were made, just rather startling to see so many rollbacks in the log within such a short period of time). I wonder if there's some new software floating about somewhere that's being tested out. --<a href="../../../s/b/_/User%7ESB_Johnny_4962.html" title="User:SB Johnny"><font color="green"><b>SB_Johnny</b></font></a>|<sup><a href="../../../s/b/_/User_talk%7ESB_Johnny_91f0.html" title="User talk:SB Johnny"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup>|<sub><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:SBJohnny" class="extiw" title="b:User:SBJohnny"><font color="green">books</font></a></sub> 11:32, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A poll has been started on whether a certain user should be banned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tree_of_Life#Community_ban_of_Brya.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tree_of_Life#Community_ban_of_Brya.3F" rel="nofollow">[119]</a>.

<dd>I also have no prior familiarity with the incident, however just to comment about polls deciding a community ban, I'm completely against it. A community ban issue should probably be the result of free-flowing discussion, not votes. <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 13:43, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know anything about the incident either, however polling is a find way to aid discussion. As long it is not taken as straight voting. If you look at that page, yes they are polling, but they are explaining their votes.</dd>

<li>Er, no. By my count, at least half of the participants are <i>not</i> in fact explaining their votes. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:00, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
<dd>That is my point, by your <i>count</i>. Now if you see somebody saying that the way they counted a poll should determine consensus than that is wrong. The people who did not comment, did not contribute much to the discussion. However the method is still a good way to talk. It is not polling that is evil, it is using the results of a poll as a reason to do something that is evil. imho. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 15:23, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough, but for more information please scroll up this very page to the discussion titled "Is a community ban appropriate in this case?" which is where this (talk of blocking, not the original dispute) all started in the first place. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 15:10, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A few comments: first, the poll was initiated only after <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">User:Brya</a> had been blocked by an admin (see discussion above), with the agreement of several other admins but after the objection of at least one editor. The poll was announced in the discussion on this page as well as on the project page. Second, perhaps it wasn't clearly stated but the poll was never intended to be a vote to block or ban Brya, but rather a poll to see whether there was <i>support</i> for blocking or banning, <i>an action that had already been taken</i>. Third, most of the votes are indeed explained, if you take "agree with MrDarwin", after I had made comments that others apparently agreed with and saw no need to expand upon, to be an explanation of their votes. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 15:57, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mr Darwin is correct. That poll was run concurrently with an ANI discussion (not in a vacuum) to gauge how other members of the community who are not usually invovled on ANI felt about the matter. Methinks too many people are allergic to the word poll, however it is a valid form of discussion. No one has said this was binding or the last word. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 22:16, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know that the IPs were related to this user (it doesn't seem like his MO), but I've spoken with him and he has agreed to leave the RfA discussion alone. I also made it clear that one more personal attack would result in a block. I will monitor his edits and the RfA (which I won't participate in, so as to remain neutral). -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope"><b><font color="#006699">Merope</font></b></a> 20:36, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sosomk's behavior here is quite over the top. The personal attacks on the RfA, as well as the edit warring over them, and the very inflammatory comment Ghirla quotes above are bad. Further, he responds to warnings from two different editors with contempt for civility. While I pearticipated in Khoikhoi's RfA, this seems to me clear cut incivility and trolling, and I have blocked him for 24 hours <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 22:07, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article on the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Hunting_Association_170e.html" title="World Hunting Association">World Hunting Association</a> has been problematic, because editors apparently associated with the Association are desperate to eliminate all reporting of the widespread, high-profile criticism the Association has received. Previously I was involved in a long back-and-forth dispute with User:Pete1080. He started out simply vandalising the article but eventually he was engaged on the talk page, gradually grew more reasonable and finally a consensus appeared to be reached. That version was stable for many weeks, until User:Worldhunt came back on the scene. That user has repeatedly blanked criticism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Hunting_Association&amp;diff=79843759&amp;oldid=76624167" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Hunting_Association&amp;diff=79843759&amp;oldid=76624167" rel="nofollow">[130]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Hunting_Association&amp;diff=82208242&amp;oldid=81909240" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Hunting_Association&amp;diff=82208242&amp;oldid=81909240" rel="nofollow">[131]</a> and maliciously altered external links to make them not work <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Hunting_Association&amp;diff=80521197&amp;oldid=80517547" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Hunting_Association&amp;diff=80521197&amp;oldid=80517547" rel="nofollow">[132]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Hunting_Association&amp;diff=81217999&amp;oldid=80973491" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Hunting_Association&amp;diff=81217999&amp;oldid=80973491" rel="nofollow">[133]</a>, labelling some of these edits with a "minor" flag, and has persisted despite receiving vandalism warnings on <a href="../../../w/o/r/User_talk%7EWorldhunt_e7e3.html" title="User talk:Worldhunt">User_talk:Worldhunt</a>. I suspected judging by the name that he actually wished to dispute content, so asked him to take it up on the talk page. He has not done so in any meaningful way and has continued to vandalise, but he did make one comment describing my reverts as slanderous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:World_Hunting_Association&amp;diff=81217194&amp;oldid=71796138" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:World_Hunting_Association&amp;diff=81217194&amp;oldid=71796138" rel="nofollow">[134]</a>, so I have posted this request for investigation here rather than <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>.--<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussell_E_272a.html" title="User:Russell E">Russell E</a> 19:53, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm considering just protecting the page so that it can only be edited by administrators for the time-being. The user has reverted too many times, and some other admin is bound to go crazy and block her/him for a while for repeatedly removing of the sockpuppetry messages.

<dd>Er, we don't use the sockmaster template as a <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scarlet_Letter_cf68.html" title="The Scarlet Letter">scarlet A</a> to brand editors who have made mistakes in the past. Per the comments above, we only use such templates on the user pages of permanently or indefinitely banned editors. I would <i>strongly</i> object to blocking Mattisse for removing a tag from his own user page when that tag shouldn't be there in the first place. In general, it's considered bad form to edit war over the contents of a user page belonging to an editor in good standing. I think it would be best to consider this a lesson learned for Ekajati and Nishkid64, and move on.</dd>
<dd>Obviously if Mattisse engages in disruptive behaviour (creating new sockpuppets, for example) it would be appropriate to consider a block. It's really not fair to block him for removing a template that shouldn't have been placed in the first place. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 00:00, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I completely agree. On top of that, the template was removed for over a month and during all that time, the admin who originally placed it did not complain. If Ekajati has a problem with Mattisse removing this on his own page, he should IMHO take it to <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">User:Hanuman Das</a> directly.

<dd>It seems that Nishkid64 has seen fit to revert to a version of the user page with the tag and protect that page with the template in place. I'd appreciate further review here, if only to know if I'm totally out in left field here. I don't want to go unprotecting and removing the tag as the first shot in a wheel war, but it troubles me that a couple of non-admins (Ekajati and Ryulong) were edit warring with another editor over something like this. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 00:14, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I guess the whole situation was a misunderstanding. I did not know when exactly to put a sockpuppeteer tag on a user page, and I frankly didn't think it was that big of a deal before you brought it up. If you believe that my actions were unjust, then by all means go ahead and remove the tag. <a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009"><b>kid</b></span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue"><b>64</b></span></a> 00:33, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding a block of this user: IMO not yet, but the user must be warned about the words they choose (see Ryulong's example of such an edit summary above). They may feel harassed, but this is becoming uncivil on their part as well. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 00:40, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can see how an editor might be a bit peeved when other editors keep erroneously – albeit with the best of intentions – replacing a sockpuppeteer template front-and-centre on that editor's user page. I note that Mattisse removed the template twice without comment, including once after a bordering-on-snide edit summary from Ekajati (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mattisse&amp;diff=82272568&amp;oldid=82251275" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mattisse&amp;diff=82272568&amp;oldid=82251275" rel="nofollow">"puppetmaster template may not be removed, you made the bed..."</a>).</dd>
<dd>I'm normally a stickler for civility, but I really would hate to see this issue further escalated when a user is upset because we admins happen to have made an error. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 00:47, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

Then another user posted a somewhat inflammatory comment, to which several users responded with comments. Then one of the possible single-use accounts removed those comments. I reverted to replace them. Now the discussion is heading rapidly downhill. Could we have some administrator intervention, perhaps?

<p><a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">User:Gene Nygaard</a> has been moving lots of stuff around lately. His rationale was that articles which have Latin letters which are not in English alphabet should have redirects which have only English letters in it. Which is fine. And he created those "redirects" by moving the whole page. Which I think is not fine. He was warned by <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a> no to do that but he ignored him and proceeded by moving <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chanoz-Ch%C3%A2tenay_db19.html" title="Chanoz-Châtenay">Chanoz-Châtenay</a> to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chanoz-Chatenay_3b90.html" title="Chanoz-Chatenay">Chanoz-Chatenay</a>. Now, I know there are some people who think English Wikipedia shouldn't have letters which are not from English alphabet, and there are those which think it should since it's native spelling and letters like â still are in Latin alphabet. But, what I wanted to ask was: if I think that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chanoz-Ch%C3%A2tenay_db19.html" title="Chanoz-Châtenay">Chanoz-Châtenay</a> should be titled <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chanoz-Chatenay_3b90.html" title="Chanoz-Chatenay">Chanoz-Chatenay</a>, am I disruptive if I move the whole article (instead of just creating a redirect)? Aaaaand, am I disruptive if I move it the other way around? Because, it seems to me that current consensus on this matter is to keep the status quo, not to enforce one of this two solutions. Am I right? Or did the community come up with a policy on this since the last time I checked? --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 08:53, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dijxtra describes "two camps", those who think:
<ul>
<li>English Wikipedia shouldn't have letters which are not from English alphabet</li>
<li>it should since it's native spelling and letters like â still are in Latin alphabet</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I'm in neither camp. First of all, keep in mind that there is a difference between manual-of-style issues, and the naming convention issues which deal with assigning the one slot available for an article's name.</dd>
<dd>The names of Wikipedia articles <b>may</b> contain diacritics, but those versions are not always the <b>appropriate</b> name to use. Our Wikipedia article is not at <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rom%C3%A2nia.html" title="România">România</a>, though a redirect from there does exist. Our Wikipedia article is not at <a href="../../../h/%E1%BB%93/_/H%E1%BB%93_Ch%C3%AD_Minh_340b.html" title="Hồ Chí Minh">Hồ Chí Minh</a>, though a redirect from there does exist.</dd>
<dd>However, there are also only <i>some</i>, in fact a <i>very few</i> of the possible thousands of different letters with diacritics available in Unicode as single letters or in the more problematic combining forms (and others in use not available in Unicode even then), that see any significant use in the English language.</dd>
<dd>As pointed out in <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28standard_letters_with_diacritics%29_1c6e.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (standard letters with diacritics)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (standard letters with diacritics)</a>, "Diacritics should only be used in an article's title, if it can be shown that the word is routinely used in that way, with diacritics, in common usage."</dd>
<dd>In huge numbers of cases, diacritics have been slapped on article's names without any discussion of whether or not it is the appropriate spelling to occupy the slot available for an article's name. It might be; it might not be.</dd>
<dd>But when those moves have been made, then at least the redirect from the former spelling remains behind. Redirects don't solve all the problems; articles can still be <b>hidden</b> from many search engine searches as a result of these moves accompanied by spelling changes within the article itself.</dd>
<dd>Similarly, my moves for reasons along these lines don't disrupt anything. All the links to it still work. Entering the name with diacritics in the "Go" box still works. Nothing is broken, but in a great many cases something is fixed: former redlinks in other articles now get to the article. They will still get to the article even if somebody in the future moves the article again.</dd>
<dd>When article names do have diacritics, it is absolutely essential that:
<ol>
<li>Redirects are created from the spelling without diacritics (other common variants are a good idea as well). <b>Redirects don't <i>just happpen!</i></b></li>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">indexing sort key</a> be fixed so that articles will sort properly in categories, according to English sorting rules (note that without using sort keys, they do not sort in accordance with the rules of any other language either; they merely sort in Unicode number order). <b>Categories don't just sort themselves automatically.</b></li>

<dd>They are not "wrong titles". They are correct spellings in the English alphabet. We have every bit as much right to establish our own identity by using our own alphabet in our writing as the people who has no other way to establish their identity than to see how cute they can get with their letters. Most English-language newspapers, for example, choose to limit themselves to the English alphabet in most cases. It is much more disruptive to have it so that someone reading about something, someone, or some place in a newspaper cannot find an existing article about it in Wikipedia, than it is for some hot-headed chauvinist to enter his non-English alphabet spelling and get redirected to an article that doesn't use the squiggles in its name. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 10:09, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>The fact is that redirect creation and index fixing <b>is</b> useful; however, we do not have carte blanche to fix these things with any method. Sticking to this method just because it raises awareness, when there are other less inflammatory and disruptive ways of achieving the same end is an abuse of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. What is most sad is that if after creating a redirect with a page move <i>he then moved it back to its original title</i>, he would have achieved all his aims listed above <b>and</b> there would be no outside complaints (as page-naming consistency would not have been broken and no double-redirects or time-wasting caused), and this discussion would not be taking place. I think intervention has become necessary. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquilina_e23d.html" title="User:Aquilina">Aquilina</a> 10:39, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, please, can we do something about this? In a lot of cases he's inventing new Anglicised spellings for things that don't even have an existing common form in English.

<li>I have left a strongly worded message for Gene. Creating a redirect is trivial, doing it by moving the article is not trivial, and is pointless and disruptive unless consensus exists to do that for <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> reasons. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 10:56, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is past history here. Further, redirects against consensus, in either direction, are not disruptive, while movement is. So, if this user does not immediately stop moving without (or against) consensus, I'd support a block. Just as I did <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive130_2e94.html#User:Gene_Nygaard_pages_moves" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive130">last time</a>. I don't see that much has changed. The user did not get blocked but also apparently did not change behaviour. I don't actually care about the arguments pro/con, I care about whether the behaviour is disruptive. If the arguments are valid, non disruptive behaviour can nevertheless achieve the needed change. BTW I do not buy the "you didn't do A so I get to do B instead" argument. If A is needful, and doing so is not disruptive, while doing B is, do A. Don't do B instead, that seems obviously not the thing to do. 22,000 edits or no. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 11:37, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Those aren't the type of moves people are complaining about here. Moving JTFG back to Joint Task Force Guantanamo is a justified move, for WP:NC reasons - it's the most common name. Moving Çandarlı to Candarli is not a justified move however, because you did it just because there was no redirect, not because of any argument of usage. There is a clear distinction between cases here, and the second type is disruptive, and these are what you have been told to stop. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquilina_e23d.html" title="User:Aquilina">Aquilina</a> 11:48, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those are <b>exactly</b> the kinds of moves being discussed here. In some cases, I have undone them; in other cases, someone else has. The point is, when there has been no determination of the proper wording to occupy the one slot available for an article's name, I am just as free to indicate my opinion and preference by making a move as anybody else is. Sometimes my preference prevails, sometimes it doesn't, but that doesn't make my move wrong in any different way than the undiscussed moves the other direction. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 11:53, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not see whats disruptive if he is not edit warring over it, he is doing the move to incite comment, if people move it he doesn't edit war and its apparent to him others feel it should be in the native spelling, if they leave it, then its obvious noone cared. He is just being BOLD, and since there is no edit warring I really do not see the problem, are edit histories being lost? are messages being lost no the talk page? I mean what exactly is the disruption being caused by the moves? the 2 seconds it takes someone to move it back? If he is fixing category listings in some cases then just leave it be, at least if half get moved back then at least half got fixed according to the categories alphabetizing. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 12:08, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He is creating work that others need to fix at articles that he is not actively editing. This is like changing British to American spelling, which is a blockable offense.

<dd>You say its disruptive, but what exactly is the disruption? What is being lost? is a page move really that hard to fix? Isnt he fixing the categories at the same time? If he was moving them to the correct location and losing redirects would that be disruptive, since its creating the need for other work to be done? If fixing some of these names create secondary work are you stating people shouldnt start something unless they can do it completely? I have in the past converted most of an article to cite news format for its references, is this disruptive because only half was in cite news then and I left work for someone else to finish it? If he moves a page and it gets moved back because of concensus what is the issue? he is not edit warring over them. Its like reverting a vandal, if he made 50 edits, do you revert everything or do you waddle through all 50 to find out which are legit and which aren't? Sometimes the mass edit way is the better direction isntead of starting and attempting to keep track of 60+ page move discussions. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 12:36, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to add a note, JTFG is more common usage then Joint Task Force Guantanamo, I think people just do not realize that because they are looking up written mentions, where the person writing has to spell it out. Newspapers cannot simpyl refer to it as JTFG, much like they would write out Rolling On the Floor Laughing and not ROFL, its just proper to do it as such.

<dd>Just creating redirects to names <i>with</i> diacritics is "fine", too. That helps increase the chances the articles can be found, and that is just as effective in fixing redlinks in other articles as moving the page is. Furthermore, doing so does not <i>screw up</i> the indexing sort keys, as moving instead of creating redirects does, when the mover doesn't actually go and fix them. That does't mean that mass, undiscussed moves along those lines are, nor that such a move cannot be undone. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 13:05, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no reason we should require ArbCom when there is clear support for a community sanction. I propose that we ban Gene from unilateral page moves to "fix" diacritics, citing as precedent the SPUI case and others where page moves to support a particular view of what constitues the "correct" title have been decided to be disruptive. If he refuses to accept a community sanction then we go to ArbCom. We can propose a community sanction via an RfC, I guess. In the short term I see no problem with blocking him for a time if he continues the disputed behaviour. This should not prejudice his starting a debate on moving any given article, if there appears to be good reason to do so, but unilateral moves are out. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 15:18, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, so we could ban him from moving articles. If he feels an article should be moved, he can propose it WP:RQM. I just don't think we should indefblock him, that's all.

<dd>I don't think so. If there is a clear consensus on the page move, there are other 1025 administrators to move it. This guy is on a verge of being baned from the community altogether.

<dd>There has to be an exit strategy... does this ban last forever? That's why I suggested clear consensus. If he is absolutely banned we will never know if he has changed his ways. That said I'm not driving here, just supporting what I see consensus forming to be and I am, as we all are, open to discussion, I would think. Community bans or article bans are an area we are still feeling our way about, so I'm not sure where this would be recorded even... seems impolite to hang it on his userpage forever, but it will get lost here quickly.

<dd>We can put him on 6 months probation. See, determining consensus for a move can be a bit tricky. He can always say "I thought that was a trivial move". He has a bunch of space for gaming the system out. If we forbid him moving the pages for 6 months, he'll get the habit of not moving the pages. And then in 6 months he'll think twice before moving something he shouldn't. I still think that an absolute ban for moving the pages for 6 months is the best possible solution. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 22:25, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also would appreciate some help or advice in dealing with this user.

<li>You know what, as I am still relatively unfamiliar with the whole AFD and notability process, I think the best thing is to let the whole AFD process play out (without recruitment of course) in its natural manner. Thus, I will learn and attempt to use better templating when forming new book articles, and if need be, they can be sent to AFD for the situation to resolve there. Trying to learn, listen, and adapt.

<dd>I have already left the 3RR template on his page. I know he is new, but he has been asked to respond or explain on discussion many times and has refused, just simply repeated the same edit, every hour or so for the past two days. (First as an IP, then with the account). Since I can't get him to discuss, I don't know what else to do, so now I am coming here. I have not seen any source other than him to suppose that Ethiopia has changed its anthem from <a href="../../../w/o/d/Wodefit_Gesgeshi%2C_Widd_Innat_Ityopp%27ya_7b09.html" title="Wodefit Gesgeshi, Widd Innat Ityopp'ya">Wodefit Gesgeshi, Widd Innat Ityopp'ya</a>. On occasion he has changed other bits of info in the Ethiopia infobox beside the anthem. He could at least explain why he is doing this non productive edit so insistently. To his credit, he has not edited since the last time I warned him, a few hours ago. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 18:45, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The good news is, there's no obvious problems with your eyes. But surely you've been around long enough, wangi, that a whiff of coffee or something could get the rest going.

<dd>Perhaps taking a peek at the navigation template that appears on the top of many, many categories, above the subcategories listing, would give you a hint. See, e.g., <a href="../../../f/r/e/Category%7EFrench_writers_be48.html" title="Category:French writers">Category:French writers</a> or <a href="../../../b/r/a/Category%7EBrazilian_footballers_51ac.html" title="Category:Brazilian footballers">Category:Brazilian footballers</a> or <a href="../../../1/9/2/Category%7E1924_births.html" title="Category:1924 births">Category:1924 births</a>.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>

<dd>Then, of course, you might follow the link there, and go read about the sort key and sorting at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization</a>. Note also, of course, that not including the sort key does not result in the category being sorted under the rules of any language whatsoever; rather, the characters are sorted only in Unicode number order. Of course, sorting doesn't stop at the first letter, either. In that same <a href="../../../d/i/s/Category%7EDistricts_of_Slovakia_864b.html" title="Category:Districts of Slovakia">Category:Districts of Slovakia</a>, <a href="../../../b/%C3%A1/n/B%C3%A1novce_nad_Bebravou_District_e36d.html" title="Bánovce nad Bebravou District">Bánovce nad Bebravou Districtis</a> out of order not only in the English sorting appropriate here, but would probably be out of order in the sorting rules of any language whatsoever, and certainly out of order in the <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovakian_language.html" title="Slovakian language">Slovakian language</a> as well as in a huge number of languages. Note also that even in Slovakian language sorting rules (appropriate, for example, for the Slovakian Wikipedia), <a href="../../../%C5%BE/i/l/%C5%BDilina_District_180e.html" title="Žilina District">Žilina District</a> is missorted in its category. It has been fixed to sort correctly in <a href="../../../../sk/o/k/r/Kateg%C3%B3ria%7EOkresy_na_Slovensku_0c90.html" class="extiw" title="sk:Kategória:Okresy_na_Slovensku">sk:Kategória:Okresy na Slovensku</a>, however—using the same methods Aquilina needs to use to fix this problem he created here.</dd>

<p>Ryu, do you have all of the noticeboard pages watchlisted or something? I for one was a little unnerved to see a response to my 3RR report within minutes of it being filed, as well as the rapid slew of responses after my initial comment to your comment. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 03:06, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, a check of your contributions list will show that you reverted several of my edits in succession, including my request for Editor Review. Why did you do that? And why did you call me a "longstanding troll"? I don't know anything about this Akins account. Furthermore, its not up to you to decide what comments other people leave on other people's pages, is it? You basically lied to everyone when you said you only reverted "strange" comments as any check of your contributions will show. What they will show is unwarranted "stalking" if anything. Please stop it. <a href="../../../u/c/f/User%7EUCF_Cheerleader_fe8e.html" title="User:UCF Cheerleader">UCF Cheerleader</a> 03:14, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gah. I got tricked again! I keep on forgetting that Jackp has a known IP address and mistake him for an AOL sock. Every time I lift an autoblock on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3A203.57.68.20" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3A203.57.68.20" rel="nofollow">203.57.68.20</a> such as I have done for <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrank_Skilton_5486.html" title="User:Frank Skilton">Frank Skilton</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrank_Skilton_99b5.html" title="User talk:Frank Skilton">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Frank_Skilton_0aeb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Frank Skilton">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../x/a/n/User%7EXanthoxyl_0e60.html" title="User:Xanthoxyl">Xanthoxyl</a> (<a href="../../../x/a/n/User_talk%7EXanthoxyl_d48b.html" title="User talk:Xanthoxyl">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Xanthoxyl_2623.html" title="Special:Contributions/Xanthoxyl">contribs</a>) (both with non-Jackp related editing histories, but stop right after the block is lifted), Jackp reappears on the IP address. I've reblocked the IP on AO for 6 months.
