<p>This user's userpage, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Deuterium" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Deuterium" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, is basically just an attack on group of editors that he has a problem with. I think this is rather inappropriate. Also this user has twice placed this propaganda website <a href="http://irmep.org/israeli_palestinian.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://irmep.org/israeli_palestinian.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy_1d42.html" title="The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy">The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy</a> article.

<p>Besides the hit list like nature of his user page, this user has also created a page including my name User:Deuterium/Timothy Usher for the sole purpose of attacking me.

<p>The strongest evidence for the identity of these users is a shared discourse, common themes and a common style. This will be obvious to anyone with the free time and the stomach to read through <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamism_Archive_4_22f4.html" title="Talk:Islamism/Archive 4">Talk:Islamism/Archive 4</a>. Just one among a good number of obvious and telling examples:</p>
<p>24.7.141.159: “It seems like s/he has a knowledge gap and an unwillingness to read the previous discussion on point s/he is bringing up.”[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Islamism&amp;diff=46959552&amp;oldid=46941913|1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Islamism&amp;diff=46959552&amp;oldid=46941913|1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]</p>

<p>The second is, like the Hrana log-in as seen on this page, a UCLA address which, by my admittedly meagre technical understanding, I would guess is the user operating through a proxy server (such as the one provided to access restricted library materials?) from his home cable account. Just a thought. I don't understand these things well enough to say what is going on technically, but from the standpoint of style and discourse, it's clear that this is the same individual.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuterium_a36a.html" title="User:Deuterium">Deuterium</a> shares all the observed points of style and affects the same mean-spirited and domineering troll-like approach, and in two of three examples he gives of my own purported misbehavior, he is carrying User:24.7.141.159's water.

<dd>I think it is interesting to observe that <a href="../../../h/r/a/User%7EHrana98_bf7b.html" title="User:Hrana98">User:Hrana98</a> has arrived on this page without being notified by <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuterium_a36a.html" title="User:Deuterium">User:Deuterium</a> on the talk page that the discussion is going on here.

<dd>I've been monitoring Timothy Usher's talk page knowing he has a bone to pick with me. The logical thing was to follow Tom's postings on Timothy's talk page. Furthermore, reading Pecher's talk page also made it clear where to go. It lead me here. ALT + F and typing my user name alerted me to this post. I'll continue to monitor these pages as long as both of your are prosecuting your little war. <a href="../../../h/r/a/User%7EHrana98_bf7b.html" title="User:Hrana98">Hrana98</a> 09:38, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did a little research by geolocating the IP address presented via the database at <a href="http://www.hostip.info" class="external text" title="http://www.hostip.info" rel="nofollow">HostIP</a>. Its not surprising that I'm in Los Angeles. Library computers on campus require a user login and that should clearly alert you to my status on campus. User:24.7.141.159 is located in Sacramento, CA. User:216.118.97.211 is located in Middletown, IA. Are both of you (Pecher and Timothy Usher) saying that I'm traveling around the country and I'm these two people and User:Deuterium? If you are, then either I'm a schizoid nut with a private jet and tons of time on my hand or, more plausibly, both of you are being paranoid and fueling troll-like attacks upon me. I only say this because both of you have been resorting to attacks on me in hope of having me banned. <a href="../../../h/r/a/User%7EHrana98_bf7b.html" title="User:Hrana98">Hrana98</a> 10:10, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As you are aware, UCLA has a set of restricted library materials accessible to students, staff and associates by logging in from one's home address, at which point you get a UCLA proxy address and go from there. Please excuse me if my technical terms are somehow inaccurate. As for 216.118.97.211 his style is nothing like your own excepting the hostility - blocked after second post - but the user's edit history shows that two of four posts [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Islamism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47214776|1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Islamism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47214776|1" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>], [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Timothy_Usher&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47417222|1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Timothy_Usher&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47417222|1" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>] were done unambiguously on your behalf, while a third [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:216.118.97.211&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47299916|1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:216.118.97.211&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47299916|1" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>]was to hide the observation that this address was acting as your sock puppet. I concede it's possible that this is only an associate of yours (as you claimed when you said re the earlier 216.118.97.211 comment that the page was "being monitored on an outside forum" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Islamism&amp;diff=47216212&amp;oldid=47215973|1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Islamism&amp;diff=47216212&amp;oldid=47215973|1" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>]), but even so it's disturbing that you should solicit such edits from your associates.Timothy Usher 10:26, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is 3:30 in the morning, do you honestly expect me to sit on campus at this hour or am I not allowed to come home to rest and sleep according to you? Are you going to point me to a Wikipedia policy page to defend this illogical position? Furthermore, Sacramento, CA is 400 miles north of here. Are you saying that I commute to campus every morning via a 400 mile journey? Middletown, IA is 1,800 miles away. Are you now claiming that I'm making that journey nightly too? Give me a break. Maybe you should also claim that I've figured out how to build a Star Trek transporter now so we can revise the wikipedia article on this development. You should also remember that just because someone agrees with or defends me is not <i>an associate of</i> mine. I've never solicited anyone to defend me. Yet, I find it alarming to see that a large number of Administrators have been contacted on your behalf to fight your battles. You've clearly been dealt severe set backs by users who have called you out on your postings. Instead of taking them on in a productive manner (which I encourage you to do), you're trying to censor me and a handful of other editors by wrongly claiming we are all the same people. Please stop this vandetta you have because it is leaving a black eye on this community.</dd>

<dd>I'd like the Administrators here to see User:Timothy Usher's style of arguing. He starts off with unsubstaniated claims and when they are disproven, he makes even more outlandish claims. This sort of attitude has destroyed the Talk:Islamism page and he is now using his tactics to prosecute a war against me. I look forward to action being taken which addresses my complaints. <a href="../../../h/r/a/User%7EHrana98_bf7b.html" title="User:Hrana98">Hrana98</a> 10:47, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you now saying that I'm 128.97.247.141? Can someone keep count of this for me? I can't keep straight exactly how many people I am supposed to be. May I remind you that our campus has 35,000 people out of which at least a couple dozen people (that I know of) know about your (in)famous reputation here via a message board. Whether they choose to participate against you is at their discretion and I, in no way, can be held responsible for anyone elses actions. Would you please answer my questions above. Am I allowed to come home at night? Do I make 400 and 1800 mile daily commutes to campus? Do you have proof that I'm soliciting the entire internet to paint you for who you are?

<p>1. After <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Shefman_7f72.html" title="Alan Shefman">Alan Shefman</a>'s son <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">User:Pm_shef</a> writes that he will abstain from editing articles related to Vaughan politics, and confirmed that abstention at 05:55, 11 April 2006 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:VaughanWatch&amp;diff=47914650&amp;oldid=47914585" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:VaughanWatch&amp;diff=47914650&amp;oldid=47914585" rel="nofollow">here</a>, "Theonlyedge" goes after Pm_shef's longtime Vaughan target (who he nominated for the AfD a month prior) a few hours later, at 22:02, 11 April 2006 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik&amp;diff=40627315&amp;oldid=40621416" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik&amp;diff=40627315&amp;oldid=40621416" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Coincidence?</p>
<p>2. The name of Pm_shef's father's company is simply <b>The Edge</b>. It is involved in anti-racism, which we know Pm_shef/ Corey Shefman has been involved in too, both personally and through his edits. The Edge sounds a lot like The Only Edge... a coincidence? See main link to his father's bread-and-butter for 25 years: [www3.sympatico.ca/theedgeq/]</p>
<p>3. Roughly 50% of all Theonlyedge's edits are also articles that Pm_shef has edited. Compare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060319203123&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Pm_shef" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060319203123&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Pm_shef" rel="nofollow">Pm_shef's contributions</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060319203123&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Theonlyedge" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060319203123&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Theonlyedge" rel="nofollow">Theonlyedge's contributions</a>.</p>
<p>4. Both accounts in question were created within 5 weeks of one another; Pm_shef on Oct 31 2005, TheOnlyEdge on Dec 11 2005.</p>
<p>5. 4 hours after Pm_shef nominates this article for deletion (which he ultimately lost), Theonlyedege comes around and does NOT vote Keep or Delete but rather, after two consecutive Keep votes, adds a comment that the article should be shortened to 2 or 3 paragraghs. This was Shef's way of cutting his losses. See original AfD Keep debate: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>].</p>
<p>6. Both users are from Thornhill, as they have both have edited the article on <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thornhill.html" title="Thornhill">Thornhill</a> and are obsessed with their politicians.</p>
<p>7. Both are obsessed with adding positive POV edits to their favorites <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Kadis_f939.html" title="Susan Kadis">Susan Kadis</a> (as well as <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Di_Biase_329d.html" title="Michael Di Biase">Michael Di Biase</a>) and negative edits/blanking to their political competitor Mario Racco and political opponents <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Reale_6e13.html" title="Anthony Reale">Anthony Reale</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tina_Molinari_3ae9.html" title="Tina Molinari">Tina Molinari</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Cooper_8e89.html" title="Josh Cooper">Josh Cooper</a>.</p>
<p>8. Why did Pm_shef / Theonlyedge create this article on a previous opponent? So that he can control it. He can keep it down to 2 or 3 sentences and maintain control over content.</p>
<p>9. Pm_shef added the deletion notice of this article to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECanadian_wikipedians%27_notice_board_0e65.html" title="Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board">Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board</a> at 22:04, exactly 2 minutes after his sockpuppet created this nomination at 22:02.

I believe this block was in violation of the WP Administrator code of conduct regarding not blocking editors you're in a personal dispute with <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_Code_of_Conduct_ae87.html#Blocking" title="Wikipedia:Administrator Code of Conduct">Wikipedia:Administrator Code of Conduct#Blocking</a> " <i>An admin should not block a user if they are not neutral with respect to that user, or have a conflict of interest.</i> ". MONGO is not responding well to my having pointed it out (see <a href="../../../m/o/n/User_talk%7EMONGO_7e86.html#Latest_Striver_block" title="User talk:MONGO">User talk:MONGO#Latest Striver block</a>) and told me to RFC him. As there's a user block involved I think I need to ANI it.</p>
<p>I have two requests for one or more neutral uninvolved admins to review:</p>
<p>One, is MONGO's 24 hour block of Striver an appropriate sanction given the nature of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASeptember_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=48768341&amp;oldid=48748749" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASeptember_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=48768341&amp;oldid=48748749" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>&#160;? Striver's comment was clearly an inappropriate personal attack; my question is whether it rose to the level of requiring, justifying, or mandating a block in response, or not.</p>
<p>Two, is it appropriate for MONGO to continue using administrative blocks against Striver given the long history of content and other disputes (which I believe are clearly non-neutral relations between them), or should he have asked for a neutral administrator?</p>

The question is, do you, MONGO, still have a sufficiently neutral opinion and position to be able to fairly and non-abusively judge whether administrative blocks are appropriate for specific grey-area / relatively minor abuses, or not? I don't think you do. I don't think I'm completely unbiased here, either, which is why I'm ANI asking for neutral administrator review. If you want to RFC or file for Arbitration on Striver, feel free... that's not an abuse of administrator power, anyone could do it, and lord knows enough people are frustrated with him. But using the administrator block powers against administrator policy (or, at least borderline) may not be an appropriate response by you against his abuses. This would have been avoided if you'd pointed out his personal attack and asked a neutral admin to respond, as policy says you should. Which is what we're doing now.</dd>
<dd>If you think that you can do no wrong in combating Striver's abuses... then you do have a problem with abusing administrator powers. Striver has to type a lot to annoy or abuse people. You have a convenient button at a level he can't get at. Two wrongs don't make a right. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 08:15, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Striver means well, and has made positive contributions, but it's clear to me that he now does more harm than good. He has a long history of personnal attacks, POV pushing, vote solicitation, content forking, and generating lame 'articles' to make a point. Is MONGO's 24 hour block warranted? Sure; If I hadn't been on a Wikibreak I would have seen the attack and blocked him myself. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 14:00, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'll volunteer to act as a second admin opinion in future situations where MONGO is considering using admin in regards to Striver <i>if MONGO asks me to,</i> but think MONGO is responsible, from what I've seen, in his adminship, and I don't think that this block was particularly inappropriate. If Striver insists on continuing to violate <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> policies on an admin and that admin blocks him, that's simply an unwise course of action by Striver, IMO. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 14:00, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we can all agree that admins should avoid conflicts of interest (real or imagined) whenever possible. However, I too see nothing wrong with the block in this case. This particular personal attack was mild, but it's hardly an isolated incident. I also note that MONGO left a note on the talk page explaining the reasons for the block (including the ongoing pattern of disruption), as any good admin should. Saying that it's automatically wrong for the recipient of a personal attack to block is not something I can condone. As long as our admins are reasonably responsible, there's no need to tie their hands quite that much. I see nothing in MONGO's actions here that looks inappropriate to me. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:17, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am getting pretty tired of this defence of Striver no matter what wikipedia policies he violates. If it were any other user he'd be banned long ago but he plays the victim and in response to this a select group of other users viciously attack anyone who takes the liberty of cleaning up his harmful contributions. Mongo should have told another admin about the situation, but the personal attack was still not warranted and the user did deserve his ban.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 18:57, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is some advertising going on around here. Earlier tonight, an article was created about the ComplianceBridge Corporation. I put an {{advertisement}} tag on it, and left a note on the creator's talk page asking them politely to please read the section about advertising on Wikipedia - specifically the section regarding advertising disguised as valid articles. I cannot find that article anymore, so I think it must have been deleted. But on my watchlist, I saw that the creator, <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECompliancebridge_d584.html" title="User:Compliancebridge">User:Compliancebridge</a> had thrown something on their talk page, and lo and behold, their user page is now an advertisement. I really don't think that this is a user wishing to contribute to the project at all - I think it's just a marketing guy who is looking to take advantage of us for a bit of free advertising. I would suggest an indefinite block of the account, while expressing hopes that the person himself will come back and help with the project. It's up to you - I'm not an admin <small>yet</small>, but I just wanted to let you know about it.

<p>The problem is that AOL (and Netscape ISP, which is owned by AOL and which I use) reallocates its IP's about every&#160;:15. Therefore, blocking the IP vandal pretty much <i>never hits the vandal.</i> It will, however, hit some other schmo using their servers (like me, for example). If you know that it's an AOL IP, don't block for more than&#160;:15. If it's a name account that happens to be an AOL IP that the autoblocker catches, there isn't a lot you can do to avoid the collateral damage. This remains one of the Great Unsolved Problems. Short of actually requiring edits from named accounts only and disabling the autoblocker, I can't think of a solution. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:10, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Considering how much of a nuisance this editor was to start with (he made a page outside Wikipedia calling for POV pushing and vandalizing) it really isn't much of a shame. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:50, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>The first time I removed the image, I left an extensive edit summary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:ManWithNoName&amp;diff=48836050&amp;oldid=48636019" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:ManWithNoName&amp;diff=48836050&amp;oldid=48636019" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> which linked to the policy being used as the rationale for the image removal. That edit summary also contains a link to a file which has extensive explanations of why this is being done along with why there is no direct notification to a person's talk page. In the vast, vast majority of cases that I have done this (more than 400 now) this has been virtually a non-issue. Over the last week, I talked with two different members of ArbCom, and both agreed that if a person should revert my changes that remove fair use images, that I should revert them and place a message on their talk page indicating to them that continued re-insertion of the images onto their userpage when the user was aware of the policy proscribing such use would constitute vandalism since such behavior is willfully defying Wikipedia policy on the issue. Understand; your userpage is not strictly yours. See <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserpage_a297.html" title="Wikipedia:Userpage">Wikipedia:Userpage</a>. It is in fact part of the overall project. You can cause harm to the project via your userpage. Simply because it is your userpage does not prohibit Wikipedia from defending itself against copyright/policy violations of its users.

<dd>Er, I thought that <i>here</i> was one of the places that serious vandalism is discussed and dealt with...? Kelly reported that the block was placed because of an 'organized program of vandalism across multiple Wikimedia projects', and provided instructions for admins with questions ('You may refer questions to myself or to Danny'). I don't see anything on Kelly's talk page; if you were concerned about the reason for the block, did you try asking her or Danny why they felt such action was necessary? <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 18:41, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

Further more the general understanding is that office actions will be carried out for legal reasons.

<dd>If you want to remain an admin on Wikipedia, you will not contravene Danny's express instructions. I think that's clear enough for you not to smell strawmen. If you have questions about something Danny's done or that someone else has done at his direction, I suggest that you raise those concerns privately. WP:OFFICE actions frequently involve sensitive matters which should not be aired publicly. It would be best if all admins would do their best not to interfere with the Foundation's management of such issues.

<dd>No we've been through that argument. Nothing on <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELong_term_abuse_53c2.html" title="Wikipedia:Long term abuse">Wikipedia:Long term abuse</a>. Therefor they were not much of a threat to en.wikipedia thus if they were pure vandalism (if not then we run into issue that if you are going to lie to protect wikipedia then your lies should at least be credible) there was no need to block on en to "protect the Foundation". Of course I can think of quote a few situations where blocking to protect the foundation would apply however most of them are covered by our other policies. Incerdentaly I can't recall where Danny was authorised to anything other than protection and deleteion (and even then Jimbo hasd indicated that protection should not last more than a week) in the name of the foundation.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 18:33, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On a completely different note, this sort of thing certainly calls into question whether Wikia has a viable business model (formerly Wikicities; it received angel funding according to a recent <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignpost_5b65.html" title="Wikipedia:Signpost">Signpost</a>). A Wikia wiki is not all that different from a less-spoken-language Wikipedia wiki. I guess the hope is that wikis might be the next big thing à la blogging, but wikis turn out to be very labor-intensive. Without a worldwide "cast of thousands" watching for vandalism 24/7, the Willys of the world will have their way with Wikia wikis. I imagine it may even be a problem for large Wikipedia wikis whose language is spoken mostly in one time zone (eg, German, Japanese, and most others). The English-language Wikipedia is a bit of an exceptional case.</p>
<p>On a less unrelated note, I've put a range block on Loyola College in Maryland (144.126.0.0/16) with a request for their network administrators to contact Wikipedia. While I'm certainly no Danny or WP:OFFICE person, this tactic certainly seems to have worked wonders for William and Mary, so it seemed worth a try in dealing with the self-proclaimed "Loyola College vandal". I hope we will hear from them soon. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 04:36, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

This user is a stalker patrolling merely to harrass me on this site and revert edits. I want him blocked for his harassing behavior. If my account is blocked again, it will in all likelyhood be unblocked. All legal issues with Wikimedia have been resolved and settled and there are no longer any pending issues regarding contributing. I want this user blocked and restrained.

Dear Mr. Merkey,

Thank you for your kind words. I have forwarded them to the Board of Wikimedia. Over the course of the day, I will 
provide you with the information you request. I firmly believe that a resource like wikipedia in Cherokee can be of 
enormous benefit to the Cherokee nation as an academic resource for students in their own language. Here is the site
of the Cherokee-language Wikipedia for your perusal: http://chr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%8E%A4%E1%8E%B5%E1%8E%AE%E1%8E%B5%E1%8F%8D%E1%8F%97. While it is still small, I am 
convinced it has enormous potential.

&gt; Gentlemen,
&gt;
&gt; I apologize for my earlier conduct and public statements and ask Mr. Wales and Wikimedia to accept my apologies.

&gt; I discussed your suggestion about the Cherokee Language Wikipedia with Dr. Dusty Deslo, Director of the Cherokee 
Nation Cultural and Language program.  I am writing a lexicon converter that will convert the entire English 
Wikipedia to the Cherokee Language for the Cherokee Nation.  Dr. Delso at present has me assigned to translate 
several hundred childrens books into Cherokee for our language immersion program for the Cherokee Youth (Tom Sawyer,
 Huck Finn, etc.)  I have been working on these translations and we are switching to the laguage conversion tools 
after I complete them.  I am working with our linguistics experts and the United States BIA on these projects for 
Dr. Delso and our people at present with a complete translation suite of tools for our language.  I have analyzed 
Wikipedia's XML dumps and have setup www.wikigadugi.org for our people and the Native Community and feel confident I
 can modify these tools to translate XML dumps from your site for the Cherokee Wikipedia in both syllabary and 
phonetic formats.

<dd>Danny seems to have sent you a nice motherhood style of statement. Notice his use of the word "perusal", in relation to the Cherokee Wiki. Are you taking this to be an invitation to edit the english Wikipedia, a wiki that you have been banned many times from for disruption? Is Danny aware of your multiple bans?

I'm relatively new to Wikipedia and wikipedia policy is sometimes a convuluted as legal documents. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerryg_42b1.html" title="User:Jerryg">Jerry</a> (<a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerryg_b2ed.html" title="User talk:Jerryg">Talk</a>) 20:30, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good faith should never be enterely ruled out. As you can see above, Danny and Jeff have been able to interact with one another in good faith, and Jeff has offered help with the Cherokee Wikipedia. As long as this goes on, having some chaps pestering him and engaging in behavior that would disgrace a moderated forum, quite against all Wikipedia policy, is a big headache for Wikipedia. That some of them openly admit that this is your <i>sole</i> purpose for editing Wikipedia is very worrying indeed. This isn't a battleground, it's an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 20:53, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps you can refer this block to <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas Turnbull</a> for review like you did the last two. Oh, I guess not. Surely you remember that Merkey's orders to you were to block my account next. Yes, yes, I know I've done edits against other vandals besides Merkey, but I fail to see why fighting against multiple vandals is somehow of more worth than being focused on protecting Wikipedia from a single threat. At no point have you claimed that any of the three accounts you blocked were in violation of any policy. I would've posted this comment to your talk page, but you seem to have the uncivil habit of removing talk page comments. (And of blocking those whose comments you don't like.) — <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMediaMangler_0339.html" title="User:MediaMangler">MediaMangler</a> 01:34, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, i'm not sure what to do about this constant trolling, so i'm taking it here. it doesn't need an rfc because it is blatantly obvious and needs no commenting, the accounts used are (almost) all throwaways so i don't want to go through checkuser, and perhaps it should go to arbcom, but that might be unnecessary. It doesn't need an investigation, i need advice on what the heck we do about this. I've only been an admin for a couple weeks.</p>
<p>The gist of it is a concerted attack on the page Gay Nigger Association of America. They are an internet trolling organization or some such nonsense, and i've come to the conclusion that it isn't simple irony at play here.</p>
<p>I came across it following up on a 3RR report on <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Psycho_96e1.html" title="User:The Psycho">User:The Psycho</a>, who is now indefinitely blocked for evading a block with socks. During his blocks the vandalism continued with throwaway accounts; GNAA was protected for a week, trolling resumed instantly afterwards, and is now again semi-protected by me.</p>

<p>Of course this is a terrible waste of time. But as long as there are trolls and bores (i.e. for ever) and as long as WP allows anyone to edit (again for ever, it seems), trolls and bores will eagerly screw up WP. Since "GNAA" is merely a group of trolls and bores, on balance it seems a good thing to me that trolls and bores apply their piddling intellects to screwing up the article about it: they'd otherwise have more effort left over for screwing up articles about matters of some significance. So let them continue. Of course, it mustn't appear that "GNAA" is a mere sandbox: the vanity of the trolls must be assuaged by the regular rigmarole of page protections, stern warnings, edit blocks, etc etc. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 11:42, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the thoughts. I've gone ahead and blocked the older socks and will continue to do so as necessary. I've also put clear warnings on the talk and in the article that trolling will result in an immediate block.

<dd>I consider this defamatory as I inserted no such thing. I reverted your blanking of the page and nothing more.

<dd>When you replace material in an article after its validity has been explicitly challenged, it seems obvious to me that you are taking responsibility for it. The fact that you refuse to take responsibility for the edit suggests that you should not have reverted in the first place. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 17:00, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not when the material has not, as you state, been "explicitly challenged." That argument is fallacious and invalid. These edits were hard to differentiate from vanadlism. If someone blanks the entire <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> article and I revert it, do I suddenly take responsibility for everything written about Hitler? I certainly hope not, otherwise Wikipedia would be a compendium of blank pages. -<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbscissa_152a.html" title="User:Abscissa">Abscissa</a> 17:37, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aaron's edit summary read "removed clean up tag, added a few categories, removed material without citations showing they are shock sites." I'm not sure how this could possibly be more explicit, perhaps next time he should use allcaps.

<dd>Please see here. I do not think your sarcasam is warranted or appropriate and I do not appriciate it. There are many articles such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Middle-earth_Wizards_27cc.html" title="List of Middle-earth Wizards">this one</a> which have <b>zero</b> sources. This does not give anyone the excuse to blank them. Furthermore, again, your fallacious argument rests upon the assumption that shock sites can be sourced: just what source, exactly, would you feel is appropriate? #1 Any reasonable person would find these sites shocking, and #2 these sites exist for the purpose of shocking. There are many, many Slashdot posts used in internet trolling trying to redirect users to these sites; that is why they are there.

<dd>If these sites actually cannot be sourced, then <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> explicitly states that the information cannot be included in the article. It is pretty clear: "Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources." You can easily resolve the issue by providing reliable and reputable sources for the facts you want to include. As far as disruption, it's been made clear, particularly at the earlier AFDs, that this article needs sources. Removal of unsourced information is long overdue, and hardly disruptive. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 19:34, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree. There was no consensus to delete "HAI2U" or to blank "List of shock sites". That article is actually going through an AFD right now. Yesterday, he tried to delete entries on "List of sexual slurs" that "only have one source". In other words, I cited many of the entries using published dictionaries (e.g., the <i>Oxford English Dictionary, Cassell Dictionary of Slang</i>) and he tried to delete them anyway.
<p>When he blanked the "List of shock sites" article, he said it was because the list was unsourced. I found that confusing as the fact that they're shock sites and that they exist can be verified by simply visiting them.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 06:48, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Aaron Brenneman has claimed "I'm not put off by a bird standing on some's penis" on his talk page implying that a site is therefore not shocking.

<dd>That's not what this discussion is about. The AFD underway is about that and it is certain that, for a fifth time, the article will be kept. The thing I find disturbing is using WP:V as an excuse to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html#Gaming_the_system" title="WP:POINT">game the system</a> and blank most of the article without debate by Mr. Brenneman. I also find disturbing the deletion of "HAI2U" even after debate ended without consensus and finally his attempt to blank most of "List of sexual slurs" even though almost all the entries had respectable sources.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 09:48, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My two cents: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is policy, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> is only a guideline. Therefore, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is more important, and it's not "gaming the system" to say so. On the other hand, there's a big difference between saying something is <i>unverifiable</i> (in which case it should be deleted) and <i>unverified</i> (in which case, sources should be found and included). I nominated HAI2U for deletion, and I had concerns that it was unverifiable. However, those concerns were apparently shared by nobody except Aaron Brenneman, since no one else said anything. A similar controversial AfD closure was done for The Game (game), but in that case, there was a lot of discussion about verifiability, and a very thorough bit of research had been done to back up that the article was unverifiable. No such thing was done here. I'm going to start a section on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> about this; I think this was done out of process. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 16:40, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Using the verifiability policy to justify deleting this article seems to be either <i>system-gaming</i> (I don't like this article, so I will find a rule that it might break) or <i>process fetishism</i> (I'll literally interpret the rules as generalities in every case). I don't see a compelling argument that the existence of this article is damaging to the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 17:02, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Also, please note that Aaron Breneman also (1) deleted Dominionist political parties even though there was <i>10 votes</i> to keep and <i>5</i> to delete.

He also (2) deleted <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_themed_timelines.html" title="List of themed timelines">List of themed timelines</a> yesterday even though there were three keep versus three delete votes. (See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_themed_timelines_74bc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of themed timelines">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of themed timelines</a>.)<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman&amp;page=" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">[56]</a></sup> He could have done much more, but I stopped reviewing the log there.
<p>Also, WP:V <i>is</i> a policy, but whether it is being interpreted correctly here is very uncertain. Editors should follow consensus when the application of a rule is uncertain.

<li>Will people <b>please</b> get over this 'you deletionist' nonsense? Hasn't the stylus worn out on that record yet? The article should never have existed. It should never have survived VfD, and if our users didn't skew to an under-20 demographic it probably wouldn't have. The reasons are clearly demonstrated above: it is an <i>inherently POV list.</i> I.e. whether something belongs on it or not is 100% someone's personal point of view. In such a case, even a <i>citation</i> is some one person's point of view, and, since books and magazines are fairly unlikely to waste ink on a list of shock sites, it's fairly unlikely that citations will be to anything more substantial than <b>webpages</b> and blogs and other oracles of crankery. There is no include/exclude to the list except some sniggering kid's "Dude, this is so dissssssgusting!" That's not what encyclopedias do, either electronic or print or written on the waters. If the people editing it can't even make an <i>effort</i> to ensure that everything in it is cited, then they're admitting that the article fails the deletion policy, that it is (and they think should be) inherently POV. That they'd be upset is no reason to bring the matter to AN/I. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:04, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What about the fact that these sites are a significant part of the history of internet trolling? Nobody has yet responded to this point yet. Furthermore, the list is not inherently POV as there are only a few sites which #1 any reasonable person would find flagrantly offensive, and #2 exist for the sole purpose of offending. For example, look at the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miller_test.html" title="Miller test">Miller test</a> or for an application of Canadian law, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Sisters_Book_and_Art_Emporium_v._Canada_%28Minister_of_Justice%29_3e05.html" title="Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice)">Little Sisters</a>. These are not "POV" tests. Again, the difference between a shock site, and say a gay porn site is that the gay porn site exists for the purpose of doing business on the internet. So even if someone finds its content offensive and obscene, it is not hard to differentiate from any shock site. I am also an <a href="http://slashdot.org/~abscissa/" class="external text" title="http://slashdot.org/~abscissa/" rel="nofollow">old user</a> on Slashdot and fermilliar with goatse trolls; your argument and implication that a bunch of under-20 year olds made the article and are trying to save it is wrong. Look at the reasons given by people who voted to keep it: One administrator wrote "Unfortunately, this stuff is notable", and another person wrote "The phenomenon of shock sites / picture collections has been around even before the internet. It is too important not to be listed here." - <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbscissa_152a.html" title="User:Abscissa">Abscissa</a> 01:19, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Notable?" So? That's not the point. If that <i>were</i> the point of anyone arguing against the article, then that person was totally misguided. Are there trolls? Yes. Do they giggle at their scribbles? Yes. Can Wikipedia have an article on <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_sites.html" title="Shock sites">shock sites</a>? Yes. Can it have a <b>list</b> of them? No, because a list would require proof that each site on it is, in fact, a site that exists only to shock and that it does, in fact, shock, and that it <i>has been used</i> to shock, and that the shock has been successful. So, when you can <i>document all the trolling that referred to each site</i> and <i>document that each site shocked someone,</i> then you can include it on the list and be verifiable. Otherwise, discuss the phenomenon in a discursive article. No one, that I know of, is arguing that the phenomenon doesn't exist or shouldn't be discussed, and confusing this handy-dandy link farm with an article is the only thing I have yet found shocking about the discussion. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:15, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Document <b>all</b> the trolling that refers to each site? This is either a joke or totally preposterous. Document that each site shocked someone? They all shocked me at <i>some</i> point, so what sort of documentation do we need?
<p>Also, I'd like to point out that asking for proof that the shock sites in question "exist only to shock" is a lot like asking for "proof" that vandalism is vandalism.

<p>This admin JzG is consistently abusing his priviliges by claiming to be applying policies that he has not actually read. His most serious offence was to list <a href="../../../3/7/_/37_signals.html" title="37 signals">37 signals</a> for deletion, even though its homepage has a link to independent press articles which clearly demonstrate compliance with WP:CORP. In addition he has deleted a whole load of useful links from an article on real time collaborative editors without any warning. He claimed that WP:NOT says only internal links are allowed, but I can find nothing in WP:NOT to give preference to internal links over external ones. Is there any procedure to have admin privilidges revoked? I have tried discussing the issue with him but he says because he is an administrator he must know best. From his homepage it is clear he is <small>(<a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Personal attack removed</a>)</small>, is it really sensible to let him sabotage wikipedia on a whim?

<dd>Wouldn't it have been better to actually talk to him on his talk page rather than simply slapping a template on it? Your own actions come across a little agressive to me (at first glance, but i may have not seen everything). Just let the matter drop. if he breaks the 3RR he can be blocked since he has been warned and has clearly seen the warning. As for personal attacks, I hate that template with a vengence.

<p>Since the situation has changed some since the initial flurry of charges and counter charges, (and with Leotardo's renewed call for pm_shef's head), I decided to create a fresh summing-up of the situation. If someone thinks it would be appropriate to cross-post this to RfCU to aid the admins there, I would have no problem with that.</p>

<ul>
<li>While Pm_Shef and VaughanWatch seem to have reached an understanding, Eyeonvaughan continues to be a problem. He has not even responded to the RFC filed against him. Analyzing all the anonymous IP accounts in the 64.* and 69.* range (Bell Canada) is probably overkill, but three in particular seem to be specifically used by Eyeonvaughan to evade his blocks.</li>

<p>Regardless of the outcome of the various checkuser requests, I feel very strongly that Leotardo needs a civility block for persistent attacks and baiting of pm_shef and Theonlyedge. There's a process to follow and spamming your allegations all over wikipedia isn't part of it. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:40, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thatcher, I believe you are just angry that some neutral admins have looked at the information and found there cause to believe that Theonlyedge is a sockpuppet of Pm_shef.

<p>Sockpuppetry and vandalism prevented holding an AfD (third nomination). The AfD notice was constantly removed from the article and the AfD page itself was constantly vandalized. As a result, I was bold and took the step of deleting the article; it can and perhaps should be nominated for deletion review, as a roundabout way of doing the AfD. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 11:14, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>His ISP is AOL--do they have a spamming policy? It's a disturbing thought (and no doubt we'll be accused of <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">telling people not to stuff beans etc. etc.</a> for having this conversation) but if this were to become a trend it does seem like the foundation would have to look into it. Do we, in fact, <i>have</i> a policy about what is and is not appropriate use of the Wikipedia e-mail function? <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 03:51, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If we dont we should as junk email is not nice or useful. He is using an AOL email address, it is just Robfleko@ so obviously set up specifically to spam, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 04:00, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Entirely annoying, I know. However, I'm not <i>sure</i> that this rises to an actionable item. If an anon or blocked user can't generate a mailing list or harvest <a href="mailto:'s" class="external free" title="mailto:'s" rel="nofollow">mailto:'s</a>, then I don't think that the "e-mail the user" feature is really something that's going to lead to <i>spamming.</i> It is annoying, and it's bad, and it's something we should address, but it's not quite on the same level as having one's actual e-mail address harvested by the C1Alis advertisers. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:23, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>What it was was evidence of sockpuppetry. Those allegations have been re-posted in that category. There is a checkuser request <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser#Theonlyedge_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29_and_Pm_shef_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser#Theonlyedge_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29_and_Pm_shef_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which I'm sure will find that Theonlyedge is the sockpuppet of Pm_shef. But since it appears as if you're not familiar with the evidence, it is posted again at the bottom of this message.</p>
<p>The other vandals were listed in good faith and with all due civility, because each of them removed the sockpuppet tag from Theonlyedge's userpage.</p>

<p>Evidence that Theonlyedge is a sockpuppet of Pm_shef:</p>
<p>1. After <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Shefman_7f72.html" title="Alan Shefman">Alan Shefman</a>'s son <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">User:Pm_shef</a> writes that he will abstain from editing articles related to Vaughan politics, and confirmed that abstention at 05:55, 11 April 2006 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:VaughanWatch&amp;diff=47914650&amp;oldid=47914585" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:VaughanWatch&amp;diff=47914650&amp;oldid=47914585" rel="nofollow">here</a>, "Theonlyedge" goes after Pm_shef's longtime Vaughan target (who he nominated for the AfD a month prior) a few hours later, at 22:02, 11 April 2006 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik&amp;diff=40627315&amp;oldid=40621416" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik&amp;diff=40627315&amp;oldid=40621416" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Coincidence?</p>
<p>2. The name of Pm_shef's father's company is simply <b>The Edge</b>. It is involved in anti-racism, which we know Pm_shef/ Corey Shefman has been involved in too, both personally and through his edits. The Edge sounds a lot like The Only Edge... a coincidence? See main link to his father's bread-and-butter for 25 years: [www3.sympatico.ca/theedgeq/]</p>
<p>3. Roughly 50% of all Theonlyedge's edits are also articles that Pm_shef has edited. Compare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060319203123&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Pm_shef" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060319203123&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Pm_shef" rel="nofollow">Pm_shef's contributions</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060319203123&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Theonlyedge" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060319203123&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Theonlyedge" rel="nofollow">Theonlyedge's contributions</a>.</p>
<p>4. Both accounts in question were created within 5 weeks of one another; Pm_shef on Oct 31 2005, TheOnlyEdge on Dec 11 2005.</p>
<p>5. 4 hours after Pm_shef nominates this article for deletion (which he ultimately lost), Theonlyedege comes around and does NOT vote Keep or Delete but rather, after two consecutive Keep votes, adds a comment that the article should be shortened to 2 or 3 paragraghs. This was Shef's way of cutting his losses. See original AfD Keep debate: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik" rel="nofollow">[78]</a>].</p>
<p>6. Both users are from Thornhill, as they have both have edited the article on <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thornhill.html" title="Thornhill">Thornhill</a> and are obsessed with their politicians.</p>
<p>7. Both are obsessed with adding positive POV edits to their favorites <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Kadis_f939.html" title="Susan Kadis">Susan Kadis</a> (as well as <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Di_Biase_329d.html" title="Michael Di Biase">Michael Di Biase</a>) and negative edits/blanking to their political competitor Mario Racco and political opponents <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Reale_6e13.html" title="Anthony Reale">Anthony Reale</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tina_Molinari_3ae9.html" title="Tina Molinari">Tina Molinari</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Cooper_8e89.html" title="Josh Cooper">Josh Cooper</a>.</p>
<p>8. Why did Pm_shef / Theonlyedge create this article on a previous opponent? So that he can control it. He can keep it down to 2 or 3 sentences and maintain control over content.</p>
<p>9. Pm_shef added the deletion notice of this article to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECanadian_wikipedians%27_notice_board_0e65.html" title="Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board">Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board</a> at 22:04, exactly 2 minutes after his sockpuppet created this nomination at 22:02.

<dd>Bear in mind that Leotardo is part of a group of users, along with VaughanWatch and Eyeonvaughan, who are bitterly opposed to the current political situation in Vaughan, Ontario, and that pm_shef, who acknowledges being the son of a local politcal figure, has been attacked by them for the past couple of months. Vaughanwatch was recently found to have used over 30 sockpuppets. While Vaughanwatch and Eyeonvaughan were banned for personal attacks and sockpuppet abuse, a slew of attacks started coming in from AnonIP accounts belonging to Bell Canada. Checkuser requests are pending on Eyeonvaughan, Leotardo and the other pm_shef attackers. I think that all confirmed socks should be banned but any blocks against the primary accounts should be suspended until the situation gets sorted out and we know exactly who is attacking whom here. I don't think any of these editors should be editing articles on Vaughan politics, obviously they are all too closely tied to the situation and unable to put aside their passions.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 12:34, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yup. My view is that we should delete the lot and come back when the fuss is over. This is an encyclopaedia, our policies are based on externally reported sources which require the perspective of time. Wars like this just prove beyond doubt that the encyclopaedia format is poorly adapted to covering current events. What we need is a sister project to cover current events. We could call it something snappy like "wikinews". Last time I looked inside this can of worms is centred about a bunch of poeple who fail <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> because they have yet to be elected to any office at all. But that could be my faulty memory. The bad taste left in the mouth by VaughanWatch and Eyeonvaughan is not a faulty memory, though. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 18:22, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, I only removed the sock tag because it was an anon posting it. Any anon edit to a user's page that I notice usually gets removed as vandalism and the anon warned with a {test}. All that being said, I warned Leotardo to leave the situation alone above <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Harassment_by_User:Leotardo" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">here</a> and suggested to both sides that they back away from the situation until the checkusers were refused or completed...but here he is pushing his evidence again (and has replaced the sockpuppet tags on theonlyedge's page since my warning). If the blocks mentioned above go through on theonlyedge and pm_shef (who I agree from the evidence <i>could</i> either be socks or meat, whatever the IRL relation between the accounts), I propose a week long ban on Leotardo as well for harassing another user. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 13:18, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>-Look I haven't done any harassment, other than add a sockpuppet tag to a user that for a long time only appeared to me as a sockpuppet. But I guess when you're on the wrong side of the fence, on the wrong side of the issue, you get blamed even when exposing the truth. It's really silly, actually.</p>
<p>In any event, I am now entrusting Wikipedia admins to add the Sockpuppet tag to <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheonlyedge_8121.html" title="User:Theonlyedge">user:Theonlyedge</a> and connect it to the allegations of sockpuppetry page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia:Suspected_sockpuppets_of_Pm_shef" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia:Suspected_sockpuppets_of_Pm_shef" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Everytime I put it back, somebody on their side takes it off again.</p>
<p>I also request that the evident harassment and elaborate use of admin time on AN/I and Checkuser stop finally against me and other users. They will not stop until all of your minutes are taken, and until we're not able to edit anymore. I count 7 different complaints on AN/I, 6 different complaints on Checkuser, an elaborate RfC and 3RR reports. They are not fair to us, as evidenced with Syrthiss above statement, don't want to co-operate, and rather than defusing situations, it just makes things worse.</p>
<p>To the suggested Theonlyedge and Pm_shef blocks: don't let Syrthiss and Thatcher131 dissuade you. It's a sockpuppet, plain and simple, so punish it. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik_%28second_nomination%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik_%28second_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">withdraw his second AfD nomination</a> for an article that his login Pm_shef failed to win on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik" rel="nofollow">first try</a>.

<li>In terms of Theonlyedge, the simple fact is, I do not know this person. Please, check our contribution histories, before the last two weeks when this whole conflict broke out, we had only edited 5 or 6 pages in common.

<li>Since then, I have endured relentless personal attacks, numerous instances of defamation and slander and still stayed involved with Wikipedia. For what?

<dl>
<dd>Such absurdities. YOU are the person that tagged me as a puppetmaster the day I registered my account. And if you are blocked it's because of the evidence of sockpuppetry, not favoritism. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeotardo_6227.html" title="User:Leotardo">Leotardo</a></dd>

<li>Finally, it is probably prudent to note that for the past two weeks or so (maybe a bit longer, im not sure), you'll see that I have <b>not edited</b> anything related to Vaughan. After working it out with <a href="../../../v/a/u/User%7EVaughanWatch_62a5.html" title="User:VaughanWatch">User:VaughanWatch</a> we decided that it would be best for the Wiki community if both of us stayed away from Vaughan articles, and focussed our efforts elsewhere on Wiki.

<li>I belive that this last point especially, but really all of the above, demonstrates extreme <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Good Faith</a> on my part, and an extreme lack of it from Leotardo. Not one of Leotardo's so called "proofs" that Theonlyedge is my sockpuppet holds water. With even the most basic of inspections and knowledge of the Vaughan-conflict, you'll see that the "evidence" is nothing more than more thinly veiled personal attacks with no actual proof beyond "<i>some</i> of their edits are similar" <b>Not to mention</b> that theonlyedge <i>created</i> the article that I led a veritable crusade to delete in its first nomination. Regardless, the fact that this sham of a complaint is even getting this amount of attention is frankly insulting to the hard work I've put in to editing articles on Wikipedia, from Canadian University related topics to Debate topics and so on.<br /></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Good faith? Are you kidding me? You labelled me a puppetmaster on the first day based on no proof, which STILL hasn't shown up. The 9 pieces of evidence holds up.

<dd>I'm trying not to get involved anymore, but I just can't ignore the way Leotardo keeps screaming that there's no proof of his sockpuppetry.

<dd>So they reverted my edits, big deal. You removed the sockpuppet tag from Theonlyedge like maybe 6 other users, that doesn't make you a sock-puppet. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeotardo_6227.html" title="User:Leotardo">Leotardo</a> 17:03, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>-There is no better time for more evidence of sockpuppetry than now.</p>
<p>Let's look at another coincidence.

<p>The other day, I added pm_shef and theonlyedge to the chckuser (along with some of the dozens of two-edit users claiming these two to be the same) per e-mail request from shef. No response yet. I also unblocked one of the many "new users" who were accusing them of sockpuppetry and put them on checkuser to be fair. If any of my other actions need to be clarified, please contact me on my talkpage. And Leotardo, I believe you were also added to checkuser to keep this issue balanced. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 02:06, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Two issues from the Vaughan mess haven't specifically been addressed: has Eyeonvaughan been using anon IPs to avoid his civility block, and pm_shef/Theonlyedge. Neither Kelly or Mackensen mentioned them when they revealed and blocked VaughanWatch's sock farm (about 45 socks now I think). (I assume that Eyeonvaughan is not an obvious sock of Vaughanwatch, or else that would have shown up.) After all their hard work I'm not about to bug Kelly or Mackensen for clarification.

<p>It may well be that this user is disruptive (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive90#User_Freakofnurture" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive90#User_Freakofnurture" rel="nofollow">[81]</a>). But he does not appear to be a banned user, and continualy blocking him is only encouraging him to create new accounts. I'm inclined to unblock this account - instruct him to use only one account - and put him on an informal probation.

<dd>Wow. I'm surprised that anon hasn't been indefinitely blocked for his history of disruptive trolling, harassment, bullying, and almost total lack of any useful contributions. Looking through his very first edits (ignoring <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.111.172.198_c6c9.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.111.172.198">81.111.172.198</a> for now), I see him delete one of your talk comments, then accuse you of both vandalism and bias, then repeatedly accuse the next editor who comes along (who happens to be an admin) of personally attacking him, while insulting you some more at the same time, etc. He's become somewhat less obvious (and more devious) since then but it's clear that he either really loves argumentative disruption or is literally unable to stop doing it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for his comment in the link you provided, it is written so immaculately and in such detail that I find it hard to believe he could possibly be so ignorant of exactly the right Wikipedia policies and procedures to have presented such incredibly misleading "evidence" of his points. In any case, while he is clearly very clever and does have a few vehement supporters somehow, he is also clearly picking the wrong fights (with at least 4 admins, even going so far as to accuse 3 of them of gross misconduct in the same post). If that isn't blatant trolling, obviously I don't know what is.</dd>

I agree, making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> by registering the username he was <i>pretending</i> to have was in retrospect a mistake, but the chap was _very_ annoying.

<dd>Oops, I didn't mean to say all of them actively support that anon, only Ombudsman and Whaleto do from the edits I've seen. I mentioned the others because I noticed 86.10.231.219 sending "please look at this" posts to all 5 of them to support comments of his made against you.

<dd>And yes, this user did little else before launching attacks on me when he became identifiable on WP, and was immediately clearly associated with attacks on the british medical association (which owns the british medical journal) where there had been previous diatribes. He may be upset that I commissioned the writing of a filter that eliminates his comments from teh BMJ when read with Firefox - the editor didn't ask for it, but did define the problem. Pansophia may have been lead astray, but received a certain amount of advice form admins in the first article edits, and didn't take it anything like graciously. Looking at Pansophias edits, I think I discern an improvement with maturity after that initial phase, follwoed by some clever working by 86.10.231.219 and a worsening of attitude, not so much to me, but to WP standards. Left alone this trolling will spread. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 21:50, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think it may mean "no", and it contains an assertion that 86 is not in dispute with me. I have considered posting to the WP Requests for mediation page, which I have open but do not adequately understand - it appears to need all parties to sign up to a request. I'm in favour, and if anyone is willing to take an interest and explore mediation I'd be grateful. . I've also relisted that talk page on MfD<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:86.10.231.219" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:86.10.231.219" rel="nofollow">[87]</a> as it is very clearly a collection of attacks, and I submit not beneficial to WP. I am aware that several people who might otherwise co-sponsor an RFC are inhibited by the expectation of personal unpleasantness being directed their way - I'd say that if the cabal (Tenofalltrades describd them, not admiringly, as a lynch mob) currently adding and linking criticisms of me to their talk pages seriously thought they had a case they should have presented it as an RFC - I may be subjective in thinking that like presenting the appearance but not substance of a username, such alternatives to established WP procedure are aimed at increasing the irritation and turmoil rather than solving a problem, but I'm probably right. Advice on an RFC would be appreciated - I'm involved in one on <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">User:Whaleto</a> which is probably also a factor in this current unpleasantness, given the linkages. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 12:33, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How is this trolling? A look at today's contributions shows that most are to the sandbox and that others are entirely stupid additions to the article on a Swedish politician. This may not be grounds for a ban, and it may be inappropriate for a user of this IP number to ask for one. But if I were in the same position as this person claims to be, I might well ask for the same thing.

<p>I do not think this block is justified. I, and a number of other editors, have had a long history of interaction with Bookofsecrets, and <i>never</i> have I suspected him to be a sockpuppet of Waya Sahoni or Gadugi. Bookofsecrets is certainly following in the lead of Waya Sahoni. Yet, however misguided he may be, two editors having the same opinion, with accounts that were obviously not created as single purpose accounts, is not a grounds for blocking as sockpuppetry. I fail to see any strong correlation between the two. They have different writing styles, different temperaments, completely different IP ranges when they don't log in, etc.; I could go on. This blocking is solely based on Bookofsecrets' support for a banned user on Wikipedia, while we have no real evidence for sockpuppetry other than likely false conjecture. Realize that I am not saying that Bookofsecrets is right – I am saying that he should not be blocked as a sockpuppet of Waya Sahoni or Gadugi.

<li>I don't know if you can, unfortunately you posted a real life e-mail address on your user page. I would never do that. I assume that wiki mail would allow some traceability. If you look in the internet headers of the e-mail message (usually hidden by most program but they should be accessible) there may be some identifying info there. I don't really know how gmail works. The childish tone of the messages and their similarity suggests to me they all came from the same person and I'm going to go on instinct here that it was from a school either the one I identified or another one. Possibly someone trying to get under your skin after seeing your personal e-mail and age posted on your user page. For starters I would remove your e-mail address and age from your user page and delete the history (if you can) so it can't be recovered. And only take wikipedia mail, which hopefully is more traceable. Unless the e-mailer slipped up and allowed some identifiable info into his g-mail messages this particular case may be out of reach, though.

<p>Anon IP is making edits to several articles about Agatha Christie novels wherein the user does not correct the articles, per se, but rather writes in bold letters exactly what is wrong with them. Despite reverts from several users and polite advice and warnings on both the articles' and the user's talk pages, the user continues to re-insert their commentary in the articles themselves.

<p>It seems as though, after the incident at the AFD the other week, Morton devonshire has now gone back and blanked the talk pages of virtually every single person he spammed, and what's odd about it, is that it now looks like about 2/3s of the people contacted don't really exist, having only a tiny handful of edits before the AFD stacking, and virtually none after, upon closer inspection, it seems as though most copy and pasted fully formed user pages within moments of registering.

<dd>Well, I take issue with both the spamming and the legal threats. But blocking isn't really a feasible option due to the offending anon being behind a dynamic IP, hence the only way of stopping the continued addition of linkspam is to prevent anon users from editing the pages in question. I'm not terribly familiar with the allegations the anon is making having not been involved with the articles in question, but someone may want to tell the anon to state his/her rationale for including the external link in question on the article talk page to gauge the general consensus, which IMHO, will be the only long term solution to this problem. -<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanglc_c543.html" title="User:Changlc">Loren</a> 04:04, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<p><a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a>, I assume an administrator, has done more than just voice his opinion about <a href="../../../%C3%A9/c/o/%C3%89cole_Secondaire_Catholique_Garneau_b567.html" title="École Secondaire Catholique Garneau">École Secondaire Catholique Garneau</a>. He has already gotten one picture deleted. He first removed the picture from the article. Then nastilly taged it as an orphaned image. (That means an image that is no longer being used under fair use.) He has decided that the images part of an <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> skeem. However they are being used for primary information such as the latitude and longitude. Also the fair use rational can be found on the image:Garneau.PNG and user Jkelly has not argued any points to the contrary. The rational in short is that this image is orphaned into the main article. (see bellow).</p>
<p><b>Fair use rational for <a href="../../../%C3%A9/c/o/%C3%89cole_Secondaire_Catholique_Garneau_b567.html" title="École Secondaire Catholique Garneau">École Secondaire Catholique Garneau</a></b></p>
<p>This image, GoogleMap of Garneau.JPG, is being linked to the article École Secondaire Catholic Garneau; though the picture is subject to copyright and <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFair_use_26b6.html#Counterexamples" title="WP:Fair use">WP:Fair use#Counterexamples</a> indicates that it is generally not permissible to have a detailed map, scanned from a copyrighted atlas, or in this instance Google Map I (<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a>) feel it is covered by the U.S. fair use laws because:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFair_use_26b6.html#Counterexamples" title="WP:Fair use">WP:Fair use#Counterexamples</a> states that "the only context in which this might be fair use is if the map itself was a topic of a passage in the article: for example, a controversial map of a disputed territory might be fair use." As actually discussed with the main article of <a href="../../../%C3%A9/c/o/%C3%89cole_Secondaire_Catholique_Garneau_b567.html#Mapping_and_charting.23Google_Maps" title="École Secondaire Catholique Garneau">École Secondaire Catholique Garneau#Mapping and charting#Google Maps</a> there are in fact contreversial map disputes about the territory.
<ol>
<li>For example: Garneau is located at 6588 carrier street, Orléans, Ontario. However, when trying to locate Garneau via Google Maps or Google Earth there are some discrepancies. This <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=6588,+rue+Carri%C3%A8re,+Ottawa,+Ontario&amp;ll=45.465714,-75.52518&amp;spn=0.004801,0.013475&amp;t=h" class="external text" title="http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=6588,+rue+Carri%C3%A8re,+Ottawa,+Ontario&amp;ll=45.465714,-75.52518&amp;spn=0.004801,0.013475&amp;t=h" rel="nofollow">Google map</a> which allegedly localizes <a href="http://www.escgarneau.com/contact.php?PHPSESSID=2e5a1b7caa024fe471d5b8dd4f20f80f" class="external text" title="http://www.escgarneau.com/contact.php?PHPSESSID=2e5a1b7caa024fe471d5b8dd4f20f80f" rel="nofollow">Garneau High school</a> actually pinpoints just in front of the <a href="http://www.mifo.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.mifo.net/" rel="nofollow">MIFO</a>.

</ol>
<p>Again, in short we must determine if this is original research first. Not simply jump to conclusion and start erasing everything (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C3%89cole_Secondaire_Catholique_Garneau&amp;diff=49622827&amp;oldid=49338131" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C3%89cole_Secondaire_Catholique_Garneau&amp;diff=49622827&amp;oldid=49338131" rel="nofollow">such as here</a>). Taking into consideration that anyone can clearly see that factual information (Primary information) for the address of the school exists. That the primary information for the Mifo exists. That Primary information that is input into google maps is used to give the primary information (the map). This is all Primary information and the only thing that is being summarized is the obvious fact that both adresses pinpoint virtually the same location. ANYONE can see that! Hence I propose, as suggested in WP:NOR that this is not original research.</p>
<p>This said User:Jkelly had no right in removing this information. Not only that but he should have advised the uploader of his motion to delete the file. I request futher analisys be conducted to ensure there where no mal intentions and that appropriate disciplinary actions be commenced.

<dd>Hi. I'm sorry that an image you uploaded and were attached to got deleted due to copyright concerns, but that is sometimes going to happen when images you upload are<s>n't</s> under an unfree license.

<p>For what it's worth, I'm pretty sure that "Google maps pointing to slightly the wrong spot" doesn't qualify as 'disputed territory', much less is it worth noting in the article (as it is now). --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 22:23, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In general, Google map screenshots cannot be claimed as "fair use". If the Google map had lead to significant national news coverage, and the mistake was no longer available on Google Maps, then fair use could be claimed. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 22:36, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Template {{<a href="../../../m/o/s/Template%7EMos3_61fb.html" title="Template:Mos3">Mos3</a>}} (which I left on the user's talk page some time ago, to no effect) says <i>"Continuous changing of content in articles to break agreed-upon MoS rules, when you have been asked to stop, is often seen as vandalism. Constant vandalism may lead to you being blocked from editing Wikipedia"</i>. The user in question is making the same edits over and over to often the same articles (recent examples include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jennifer_Lopez_discography&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49047052" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jennifer_Lopez_discography&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49047052" rel="nofollow">[92]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stripped_%28Christina_Aguilera_album%29&amp;diff=49604076&amp;oldid=48545997" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stripped_%28Christina_Aguilera_album%29&amp;diff=49604076&amp;oldid=48545997" rel="nofollow">[93]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alicia_Keys&amp;diff=49645769&amp;oldid=49595212" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alicia_Keys&amp;diff=49645769&amp;oldid=49595212" rel="nofollow">[94]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alicia_Keys&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49647241" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alicia_Keys&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49647241" rel="nofollow">[95]</a>), and each time I've cleaned them up and asked that he/she stop, but they just carry on. It's obviously time-consuming and counterproductive for my sake and everybody else's further down the line to keep having to tidy up after these edits, and the user doesn't seem to be listening to what I am saying, so I think there needs to be some degree of administrator intervention here.

<p>Others should be aware that one or more editors have been posting links to a site that reveals personal information about Wikipedia users. It had been, at last check, cut down quite a bit, but at one time posted the name, address, telephone number, children's names, and photograph of at least one Wikipeidan, with other information on several others, and may well do so again; that particular user has been forced to leave Wikipedia as a result (the information was used to contact his employer, much like the Gator1 situation). I blacklisted the link to prevent further disclosure, but the users in question have used Wikipeida Review to circumvent the blacklisting, requiring that Wikipedia Review be blacklisted as well. I've posted to WR on the subject, and let them know I will remove WR from the blacklist if they remove all links to the other site.

Rogerman contacted me in a blind panic, terrified that his IP and other personal information would be revealed, and begging to just be blocked, rather than outed (apparently, he's a student, and was concerned of reprocussions from school administration). After calming him down, and assuring him that we don't release personal information about non-vandals, I was able to work out the entire situation: He had begun editing the articles, and when reverted, recruited his roommates to help him. (Points to him for not simply sockpuppeting; meatpuppeting is bad in practice, but at least brings in other editors.)</p>
<p>After working out all the details, and giving him a lecture on the importance of talk pages rather than reverting, and the evils of meatpuppetry, I promised him that I would raise the issue here. Unfortunately, I've been in and out the last few days, and haven't had a chance to post on it yet. As such, here is what I am going to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am lifting the indefblock on Rogerman, so that he may participate in this discussion, with the warning that any further disruptive behavior is subject to blocking, and that sock and/or meatpuppeting won't be tolerated. I'm informing <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a>, the blocking admin, via his talk page of both my unblock and this post.</li>
<li>I'm leaving the blocks on the other two accounts, pending discussion here of what can be done with them. From my discussions with Rogerman, I believe he understands the importance of abiding by policy and has conveyed the same to the other two users; I would tend to support unblocking if the users promise to behave, but will leave that to others to decide.</li>
<li>I'm volunteering (and making it a condition of my unblock) to have an informal mentorship with Rogerman; where he has questions, or where others are concerned about what's going on, I'll have a look and seek a resolution.</li>
<li>I'm reccommending mediation on the issue that started the edit war, and will leave it to the parties to define the scope and scale of said mediation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I'm overstepping here, or if others know of extenuating circumstances, please make it known here. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 00:54, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A couple notes, since I was the ne who brought the sock/meatpuppetry to attention:
<dl>
<dd>1) Are we absolutely sure that it was roommates and not him? I only ask because, as far as I'm aware as the person who requested the Checkuser, this was never actually verified. As noted at <a href="../../../r/c/u/WP%7ERCU_f1af.html" title="WP:RCU">WP:RCU</a>, the signatures were as identical as the articles being edited, and with vastly similar knowledge and agendas, which is what raised the question.</dd>
<dd>The issue which started the "war" at <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Sobran_b1b8.html" title="Joseph Sobran">Joseph Sobran</a> has been resolved, as any consensus within the article was warped due to the meatpuppetry. Any mediation that outside parties may desire will not be opposed by myself, but probably won't be necessary.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Either way, I'm glad to see some resultion come to this regardless. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 01:15, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm fine with the unblock, and can confirm the feeling of panic that he conveyed.

<dd>Essjay, if you will be mentoring Rogerman, please keep a very keen eye on his future activity. I'd like to ask that you research the recurring conflicts that this user introduced and sustained in the past, in other articles and talk pages. His tactics were not confined to the isolated circumstances of the Joseph Sobran article. Please carefully inspect his past activity with consideration for what the patterns may suggest to you about the basic intent of his involvement with Wikipedia. I did not suspect the puppet issue until it was announced that he had been blocked, and yet I had already observed potentially deeper levels of bad-faith behavior in this young man's conduct elsewhere in the Wikipedia project. If you are unblocking him, I urge you to be strictly intolerant of even subtle dishonesty, and of any moves to infuse articles with POV. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProjection70_a733.html" title="User:Projection70">Projection70</a> 03:24, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I do not endorse everything that <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProjection70_a733.html" title="User:Projection70">Projection70</a> says, but he is correct that there are other issues with this editor besides puppetry, such as POV pushing and incivility. I think that a mentoring relationship can help. I'm sure many users will be watching this editor's future contributions. It sounds like there is possiblity for growth and improvement. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 04:50, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Contrast the way Rogerman represented himself to Essjay against how he originally represented himself on his <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerman_d209.html" title="User:Rogerman">user page</a>. He portrayed himself for Essjay's benefit as a humble student who is afraid to be outed due to possible reprocussions from school administration, and who recruited his roommates to help him as meat puppets. He stated on his user page, however, that he is a married, small business owner from Orlando, Florida, who spends a significant period of his time day-trading. Although he suggested to Essjay that he was terrified of being outed, he openly declared on his user page that his wife is pregnant with their first child, "Roger William Cohen-Petersen," thus telling the world a great deal about his purported identity. The user page also says that he graduated from college. Is he someone who has graduated from college but lives at school with two roommates and a pregnant wife, while day-trading and owning a small business? Might be possible, but remotely so. Essjay, I applaud your compassion in unblocking him, but with the apparent incongruities I also thank you for keeping an eye on his progress. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProjection70_a733.html" title="User:Projection70">Projection70</a> 05:48, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I've erased some of them (retaining the ones where he's actually made a defense of the article above "It's good"), but now I'm having second thoughts — unless there's blatant vandalism/trolling/NPA's, should this type of content be deleted from an AfD? I'd appreciate an admin dropping by to take a look.

<dd>If each additional vote is from the same user/IP, I'd say feel free to remove them, as long as you leave a comment saying you've done so. If they're from a user you have good reason to suspect is a sockpuppet (i.e. first edit, saying "<i><b>Keep!!</b> Artikle is leet w00t&#160;!!!11!</i>"), leave a note such as <code>&lt;small&gt;User's [[Special:USERNAME/Contributions|Xth edit]]. ~~~~</code> after the vote, and the closing admin'll take the possible sockpuppetry into account. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">(talk)</a> 07:12, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, transparency is key. In the rare event that a comment is actually deleted a note should be left for the closing admin. Alternatively, leave it in place and annotate it, or move duplicates to the talk page and again leave a note to that affect. In this particular case, if the closing admin is on the ball they'll be disregarding that anon's contributions anyway. AFD is a process of determining <i>community</i> consensus, after all! --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 07:56, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
