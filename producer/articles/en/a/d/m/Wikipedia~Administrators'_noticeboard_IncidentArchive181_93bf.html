<p>Are comments on this IP's talkpage considered worrying to the community?

<p>Hi, i hope you can help me. Im having a big problem with an administratorcalled thejps. When i joined i didnt know what i was doing and broke a few rules. I wasnt abusive but went about changing articles the wrong way. I was banned for 2 weeks which i completely agreed tp. Since i have come back i have followed all the rules, discused everything, have not edited 1 article and been overly polite to everyone. Wherever i start adiscussion on the discussion page thejps keeps following me and telling everyone to ignore me,that my POV is wrong and calling me a trol! All i want to know is how do i report him and warn him off. I enjoy reading articles and have only started a few discussions, yet i feel i am being taunted to react so he can ban me again. He has really taken it peronnaly, how do i stop him? Iwould appreciate any advice, thanks a lot. My email is <small>hidden</small> cheers Daveegan06 10:30, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>An editor called my attention to an ongoing dispute at <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a>. I've done some poking around, and I'm greatly troubled by what I see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBosniak_47d6.html" title="User talk:Bosniak">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bosniak_b4b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bosniak">contribs</a>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=101731094&amp;oldid=101708383" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=101731094&amp;oldid=101708383" rel="nofollow">reverts any attempts</a> to introduce neutral point of view terminology (for example, an editor changed the subheading "Denial of the massacre, revisionism and scepticism" to "Critical views" to make it less POV-laden).</li>
<li>he repeatedly introduces information in blatant violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=101731094&amp;oldid=101708383" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=101731094&amp;oldid=101708383" rel="nofollow">"...accused of raping Bosniak women..."</a>) and has been adding this information despite warnings since August (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=68557450&amp;oldid=68444630" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=68557450&amp;oldid=68444630" rel="nofollow">"...accussed of participating in Serb-run rape camps..."</a>). This information has no reliable sources and has in fact been widely discredited.</li>
<li>Bosniak accuses editors of "vandalism" when they make any changes contrary to his POV, using edit summaries like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=101731094&amp;oldid=101708383" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=101731094&amp;oldid=101708383" rel="nofollow">"rv to Psychonaut - Jim Douglas, this is not your personal web page to vandalize.

It should be noted that the user in question <i>was</i> discussing the issue on the talk page.</li>

<dd>Talking about mission? Cheap shots. All of you who came here are on a mission - on a mission to ban me so you would be able to vandalize Srebrenica Massacre article. Talking about 'bad faith' you are the ones who have bad faith towards me and objective people building Srebrenica Massacre article. I have no bad faith, see - I am not complaining. I am just responding to your disagrements. Jim Douglas, Psychonaut, etc who came here are obviously on a mission. They can't achieve their goals with Srebrenica Massacre article, so they come here and complain. They treat Wikipedia as their personal page, and when they disagree with people, they want those people banned. By the way, Bosniakophobia is not an 'invented' or 'false' word. In fact, it's as much invented and as much as false as Serpophobia, but that's another story. Jim Douglas, Hadzija, Psychonaut, etc, have repeatedly ignored Srebrenica Massacre discussion page, and completely refused to take into consideration other people's opinions. Anyways, it's sad to see some people constantly complaining like toddlers. I would rather see them more productive in making this wikipedia better place for everyone.

<dd>We can also add to the list of grievances that he's a serial and unrepentant copyright violator.

<dd>I concur. Truth be told, I'm hesitant to call for a community ban because I feel it would result in martyrdom and a plethora of socks, but they would be easily spotted. The user, however, runs a blog on this subject and would likely recruit meatpuppets to his purpose, which would be more difficult to control. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope"><b><font color="#3D59AB">Merope</font></b></a> 21:09, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Talking about mission? Cheap shots. All of you who came here are on a mission - on a mission to ban me so you would be able to vandalize Srebrenica Massacre article. Talking about 'bad faith' you are the ones who have bad faith towards me and objective people building Srebrenica Massacre article. I have no bad faith, see - I am not complaining. I am just responding to your disagrements. Jim Douglas, Psychonaut, etc who came here are obviously on a mission. They can't achieve their goals with Srebrenica Massacre article, so they come here and complain. They treat Wikipedia as their personal page, and when they disagree with people, they want those people banned. By the way, Bosniakophobia is not an 'invented' or 'false' word. In fact, it's as much invented and as much as false as Serpophobia, but that's another story. Jim Douglas, Hadzija, Psychonaut, etc, have repeatedly ignored Srebrenica Massacre discussion page, and completely refused to take into consideration other people's opinions. Anyways, it's sad to see some people constantly complaining like toddlers. I would rather see them more productive in making this wikipedia better place for everyone. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 07:47, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When she didn't unarchive the warning, I did instead, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lucy-marie&amp;oldid=101423853#Warning" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lucy-marie&amp;oldid=101423853#Warning" rel="nofollow">left a note about the archiving on her talk page</a>.

<p>I would appreciate assistance in handling this situation. I got in way over my head. I'd read a few of Lucy-Marie's comments when editing the various person's articles, so I knew that she had a habit of continually reverting people's work and was a POV pusher and it didn't really matter if she was presented with evidence that what she was saying was incorrect, but she'd never been particularly hostile (I thought) and was at least sorta attempting to discuss things with people, even if only to tell them that they were wrong. I thought a gentle warning from an outside party showing her that she'd gone so far in her edits as to tred on quotations and references might pull her back a little.</p>
<p>I didn't expect her to be rude and hostile from the get-go, to ignore all authority and show no respect for anything offical or the person she's currently disagreeing with. I kept trying to get her to take her problems with the warning to the helpdesk, but she seemed to think that it was easier to simply constantly revert warnings, and for the moment at least, it has been. She has no warnings on her talk page, and instead I have comments on mine with her complaining that I'm harrassing her. I haven't had any interaction with her before this, but I've read her comments on the person articles' talk pages and her talk page and I don't think any amount of "fact" I could point her to would help, because it would be coming from me. I've also now seen her get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:200.38.7.41&amp;oldid=57951314" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:200.38.7.41&amp;oldid=57951314" rel="nofollow">angry</a> (vandalism), and I'd like to avoid escalation. She obviously does good work on Wikipedia when not getting into fights with people, so I'd really appreciate if someone could step in.</p>
<p>I think she needs to be warned--looking back at her edits she not only edited quotes and references (which she may not have noticed), but she changed the intro of the article (to avoid using the word personhood) which is having consequences now as the future role of the article is debated, and put in other POV pushing lines which couldn't be taken care of because of the deadlock. It took three separate people to revert her edits on non-person. She reverted back giving "no reason for revert" as her reason for reverting back, even though a reason was provided and there was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Person/RfC_archive" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Person/RfC_archive" rel="nofollow">ongoing Rfc</a> about whether persons was a word where even the dictionary definition she gave for people used the word persons 5 times to define people.</p>
<p>Which is why I warned her originally. And her subsequent behavoir, removing multiple warnings multiple times also I feel needs warning. This isn't a case of a newbie not knowing something (for example, if I'm screwing this up completely, or this is the wrong place, let me know), this is someone who's been warned multiple times but doesn't believe that they are valid or that other people are right. This is someone who has NPOV and a million other Wiki policies linked to her in talk pages reglarly and ignores them anyway.

<li>It is really best to avoid putting warning notices on the pages of users whom you are in dispute with. They seldom help, and mostly tend to inflame the situation. And the user is perfectly entitled to remove them. If civil discussion is failing, I suggest you try one of the approaches at <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> e.g. mediation or an RfC. This is not really a matter for admins.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 02:18, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't in a dispute with her at all. I had zero contact with her until I warned her--our only contact and dispute has been about the warnings and her violation of Wikipedia policy in removing them. I wouldn't have had a problem with her going to the help desk or somewhere else, I had a problem with her deleting them--making a uniform decision that she was right, and I was wrong and it didn't matter what wikipedia policy or convention was, she could do what she wanted. This was especially problematic as it was exactly the behavoir I was warning her about.</li>
<li>When I came to the persons article and saw the dispute, I originally never intended to warn her or anyone else about what I saw as a content dispute on the person article. I came to the article when it was deadlocked over the "persons" v "people" issue and over the "personhood" v. "being a person" issue--the article was deadlocked because everyone who had commented before was seen to have a bias. I had no prior edits on the article or any associated articles and unlike the Rfc debacle, I didn't know anyone on the article beforehand. I provided sources and fixed the problems. In the following days, I found that what was going on was much bigger than a content dispute, and I saw to what extent Lucy_Marie had knowingly violated Wiki policy to POV push. I looked carefully at edit histories and comments, and saw that there were points where she had blatantly lied to other editors, and when she was told that her edits had changed quotes she still deadlocked the article leaving quotes and references incorrect for a month to push her POV.</li>
<li>I saw what I felt was a fairly serious problem, and was probably the only person who saw the extent of it and couldn't be considered biased--I'd had no interaction with her or any of her articles. I left what I thought was a fairly mild warning, which spiralled quickly out of control.</li>
<li>There's nothing that we need additional comments for, so an Rfc is entirely inappropriate. I wasn't leaving a comment about a content dispute on her talk page, so we don't need dispute resolution or mediation. There was a dispute on the person article, between herself and everyone else, and she's apparantely no longer interested in editing the article and the dispute doesn't exist anymore. I wasn't involved in the article when the dispute did exist anyway, and the dispute was about the correct pluralization of the word "person" something that can and has been looked up several times. I really can't help someone if they can't understand or don't want to listen to every dictionary, including the one that they cited.</li>
<li>Also, if users can simply delete warnings if they don't like or disagree with them, why is there a template warning about removing warnings? Does that only apply to certain warnings? Can only certain users use this template? I'd appreciate some clarification, especially as I thought that user talk pages (and their archives) were supposed to be records. <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 12:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</b></li>

There are a few of us working on reverting the vandalism but it is getting to be a pain.

<p>User:TSLcrazier, has been causing a lot of trouble lately with Disney Channel articles. He constantly uploadeds images with no copyright info, or a source. He is also mass producing episode articles with little to no information, having only a sentance saying its an ep from what ever show, and an infobox, occasionally it contains the same summary SENTANCE that is on the list of episodes. He also has a habit of removing deletion tags from any article/image he creates.

<dd><small>(originally started as a seperate thread, this was merged when I noticed this thread)</small>This user is being a bit of a problem editor. He's uploading lots and lots of photos without fair use rationales (though they can be used under fair use), and seems to ignore rules as he sees fit, such as removing AfD tags, which he's done before and been warned for, if I remember correctly, and has done it again today. He generally seems to have the attitude "Screw the rules, I'll do what the hell I want", which is a dangerous attitude for someone without knowledge of the rules to have. What can be done, here? I was tempted to block him but that seems way over the top. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Deskana</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana"><small>(request backup)</small></a> 17:01, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

In the block mentioned his "vandalism" was the removal of messages from his talk page, and even then the blocking admin said the block was primarily for edit warring.

<dd>You admitted on ANI to creating a sockpuppet which you used only to comment at Barrington Hall, and I have left numerous articles to avoid you, as you aware. The WP:STALK evidence is very clear in your case, and I think you have gambled that I would not report you because you know I don't want to have anything to do with you, not even an ANI case reporting you for wikistalking. But I would do it at this point, and ask any admins who are paying attention to bar Mastcell from stalking me. (Especially because he has done so twice now in order to escalate disputes at Barrington Hall/is having a dispruptive effect on the article.) This should be clearly marked as a separate issue from Milo if it continues, and moved to a <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> complaint against Mastcell.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 22:48, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Your "confession" was archived by JMabel, in case I wanted to make an issue of it. Barrington Hall is an article you have never made an edit to, and which you aware I will not leave.

<dd>(edit conflict) Yes, but I just ignore him when he comments elsewhere. I will dig up the diffs. What I am concerned about is Barrington, because it really gives the creeps--he know he's "cornering" me at an article I'm personally committed to, and he shows up only to try yo escalate disputes. The recent diffs are all on the Barrington Hall talkpage. Someone else already pointed out to him "perhaps you are editing the wrong article," to which Mastcell responded with WP:OWN b.s, I think because he thought I wouldn't report him-- reporting him means having to be involved with him. For him, it's a win-win situation. I just want him to leave me alone, I already left all the birth control articles, and his presence at Barrington Hall is making things worse for everybody, not just me.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 23:33, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Note: here is a good example of him wikistalking, me just ignoring him. (Everyone else ignored him as well.) This was an ANI complaint started by J.Smith, in which J. Smith, Nick, and Guy were all involved, but dropped it for obvious good reasons. To their credit, they admitted they weren't unbiased, since they were all involved in the big You Tube/EL controversy at EL, taking the opposite position from me. Mastcell appeared at the end to try to continue the argument (and by doing so let me know that he was reading/stalking all of my contributions to EL, saying, in essence, "I am following every one of your edits, I read everything you write, and I will chime in if I think it will bother you, or make a situation worse,": <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100916229" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100916229" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 00:49, 20 January 2007 (UTC) And here is a link to the entire discussion, so you can see his comment in context:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100916229#Threatening_language_on_user_page" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100916229#Threatening_language_on_user_page" rel="nofollow">[24]</a></li>

<dd>The point is that if it has been well-estabished that you and so and so don't get along, so and so has left articles where they were a regular editor to avoid you, and asked to be left alone, you should try to stay away from them--not stalk them. That's disruptive in and of itself. As for your "de-escalation" absurdity, no, it does not de-escalate disputes if you join them when they are heated and unbalanced, and you join on the unbalanced side against someone who has already asked to be left alone and pointedly avoids you. Since you stalked the EL issue and the EL You Tube issue at Barrington Hall specifically, you were already aware that the side you were joining was the "EL" side--editors who are not neutral, and arguably not disputing the issue at hand. So, seeing a bunch of people disgruntled that the You Tube link was allowed to stay try to pick a fight about something else, and deciding "hey, this would be a good time for a stalker to join! That would de-escalate the issue, if I sided with the disgruntled EL people!" is ridiculous, and you know it. Now everyone else knows, too.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 03:27, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cindery, you keep saying you "left articles to avoid me" and that I "harassed you away from articles".

<dd>This is about you, and the fact that you are stalking me, and that it serves no good purpose for Wikipedia. (Anyone with the patience to read your 40 pages of nitpicking harassment on the Emergency Contraception page will want to leave that article too.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>But I will address what you have said, for the benefit of readers, with the caveat that it does not mean I will allow you sidetrack focus off of your stalking.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. I had a sterling rep prior to the block--which was one extended block, and if I wasn't already disgusted enough by you to have left all the articles I used to edit, I would have contested the blocks, as the first, for "npa" was extremely weak. The block was for a draft of an RfC against Nick on my talkpage. The next person to make a draft saw their draft deleted and protected from recreation. There was definitely concerted interest in preventing people from organizing transparently to file an RfC against Nick. If I had intended to "personally attack" Nick, I would have left a message on his talkpage. Putting together an RfC is not a personal attack.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2. User:Mumblio is not a sockpuppet, he is a human being. His unblock request and his letter to Essjay were ignored. No one "went after" Essjay--it was pointed out that he ignored an email in the hope that he would reply. Mumblio, incidentally, interviewed a lawyer this week, in his capacity as a journalist, who turned out to represent a member of the Foundation. (They traded stories and gossip.) He does idly sometimes want to contribute again--about some guy named Gene Savoy. He thinks the lawyer will help him. I told him just to create another account and stay away from me (his home IP is not blocked.) He likes the name "Mumblio," though. He was blocked after making a single comment re the Barrington You Tube dispute.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3. Yes, after you, and then that, I was <i>completely</i> disgusted, and I still am--I agree with a lot of "Why Wikipedia is not so Great." Nevertheless, I followed through on the Nick RfC, and the EL issues (I felt somehwat better about Wikipedia at the Foundation level after the Foundation's comments on that, but still feel there are too many people-with-problems.) I also massively improved <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheingold_Beer_456e.html" title="Rheingold Beer">Rheingold Beer</a>--it's hard to resist improving articles sometime, even if one agrees Wikipedia is not so great because of the people.</li>
</ul>
<p>In closing, maybe I haven't made myself clear enough about your stalking: you give me the creeps. Leave me alone. I will never like you. You crossed the line when you stalked me to Depo Provera and then refused to stop posting on my talkpage after I asked--your emotional over-engagement was the creepiest thing that has ever happened to me on Wikipedia. There is no chance I will ever change my mind and want to have anything to do with you if only you stalk me enough. I know that you feel rejected. That is not my problem. Invest emotionally in something in the real world. What part of stay away from me don't you understand? The "dispute resolution" that you desire/keep asking for, where I end up liking you is never_going_to_happen. The way to resolve this is for you to stay away from me. I left all the birth control articles--you can stop stalking me.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 06:46, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I've tried to compare the contributions of both of these editors. I don't promise that this is all correct, but I've tried to match pages that both have edited in their past 1000 edits, to see who was 'first'. None of this proves or disproves anything, but just in case its interesting to anyone.</p>

<dd>Your diffs don't make any sense--at Depo Provera, for example, I was a long-time contributor--Mastcell showed up there 30 minutes after the dispute at Emergency contraception (and a day after I sent a message to another editor saying that article meant something to me). After he was (and admitted he was) "more argumentative" than he should be, I left. His knowledge that I edited that article didn't come from the article. At emergency contraception, I returned after a long break and didn't even notice him until he fixated on me/began responding directly to me. Your Barrington diffs don't take into account his sockpuppet, Girondin, in December...and so on.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 10:09, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>...and your diffs for Milo's talkpage, William M. Connelly's talkpage, and the admin noticeboard refer to instances in which one or the other of us was discussing something completely unrelated/wasn't aware of the other. (But the idea of "first" leaves out the concept of "repsonse"--so while you have included two completely unrelated comments we made on ANI, you have left out his responses to me on ANI.)-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 10:16, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Absolutely. This is looking only at the fact of editing. For example, it 'shows' that MastCell was first to your talk page, which clearly isn't true. It's just that in his past 1000 edits, he has some edits on your talk page that are older than any of your past 1000 edits, so he appears to be 'first'. Regarding Depo Provera, all my report says is that he too is a long time contributor. That doesn't mean he wasn't stalking, it just provides an alternate explaination for why he might be at the page - he probably already had it watchlisted. I guess I could list all of your edits at each page, would that be more useful? It might be quite long. What about I take this to your talk page? Anyone interested can follow us there.

<li>This is an example of a meaningful comparison: I left on Dec. 1. I returned on Dec 20--to the Barrington Hall talkpage. (an article I have edited for a while, far away from birth control articles.) Mastcell made his first appearance there on Dec 21--as a sockpuppet.-(How would he know I was back if he weren't stalking me, etc.)<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 10:34, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>He might have seen your edit at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents</a>. More likely he may saw that you had edited your own talk page. What I can say is that you didn't edit any other pages that I would expect him to have on his watchlist, based only on his last 2000 edits. Below are all the edits from either of you on pages that you have both edited, from when you left to when his sock appeared at Barrington Hall. At a complete guess, he either followed your contributions or the link on your user page. And I'm going to log off. Back tomorrow.

<li>Note: thanks, Ben. I would like to point out that there was no link to Barrington Hall on my userpage at the time. As you have noted that I didn not return to any articles I previously edited/that might be on his watchlist, I think it is safe to guess that he was stalking my edits.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 21:37, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, that's not what I said. He edited your talk page in November, so it's quite likely that he knew you were back as soon as you edited it. I'll annotate below. For me, there are two issues here, of which I'm only looking at one, but you should consider them both. The issue I'm not looking at is what did he say, was it valid? The issue I am looking into is why did he say it? Was he following you, and why? There are valid reasons for following people. For example, I'm following you both around at the moment for what I hope is a valid reason - to try to help you both contribute better to Wikipedia. But rather than you and I guessing, let's just ask him. MastCell, I assume you're reading this.

<p>I looked at the contributions from Girondin and can't relate this to stalking. Stalking should involve some form of harrassment. It looks like a normal content dispute to me.</p>

<p>...mimsy-whomever [Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington] was clearly editing in bad faith in late Dec by deleting the link without discussion, as he was politely informed in <i>early Nov</i> that the link was not a copyvio, and that he should not even be attempting to delete it without discussion (see below). He is also an official member of the "You Tube Deletion Committee" started by Dmcdevit--i.e., has an admitted bias/ego investment in something other than editing this article. From his current talkpage, you can easily observe that "Nearly Headless Nick" is a close ally, and not constructively for the benefit of Wikipedia, from what I have seen--NHN has recently made the bizarrely ludicrous accusation on mumsy's talkpage--to Arygiou--that stating any alternate opinions about YT links is "disruptive." He clearly has ZERO idea what "disruptive" means, as on-topic good faith editorial opinions on talkpages are never disruptive--or perhaps he <i>does</i> know and is trying to bully??? NHN, on the other hand, is in fact participating in a project which is disrupting Wikipedia to make a point; has certainly had a decidedly and idiotically disruptive effect on this article, in my experienced judgement. My feeling is that they can get lost and stay lost, or we can take it to a higher level. They are not editors of this article, they have categorically refused to engage in discussion on the talkpage of this article while making edits they know are disputed, and they do NOT have consensus on policy pages--consensus is against them. What they lack in consensus they have tried to compensate for with bullying (which disgusts me).</p>

<dd>Clarification: Nearly Headless Nick and Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington are the same person, so to say they are close allies is an understatement. If you click on Nearly Headless Nick's signature above, it takes you to Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's home page. The names are based on a character from Harry Potter. <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirondin_0ab5.html" title="User:Girondin">Girondin</a> 23:34, 21 December 2006 (UTC) Now can we get back to more self-congratulatory reminiscenses about how great Barrington Hall was, and how lame the youth of today are?</dd>

<dd>sockpuppetesque? meatpuppetesque? I don't understand. They are A SINGLE ACCOUNT.

<dd>He found this page by stalking my edits, used a sockpuppet to make comments he <b>admitted</b> were uncivil, during a dispute. (And clearly was not much of a "mentor" as WP:SIG doesn't advise having a username and sig which are not obviously the same to the casual reader--it can be considered disruptive. There's no reason a user couldn't apply right now to register the username "Nearly Headless Nick," as it is not registered to anyone, but the sig of Mimsy.) Let's also note that you are currently involved in the Barrington Hall dispute.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 22:23, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">WP:SIG</a> is not policy as far as I am aware. Many users have signatures that differ from their user account. The fact he was trying to point this out to you was quite helpful considering your first post in that section. The only uncivil bit is the "self congratulatory" part which is not exactly OTT given what you have on your user page, re: the "Barrington six" . <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Cindery&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101521139" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Cindery&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101521139" rel="nofollow">[31]</a></dd>
<dd>My involvement in the Barrington page is due to the arguments overflowing on to this page. There is no reason why i should not edit the page and give my opinions on whether your sources are reliable, or not. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 22:50, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Note that 1) WP:SIG states: "While not an absolute requirement, it is common practice for a signature to resemble to some degree the username it represents. Signatures that obscure an account name to the casual reader may be seen as disruptive" and 2) I edited my userpage to note Barrington six, etc two days ago 3) please keep content dispute on the page of the article. Noting that you are involved in the content dispute is helpful here, in my view. Let's not confuse the issues. This is about a clear case of stalking.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 23:15, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just discovered it was a recent edit (added link to my original comment for clarification) but still the fact you wrote still shows it is not an OTT observation. I repeat WP:SIG is not policy, I know what it says. Look around you and note how many other users do not follow the guideline. It is no crime, although I personally would not recommend it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wizardry_Dragon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101511249" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wizardry_Dragon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101511249" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> Also it is quite normal for people who are involved in a dipute to comment on WP:ANI, this is a place for community input. To be frank you probably need to learn a little more about how things work in wikipedia. It seems that all your disputes involve people trying to help you understand how to sucessfully contribute to wikipedia. If you refuse the advice from others on what can be considered a reliable source then you will be in many more disputes. Please listen to what other have to say, believe it not, many are trying to help your write an article that will be stable. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 23:24, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Stalking should involve some form of harrassment.</i> --David D.</p>
<p>Remember though, that unwanted attention is itself harrassment. Suppose a colleague kept giving you gifts, even after you asked them stop. It's important to look at what was said, but it's also important to look at other things as well. I've looked though <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_Cindery_MastCell_allegations_3c69.html" title="User talk:BenAveling/Cindery MastCell allegations">both users contributions</a> at some length.

<dd>I'd suggest you look at the "quality of contributions", then.

I explained what should have been obvious with a basic assumption of good faith <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACindery&amp;diff=86329780&amp;oldid=86329017" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACindery&amp;diff=86329780&amp;oldid=86329017" rel="nofollow">here</a> (which Cindery rejected as "further harassment"). I don't see why I need to check to see if Cindery's been at a page before I edit it, so long as I contribute constructively and don't disrupt/attack/violate policy - and I think that's a really questionable precedent to set. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 23:36, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The short answer is "Because it would make the universe a happier place". It doesn't take long to check the last 50 edits once and it would save a lot of stress for a lot of people.

<dd>That is a dangerous precedent to set, though well-intentioned. Should we cater to Cplot because he <i>perceives</i> there is a pro-government cabal on Wikipedia? No! Doing so would be absurd. Likewise, doing so here would be akin to acquiescing to disruptive forces on Wikipedia, though I do not equate Cindery to such undesirable elements. We are not here to make everyone happy, warm, and fuzzy. If we are to edit peacefully in this world, we either must swallow what bitter medicine others force down us or we grow a thicker skin. --<sup><a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhysicq210_4b59.html" title="User talk:Physicq210"><font color="#000000">210</font></a></sup><b><a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0" face="Comic Sans MS">physicq</font></a></b> (<i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Physicq210_25e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0">c</font></a></i>) 00:39, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That does not explain why your sockpuppet appeared at talk:Barrington Hall a half hour after I edited my talkpage after a long break (you did not answer Ben's question about that) and it <i>especially</i> does not answer why you would <b>return</b> to the same talkpage after I pointed out that I was purposely avoiding you.

<dd>Ben, it is not harrassment to correct people who are not willing to adhere to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. It is common for editors to try and limit the damage that such individuals bring to wikipedia. To suggest it is stalking and protect editors such as cplot flys against reason.

<dd>He hasn't stalked me there in the last 16 hours or so--he stopped last night after I began pointing it out (at the article, but after this report). Hence I have not pointed out on the talkpage that he is stalking me during that time. There <i>is</i> a distinction between the regular editors of the article, and a small group of people leftover from the You Tube/EL dispute (and then there is Mastcell, who is in a WP:STALK category all by himself, who opportunistically joined them.) As I have just made a complaint against you, Milo, for blanking a section against consensus instead of discussing--when the consensus included all parties, even the YT/EL crew--I do not find that you are an impartial judge of whether Mastcell is wikistalking. Clearly he is. Again, he <i>created a sockpuppet to harass me on the talkpage, was aware that I completely avoid him because I explicitly said so, and then returned to the talkpage only three weeks later, to inflame a dispute.'</i>-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 20:49, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

The important part is the disruption - disruption is considered harmful." Cindery has shown disregard for WP:RS and WP:NOR at the article in question (not to mention WP:OWN) - I <i>hope</i> someone is keeping an eye on the articles she edits. It seems like there's some circular logic going on here - it's stalking because it's disruptive/it's disruptive because it's stalking. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 13:04, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Attempting to derail the issue with false accusations will not work. Wikistalking, again, is: <b>Following an editor to another article to continue disruption (also known as wikistalking) The term "wiki-stalking" has been coined to describe following a contributor around the wiki, editing the same articles as the target, with the intent of causing annoyance or distress to another contributor.</b> As you admitted to using a sockpuppet to harass me at Barrington Hall three weeks ago, returning to that talkpage is very clearly stalking.

My point was that you use accusations to bully editors with whom you have content disputes. A question to any masochistic admins who are still reading this thread: Cindery's now made nearly 75 edits in the past 24 hours containing my name and some variation of the word "Wikistalking", without providing any convincing evidence.

<dd>I do not own Barrington Hall, I am a significant contributor to that article. I think the unfair compromise (to Wikipedia) was that I left all the birth control articles already, to avoid Mastcell. It's not much to ask that all he do is desist from following me around elsewhere, esp. desist joining/inflaming a dispute against me at the talkpage of an article he has never edited, and where he has admitted to harassing me with a sockpuppet.

<dd>As I said ppreviously, not an admin, just a watcher, generally. However, I do agree with Calton. It seems that your solution rewards Cindery for assuming someone's out to get her, and raising a stink about it. Even worse, your solution is one sided, because it says MastCell can't edit anythign Cindery does, but not vice versa. Thus Cindery could easily use this restraining order to ruin his wiki-life, by editing his more usual haunts, and then run for admins when he goes to them. While I'm sure the admins would see through it quickly, why set up for more AN/I filings about this? I think Cindery set herself up for most of this by giving the statements about her personal relationship with the subjects of the article, and it came back to bite her. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 01:10, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>A few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I haven't violated any policy or guideline. I've been civil and content-focused at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarrington_Hall_793b.html" title="Talk:Barrington Hall">Talk:Barrington Hall</a>, and I've been as civil as possible here. Every claim I've made here is backed up by diffs. (Compare my behavior here to Cindery's). Therefore, I don't see why I should be constrained, every time I'd like to edit an article, to first make sure Cindery hasn't been there first.</li>
<li>I cited the diffs above to indicate that Cindery has a history of responding to content disputes by bullying editors she disagrees with. That's what's happening here, and I think your suggested resolution only rewards such behavior.</li>
<li>I don't have any plans to comment further at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarrington_Hall_793b.html" title="Talk:Barrington Hall">Talk:Barrington Hall</a>, because my concerns (which had to do with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) are shared by a number of other editors there and are being addressed by them, and contrary to Cindery's assertions, I really don't enjoy dealing with her. But at the same time, I reserve the right to comment civilly and constructively there, or anywhere on Wikipedia. If, as Cindery suggests, she considers my very presence on the same page as her to be "stalking" and a policy violation, regardless of the content of my contributions, then I'd suggest that the issue here is primarily Cindery's and not mine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's my proposal for resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Cindery has a problem with me, follow <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>. Isn't that why it exists?</li>
<li>In the meantime, further unfounded, unsupported accusations against me should be treated as <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. Is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=101957286&amp;oldid=101957023" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=101957286&amp;oldid=101957023" rel="nofollow">this</a> an acceptable edit anywhere, under any circumstances (much less on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, from an editor with a long history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Cindery" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Cindery" rel="nofollow">disruption and personal attacks</a>)?

<dd>The first 2 steps of DR are Talk and Disengage. We're doing the first, and I think we're close to agreeing to do the second. If by "have no plans" you mean "plan not to" then yes, I think we're done. I assume you've removed Barringon from your watchlist? And Cindery's homepage?

<p>So Cindery is suggesting that it's OK to attack me on her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Cindery&amp;oldid=101521139" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Cindery&amp;oldid=101521139" rel="nofollow">userpage</a>, and that if I complain about it I'm continuing to "stalk" her.

<dd>I was not aware of the arbitration case when I made the moves, and apologize for what I now see is a blatant disregard for a standing policy. I've fixed all the disambiguation changes I've made. However, the capitalization changes I've made should stand. Regardless of how the producers wish to name the episodes, Wikipedia has a Manual of Style which overrides the show's conventions. Therefore, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stole_Beer_from_a_Golfer_9eff.html" title="Stole Beer from a Golfer">Stole Beer from a Golfer</a> is correct, as well as all of the other naming changes I made. <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanreyes_225e.html" title="User:Evanreyes">Evan Reyes</a> 21:27, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A line continues to be removed from a <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Paul_1d72.html" title="Sean Paul">Sean Paul</a> article relating to his racial percentages. The line in question is "Racially, this means that Sean Paul is 62.5% <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">White</a>, 25% <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese.html" title="Chinese">Chinese</a> and 12.5% <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black</a>". This is based on testimony which is already shown in the article. However, I calculated the percentages and posted them, because it is in general easier to understand. Since many users will be going to the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Paul_1d72.html" title="Sean Paul">Sean Paul</a> article specifically to find out about his racial background, this information is important. The user <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> has removed it, stating that it is original research. However, in my opinion, this is not original research, but a simple math calculation that anyone could perform in their head. The only difference is, this makes it easier for readers who are less math-saavy than I am. I have once again replaced the line, but I informed <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> that I would report the issue to administration to find out what should really be done. <a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhythmnation2004_5737.html" title="User:Rhythmnation2004">Rhythmnation2004</a> 14:53, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Apart from the issue of what value it adds to the article, the "percentages" (to 0.5%!) really are not supported by the source - "mixed black and white" <i>does not</i> necessarily mean half and half, while "Portuguese descent" does not mean pure Portuguese, especially since he claims descent from Solomon, making the family Portuguese Jews (like many in the Caribbean) - after 500 years in the Caribbean, the default assumption is that these people are mixed, not that they are unmixed. So the "percentages" are not in keeping with the available information - the info is too vague. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 15:39, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. Generally, when a person says they are "mixed black and white", that usually means that it's half and half. It's not as if Sean Paul is perfect when it comes to the English language. He speaks the typical lingo of Jamaicans, who always consider "mixed black and white" to equal half Black and half White. And Portuguese Jews are white - since when are Jews a separate race? That's a little bit Hitler-ish, if you ask me.<a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhythmnation2004_5737.html" title="User:Rhythmnation2004">Rhythmnation2004</a> 15:45, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(edit conflicts) #1, this is a content dispute and doesn't belong here. #2, without a clear-cut source, this constitutes original research. #3, "race" is an extremely fuzzy concept (which many people don't realize) and calculating the <i>exact percentage</i> of one's racial affiliations is laughable to me. #4, why would the average reader care? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="purple">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="red">ka</font></a> 15:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As others have said, this is not the place for this discussion. However, seeing as it's here: Giving percentages to 0.5% is <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_precision.html" title="False precision">false precision</a>. I doubt anyone is the world is 100% one race (I don't think race is well defined enough, for a start), so the chances of anyone being 50/50 between two races is pretty much 0. It's much better just to state the approximate races of his ancestors and let the reader decide how to interpret it. I don't think it is really original research though, it's just misrepresentation of verifiable facts. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 16:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed, as a recent channel 4 show indicated (anyone remember the one I'm on about - they genetically tested various people), even if you know your family tree back - 6 or 7 generations, your ethnic mix is far more complex than that.

<dd>To Tango, it is original research as he is taking the vague descriptions of the persons racial heritage and drawing his own conclusions from them - namely the figures. -<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 19:15, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There was no intention to interpret the facts. The editor sincerely thought that was what the sources said, and was simply representing those facts incorrectly.

<p>Just to clarify - I was not saying that Jews aren't white (although in the English-speaking Caribbean Portuguese weren't "real white", which is why they tended to intermarry with the light-skinned mixed lower middle class, rather than the white upper class descendent from the plantocracy or the upper middle class originating from the English civil servants). I'm saying that Portuguese Jews were expelled almost 500 years ago, and that after being in the Caribbean for 500 years a lot of them would have intermarried. With respect to "mixed black and white", this means just that, mixed. In the English-speaking Caribbean we have families who have been mixed for 200 years, and have continued to marry mixed people. They had their origins not only in slavery, but also in the "poor whites" (mostly Scots and Irish indentured labourers who were sent to the Caribbean in the 1600s and 1700s (see <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redlegs.html" title="Redlegs">redlegs</a> for the Bajans), who often intermarried with the mixed lower middle class). So to say someone is "mixed black and white" says <i>nothing</i> about the proportion of each race; there is no reason to take it as "half and half". <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 19:37, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Put shortly for others reading this: The issue here is using SI prefixes in articles where our sources quantify numbers using binary prefixes. I believe that <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> will always override MOS guidelines. The MOS says that converting from binary to SI in articles fine, but I'm of the opinion that doing so where our sources are explicit in using another format is decidedly <i>not</i> fine. Wikipedians don't usually have the leeway to restate what a reliable source says with different units of measure, just because some people prefer that measurement. Apple (and publications who report on them) almost never use SI... as a result, neither should we.</dd>

<dd>Sarenne's edits have now been reverted by no less than five different established editors, and yet this <i>single-purpose account</i> still insists on pushing changes on a wide number of articles (though limited in scope almost exclusively to Apple consumer hardware articles). They're claiming "consensus" by pointing to a discussion from a year and a half ago, but if this many editors are reverting their changes, then this mission of theirs needs to be put on hold, and discussions need to happen BEFORE wide-ranging changes are made.</dd>

</ul>
<p>On the positive side:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editors have stopped actually removing critical discussion from the talkpage:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Concerning evidence for sockpuppetry or meatpuppetry: Some editors are editing using predominantly single use accounts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Fainites" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Fainites" rel="nofollow">[75]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.179.191.108" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.179.191.108" rel="nofollow">[76]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/202.67.116.135" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/202.67.116.135" rel="nofollow">[77]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/210.50.223.207" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/210.50.223.207" rel="nofollow">[78]</a>: The recent COI issues on the article are perhaps more important <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive175#NLP_update_-_Some_COI_issues_and_reluctance_of_some_editors_to_get_along_.28and_some_positive_points.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive175#NLP_update_-_Some_COI_issues_and_reluctance_of_some_editors_to_get_along_.28and_some_positive_points.29" rel="nofollow">[79]</a> considering the cultic issues inherent in the subject. Apart from this I see no evidence of any sockpuppeting actually going on in the article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There has been some compliance with Cleanuptaskforce suggestions. Also - though they do tend to try to marginalize critical suggestions critical influence shows some effect and there is a delayed positive response towards some of those suggestions afterwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall things are slowly moving forward. Civility is clearly very important on Wikipedia (as I see it in a nutshell - to “Participate in a respectful and civil way. Do not ignore the positions and conclusions of others. Try to discourage others from being uncivil, and be careful to avoid offending people unintentionally) and especially for articles such as the NLP article. None of the other articles I edit on have editors who persistently restore argumentative phrasing (WP words to avoid) into the text. It seems to me that as long as civility is properly adopted and reasonably maintained though - then all relevant views can be fairly presented and constructive article proceedings can be maintained long term. Again - if I inadvertently make any suggestion or action that is not constructive then I would be grateful if an admin could point it out here or on my talkpage.

<p>Thank you Woohookitty for some positive remarks. As for AlanBarnet, the reason why he is sidelined and/or ignored by all the other regular editors is that they are all of the view that he is a sockpuppet of Long Term Abuser HeadleyDown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Long_term_abuse/HeadleyDown" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Long_term_abuse/HeadleyDown" rel="nofollow">[80]</a>and therefore attempts to negotiate/discuss civilly or compromise with him are a pointless waste of time. Several of these editors lived through the previous mediation/arbitration marathon and therefore have experience of this. The major improvements in accuracy of citations and quotations took place in the teeth of his interference and major improvements in trimming have taken place since all editors agreed to ignore AlanBarnet as a sockpuppet of HeadleyDown thus enabling some constructive work to be done.<a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFainites_e96a.html" title="User:Fainites">Fainites</a> 18:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Fainites. This is a good opporunity for you to try to get along with editors who hold different views from you. Some infrequent editors on the article seem to be in agreement with me concerning the need for civil discussion<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=99309220&amp;oldid=99286744" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=99309220&amp;oldid=99286744" rel="nofollow">[81]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98616296&amp;oldid=98616234" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=98616296&amp;oldid=98616234" rel="nofollow">[82]</a>.. However, the prior assessments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive160#Comaze_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive160#Comaze_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" rel="nofollow">[83]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive164#NLP_article_specific_examples_of_promotional_obscuring_of_facts_and_relevant_views" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive164#NLP_article_specific_examples_of_promotional_obscuring_of_facts_and_relevant_views" rel="nofollow">[84]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive175#NLP_update_-_Some_COI_issues_and_reluctance_of_some_editors_to_get_along_.28and_some_positive_points.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive175#NLP_update_-_Some_COI_issues_and_reluctance_of_some_editors_to_get_along_.28and_some_positive_points.29" rel="nofollow">[85]</a>: indicate that you seem to be part of a domimating group who encourages COI editing and the promotional obscuring of views. You seem quite resistant to reasonable admin suggestions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADoc_pato&amp;diff=99248806&amp;oldid=98777992" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADoc_pato&amp;diff=99248806&amp;oldid=98777992" rel="nofollow">[86]</a>. According to policies on sockpuppetry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:sockpuppet" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:sockpuppet" rel="nofollow">[87]</a> the dominating group in this case could possibly be considered meatpuppets when following the same NPOV non-compliance and can all be considered the same editor when voting about other editors. I'm not particularly interested in banning COI editors or rooting out all possible meatpuppets though - and I'm sure admin will deal with any sockpuppetry. The main solution is to encourage editors to get along civilly so they can present all relevant views in concise form without obscuring the most relevant. I believe that above all - admin suggestions and scrutiny have been helpful in improving the NLP article and I'll continue to make helpful notifications to encourage civility and constructive editing for as long as its needed. I believe its inevitable that at some time you will have to show that you can get along with editors of different views. For the sake of civil discussion and a balanced article of course - the sooner the better. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 05:42, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi 58. I am not gaming anyone. I have shown commitment to civility and that will continue in cooperation with admin. I believe my discussion behavior complies with how a Wikipedian should communicate on Wikipedia and follows how other admin communicate. Criticising it probably doesn't help. I believe my userpage is full of undue harassment towards me and shows a particular group's pressure to stifle criticism. If anything it shows that the more pressure I get - the more civil I become. I hope to encourage this civility reaction in others long term on the NLP article and all the other articles I am editing on. Feel free to join. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 14:28, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just want to add a quick note. It has been a pleasure collaborating with 58.* and Fainites. I believe these editors tend to be on the healthy skeptical side. Together we are working on NPOV. We have systematically worked through the entire article to checking facts and references. It has come a long way on the road to become a wikipedia feature article standard. We want to promote an atmosphere in the article and discussion so that more experienced wikipedians are willing to weigh in. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComaze_7cd3.html" title="User:Comaze">Comaze</a> 12:16, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Comaze. Judging by the past notices there is a dominating group on the NLP article (and there are COI issues) who tend to obscure relevant views for the purpose of promotion. Just yesterday Fainites and 58 added defensive writing to the lead section dressed up as criticism. The Cleanuptaskforce just asked for less defensive writing from proponents yet it was added as if its criticism. Criticism has been obscured. The science fact is that NLP is unsupported. The main criticism and concern is that NLP is pseudoscientfic and there are concerns about it being promoted as a therapy in self development and in HRM. Its fairly clear that as a group there is no substantial skepticism. It took a lot of work and even scrutiny from this ANI to make the basic fact present on the article (unsupported). The obvious solution: If more experienced Wikipedians are to be encouraged to edit there then it would help if you as a group would show that you can get on with editors who hold diffent views and who want to report straight. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 14:22, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Professor Devilly appeared on the talkpage a while back and said he held NLP as an archetypal pseudoscience <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=97121647&amp;oldid=97110459" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=97121647&amp;oldid=97110459" rel="nofollow">[97]</a>. His paper also supports the view that NLP is a pseudoscience. Professor Drenth (1999) and others call it pseudoscientific. Its discussed in books about mind myths and pseudoscience and the main reason for mentioning it is because it is promoted in fringe psychotherapy - pop psychology and human resource management. Editors have persistently been suppressing that information in the lead section eg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=101853623&amp;oldid=101745470" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=101853623&amp;oldid=101745470" rel="nofollow">[98]</a>. I'm glad to see that the incivil edit summary has been omitted though. Now in order to be properly civil it is necessary to discuss with all editors whatever their view. I believe most here would deem that to be in the spirit of constructive editing on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 04:34, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I put in accurate quotations from Drenth 1999 and 2003 and also verified Devilly. Comaze was the one who invited Devilly to comment. I also corrected the references and citations and quotations from Lilienfield, another scientist who calls NLP a pseudoscience, also the other scientists who call it 'neuromythology' and the like. AlanBarnet does none of this work yet he accuses me of being part of a pro-NLP group. Alan Barnets main contribution to the article is false quotes and references and misleading summaries, eg a completely untrue entry, not mentioned in the edit summary, that three reputable scientists called NLP a cult. Do not be misled by the sugary, pseudocivil admin notices. There are miles and miles of the same misleading nonsense on the talkpage. all ignored. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFainites_e96a.html" title="User:Fainites">Fainites</a> 17:15, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I submitted a 3RR violation report concerning anonymous <a href="../../../1/9/3/User%7E193.219.28.146.html" title="User:193.219.28.146">User:193.219.28.146</a> persistent re-adding an unconstructive and inflammatory comment to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Talk%7EAss_to_mouth_b163.html" title="Talk:Ass to mouth">Talk:Ass to mouth</a>, because he objects to the existence of the article rather than suggesting improvements (the article recently survived an AfD). His comment has been removed by 5 different editors (including one admin) over the past few days, and the anon editor has recently re-posted the comment a 6th time today. He has been warned multiple times, and claims on his talk page that (a) his talk page comments are meant to improve Wikipedia; (b) he is not doing any reverting, others are reverting <i>him</i> and they shouldn't be deleting talk page edits; and (c) there isn't a precedent for reporting 3RR violations on a talk page.</p>
<p>My question is, is this appropriately reportable as a 3RR violation, or is there a better place to report persistent trolling? Details of the incident are documented in my 3RR report at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:193.219.28.146_reported_by_User:Axlq_.28Result:.29" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR#User:193.219.28.146_reported_by_User:Axlq_.28Result:.29</a>.

<dd>You're within your rights to remove the comment (within 3RR), but my advice would be to leave the comment in place and answer him. Or leave the comment in place and ignore him. He's wrong, but he's within his rights to ask the question, so long as he doesn't 3RR.

<dd>(Edit conflict) With all due respect, I agree with the anon - not about the substance of his comment, but about the fact that you shouldn't be deleting a reasonably civil talk page comment. He writes that this article is one of the differences between the Wikipedia and Britannica. Well, in that, he is absolutely correct. I personally believe that makes us more useful, but that's just an opinion. In any case, it is less disruptive to just let it stand. Trying to delete those three lines of text has already wasted ten times the effort of writing them. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 00:22, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If someone repeatedly places the same message on some one's talk page that they have acknowledged (deleting a message is the same as acknoledging that you read it) then it becomes harassment and incivility. The only time you should -ever- force a message to stay on a page is if a user is currently acting to vandalise the pedia and an easily accessible log needs to be there for a WP:AIV note. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 02:21, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That is kinda irrelevant - we have been removing a trolling comment from an article that has had a lot of scrutiny recently. The comment is completely non-constructive and its removal is in line with <a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">WP:TALK</a> (ie. the second sentence, namely 'Article talk pages should not be used by editors as platforms for their personal views.') Also, as I have stated elsewhere, 4 editors agree that his comment is inappropriate for that talk page and have removed it.</dd>
<dd>I disagree with the earlier editor who said it is wasted time removing them. If they stay it leads to other users adding similar comments which are also pointless (for example just prior to this silly incident there was another anon who went on a bit of a rant about it being anti-christian). Keeping a talk page tidy and on topic is just as important as actually working on the article in my opinion.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 12:29, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This issue has restarted. I removed the comment (and that of a supporter as it would have been redundant without the thread opener). It has been reverted again. Can this talk page be semi-protected to avoid this? Also, the block imposed seems to have no deterrent effect. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 01:25, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

An RFCU was filed against some folks who AD doesn't like, and when they were proven to not be socks or puppetmasters, he began attempting to re-add more and more to the RFCU (in spite of Essjay telling him that the evidence had already been reviewed). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Petri_Krohn&amp;diff=102002359&amp;oldid=102002190" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Petri_Krohn&amp;diff=102002359&amp;oldid=102002190" rel="nofollow">[101]</a>.</p>

<dd>Calling someone a troll and a "circumfetishist" (learn something new every day) in their AfD isn't very cool in my book. Especially when it's being done based on <i>Google results</i> rather than on-wiki activity. I think it does cross the line into PA territory, but I can <i>sorta</i> see it being interpreted either way. Sorta. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 04:58, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) I have to say I look askance at critical mentions of the off-wiki activity of fellow editors unless it 1) violates <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> and/or <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, or 2) involves off-wiki activity specifically designed to disrupt WP (and even there, caution would be advisable).
