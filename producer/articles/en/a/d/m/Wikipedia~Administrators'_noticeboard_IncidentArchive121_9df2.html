<p>What does one do about a problem user who bombards one's user talk page with false warning templates? Ste4k has been doing so, making false accusations of personal attacks (an example of what Ste4k classifies as a personal attack can be seen when she selectively quotes a sentence beginning "What is a problem is you trying to make that decision for everyone else ..." as "What is a problem is you..."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Charles_Buell_Anderson&amp;diff=63555232&amp;oldid=63534141" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Charles_Buell_Anderson&amp;diff=63555232&amp;oldid=63534141" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) Ste4k has also falsely accused me of vandalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62237724" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62237724" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (for removing, as mentioned above, a set of <i>twenty links</i> she inserted into the "See also" section of the article on rationales as vague as "<a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a> - Related to Religious Figures") She also claims that I "Remov[ed] direct quotes from a cited source supplied by <a href="../../../n/s/c/User%7ENscheffey_0fe4.html" title="User:Nscheffey">Nscheffey</a> (<a href="../../../n/s/c/User_talk%7ENscheffey_d4cb.html" title="User talk:Nscheffey">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nscheffey_b4d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nscheffey">contribs</a>)" when in fact, the source she refers to is not directly quoted at all, and responds to the fact that I had to restore information she removed on incorrect pretext, twice, by informing me "Please refer to policy listed at <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>."

<dd>I completely agree with this analysis. Ste4k combines a stubborn nature with an incorrect interpretation of policy, along with an infinite capacity to be "offended". The <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#User_talk:Ste4k" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">drama she has caused over her talk page</a> alone is amazing, but she has wreaked havoc in many other areas of Wikipedia. I have witnessed many editors have unfriendly and bizarre interactions with her, and am considering opening an RfC on her behavior. Her current activity is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ste4k&amp;diff=63668452&amp;oldid=63667929" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ste4k&amp;diff=63668452&amp;oldid=63667929" rel="nofollow">removing comments</a> from her talk page as "personal attacks." --<a href="../../../n/s/c/User%7ENscheffey_0fe4.html" title="User:Nscheffey"><font color="#000080" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>N</strong></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>scheffey</strong></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/s/c/User_talk%7ENscheffey_d4cb.html" title="User talk:Nscheffey">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nscheffey_b4d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nscheffey">C</a>)</sup> 21:25, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hey all, I've recently been accused of being racist,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am British you racists person, there are many of us in the UK, irrespective of our ancestry. I suggest you move on to another site preferably backed by the National British Party. I would be greatful if you could email me your remarks with your full name and address (you do not have to, of course).

<p>Normally I wouldn't object, just smile and move along, but I also noted this:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I don't think that this could be construed as a legal threat, but considering he also mentioned "...You could be taken to court, or at the very least reprimanded." and "I am afraid I cannot let this one down and will return to it, this week, next or whenever." I'd like to get other peoples opinion. Needless to say, this <i>is</i> my real name. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 18:41, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think it's a legal threat. he seems to have a bee in his bonnet. I cannot see why he has taken such offense but perhaps he's suffered racist comments IRL so is extra sensitive. Who knows? What I would do, in your position, is nothing.

<p>If it recurs, if he decides to fixate upon you and the "racism" that has not yet been fixed (by your premature removal, etc.), then I'd suggest calling up the mediation cabal folks to take him in hand, figure out whether he misreads everything or just you, and try to help. "Racism" is one of those rhetorical nuclear charges. The most important thing is not to debate it, I think, as that maintains the focus on some demand that you please someone else, but rather to acknowledge the feelings as a practical matter only. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:46, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Accusations of racism qualify as a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivility</a>. Warn him off. If he continues, give it a NPA warning, and ask someone else to remove the attack. If you can avoid him, do so.

<p>I recently looked at opentasks and stumbled on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=My_Bed_Banter_%26_Beyond_%28Scrubs_episode%29&amp;oldid=63455882" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=My_Bed_Banter_%26_Beyond_%28Scrubs_episode%29&amp;oldid=63455882" rel="nofollow">this</a>. The text seemed curiously blocky, so I inputted the text into google and found a summary, verbatim, at <a href="http://www.tv.com/scrubs/my-bed-banter-and-beyond/episode/114341/recap.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tv.com/scrubs/my-bed-banter-and-beyond/episode/114341/recap.html" rel="nofollow">TV.com</a>. Now, this would be a simple matter if it didn't appear that just about every other episode summary was a direct copyvio of the summary at TV.com. The copyright policy on TV.com <a href="http://www.cnetnetworks.com/editorial/terms.html?tag=tv.ft.no" class="external text" title="http://www.cnetnetworks.com/editorial/terms.html?tag=tv.ft.no" rel="nofollow">here</a> clearly states, "<i>All materials published on our sites, including, but not limited to, written content, photographs, graphics, images, illustrations, marks, logos, sound or video clips, and Flash animation, are protected by our copyrights or trademarks or those of our partners.

<p>This may be a long term thing, but each episode is possibly a copyvio. Looking through <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Scrubs_episodes_cfc9.html" title="List of Scrubs episodes">List_of_Scrubs_episodes</a>, episode 1 does not appear to be copyvio, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 all are blatant copyvio. This leads me to believe it is likely that each of the... *gulp* 114 episodes could be copyvio. I brought this up in IRC and it was suggested I bring this here, so here you go. What should be done, heh? <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 04:06, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The removal of the RFA should be, in my opinion, for trolling, and not the personal attacks. The candidate's usage of "nigga" and overuse of profanity was probably a childish imitation of rapper talk, so NPA isn't really applicable on the RFA. However, it was a completely unserious RFA designed to troll, to give the candidate another opportunity to play. The RFA needed to be removed to not feed the trolls and because, under early removal, the pro/con voting was 0 - 15 after&#160;:30. There was no chance. As for the block, it's wholly appropriate for vandalism and trolling. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:51, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I originally didn't think it was RJII, (that was Francis). But I have to admit that after talking to Francis over email, more in depth analysis and in light of the style of their recent messages on their own and Hogeye's talk pages, I could have been mistaken with regard to it being hogeye. I am starting to agree that it could be RJII. Either way, I am certain this user <i>is</i> a sock of one of these two blocked/banned users. Brand new user's rarely end up on such obscure pages as the ones he did and start pushing that pov. Anyways, their first edit was a revert, which seems highly unlikely for a new user (I didn't learn how to do that for at least a week or two, maybe longer). And although Hogeye never edited that page, as of June 30, four open proxies suspected to be socks of hogeye have edited it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/208.101.10.50" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/208.101.10.50" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/70.166.128.20" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/70.166.128.20" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=209.126.148.50" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=209.126.148.50" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/72.204.5.50" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/72.204.5.50" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> Their edits on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_individualist_anarchism.html" title="American individualist anarchism">American individualist anarchism</a> (which currently redirects to "anarchism in the united states") were reversions to pov forks supported by other suspected hogeye socks. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 21:22, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

On the one hand Giovanni33 has been sockpuppeting and editing in a very combative way. On the other hand, some people believe he is willing to edit in a positive way going forward. The main issue I see is that he has not admitted his sockpuppeting; without this admission of wrongdoing, it is unlikely he will cease from doing these behaviors. My recommendation is that he be blocked until he admits all of his sockpuppets, uncluding <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor33_6069.html" title="User:Professor33">User:Professor33</a>, and promises not to use sockpuppets again.

<dd>I don't think G33 especially disruptive, besides the puppetry and the arguments which follow. Nor are his puppets generally disruptive, except insofar as they're used to ignore 3RR (always). His puppets should be indef blocked, and he should be allowed to continue editting from his main account without prejudice. Edit-warring should prove less appealing without the capacity for limitless reverts.Timothy Usher 22:33, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that as there have been some clearly wrong allegations together with some possible allegations that it would be wise to get some <b>final</b> desision on what are his socks or not by some that are not involved in editwaring with him, and then take things from there. <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgathoclea_2154.html" title="User:Agathoclea">Agathoclea</a> 23:29, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There have not been "some clearly wrong allegations", Agathoclea. There was, I believe, <i>one</i> (not <i>some</i>) wrong allegation — that of <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuteronomy2000_e78b.html" title="User:Deuteronomy2000">User:Deuteronomy2000</a>. I never made that allegation, and when I asked the two users who had tagged that page to stop, they both stopped. It was not a crazy assumption to make, though, as that user account was clearly created specially for the purpose of trying to get blocked someone who had blocked him, as he has a history of creating puppets, and as he drew attention to himself by reverting my removal of Deuteronomy's post. I would strongly oppose any suggestion of blocking Giovanni until he admits that Deuteronomy is his puppet. But I do not think that a brief accusation (against someone who has violated <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> again and again), which I never supported, should be allowed to weaken the case that he has used numerous puppets.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the "possible allegations", on the <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cline.html" title="Cline">cline</a> between absolutely excluded and absolutely certain, I think the word "possible" comes far too low when referring to Giovanni's puppets. I might include <a href="../../../f/i/o/User%7EFionaS_5144.html" title="User:FionaS">FionaS</a> as a "possible" puppet, but that account is of little interest as it was created just to support Gio, after he was caught redhanded in puppetry, and did not attempt to revert to his version afterwards. But there is no way that Kecik is a "possible" (meaning perhaps, perhaps not) puppet. The same goes for MikaM. Think of it. They both registered around the time that Giovanni was meeting with opposition. They have both edited while logged off, and then acknowledged the edits, from IPs that were geographically close to Giovanni. They both share linguistic idiosyncrasies with Giovanni. They both began to revert to his version soon after arriving. They both follow Giovanni from one article to another, in order to revert to his version or to support him on the talk page. Kecik's seventh edit and MikaM's sixth were votes on the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETransubstantiation_f77c.html" title="Talk:Transubstantiation">transubstantiation talk page</a>, supporting Giovanni, who wanted to put in stuff about Transubstantiation being based on earlier pagan rituals with cannibalism. Note that the Transubstantiation article was not being discussed at the pages where they started their wiki-life, that no message was left on their talk pages asking them to show up, and that they did not have e-mail enabled. Note also that they would frequently show up when he had run out of reverts, and would just revert back to his version without discussion. Kecik has 40 reverts to Giovanni out of a total of 45 article edits. He was nearly four months at Wikipedia before he made a single edit to a page that wasn't one where Giovanni needed support. And he only did that after I had repeatedly pointed out his record of doing <i>nothing</i> except reverting to Giovanni. MikaM has 32 reverts to Giovanni out of 42 article edits. How could those accounts be anything other than puppet accounts? <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 01:39, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, there isn't disagreement. Giovanni has never admitted to deliberately violating our policies in a devious way. Nobody who has seen all the evidence has disagreed about any particular account being a puppet. The accounts are BelindaGong (confirmed), Freethinker99 (confirmed), MikaM, Kecik, RTS, NPOV77, HK30, Mercury2001, and Professor33. Apart from RTS, whose IP is not known, they are all known to be geographically close to Giovanni33. RTS appeared suddenly one day and reverted seven times to Giovanni's version — as a brand new users. Brand new users don't normally know how to revert. Within minutes of his blocking, NPOV77 jumped in and reverted back to his last version. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 01:39, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Will comment more fully tomorrow, but just before I go to bed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebecca said she was going away for a few days, and asked that things be put on hold until she got back.</li>
<li>Giovanni is very unlikely to admit to any wrongdoing that can't be proved. Even when it can be, he's not given to admitting things. For example, he has claimed that his only edit warring was at the very beginning when he "didn't know the policy at all", despite the fact that there are numerous diffs to show how he was told about the 3RR over and over again, and was not reported until he had carried out numerous violations <i><b>after</b></i> the warnings.</li>
<li>I think we should try to discuss things here before any blocks are implemented (other than blocks for new offences), and should also avoid unblocking without full discussion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Giovanni33" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Giovanni33" rel="nofollow">His block log</a> is, I would say, rather embarrassing to administrators.</li>

<p>I have e-mailed a full account of Giovanni's puppetry, with evidence, to members of the ArbCom. Or, to be more accurate, I e-mailed it to a senior Wikipedian who is able to access the ArbCom mailing list, and asked him to forward it. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 01:59, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have continued to revert him beyond my own 3RR limit, in cognizance of the "clear vandalism" clause of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. I understand that revert wars are undesirable on Wikipedia, but I also strongly feel that blatant vandalism and attempts at <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">ownership</a> of articles should be firmly repudiated. I will <i>immediately</i> desist reverting the vandal if <i>anyone</i> (other than the linkspammer) asks me to on my talk page.

<p>In so much as the policies are in place, by "WPs", already, and generally applied to <i>all</i> Wikipedia - why is the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> articles page(s) seen as a "special case" - and upon what authority?

When would the "legal" vendetta murders" start?&#160;:( In short Why is the above needed? Why not <i>in good faith</i> point out the <i>generally</i> agreed Wiki Policy documents, and rigorously use the consensus "disciplinary" protocols set out therein? <a href="../../../m/o/u/User%7EMousescribe_4fec.html" title="User:Mousescribe">Mousescribe</a> 20:30, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(Yes do, as I'm not a sock either - try getting a factual sign-on protocol for editors here, "Witchfinder" with checkuser is no use.) So you agree officially with a Police State setup? It is not a complaint, it is a question on Wiki policy. Also if you are linking me to "Imacomp" you have done a "covert" checkuser to show I have the same IP address. Why not just ask? I feely tell you that I Have, "He" is my Grandpa, and the IP address a/c is with Blueyonder, under Grandma's name. Also Grandpa "Imacomp" <i>is</i> a Freemason, as is my Father "mousescribe" - and I am not. OK?.

<dd>I don't have any particular viewpoint on the discussion there.

<p>This incident troubles me.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive22#User:Xombie_reported_by_User:Mailer_Diablo_.28Result:_8h.29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive22#User:Xombie_reported_by_User:Mailer_Diablo_.28Result:_8h.29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive22#User:Xombie_reported_by_User:Mailer_Diablo_.28Result:_8h.29</a></p>
<p>Mr/Ms Diablo, who is an administrator, inserted a derogatory personal opinion regarding the subject of the article, more than once. Xombie, who was policing the article for such comments, since it involved a current event drawing much attention (the World Cup final) properly removed the Diablo posts, as well as those from other users. Diablo then complained about Xombie, listed as 3RR violations Xombie's clearly correct removal of inappropriate posts as well as some that were more debateable. William M. Connelly then blocked Xombie without giving him a chance to respond. The comments Xombie removed often bordered on vandalism. More important, the deletion of derogatory unsourced information from the biographies of living persons is an exception to the 3RR rule. The comments Xombie deleted either violated that directly or were derogatory personal opinions, which are even worse. He did not delete any appropriate, purely factual, sourced comments. One or two of the deletions were partially sourced, but the text went beyond the sources. I think this is an example of an administrator acting out of pique and ignoring the fact that his own postings violated Wikipedia policy. He should at least have been warned about the derogatory comments/living persons and edit warring involved. Xombie deserves an apology. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivianDarkbloom_43b2.html" title="User:VivianDarkbloom">VivianDarkbloom</a> 23:56, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On looking at the history, it appears to me that Mailer diablo acted correctly, and the material repeatedly removed by Xombie was not inappropriate.

<dd>I haven't issued a warning, yet, but I'm about to. He does seem to have very narrow interests -- something called Ten O'Clock Classics, which he bolsters a great deal, and laser defoliation. The removals of tags seem to be a very naive form of OWN, too. If he continues after the warning (I won't watchlist him), please flag the mediation folks to see if he'll respond. If he doesn't respond <i>and</i> keeps going, then he's probably not here to help the encyclopedia, but rather to advertise. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:41, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since the implementation of anonymous-only blocks, I think it's time to review our policy of blocking Tor exit nodes. I believe that we are better off removing all Tor blocks and replacing them with <b>anonymous only blocks with no account creation</b>. It has also been suggested by <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">User:Gmaxwell</a> that we use a bot to update these blocks based on the list provided by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

<li>I for one have nothing to do with Wikiproject Islam and do not have an Islamic Barnstar. I merely oppose your edits and support blocking you because I have seen few editors more disruptive than you in my time at Wikipedia. (I'd say Thewolfstar is the only one who tops you.) Your belief that anyone who opposes you on cat:Anti-Semitic people and related articles must be an "anti-semite" is an example of your demonstrated <i>routine failure to assume good faith</i>, and your neverending personal attacks, such as (incorrectly) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk%3AAnti-Semitic_people&amp;diff=63639595&amp;oldid=63623579" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk%3AAnti-Semitic_people&amp;diff=63639595&amp;oldid=63623579" rel="nofollow">calling netscott a "spammer"</a> when the section heading he wrote was <i>factually accurate at the time he wrote it</i>, are the principle reasons why I support the idea of such a block. Your attempt to escape your past as <a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorky_Pig_76af.html" title="User:Porky Pig">User:Porky Pig</a> failed, and so now you blame the poor reception your personal attacks has earned you on a past vote. I'd like to point out that none of the other editors who sided with you on the delete vote have been blocked that I know of, and many of them still participate collegially with those of us who voted to delete the category. The odd one out in this equation is <i>you</i>. I suggest ceasing the personal attacks, ceasing to assume bad faith, and working <i>with</i> us.

<p>I'm not clear just how this burr got under his saddle, but Panairjdde needs some time to cool off &amp; reflect on his behavior.</p>
<p><b>History</b>: As you may have noticed, he's been involved in an edit war at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montanism.html" title="Montanism">Montanism</a> over whether the letters "AD" should appear in the article (after the words "second century") because they are <i>redundant</i>. He has also been removing this abbreviation entirely from many other articles apparently for the same reason. Panairjdde argued at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Talk%7EMontanism_8875.html" title="Talk:Montanism">Talk:Montanism</a> that the Manual of Style gave him the right to remove this term; however, various editors who disagreed with this interpretation must have presented a good case, because he immediately proposed at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)</a> a change in the guidelines that would support his interpretation.</p>
<p>(Warning: here I became involved, &amp; pointing to Panairjdde that redundancy was not the most convincing argument justifying his deletion of "AD" entirely from articles, &amp; pointed to the guidelines at <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>. I tried to keep my tone friendly &amp; non-confrontational. I also asked him if there was another reason for his dislike of this term, but never saw an answer.)</p>
<p>Last night I saw that Panairjdde had announced that he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29&amp;diff=63684907&amp;oldid=63683951|was" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29&amp;diff=63684907&amp;oldid=63683951|was" rel="nofollow">dropping the matter</a>, &amp; thought that was the end of the matter. This morning, I noticed that he had made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Honorius_%28emperor%29&amp;diff=63750670&amp;oldid=60492865" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Honorius_%28emperor%29&amp;diff=63750670&amp;oldid=60492865" rel="nofollow">these edits</a> to <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honorius_%28emperor%29.html" title="Honorius (emperor)">Honorius (emperor)</a>, adding "AD" before every appearance of a year.

<dd>Comments (maybe even a scapegoat is allowed to present its own POV):
<ol>
<li>"various editors who disagreed with this interpretation must have presented a good case" They did not, since we kept discussing. But my point was never (never) disrupting Wikipedia, on which I have been working since 2002. Just because a lot of people did not like the way I was editing (and a few even said I was right) I asked for third opinion and a MoS modification to let the rule be clearer.</li>
<li>"I also asked him if there was another reason for his dislike of this term, but never saw an answer." I answered you, pointing out that my change proposal was against redundancy, not against AD (in the AD/CE diatribe, I am for BC/AD and against BCE/CE), so it included AD <i>and</i> CE.</li>
<li>As regards "dropping the matter", I asked to be allowed to apply the MoS with the same degree of liberty CodexSinaiticus (the user I started to edit war agains in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montanism.html" title="Montanism">Montanism</a>, after several other "redundant Ad" removals found no opposition). Since this right was not granted, I decided to change position, and do what Codex Sinaiticus have been doing in all his edits, that is adding AD wherever possible (and note that CS adopts this policy because he want to push a religious POV, as you can see from his talk page and edits).</li>
<li><i>None of my edits disrupted anything</i>. If anyone is able to show me that I disrupted anything, I shall disappear totally from Wikipedia. The problem is that llywrch did not find it good to point to any disruptiveness (I was just adding ADs in front of the years, as well as doing other uncontroversial edits). I also asked him why the same kind of edit was disruptiveness when I did it and not when Codex Sinaiticus did (no answer, of course).</li>
<li>It is also the second time, at least, that an administrator blocks me out of no reason. I was good the first time, waited for the block to expire, discussed with him, and in the end he recognized I was right and the block was wrong (<a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPanairjdde_Archive2_1f78.html#Block_for_violation_of_3RR" title="User talk:Panairjdde/Archive2">User_talk:Panairjdde/Archive2#Block_for_violation_of_3RR</a>, end of the post).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In the end, I did (not Codex Sinaiticus did, or any of those writing "settle this matter trough consensus" did) all I could do to settle this matter within WP rules. But, when I acted according to the "rules" set by a stubborn user (CS) and by the indifference of everybody to the matter, I got blocked.</dd>
<dd>If this will end without llywrch excuses, I kindly ask you to block me forever. Thanks alot.--<a href="../../../1/5/1/User%7E151.47.126.70.html" title="User:151.47.126.70">151.47.126.70</a> 20:15, 14 July 2006 (UTC) (Panairjdde, out of block)</dd>

<li><b>Response</b>: I just reviewed the discussions at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html#Alternative_proposal_for_section_.22Eras.22" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Alternative proposal for section "Eras"</a> &amp; <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPanairjdde_7c27.html#Year_dates" title="User talk:Panairjdde">User talk:Panairjdde#Year dates</a> just to be sure I didn't miss anything. This is your response to me at the MOS talk page:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Looks like my proposal got no support. Fine. At least acknowledge I am allowed to remove redundant AD is I feel like.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I read that as dropping the matter.</p>
<p>And your next words, before I had a chance to respond to the above were:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seems like you are not realistic. All of these started because I removed ADs from an article in which all of the years were AD, and I ensured the sentences were clearly worded. See <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montanism.html" title="Montanism">Montanism</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">Paul of Tarsus</a>. Since there is no consensus in claiming that redundancy is a reason to remove ADs in itself, I shall play it safe and allow/add ADs wherever it is possible, even beyond 1st millennium.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>That doesn't read to me as if you were engaging in a discussion. You threw down an ultimatum &amp; started doing what you promised. And what is it with this black/white thinking? Your point seems to be that either there be <b>no</b> use of "AD" or it should <b>always</b> be used, despite style &amp; convention. People were trying to convince you that there was a third solution -- that there should be <b>some</b> use -- but you were too impatient to listen.</p>
<p>And this is your response to me from your talk page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(First paragraph snipped)</dd>
<dd>Now, how do you dare removing my ADs from <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honorius_%28emperor%29.html" title="Honorius (emperor)">Honorius (emperor)</a>? In which your edit is different from Codex Sinaiticus' ones in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montanism.html" title="Montanism">Montanism</a>? Why the same rule is applied liberally to CS, and restrictively to me?</dd>
<dd>In the end, if you feel like I am "disrupting" (but you should be sure it is a disruption, and I don't see why my version of Honorius article is disrupted), you are free to adopt whatever action you like. Being "nice" does not pay on Wikipedia, this is what I learnt in the last years here.</dd>
<dd>I have enough of retreating in front of stubborn editors like CS, who have their views only because they do not actually want to collaborate, but to make their POVs prevail: I am going to start being stubborn myself. Whatever it takes.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I removed your edits from the article because you were pushing your point <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_absurdum.html" title="Ad absurdum">ad absurdum</a></i> -- which is the core of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Stop being disingenuous. Your edits are silly &amp; you know it.</p>
<p>This matter is not about Codex Sinaiticus or what she did; at worst the dispute at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montanism.html" title="Montanism">Montanism</a> would have ended up at <a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">WP:LAME</a>. If you believe she's misbehaving, there's a wide variety of options to use to grieve the matter. But she dropped out of the picture when you announced you were about to launch an edit war, &amp; editted several articles to prove your point -- &amp; came close to a pair of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a> violations. And now you are still making changes to Wikipedia as an anon.</p>
<p>I have tried hard to be nice about the matter, &amp; to show some understanding, but it's obviously not working with you. I'll be blunt now: <i>grow up or leave Wikipedia</i>. I'll feel the same way about which of these two options you follow. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 21:40, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I truly believe you are twisting the events to fit your POV, now you understood you were wrong on the matter. If <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Honorius_%28emperor%29&amp;diff=63810885&amp;oldid=63750670" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Honorius_%28emperor%29&amp;diff=63810885&amp;oldid=63750670" rel="nofollow">this</a> is absurd or silly, I would like to know why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_of_Tarsus&amp;diff=62644079&amp;oldid=62643096" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_of_Tarsus&amp;diff=62644079&amp;oldid=62643096" rel="nofollow">this</a> is not. I already asked you this twice, but you forgot to answer, funny.</dd>
<dd>I looked for consensus, there was none, I applied the policy coming out, which says it is upon the editor. This is not black/white, this is either I am allowed to do what I see fit, or none is. Same rules for all editors.</dd>
<dd>"If you believe she's misbehaving, there's a wide variety of options to use to grieve the matter." I tried them all, and the result was that her behaviour was correct. I simply applied it (again, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Honorius_%28emperor%29&amp;diff=63810885&amp;oldid=63750670" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Honorius_%28emperor%29&amp;diff=63810885&amp;oldid=63750670" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_of_Tarsus&amp;diff=62644079&amp;oldid=62643096" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_of_Tarsus&amp;diff=62644079&amp;oldid=62643096" rel="nofollow">this</a>). The fact that you blocked me and not her means that the rules are not the same for both of us?</dd>
<dd>As regards "And your next words, before I had a chance to respond to the above were" bit, I got an answer to my preceeding post, which was sort of "do your edits leaving the article clean, and probably noone complained", a mockery about was happening in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montanism.html" title="Montanism">Montanism</a>, don't you think? You forgot to put this too, funny. However, the result was that the style/convention is on the editor taste, and I applied mine.</dd>
<dd>As regards making changes as anonymous, it is because you kindly blocked my account. I could not do it otherwise.</dd>
<dd>As regards being nice, note this "nicenesses" of yours:
<dl>
<dd><i>I'm asking you to stop this disruption immediately. Obviously, you have an issue with the style "AD" for reasons other than redundancy; I would suggest you spend your efforts on explaning them in the appropriate place. If you ignore this request, as an Admin I will be forced to take appropriate actions. I sincerely hope that this will not be necessary.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In a single post you are accusing me to do disruption (thing you still have to motivate), accusing me to have issues (thing you still have to prove), mock me after the long effort to settle this matter through WP means, menacing me. I hope you will be more nice when you "grow up" (thanks again).</dd>
<dd>I do care about this, otherwise I would not be here answering to you. But it takes two persons willing to settle the matter for a discussion, and in none of your posts to me (talk page and here) I see your will to settle the matter. --<a href="../../../1/5/1/User%7E151.47.126.70.html" title="User:151.47.126.70">151.47.126.70</a> 22:02, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And my alleged mistreatment of you justifies your use of <b>three</b> sockpuppets in the last few hours to circumvent this block? You were banned for throwing a tantrum worthy of any four-year old, &amp; I gave you a timeout -- just like any four-year old would get. And you threw this tantrum because people did not approve of your deletion of "AD"! There might be sillier things worth risking a 24-hour ban over, but I can't think of one.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To repeat myself Panairjdde, why did you originally want to delete <b>all</b> use of "AD" in an article? And when people thwarted these efforts, why did you start inserting "AD" into articles as much as possible? Does a little redundancy truly offend you this much? I honestly can't imagine why these letters mean so much to you, so so there has to be more to this issue than what you are writing. If you don't want to tell me -- well, there it is. But to risk so much over such a silly matter? There is no way I can understand this as adult or mature behavior.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you stop creating sockpuppets, &amp; just spend the 24 hours away from Wikipedia &amp; your computer, the block will be over. And if you do that, I'll offer you a deal: prove to me that I misjudged you. Do these things: for the next 3 days do not make any "AD"-related edits -- don't worry, the articles will still be there after that many days; during this time, make substantial improvements to 15 articles in <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">Wikipedia: Cleanup</a>. If you want to shame me &amp; show how you've been wronged, improve twice as many articles -- or three times as many. Do that, &amp; I will genuinely apologize for mistreating you &amp; misunderstanding you.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But in any case, make this block into a wikivacation; the world consists of a lot more than Wikipedia. The way you are behaving, you are going to end up causing yourself even more grief &amp; frustration, &amp; you may be blocked for good from Wikipedia. Other Admins are reading this &amp; forming opinions. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 01:58, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't issued a warning, yet, but I'm about to. He does seem to have very narrow interests -- something called Ten O'Clock Classics, which he bolsters a great deal, and laser defoliation. The removals of tags seem to be a very naive form of OWN, too. If he continues after the warning (I won't watchlist him), please flag the mediation folks to see if he'll respond. If he doesn't respond <i>and</i> keeps going, then he's probably not here to help the encyclopedia, but rather to advertise. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:41, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In response to those specific points: he's been repeating the removals on multiple passes through the same articles, even where the edits were reverted previously (as in the Stravinsky case). As for warnings, it's not as if he doesn't know this is a problem for many editors. And given the speed at which he edits, speed of response is probably of the essence. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenry_Flower_de0f.html" title="User:Henry Flower">Henry</a><a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenry_Flower_b54b.html" title="User talk:Henry Flower"><sup>Flower</sup></a> 11:47, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He has delinked three years, one of which was linked twice (!) for a total of four changes. As (without, admittedly, having checked) I very much doubt that the three year articles contain any information relevant to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, to my mind Wikipedia is four useless links better off for this edit. In fact, if I had been copyediting this article I would have delinked the years too. (There's an argument that an article like this should link to the "xxxx in music" instead.) I do appreciate your concern and I have read into the background on this, and I still fail to see why "speed ... is of the essence" here. It's not like he is vandalising anything useful after all. Is it because he is (presumably) using a bot to edit? Surely there must be a better way to sort this out than a block! And why (other than to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>) would you want to revert these edits en masse?</dd>

<p>Re: "Can someone with tab experience help with reverting his contributions where needed?":</p>
<ol>
<li>Usually, with Bobblewik, the whole series of date delinkings is reverted, leaving it to the usual editors of these articles to add or remove date links as they think appropriate, in accordance with the MoS. I quoted the relevant MoS section above. Seems like Guinnog has a problem with what is currently in the MoS too, because this editor gives a reading of style recommendations that has disappeared from the MoS for some time now, after a discussed consensus that took several months to achieve.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>You'll have to explain what you mean to me here. If you're referring to my stated preference for not linking date fragments, I am guided by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29#Partial_dates" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29#Partial_dates" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, although I think the policy is a mess now as it allows for the sort of ambiguity whose results seem apparent in this dispute. I would hate to think I could be blocked for a month for delinking years which I don't feel add anything to the article I am editing. One often sees many dozen links, many of them repeated, in any one article. I must have removed hundreds, just as I routinely remove any link I judge to be of no value to the project. Many of our articles are ludicrously overlinked with these low-value links. As with any edit any of us makes, other editors are free to put them back as or if they wish. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 12:56, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The last roll-back-reverting of Bobblewik's delinkings was, as far as I know, performed by Rebecca, earlier this month: "I've rollbacked the lot this time, but please let it be the last of them." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bobblewik&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61481378" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bobblewik&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61481378" rel="nofollow">1 July 2006, notice on Bobblewik's user talk page</a> --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 12:40, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I probably should have put a template there.

<li>Template placed. The text Francis quoted doesn't really appear to be a guideline or consensus. It specifically states that there's different groups of editors believing different things. Anyway, I think suspected bot editing and ignoring talk page messages after multiple blocks validate a 1 month block. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:08, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nobody really suspects bot editing by Bobblewik. Moreover he has offered to cut his editing speed to any reasonably specified by those who have objected, and had no reasonable response (possibly no response). His warnings (and blocks, as far as I know - excluding yours) have all come from those who are involved the content dispute. Moreover a number of admins have used admin powers to roll-back his edits, indiscriminately, which he has been exceedingly patient about. IMHO Bobblewik is more sinned against than sinning. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 15:10 <a href="../../../1/6/_/16_July_855f.html" title="16 July">16 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (GMT).</dd>

I am requesting a permanent block. Here are the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>He was registered as User:Atticus765, but blocked indefinitely in May 2006, for vandalism, block evasion, etc. No CheckUser test was run, but the pages vandalised and the vandalism style are the same, and the timing matches the time Atticus765 got blocked. And even if this isn't the same person, after three temporary blocks that all showed no effect, I think a permanent block would still be justified based on just the IP's vandalism alone (over 150 edits; all vandalism) and not counting Atticus765's edits.</li>
<li>He has during his blocks used <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Atticus765_2fbd.html" title="Category:Wikipedia sockpuppets of Atticus765">several sockpuppets</a>, which have all been blocked.</li>
<li>He has continued vandalism, despite multiple warnings from me and other editors, under his IP.</li>
<li>Most of the times I reported him, however, admins told me he had either stopped or not edited in two days (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=63394432" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=63394432" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>), both of which definitely not true, as his edit history shows. Other reports led to short-term blocks, shortly after which he continued to vandalise the exact same pages as before.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Firstly, indefinite blocks are never used for IPs (in time, a particular IP could be used by anybody). In exceptional cases, one might block for a period of months. Secondly, I have a hard time seeing how this ip's edits over the past few days are vandalism. Can you explain? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 14:16, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as a matter of fact, said IP is sadly only used by currently this one vandal, at least obviously by nobody else editing Wikipedia (according to the user's edit history, which includes not a single contructive edit). If he was blocked, and somebody else with the same IP wanted to edit Wikipedia, there would be ways to do so. Also, even a half a year block may be enough time for this fellow to cool off. And secondly, it is vandalism, because he continuously spams Wikipedia articles with his opinionated conceptions of musical genres applying (or not applying) to bands — despite being warned multiple times by multiple users that these genres were discussed, decided upon by consensus or professionally determined by music journalists — and refuses any kind of discussion, while at the same time showing no form or remorse, insight or acceptance for his obvious misbehavior. I know it's not strongly blatant vandalism (such as blanking/moving pages or spamming profanities/gibberish on articles), but given its sheer continuity and this user's lack of will to follow Wikipedia's rules and policies, he certainly deserves to be blocked. It's not easy and takes some time to get into this case, but it certainly is vandalism. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryCane_57e2.html" title="User:HarryCane">HarryCane</a> 17:55, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User:Repmart was making personal attacks on <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">User:The JPS</a> in several different locations, which I reverted, and he kept re-adding, so I blocked him last night for 24 hours.

He kept coming back with anon accounts to replace the attacks, and I blocked those, as well. I have now received an email from him threatening to create a website repeating his attacks on The JPS and on me, as well, although what he plans on saying about me, I cannot imagine. I have warned him that if he does so, I will permanently block him.

<p>I have just been harshly treated (erasing two weeks of research) by the user "<b>AnonMoos</b>". This is my first addition to Wikipedia, and was apparently not in accordance with the style guide. I can understand a correction and brief instruction or hints on how to complete it, but not the casual erasure and harsh "you got it wrong, do it like this".</p>
<p>This is at total discord with the Wikipedian / community approach that I'd come to think Wikipedia stood for. Frankly, I'm now wondering why I should bother to extend it, rather than being excited (as I was) at the thought of participating.</p>
<p>Frankly, this user's attitude to newbies is more than likely turning every person away from Wikipedia that he "corrects" in such a harsh manner - in short: hindering more than he helps.</p>
<p>If he 'corrects' 10 articles each week, but turns 10 people away from contributing - he's simply preventing growth, rather than aiding proper growth by helping newbs.</p>
<p>I'm annoyed, and frankly very angry at such treatment - I appreciate his "help", but <b>NOT</b> his attitude.</p>
<p>I'm happy to be corrected - <b>but not smacked down like a little child</b>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by User:Tiberiusgrant (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7ETiberiusgrant_ca6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Tiberiusgrant">contribs</a>).</small></p>

Some three and half hours after I have removed the attack, without being told to do so, JzG placed a warning on my talkpage about a thing I already undid. Warnings, blocks etc on wikipedia should be preventive, not punitive, whereas this is purely punitive, and could also be perceived as bossing. I have kindly (with Please) asked JzG to remove the warning from my talk page. Anyone please back me up on this. Azmoc 12:34, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I didn't think Zoe's contribution was edifying either, but the discussion point is, should the warning be removed from Azmoc's talk page. I don't think so.

<li>What I said, what I did was a <i>personal attack</i>, but I cooled off and removed it myself, long before someone placed a warning on my talkpage. This directly contradicts the preventive not-punitive common sense in which admins should use the blocks and warnings. Moreover, the sentence I left there is (quote): <b><i>I find your stated belief that you are</i> running wikipedia <i>more than the other (yet inexperienced) users unbelievable.</i></b> It doesn't say anything about Zoe him/herself, it just says that I strongly disagree with his/her beliefs, unless we live in some environment in which disagreeing with an admin is a personal attack. This admin-cabal argumenting like <i>well, well, you are right here, but this other thing you did is wrong anyway so we will do nothing against our co-admins</i> is really driving me nuts.

<li>It's a pro-forma warning. The mature response is to accept the criticism, as you partially do (even with the modification it is still unacceptable to accuse an admin of abusing privileges in a content dispute unless you can cite solid evidence) and not do it again. Wikilawyering about exactly how incivil you were is not the way to go. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:09, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Look that is enough. I am not wikilawyering here, I am citing no policies etc. You are the one who placed a warning for a comment that has been removed. You provided the removed edit as a reason.

<dd>Moreover, instead of responding to my original proposal, JzG made yet another "I would like to see your full history" comment, then said "The cabal rejects this proposal. That is all. Just zis Guy you know? 12:45, 16 July 2006 (UTC)". What I did, what was the original IP I used to edit before I registered etc. is no bussiness of JzGs' and if he didn't want to respond to the proposal, and came there only to make comments on me and my edit history, he shouldn't have said anything at all.

<dd>What I pointed out was the absurdity of suggesting that the French-dominated <i>Union Cycliste Internationale</i> would allow the conservative American Lance Armstrong, a friend of Shrub, to evade a drugs ban. At the time there was much bad blood between the USA and France; the term <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheese_eating_surrender_monkeys.html" title="Cheese eating surrender monkeys">cheese eating surrender monkeys</a> is associated with this bad blood in the public mind.</dd>
<dd>What we have here is a simple case of Wikilawyering. Rather than coming up with the usual tripe about "suppressing information" (and believe me, we all groan out loud when we hear those words) you could instead have accepted my suggestion that you explore, on the article's Talk page, a properly neutral way of covering the issue - and indeed a way of fixing the rest of the section, which is POV tagged for reasons which are bliningly obvious.

The information you provided was stated in biased terms, and gave undue weight to an opinion which does not reflect the current legal status of Armstrong, rto wit: legally not a doper, whatever his detractors say. Until the courts say otherwise, neither can we. A case closed only this month where the implication he was a doper was found to be wrong.

At the begining I thought this was just someone carrid away by zeal to include some fact they'd newly discovered. By now I am convinced this is a simple POV push.

<p><a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocafan_ad96.html" title="User:Socafan">Socafan</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/c/User_talk%7ESocafan_ae98.html" title="User talk:Socafan">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Socafan_1a46.html" title="Special:Contributions/Socafan">contribs</a>) is intent on ensuring that a section of the article on <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Armstrong_8148.html" title="Lance Armstrong">Lance Armstrong</a> paints him in the most unfavourable light possible. Bear in mind that Armstrong may well be the most tested athlete in history and repeated drug tests and an official inquiry have all exonerated him. Here's Socafan's latest update, which is indistinguishable in tone from the ones for which I blocked him briefly before. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lance_Armstrong&amp;diff=64051351&amp;oldid=63850745" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lance_Armstrong&amp;diff=64051351&amp;oldid=63850745" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>. Note thast the last para, which was neutralised from some heavy innuendo, has been deneutralised, and the guilt-by-association has been reintroduced. I need a second pair of eyes here.</p>
<p>He has filed an ArbCom case at <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html#JzG" title="WP:RFAr">WP:RFAr#JzG</a>.</p>
<p>I have protected the article to prevent his repeated reversion to his preferred version (and to keep a spate of drive-by anons off); it is arguably better to block the problem editor and leave the article unprotected but that would prevent him taking part in the arbitration. I wouldn't like to call that one myself, please feel free to swap the article protection for a block and unprotection or possible semi-protection if you think it right. I feel very strongly that until Socafan at least acknowledges that there might be some merit in the idea that, for example, emphasising WADA's view over that of the official inquiry by the former head of the Dutch anti-doping agency which was strongly critical of WADA, might violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, it would be unwise to allow him to edit the article. Socafan appears determined to assert his point of view, and to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> his Talk page; look in the history since many pertinent comments have been deleted as "trolling". <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:00, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You do not own my talk page either. Many editors remove talk from their pages, and you used double standards by punishing only one side - Netscott had removed talk from his page, too. You assume bad faith and claim I push a POV while I can easily say that what you do is abuse of admin powers to push yours. I have not broken the three revert rule - you have - and I explained my edits, provided source and used talk, you just made wholesale reverts. The WADA case needs to be discussed at the article talk page, not here, but only reporting that UCI rejected WADA's and leaving out that WADA continues to see Armstrong as a drug abuser and considers legal actions against UCI is clearly tendentious. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocafan_ad96.html" title="User:Socafan">Socafan</a> 20:03, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User is the creator of the article and has been edit warring around it in the past. He is not an admin (failed the nomination 6 times) and is often barred from using Wikipedia, mostly for 3RRing. He just single handed closed the AfD of this article as "keep", putting a label on the talk page referring to another AfD. A vote to delete the article was removed by him, referring to his "AfD closure". He has also "closed" other AfDs about which he was edit warring and has been warned about this behavior. I would like an administrator to look into these issues, also since I do not know precisely how to deal with them myself. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 13:18, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks to <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> for catching this. IMO, the article is a clear delete, but even clearer is the rule that non-admins don't close AfD's they've "voted" on. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 14:20, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for the compliment, Eluchil404. Haham haunka had done exactly the same to an article I listed for AfD. He was warned at the time, but then recreated the article right after it was deleted through the AfD. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 14:49, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This AfD has been listed since July 7. On July 11 it was closed by Haham hunka as keep despite his voting in it. It was reopened on July 13, then closed again that day by Haham hanuka. It was reopened today. Since this is buried way back in July 7's AfDs, would an admin be willing to take a look and relist this on today's AfDs because of all the issues that have been had with it being closed and opened several times over? <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 14:31, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pointing out as I did at the AfD, Haham hanuka was trying to push the AfD to his side by advertising it at user talk pages: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jackys_cy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64131846" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jackys_cy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64131846" rel="nofollow">Jackys cy's</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Seidenstud&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64131664" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Seidenstud&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64131664" rel="nofollow">Seidenstud's</a>, specifically.

<p>I live in the UK. In the UK we have freedom. I intend to tall my story with nothing but the TRUTH on my side. You are a part of THE problem on Wikipedia. Administrative bullies.</p>
<p>Here's my latest quote from YOU that WILL make it onto all the different discussion groups and forums where I intned to paste the story aobut YOU and The JPS.</p>
<p>"If you DO make such a page, don't expect your block to be undone. Zoe" The quote speaks volumes Zoe, you moron. You are going to suspend me if I tell people how you and The JPS are administrative bullies and how you BOTH use Wikipedia for your own political agendas and how THE JPS uses it to sell stuff on Ebay.</p>
<p>With regards to your threat about suspending this 1 User ID, you can lick my hairy balls.</p>
<p>I am not only going to make 'such a page' but it I am going to put a lot of hours into pasting the story and I intend to email 'THE BOARD' every day until they respond. I will uise as many different email addresses as it takes to see your bullying corrected.</p>

<dd>My point was, perhaps it is best to try something else entirely. Blocking the accounts just creates more and more IPs that are autoblocked. At some point this has got to be affecting other Wikipedians, because it does not seem to impact this user. Maybe someone could find out what he wants and get the issue resolved - something seems unresolved. That way Admin time wouldn't be spent looking for the accounts, researching the accounts, and blocking them. This can't be the only way to address users. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThoughtControl_142e.html" title="User:ThoughtControl">ThoughtControl</a> 22:24, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That doesn't seem right. The PoolGuy account was around for years without any problems. What makes you think he wants to be abusive? Sure lots of Admins have blocked those accounts, but he seems very consistent in bringing up one issue of improper administrative action. Perhaps someone could figure out that resolving that would resolve the issue. Seems to me the inappropriate block, inconsistent with a written Wikipedia policy is the issue. Why is that ignored? <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarageDoorOpener_79f9.html" title="User:GarageDoorOpener">GarageDoorOpener</a> 23:17, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The disappointing thing is trying to explain Wikipedia policy to Admins. However, here goes:</p>
<p>"There's no specific policy against it, but it's generally considered uncool unless you have a good reason."</p>
<p>"I would say that multiple usernames are really only a problem if they are used as a method of troublemaking of some sort. For example, to generate an appearance of consensus, or to vote more than once, or to hide from public scrutiny.[1] (2003)"</p>
<p>This is a quote from Mr. Wales on the <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> page. To translate, users can have multiple accounts, so long as they don't use it to violate policy. GoldToeMarionette was a multiple account, however it did not violate policy. This is what is actually written down as Wikipedia policy. Please explain how this can possibly be unclear to those with Admin authority. I am not an Admin, and it makes complete sense to me. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContributerGreen_895c.html" title="User:ContributerGreen">ContributerGreen</a> 23:35, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't do anything wrong. I would think that would mean something to Admins too. Why do you want to make a user who was a good but small contributor go away? How is that good for the project? <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQualityCounts_01fb.html" title="User:QualityCounts">QualityCounts</a> 23:57, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is very interesting, these users were very anxious to comment and contribute when it is all about blocking. When thought is challenged and forced to think about the policy and its application these Admins avoid it. They think it is best to just block, because blocking makes problems go away. Blocking does not solve the fundamental problem. I need someone to deal with the fundamental problem. Does anyone here have the capacity to address it? A few of you have proven you can block an account, congratulations. Now, try to actually address the issue.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, someone will block this account too, thinking that will make a difference. How disappointing, that will be the limit of their Administrator capacity. Instead, hopefully someone will rise to address the issue. Anyone? It just takes communicating, not blocking. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReadingRabbit_6d37.html" title="User:ReadingRabbit">ReadingRabbit</a> 01:37, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The probem has been repeatedly described to you, it went through an arbcom case, and since neither was to your liking you ignored it.

<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I would like to bring to your attention what I consider heavy handedness on the part of an administrator. Please reference the discussion in relationship to myself and <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESCEhardt_7145.html" title="User:SCEhardt"><font color="blue">SCEhard</font></a><a href="../../../s/c/e/User_talk%7ESCEhardt_f6c3.html" title="User talk:SCEhardt"><font color="#3D9140"><b>T</b></font></a> The dispute relates to my uploading an image, a mistake I admit but as I explained to the administrator a light-hearted yet admittedly misguided attempt to add some levity to a topic others were becoming too serious and combative about. In response I received an aggressive message on my talk page threatening me with blocking and the direction not to remove said message. I went ahead and did so as I believed a more civil response was approriate and made this clear to said admin. But again I received an even more aggressive uncivil message. It is unacceptable for Administrators to act in this way. Their intentions may be good but their arrogant attitude is ridiculous. I do not want to be blocked merely on the whim of an administrator who decided to take an overly aggressive response to my actions. Thank-you for your time.</p>

<dd>It is my understanding you were blocked specifically for removing a warning from your talk page from an administrator. I personally take a very dim view of that and I see no reason to lift the block at this time (you asked, indirectly, on the unblock mailing list) as I see no change in behaviour to warrant it. The repeated incivility was not addressed by this block, perhaps it should have been as well. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 11:22, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>False. There <i>was</i> discussion (or at least I attempted discussion, your refusal to take part or even acknowledge the validity of the underlying premise notwithstanding). The "sourced information", the sources of which are not uniformly reliable, was presented in a heavily slanted way, a point you have yet to accept despite it having been made by every single person who has so far looked at the case, including those Arbitrators who have commented. Even the people who think I acted wrongly in some respects appear to be unanimous in agreeing that there was a problem with what you were trying to add to the article. When people do not accept your arguments the solution is to <i>find better arguments</i>, not to repeat the same arguments only louder. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 18:23, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As with your edits to the Armstrong article and most of your descriptions of this dispute so far, I find your characterisation of Phil's comments unrecognisable. I was not "warned for misconduct", Phil <i>agreed</i> that your edits were problematic but pointed out, as one experienced admin to another less experienced, that I had made a mistake. As the discussions show without any ambiguity at all, I accepted his judgment and fully endorsed his subsequent actions; had any such comments been made here (where I posted each action at the time for peer-review; Phil's comment here was some hours after my own inviting review) I would have accepted them in similar vein. I also asked where I went wrong, and have discussed with him whether there is a more effective forum for peer-review of admin decisions. If you want to paint that as vindicating your actions then you are, I'm afraid, deluding yourself. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:22, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Considering that the user Leyasu is in England and the NightmareChase account is in America, it seems somewhat ridiculous. Circues has also banned people from Brazil, Argentina and France claiming they are Leyasu as well. This is getting beyond a joke with this admin. As unless Leyasu is mystically hoping all around the globe, then Circues is abusing his admin powers. After checking his contributions as well, it isnt just articles relating to Leyasu that he is banning people from editing when they make an edit that doesnt agree with his own POV on a subject.

<li>I'm gonna have to agree with Stormie on this. You appear to be linking to a single website on multiple articles. Reviews don't make good external links. Especially when they don't come from reliable newspapers or known film/music critics. This is just a site where random people can write reviews (be it collaboratively). - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:09, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Okay, but there were a few, such as a biography on Hulk Hogan, that would have made good external links.

<p>As far as I can tell, there is <i>no question</i> about whether this user is disruptive or deservant of a block.

<dd>They should be held to a higher standard of civility, but they also get slightly more credibility, as they have been vetted rather publically, and humiliatingly in some cases. The key was "long time," in the above: i.e. over a prolonged period of time, this editor has not been a source of trouble nor administrative controversy.

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>Firstly I'll introduce myself as Tony Sargeant, Network Manager of St Bernard's Convent School, Slough (see article).</p>
<p>I see that the school IP (82.110.149.183) has been blocked from editing until 12th September 2006. Good, please leave blocked. I agree with your policies being applied to protect the articles.</p>
<p>Is there a way I can stop the St Bernard's School article from being changed? Or be under my control? There are some minor errors in it.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<dd>I really haven't seen any evidence that what Guy was doing was in fact votestacking at all. I personally voted in that article because it was on my watchlist, I think everybody kinda voted at once because they might have been waiting to see what other people's opinions were. I think that it is ridiculous that Guy is being banned for something that almost everybody does when there is a vote going on, after all I wonder how so many people that voted "support" found out that there was a survey going on at that particular moment especially when so many people had never edited the article in question before?

<dd>I was also concerned to see that Kim van der Linde, who is involved in this dispute, got Guy banned from the page, started a poll about the title, ignored the results of it, then misused her admin tools to move the page against the poll results, then felt obliged to post a tag declaring that Guy is banned from the page. It's up to the admin to do that; maybe he forgot, or maybe he intended not to. I'm worried about the extent to which Kim van der Linde seems to be taking every opportunity to cause a problem for pro-Israel editors, and is consistently confusing her admin/editor roles. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 13:38, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>Firstly I'll introduce myself as Tony Sargeant, Network Manager of St Bernard's Convent School, Slough (see article).</p>
<p>I see that the school IP (82.110.149.183) has been blocked from editing until 12th September 2006. Good, please leave blocked. I agree with your policies being applied to protect the articles.</p>
<p>Is there a way I can stop the St Bernard's School article from being changed? Or be under my control? There are some minor errors in it.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

We miss some vandals, and we miss some mistakes, but <i>generally</i> we spot it when a school article gets "booger" edits and the like. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:34, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You later come in and restore an edited version of the comments that I had altered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMONGO&amp;diff=64303259&amp;oldid=64297349" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMONGO&amp;diff=64303259&amp;oldid=64297349" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>. In this, you reminded me of the obvious and added the editor summary of "rv deliberate mischaracterization of talk page comment by MONGO by changing the heading".

Basically, I removed the links or mention to that website since at this time, they are enaging in personal attacks against me on their mainpage. Your attempts to point out this fact, even after I had removed them constitutes a personal attack. I have never met you before and this isn't some kind of playground.

<dd>Once YOU got rid of it, I didn't revert. how was I supposed to know what you wanted? All you had done before was to turn the heading into a personal attack.. The discussion itself was left untouched by you when I reverted the personal attack. Your complaints are baseless and unrelated to my problem with Hipocrite's general superiority attitude.

<li>Yes, you're in the wrong. Also quite wrong when you claim, on my talkpage, that I've "alleged" you committed policy violations. No, I haven't. If you post on MONGO's page again it won't be for violating paragraph 10 B of policy 6 R, Amendment 173 that I'll block you, it'll be for inconsiderate obnoxiousness and not using common sense.

<p>There is an edit war at <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> regarding whether mention of Chinese censorship belongs in the introductory paragraph. While an attempt to arrive at consensus is being made at <a href="../../../g/o/o/Talk%7EGoogle_bf7b.html" title="Talk:Google">Talk:Google</a>, certain editors continue to insert the text despite continued warning that it should remain out until consensus is reached. Countless edits/reverts have ensued (with likely 3RR violations). I'm especially concerned with User:Spet1363 admitting that s/he also edits under User:129.67.89.102 (perhaps to avoid 3RR?) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGoogle&amp;diff=64372060&amp;oldid=64369665" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGoogle&amp;diff=64372060&amp;oldid=64369665" rel="nofollow">[89]</a>.

Could we have page protection on the page in question so that the edit wars calm down?

<li>OK. I have protected the article.

If editors can provide valid citations from reliable sources for the removed content then I am sure it can be reinserted. I have left a comment on the article's Talk page to this effect.

<p>64.1.198.83, 70.89.181.10, Fiber-optics and Timbercon appear to be accounts owned by the same user to spam links for a small fiber-optics business, Timbercon. They also have a vanity article, Timbercon, which I have <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Timbercon_cf9c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Timbercon">nominated for deletion</a>. On June 2, they got one spam warning, then they used another account to add the same links again a few days later. Then June 12, another account was warned and links reverted. Then more spam-links were added by still another account.</p>
<p>There's an ongoing back and forth between me and these users at Talk:Timbercon. Repeatedly cleaning up link-spam, warning (politely at first), dealing with the vanity article, then with the sock-puppets objections spread across multiple talk pages, my talk page and the article talk page -- all of this is consuming hours of my time. The objections are disingenuously masked in a friendly, "how can I improve" manner that is belied by a review of all 4 accounts' talk pages and edit histories.</p>
<p>Any advice or help from admins before I just walk away; I've got my day job to consider and can waste no more time on this (in other words, the sockpuppet is about to win). --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 17:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Due to the effort involved, difficulty of interpretation of results and privacy issues raised, checkuser is a last resort for difficult cases. Use other methods first.</i></li>
<li><i>Obvious sock puppets may be treated as such without using checkuser.</i></li>
<li><i>Please do not list cases involving "throwaway" accounts that are only used for a few edits.</i></li>
<li><i>Data is kept for a limited time so we cannot compare against accounts that have not edited recently.</i></li>

MONGO's behavior especially has been wildly boorish and insulting--I don't even have anything to do with this, and just came into to try to push a NPOV/non biased POV as a middle ground. In response I've been accused of trolling, and the edit war persists. I want to ask that MONGO be at least temporarily stripped of sysop permissions based on his:

<dd>Thanks.Note your last edit there is you actually deleting a request that you be investigated. Isn't that a conflict of interest? 21:02, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You unilaterally protected the article and began to edit it, and then protected the talk page so no one couold have any input, also refusing to hear about it on your own talk page. YOu cut much of the article's talk page out and archived it, even when it was still active headings. You threatened and intimidated users who mentioned the matter. You deleting huge chunks of the article, without even a note in the talk page, and continued to delete rather than insert "fact" tags or other notices of disputes. You reverted several attempts to include sources. YOu have been intentionally deletionist and uncooperative. That's how you've been "boorish".

<dd><b>Comment</b> I know little about this debate and have only had positive experiences with MONGO in the few times I've had anything to do with him here. I can see that ED hosts an extremely derogatory page which I'm sure he finds very insulting (having read it, I can definitely say that I'd be <i>infuriated</i> if it was written about me). It would strain the best of editors' patience and temper to deal with such inflammatory and personal attacks. Therefore, and I don't mean any disrespect, it seems a tad inappropriate for him to be personally involved in dealing with the issue. I suggest that MONGO ought to recuse himself from dealing with the article on ED to avoid the appearance of partiality. There are plenty of other administrators who can defend that particular article from vandalism, trolls, etc. Cheers, <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 21:58, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you see no bias or conflict of interest for either yourself or MONGO to directly participate in this article given the recent problems? I request again that both yourself and MONGO do not participate in this. There are literally HUNDREDS of other editors more suited at the time being. I don't mind others making valid edits, but given the hostile tone from MONGO and the sheer determination of yourself to work at removing the article from wikipedia outright, I believe this is a conflict of interest in your role and position. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 23:38, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The notability of the site is still being debated after the issue was first raised a day or two ago, and this deletion was immediately forced through after editors complained about perceived bias (almost immediately after). Admins do a good job, but this does feel like a retaliatory nomination, especially given the ferocity of people to "get rid of it". This nomination so far is heading based on votes to either a weak to solid keep, or a no concensus. If that happens, the article should remain while it gets worked out further on the page itself.</p>
<p>If the vote and discussion from the article is a "keep" or no concensus, I am concerned that some action may be unilaterally taken vs. this article after the vote possibly, going against concensus. Questions in regards to this have been ignored on the vote page, while every other question/comment from parties opposed to the article's existence have been met with swiftness. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 00:37, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually no, almost any AFD nom is a "premediated attempt to destroy an article". That is, after all, the point of nominating something for AFD - to remove something that the nominator believes is unsuitable for Wikipedia. I would <i>hope</i> that AFD noms are premeditated - I would <i>hate</i> to think that people would nominate articles for deletion on the spur of the moment. Calling an AFD nom "a premeditated attempt to destroy an article" is like calling article creation a "premeditated attempt to create an article". It <i>is</i> rather impolite to <i>phrase</i> it that way, trying to spin a perfectly normal action into something sinister. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 06:59, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The actions and comments from certain members of the <i>keep</i> side of the debate are really quite shameful. If anyone wonders why admins burn out or get upset occasionally, one need only look at the onslaught of willful ignorance and the completely undeserved sense of entitlement being utilized by certain members of that debate, threatening current editors who have had the courage to speak their mind, and even against anyone who would potentially enforce policy in regards to this debate. --Jeffrey O.

<dd>I'd consider this a priority. He commented on my talk page in regards to my reverting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mike_Rosoft&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64569314" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mike_Rosoft&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64569314" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> and we've had some discussion. However, while we were conversing, he created an anti-administrator template and began posting it on administrator's userpages. One can see that he's decidely determined to be antagonistic from the comments left on my talk page. <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 01:42, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In fact, the information he stated is listed in the trivia section prior to his edits, as well as on other pages related to the series. It's just that the diction of his edits are a little condescending: "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Power_Rangers:_Mystic_Force&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64580124" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Power_Rangers:_Mystic_Force&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64580124" rel="nofollow">Five bucks says Nick is Bowen</a>" and "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Power_Rangers:_Mystic_Force&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64580437" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Power_Rangers:_Mystic_Force&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64580437" rel="nofollow">Anyone who has done any research...</a>". While the gist of these statements are regarded as true, I don't think they are necessary for inclusion in the article. I had left messages on the user's talk page, a test3 with some personalization and then he had done the second contribution while I was leaving him the message. I then gave him a test4 with other personalization and then listed him on <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, and then I was directed to list him here through a message left on my talk page.

<dd>I think that's a bad idea. We don't ban people from articles for having editing disputes: and in this case, I think, it would be a double standard to do so: <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> doesn't mean that the subjects of <i>articles</i> should be immune from reasoned criticism.. and the fact that the subject is actually editing the article, frankly, swings the balance the OTHER way. If Lerner is going to edit the article on himself (which I really don't think he should), he's going to have to accept that editors critical of him are going to edit the article, too. I'm going to get involved in the dispute and see what I can accomplish. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:32, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Now Haham hanuka closed the 2nd nomination as keep despite no decision in that way (I know we don't vote, but nose count says 8-5 for delete, 2 of the keeps being weak keeps), at best this is no consensus. In addition, he voted in the AfD. I reverted his closing of it as he is too involved to be closing it. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? This is the second time he's impeded on AfDs for this article (an article that had been deleted four previous times as speedys <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Dora+Venter" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Dora+Venter" rel="nofollow">[121]</a>). <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 16:00, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

The wording on the AfD itself was also edited repeatedly *after* it was posted, making it sound, if I may, more severe and/or 'worse' than the original as posted. Is this an issue?

<p>As I mentioned in the very first sentence, I was unsure whether SPUI still had a current probation. Some <b>clerk</b> fell down on the job, as SPUI is not listed as a participant on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Completed_requests_Involved_parties_2f99.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Completed requests/Involved parties">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Completed requests/Involved parties</a> since February 2006.</p>
<p>As to your other comment, you expect unilateral capitulation? Or that every page edit by SPUI should result in an individual Arbitration, rather than just reverting it?</p>

<dd>The fact SPUI hasn't been blocked for violation both the civility and disruption conditions set by the most recent Arbcom is disturbing. If other editors involved in that Arbcom have to be civil and refrain from disruptive edit warring on highway articles, why is SPUI being held to a different standard? He is being disruptive, no one questions this above as it is without question. My question then is why isn't one of the Admins here doing their job. A block is proscribed and anything less then institution of said block does nothing but negate the entire validity of the Arbcom. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyBGood_3156.html" title="User:JohnnyBGood"><font color="green"><b>JohnnyBGood</b></font></a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnnyBGood_d6fd.html" title="User talk:JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>t</b></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JohnnyBGood_a89f.html" title="Special:Contributions/JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>c</b></font></a> <b>VIVA!</b> 18:06, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This giving him chances stuff is b.s. If it were anyone but him they would have been blocked, rightly so, under the terms of the probation (which explicitly forbids highway article disruption which warring is universally recognized as. If he's not then the Arbcom and it's rulings are a farse and should be treated as such.

<p>Yesterday, User 71.143.19.196 was temporarily banned from Wikipedia. They have been engaged, along with myself and several others, in a dispute over the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Hendrickson_e683.html" title="Benjamin Hendrickson">Benjamin Hendrickson</a> page. The article is regarding an actor who recently committed suicide, and the dispute is over a line that states how (gunshot wound to the head).</p>
<p>User 71.143.19.196 had reverted to their version at least 13 times (since July 8) before being blocked yesterday. Along with some "minor sins" (ie, not signing comments with four tildes) they committed larger infractions, including foul language in other user's pages, and repeatedly removing text, including warnings, from their own text page.</p>
<p>It appears we now need to add sockpuppetry to their list of sins, as User 71.142.208.166 has made the same edit today (and has also made comments under edit summary that suggests they are the same user). This user is simply going to dispute anyone (myself or others) who edit this page, and agressively challenge them by comments on their page. They seem to have little to no awareness of proper protocol. I will admit myself that I don't understand all the intricacies of how to mediate a dispute, so I really, really need some help here.

<dd>This appears to be a consensus growing that the information about the gunshot wound should remain and one user is repeatedly removing the notes of that.

<li>A range block on 71.142.0.0/15 would get both and maybe prevent more, although that's 131,000 addresses. Maybe blocking anon only wouldn't be so bad, for a short time. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:10, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>You can't do range blocks lower than /16 on wikipedia and you really shouldn't do range blocks for any length of time at all. We are too big now, collateral damage from range blocks in now an almost certainty. Are they edit warring over just one article?

<li>The edit warring in question appears to be with this article in question, though the user has been blocked in the past for general "abuse" and "disruption". Semi-protection should be best, though, as it will at least encourage the user to get an account so we can discuss the matter (though it seems he is just persisting in an edit war and has been reverted by numerous other editors).

<dd>Since you have also said several times that you are leaving Wikipedia, you obviously don't need two accounts.

<p>I reported the matter to the Arbitration Committee via thier private mailing list, in order to get a sanity check (though it's very obvious as checkuser results go) and for advice on how to proceed. I also requested that Conrad email me urgently; instead of doing so, he responded with a curt response that he did not pass out his email. Theresa made a similar request (as an Arbitrator) and was met repeatedly with a similar result, before being reluctantly provided with an address. His response, on her talk page, was less than satisfactory.</p>
<p>At this point, he's made it public, and the appropriate avenue to decide what to do is here. I count 18 usernames on three IPs (there are dozens more, those 18 were just handy); they are not, as he suggests, dopplegangers. Indeed, he warned one of them shortly after using it to vandalize: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hemit_Alin&amp;diff=64023918&amp;oldid=63924902" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hemit_Alin&amp;diff=64023918&amp;oldid=63924902" rel="nofollow">[124]</a>. Sadly, this sort of thing is all to common; this is at least twice in the last week that I've come across otherwise legitimate contriubutors engaging in vandalism via sockpuppets.</p>

<dd>My thought was along the same lines. While posting to ANI might be punishment enough (depending on how badly he wants to be seen as a good wikipedian) I would rather see probation at the very least.

<dd>Responding to a few things (I went to dinner and the thread exploded!):</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As much as you'd think it wouldn't happen, it's not uncommon to see someone vandalizing and then cleaning up thier own mess. I don't know if it's some kind of guilt, or if it is because they want to elevate thier public image, but it happens too frequently.</li>
<li>He may or may not do it again; I guarantee if he does it again he'll do it in a way that is much harder to detect. Rarely does ignoring the problem cause it to go away; it just cases it to hide deeper beneath the surface.</li>
<li>You can create accounts while logged in, but it causes them to be logged under your name, as in "User:A created User:B" rather than just "created User:B". If you log out before doing it, or do it in a separate browser, then it doesn't do that. This is not a case of "someone else was on the IP at the time"; dynamic IPs do sometimes change, but they don't switch to a vandal for twenty minutes and then back to you, as shown above.</li>
<li>There is a reasonable amount of work that goes into this, but it's what I'm here to do. My concern is that further problems be prevented, as each one of these accounts takes admin time to block, often multiple admin's time as they all simultaneously block, and the time of others to tag the accounts. Additionally, it takes checkuser time, as at least one checkuser (me) is actively checking accounts from these types of sprees in order to block the IPs and prevent further damage.</li>
<li>I've yet to see any response from him on the subject, and certainly no remorse. Indeed, he has been very uncooperative so far, and I don't forsee a change in that. As I indicated above, I think if he's learned anything, it's to be smarter about his sockpuppetry. I'm not willing to spend the next year checking up on him constantly, and I doubt any of the other checkers have the time.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Beyond seeing that no further damage is done to Wikipedia, I'd like to know the community's take on this, and what they feel should be done; as I've said, I find it all too often, and if the community is unconcerned, then I will just keep it to myself from now on and not waste my or other's time with public reports. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 01:54, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>COMMENT</b> - I admit that it is true that I have been creating accounts. I am not going to play dumb or lie to you about it. I will explain, but not rationalise my reasons for doing so. One of my reasons is that which was mentioned, that it would give me an oppourtunity to show my willingness to fight vandalism by reporting them myself. Another is that I suffer from certain mental problems including schizophrenia. One symtom of my mental problems is that at times, certain thoughts which I find particularily inappropriate or unpleasant inter my mind and my mind cannot let go of them. By creating accounts with names that reflect these thoughts, it in a way has helped to isolate them from my mind. It is difficult for me to explain how this works, but doing so helped to relieve my mind of unpleasant thoughts. I also created accounts and/or made vandal edits in a few cases simply to see how efficiently Wikipedia would respond. But, as I said, I am not trying to rationalise what I have done. Though I mentioned having mental problems, I do have control over my own actions and could have found other ways to deal with my problems. And as for wanting to show my willingness to fight vandals, I should have done so by actually fighting vandals rather than inventing vandals to fight. I apologise for what I have done and promise to discontinue it immediately. Please note however that my contributions testify to my desire to be a respectable editor. I regret that I have perhaps permenantly damaged my reputation as a Wikipedia editor, but accept that I am to blame for it. I believe that I do deserve a block for this and shall take a break from editing whether I receive one or not.--<font color="green"><b>Conrad Devonshire</b></font> <sup><b><font color="purple">Talk</font></b></sup> 04:00, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was very big of Conrad to come clean with the above, and I commend him for that. It must be quite difficult to have all of this aired under the public eye of ANI.

<dd>It's amazing how our wikisociety functions. Would a block be <i>preventative</i> if in enforcing one other users will not engage in such behavior (or alternatively if they are currently engaged in similar behavior now, stop)?

<dd>Yes, perhaps you and Brenneman are correct. To a certain extent at this point whether this user is blocked or not may be immaterial as he's decided to not edit on his own for some time... and if he indeed abides by that then a block'd be redundant (if we're talking strictly about <i>preventative</i> in the sense of this one user). I think in a similar situation in the future Essjay or an ArbCom member should be <i>inclined</i> to just <b>immediately block</b> and note the reasoning in the block log and then proceed to inform the community of the back story and if given an explanation and promise not to continue that is on an equivalent level as Conrad Devonshire's, then subsequently lift the block. Essentially in my view some sort of an easily verifiable <i>history</i> (ie: block log note) should accompany such behavior, no? <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 13:19, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I find creating multiple inappropriate usernames a blockable offense whether it's preventive or not. It's something explicitly forbidden policy and caused multiple people a lot of work. Oh yeah, don't forget to block the all the accounts except for the main one.

<dd>My approach to this is that I'd support a block if he presented an ongoing risk to the encyclopedia. While there might be an argument for blocking as a deterrent, this isn't compatible with our blocking policy. Moreover if we were seen to block someone who came clean and promised to stop, it would almost certainly deter other editors from coming clean about antisocial activities. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 13:18, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

Still, he'll pose just as much threat a week from now as now, so I don't believe the community agreeing to lift this one-week block is harmful. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 14:35, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I get the impression that I've wasted my time a) checking up on the problem, b) sorting it out, c) notifying the Arbitration Committee, d) trying to resolve it with the user, e) reporting it here, and f) thinking anybody would care. There *is* a side to this besides "Oh poor Conrad, he's been naughty but we shouldn't hold it against him": There's the dozens of administrators and other RC patrolers that have been affected, there are the users who have been impersonated and/or attacked in these usernames, and there is the time of the Arbitration Committee any myself that has been wasted dealing with this. I think NoSeptember hit it on the head: He *didn't* come clean until he was *forced* to, and displayed defiance right up until he posted here with a miraculous change of heart, deep understanding of his conduct, and profound sorrow for the trouble he's caused. Quite frankly, I'm not convinced in the least; I think I understand now why so many of the longer-term checkusers have stopped doing this sort of thing: The end result is that nobody wants to do anything about it, and you've wasted several hours (about six, in this case) dealing with it. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 14:59, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suspect for the same reason I generally don't immediately block when I find anomalies doing CheckUser: it's best to have another party verify your suspicions before going public with serious accusations. If I, as a CheckUser, block sua sponte based solely on CheckUser evidence, and someone complains, I am in the situation of having to justify my block with the reason "I have evidence that supports this block, but I cannot show it to you". This doesn't go over well. Having the evidence reviewed by other trustworthy individuals at least results in a united front before a block goes in, with multiple seemingly reasonable people who will stand behind it. If the other people won't stand behind it, then it would have been a bad idea to block in the first place, eh?</dd>

<dd>I view my role, when using CheckUser, as that of a security officer. It's my job to examine the evidence and report on what I find to others to decide what to do as a result of my findings.

<dd>Personally I believe prevention extends beyond the individual user concerned, the message we seem to be sending out here is that provided you apologise when caught then no problem. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 16:40, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that <i>is</i> the message. Wikipedia is extremely generous with second chances. Unfortunately, consideration of the effects on other users is often neglected (as Essjay pointed out, or as in the case of the unblocking of Blu Aardvark and MSK). By unblocking him are we sending the signal that we are more interested in rehabilitating one part-time vandal than in respecting the efforts of dozens of vandal fighters? A long block or outright ban would send the message that his disruptive activities <i>and their negative effects on others</i> so outweigh his positive contributions that we would rather not have him around anymore. (On the other hand such a ban would be largely symbolic as there is no practical way of keeping Conrad from continuing to create more abusive accounts--he just couldn't get "credit" for reverting them anymore.) <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I doubt that is really the message, nor do I think Essjay has wasted his time, although I see where he is coming from. Bear in mind that blocking isn't the only consequence in play in this case; for example, Conrad Devonshire clearly had ambitions to become an admin and realistically that will not happen now. Alerting the community to this kind of fraud is very much a concrete result in of itself. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 17:26, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My view is that if you apologise and <b>stop</b> then all should be forgiven. Call me a cynic but we only have his word that he is taking a wikibreak. For all we know he is happily editing (and trolling for that matter) with yet another sock. I don't think unblocking him was the best thing to do, it gives a rather wishy washy effect. A week was a very short block in the first place IMO and it should have stood unless there was overwhelming support here to undo it - which there wasn't. Having said that, what's done is done. I think he needs to be carefully watched and if he shows any sign of his past bad behaviour he needs to be community banned. If OTOH he stops fucking about he should be completely forgiven. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 19:54, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Can't say I'm pleased with the way this has evolved. We have a user who has made multiple vandal-only accounts, and has attempted to improve his cred by "reporting them". He also did not come clean when first approached about it. Heartfelt apologies or not, there must be something said on a community front that such behaviour is unacceptable. I think that entails a block. Call it punitive if you want. There was no consensus to undo the action -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)">Samir</a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)">धर्म</a></small> 22:12, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I still support the block. Not to discredit the otherwise good work of Conrad, the rules need to be applied evenly to all. Essjay did the right thing.

<p>Just to register my view ... I don't believe it when someone "reveals" that they have various mental illnesses as an excuse for their actions. It's too convenient. If they've been open about it from the get-go, and then later on they do something that might be a result of their illness I understand, but magically becoming schizophrenic when it's revealed you've made over a dozen abusive sockpuppets is too much.

<dd>(Copied from his talk page and modified slightly) Uhh, sorry, looks like I am the only one who feels that Conrad's apology is next to meaningless, and that he deserves a very long term block. Actions speak louder than words. If we are going to endorse his apology which resulted from his vandalism fiasco, then we are basically saying that creating accounts and reporting them was constructive in the first place. In other words: creating damage can be nullified by certain actions. Sorry, I don't think so. And incidentally, on a personal note, the accounts that he kept creating are marginally funny after the "list of shock sites" debacle. I'm sure, however, they aren't funny to the people who had to remove them and delete them etc. If you want forgiveness, see a priest, as a Jew I believe in guilt&#160;:-) - <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbscissa_152a.html" title="User:Abscissa">Abscissa</a> 02:17, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The image is not a copyvio. The story behind the image is embarrasing to Hardvice, who wishes it to remain private. Zscout unearthed the reasoning and posted it to the possible unfree images page. Per Hardvice's request, and with Zscout's consent, I wiped out that edit using oversite. Suffice it to say, the image is most definitely in the public domain.

Per the original post by MONGO, I want to say that I've been doing too much conflict editing and I am going to try to cut back and stuff.

<dd>Marcyu has emailed unblock-en-L asking to be unblocked on the grounds that there was no policy justified reason for the block in the first place.</dd>
<dd>On first impression, this reads like a minor user dispute between Nlu and Marcyu in which Nlu has used admin powers without sufficient justification. Nothing that Marcyu did was significantly disruptive to any page or discussion, nor did it reach the threshold of personal attack, though it was rude and inappropriate.</dd>
<dd>This additionally appears to be a violation of the general rule that admins should not block people they are engaged in disputes with other than for egregious abuse or clear vandalism.</dd>
<dd>I would like to request further review of this block and Nlu's actions. At the very least a more detailed justification for why the block was made is required.</dd>

<p>He's also emailed me, with essentially the same message that went to the mailing list. He's claiming that he was initially blocked by Nlu for six months and that this will show up in the deleted history of his main page. Nlu's only actions on User:Marcyu were to delete it <i>on Marcyu's own request</i> - {{db-owner}} - on the 18th of March. He then deleted it again a couple of hours later as a vandalism/attack page, G3/A6 on <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, because Marcyu's response to Nlu's doing what he asked for was to call him and <a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._Koot_c978.html" title="User:R. Koot">R. Koot</a> "extremely biased, immature, and unprofessional". There is no six month block in the block log, there is nothing in Marcyu's talk page history mentioning six months as far as I can see. He's also claiming that Nlu reverts anything he adds to articles - since March, he has made one edit to an article, to insert an unconfirmed rumour <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kel_Mitchell&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64424224" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kel_Mitchell&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64424224" rel="nofollow">[132]</a> and Nlu did indeed (properly) revert that. I don't see any other evidence of Nlu reverting article edits (Marcyu has made 26 of these in the eight months he's been here - he claims to generally edit anonymously because of this alleged, and apparently nonexistent, constant reverting by Nlu). The only disputes with Nlu I see here are Marcyu's persistent and long-term refusal to sign talk page edits with anything other than an attack on admins (if a "signature" doesn't contain either your username or a link to your user page, <i>it's not a signature</i>), and persistent attempts to remove vandalism and personal attack warnings from his talk page (one placed there by Nlu, most placed there by other people). I'm not a big fan of people slapping warning templates on people's pages without any further comment and then getting aerated when they remove them, and Nlu could have been more communicative, but it's pretty clear that Marcyu just isn't getting the point. He's an adult, he ought to know how to behave in communal situations, and as he also claims to be a journalist he ought to know about the importance of verifiability and reputable sources (which have been the cause of many of his problems with other editors in the past, apparently). <s>I'd be in favour of reducing the block to maybe a week, on condition that he uses a proper signature in future and stops mucking about with his talk page to remove warnings, but</s> I think the block is justifiable. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 09:08, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I endorse the block. In the interests of disclosure, I'm somewhat involved in this, but this guy's clearly abrasive and <i>not getting the message</i>. He also seems to enjoy playing the innocent, and making up ridiculous accusations (see <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Hasty_Blocking_by_Some_Administrators" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#Hasty Blocking by Some Administrators</a>. When I confronted him with overwhelming evidence completely quashing his accusations against Nlu, he went off onto another tangent.

<p>I see and have a big problem with this editor and I don't quite know how to deal with it.</p>
<p>This editor is very domineering and controlling and not entirely scrupulous about it, frequently needling and baiting other editors. I'd rather you form your own opinions by visiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Asperger_syndrome" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Asperger_syndrome" rel="nofollow">Talk:Asperger syndrome‎</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Asperger_syndrome/Archive06" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Asperger_syndrome/Archive06" rel="nofollow">archives</a>.</p>
<p>With this editor the deal seems to be that unless you submit to his/her control he/she will find ways to make trouble for you.</p>
<p>Today I REALLY believed that we had finally got a concensus going in spite of <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">User:SandyGeorgia</a> that still included <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">User:SandyGeorgia</a>, but I was wrong, the minute I expressed this here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_review/Asperger_syndrome&amp;diff=64565831&amp;oldid=64562892" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_review/Asperger_syndrome&amp;diff=64565831&amp;oldid=64562892" rel="nofollow">[133]</a> , she/he had a knife in my back here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nandesuka&amp;curid=3199574&amp;diff=64570655&amp;oldid=64351761" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nandesuka&amp;curid=3199574&amp;diff=64570655&amp;oldid=64351761" rel="nofollow">[134]</a> about an incident she/he had resolved to suit him/herself many hours earlier (which aspect, you will notice, is not mentioned).</p>

<dd>Francis, I have read that mediation and I honestly do not see any evidence of "kindness" (for example: "<i>Sandy is hypocritical when she gets on her soapbox about how I'm violating wiki rules! She edited some things I wrote on the talk page and moved it out of context. She also tried to simply erase the entire section on Marinol, until a sysop reverted the page back!</i>", not quite my idea of "kindness"). I just see yet another editor who has been subjected to the kind of abuse I see on <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger_Syndrome_92e0.html" title="Asperger Syndrome">Asperger Syndrome</a>, not being believed, which is a common feature of this kind of situation. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 01:57, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have an appointment right now, but will be glad to respond in more detail later this evening, as needed. But, just to briefly address the question above about sock puppetry:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am not aware of any suspicious or suspected sock puppetry on the article, nor have there been any problems with edit warring or anything of that nature, either right before, during or after Zeraeph raised the question of a sock puppet. I have no reason to suspect there is any sock puppetry going on, and believe the comments Zeraeph referred to were probably from a legitimate, anon editor. Since Zeraeph mentioned a sock puppet in a passage referring to <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">User:RN</a> and myself, I simply asked him to please not refer to sock puppets in proximity to my name.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Asperger_syndrome#What_the_autistic_community_feels_about_the_medicalized_article" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Asperger_syndrome#What_the_autistic_community_feels_about_the_medicalized_article" rel="nofollow">[138]</a> I also reminded him of civility, because of his response to the anon editor, to myself, and to Rdos. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 19:42, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I should like a few impartial parties to look at the relevant talk pages for themselves. However, I do not think it is for <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">User:SandyGeorgia</a> to presume or inform me (or anyone) of what they mean by anything they say, nor to order people not to mention anything in connection with her name. To whit, if now, or at any time in the future, a person sees cause to suspect her of sockpuppetry <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">User:SandyGeorgia</a> has no right to order them to refrain from remarking it. Nor to dictate in any way what other editors should, or should not, say, yet she frequently does. Frankly she often addresses other editors as though she were a schoolmarm and they children who must defer to her. She also treats articles as though they were her personal property. To the extent of informing other editors what they may or may not do on both talk pages and in-line comments. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 01:31, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the sock puppetry issue, I jumped to no conclusion, Zeraeph, but I did point out that you were using the term sockpuppetry in the next sentence after you mentioned me, and I asked that you please take care with doing that. This is in accordance with Wiki policy (AGF), not a "domineering" directive of mine. We had another problem when you archived the talk page, with no warning, in the midst of multiple ongoing discussions and a FARC. Because you archived *current* (within the hour) discussions, I asked that you not do that, and I restored the talk page, with consensus, while other editors waited. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Asperger_syndrome#Revert_archive" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Asperger_syndrome#Revert_archive" rel="nofollow">[142]</a> Again, this is in accordance with Wiki policies, not my directives. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 04:44, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the TS mediation, those were statements made by my co-editor on the TS page, and since Francis was the mediator, he was in a good position to know whether or not I was kind. The co-editor was emotional, and was mistaken in his statements about the talk page or the edits. In fact, I have been very kind to him, and with respect to him, then and today. A thorough review of the talk pages in question will reveal the facts. Francis, who was the mediator, can respond to your charges about my behavior on that. I would be interested in seeing an example of what you refer to as my abuse on AS, so I can understand what is troubling you. We have gotten a lot of collaborative work done in the last week, and I've not seen any evidence of discord. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 04:44, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is very hard to communicate discord when the person you are trying to communicate it to dismisses your every attempt to communicate it as a "personal attack", and tries to get you censured for it instead of considering or discussing what you are saying. As a result, you are prevented from trying to communicate by the risk of censure. Unfortunately, the more severe the problem, the harder it is to communicate in a way that cannot possibly be manipulated and presented as a "personal attack", which was my cue to bring this here.</dd>

My e-mail is activated, I will read and respond, and I guard confidentiality of e-mail scrupulously. You are welcome to resolve this directly with me.

<dd>My conclusion is that this entry is a personal attack, from an editor who has made no attempt to present or resolve his apparent dispute directly with me. Examination of the talk page reveals cordial and consensual editing, and steady ongoing progress towards improving the article in order to retain its featured status, with two editors now changing their votes on FARC to "Keep" as a result of the progress made. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_review#FARC_commentary_4" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_review#FARC_commentary_4" rel="nofollow">[154]</a> I hope admins will explore the talk page and evaluate the extent of personal attack. I understand it is stressful to see one's past work under fire during FARC, and that tensions will naturally arise, but other editors seem to be coping fine. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 12:13, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zeraeph, it is rather disingenuous to simply refer to this a single domineering editor - as I have supported what Sandy has done (YES we are seperate editors thankyouverymuch). Sandy has not been uncivil at all (in fact, I wish I could handle it as well as she does...), but you on the other hand have at times been slightly uncivil - but either way I'm a bit puzzled it is on ANI. In fact, you should really thank Sandy for putting in so much work into saving that article from FARC - her or myself wanting sources for information in a featured article is hardly domineering. Anyway, this particular issue is dispute resolution stuff. <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a> 17:07, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To clarify, I have not blocked Blu Aardvark, who is already blocked indefinitely. I have simply recorded his ban evasion and reset the clock on his one year arbcom ban to run from today, as is customary in such cases. He remains indefinitely blocked, but if someone lifts this indefinite block for any reason they should then impose a block to cover the remainder of the arbcom ban from that date until July 19, 2007. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 20:17, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thanks to all for the information provided about Amorrow. As for CanadianCaesar, I am willing to be supportive of any Wikipedian who is devoting time to trying to control vandals and disruptive users. Also, for everyone who helps on this page, thanks for being here when people like me need you. I'm one of those folks who cannot deal well with the dark side of Wikipedia, and I really appreciate those of you who can and do. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 01:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have now had a chance to look at many edits that are apparently by Amorrow puppet accounts. Above, Tony Sidaway indicated that Amorrow's editing often "stinks like a skunk". I have noticed this "stink" in a confrontational attitude and willingness to engage in multiple reverts when edits by these puppets are challenged or reverted. FloNight (see above) indicated that, "All edits by banned user Amorrow must be removed. All articles started deleted." However, some of the edits by these puppet accounts seem like valid contributions to the encyclopedia. The article that was apparently created by Amorrow and was deleted by CanadianCaesar was mostly text cut from other Wikipedia articles and written by other editors such as myself. There has previously been discussion about creating an article such as <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_College_DNA_controversy_c3fe.html" title="King's College DNA controversy">King's College DNA controversy</a> and I am tempted to un-delete it (even if it was created by Amorrow) because it would be a useful article for Wikipedia to have. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 04:46, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please don't! Andrew Morrow is a banned user like no other banned user. I don't care if he sometimes makes good edits.All his edits will be reverted. If you think the article would be useful for Wikipedia to have then write it yourself, do not undelete his work. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 06:22, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Theresa is correct.

<p>When I followed the Amorrow puppets through Wikipedia, I experienced even greater "stink", particularly at <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a>, so I think I am starting to understand the seriousness of this situation. However, I also found MANY Wikipedia articles where Amorrow has apparently made many edits during the past month. Often these edits seem like serious contributions to the encyclopedia and the edits have never been removed. Many of these past edits are now all mixed in with edits by other users. It would be a lot of work to remove all of these edits. I started leaving notes such as <a href="../../../a/n/g/Talk%7EAngela_Beesley_4d1d.html#Wikia.2C_Inc." title="Talk:Angela Beesley">this</a> note about <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia%2C_Inc._b870.html" title="Wikia, Inc.">Wikia, Inc.</a>. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 12:52, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some of his edits may look good but they still need to be reverted. Of course some may be missed. That can not helped.

<p>Wikipedia has a problem with losing new editors. I have seen many comments by editors who have decided to leave because they have felt unwelcome or have been treated roughly. As a newish editor myself the following experience might serve as as a case study. I put the <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gill_Langley_0fa6.html" title="Gill Langley">Gill Langley</a> article up for AfD (it has just been closed <i>no concensus</i>). The pros and cons of that are not the issue here, however. During the AfD <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> thought it appropriate to make a smutty joke <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FGill_Langley&amp;diff=64013032&amp;oldid=64012235" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FGill_Langley&amp;diff=64013032&amp;oldid=64012235" rel="nofollow">[163]</a> which though subsequently blanked remained up for nearly a day.</p>
<p>I considered that the report cited in the article was controversial - whether right or wrong that was my view. I inserted into the article 'The <i>Next of Kin</i> report into what is a contentious subject has, however, not yet been <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer reviewed</a> nor subject to critical analysis.' Again, whatever the merits I regarded that as factual point and my right as an editor to make it. However, SlimVirgin the creator, reverted my edit as (delete nonsense about peer review; who cares about that?)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gill_Langley&amp;diff=64141571&amp;oldid=64139981" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gill_Langley&amp;diff=64141571&amp;oldid=64139981" rel="nofollow">[164]</a> and (rv stop this nonsense)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gill_Langley&amp;diff=64180028&amp;oldid=64175757" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gill_Langley&amp;diff=64180028&amp;oldid=64175757" rel="nofollow">[165]</a>. SlimVirgin than put on the talk page 'BlueValour, you're well out of order. I'm assuming you have something against animal rights.'<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Gill_Langley&amp;oldid=64141879" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Gill_Langley&amp;oldid=64141879" rel="nofollow">[166]</a>. When I explained my position SlimVirgin then wrote 'You're talking utter nonsense....As for your attempt to poison the well in the introduction....'<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGill_Langley&amp;diff=64182587&amp;oldid=64181941" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGill_Langley&amp;diff=64182587&amp;oldid=64181941" rel="nofollow">[167]</a></p>
<p>I gather SlimVirgin is an admin, charged amongst other things, presumably, with dealing with aggressive editors. Her comments do not seem compatible with either <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. How can I and other new editors have confidence that she will look after our interests when she is prepared to make these sort of comments to someone who she acknowleges is a new editor?<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FGill_Langley&amp;diff=64012235&amp;oldid=64009916" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FGill_Langley&amp;diff=64012235&amp;oldid=64009916" rel="nofollow">[168]</a></p>
<p>I have spoken to several people who have expertise that they could bring to WP. However, they are reluctant to get involved because they have heard that if you tread on the wrong toes you can get flamed. From my experience I can only confirm that they are right. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 03:15, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Slimvirgin is typically a fairly ok person. She has to deal with a lot of rude people though, and I guess like everyone she can have a bad day once in a while, when the rudeness gets to her, eh?</p>
<p>Wikipedians are normal human beings who sometimes forget their manners, but in general they *do* know how to behave. To get wikipedians to be polite to you, even if they're rude to you at first, just be nice, be patient, explain things using clear logic, stay calm, and stick to your point. People will typically start to listen and start to behave like proper wikipedians again.&#160;:-) Remember that you're constantly negotiating where the consensus will be, and that everything you say will be archived for eternity, so stay professional. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 09:58, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is anybody here willing to help me fill a RfC agains JzG here? There are no pro-forma warnings on Wikipedia. There are warnings or no warnings. Pro-forma warnings are just a form of bullying. After I have proven, that the original reason for warning was removed even before the warning was placed, JzG is searching for new reasons (see his "it is still unacceptable.." comments) or calling the warning pro-forma. Now he is joking about the "cabal", disparaging my comments and complaints and clearly trying to irritate me with those comments. Azmoc 13:22, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not know anything about this particular case, but the attitude to shrug off complaints about abuse of adminship with derogatory comments and mock about "the cabal" is something I know from JzG, too, and I think it is in no way helpful to resolve disputes.

<p>Perhaps it's because London has been basking in 30 degree temperatures, but there's now an edit war over The weather in London. For a long time this was an intentional red link as an example of an article which should not be created. Now, <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonMerlin_5f2b.html" title="User:NeonMerlin">NeonMerlin</a> has decided to create it as a redirect to <a href="../../../c/l/i/Climate_of_London_6a74.html" title="Climate of London">Climate of London</a> and is trying to eliminate it as an intentional redlink. (Now I'm no climatologist but I always understood there to be a fundamental difference between climate and weather)</p>
<p>It does seem to me that <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonMerlin_5f2b.html" title="User:NeonMerlin">NeonMerlin</a> by recreating the article after several admins have deleted it is beginning to flout the spirit of the 3RR. I'm not sure where consensus is on this but he seems to be the only editor consistently on his side of the argument.

<dd>I am not still "trying" to eliminate it as an intentional redlink: I have finished doing so. Now, the only pages linking to it are those that cite it as an example of an edit war.

<dd>It's not my fault that not enough people can be bothered to speak up yet. However, bear in mind that nobody appears to have raised any objections to, let alone reverted, the edits that brought these red link examples into disuse in the first place. Instead of blaming me for a few admins' rash decision to speedy the weather in London and ask questions later, I'd appreciate it if everyone else could <a href="../../../c/h/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EChoosing_intentional_red_links_2e9b.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Choosing intentional red links">discuss the relevant guideline proposal</a> on its own merits so that consensus can be reached and it (or an alternative) can become official as soon as possible.

<p>Recent edits to the <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Alamo_2c77.html" title="Tony Alamo">Tony Alamo</a> article have added the full name of a child who was allegedly abused at the direction of Alamo in the late 80's. Since no reliable source has printed the name of the child as far as I can tell, it seems that revealing the name in this article could potentially be illegal under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (rather, the laws passed in every U.S. state designed to conform to this federal act). I am not absolutely certain that this is illegal (as this would require research of a lot of states' laws), but given that every state has passed laws to conform to the federal act and because the federal act requries the states to keep child abuse reports and records confidential, I think it's definitely possible. My posting on the <a href="../../../t/o/n/Talk%7ETony_Alamo_8012.html#Recent_edits_by_Toitd" title="Talk:Tony Alamo">article's talk page</a> explains the problem in a little more detail.

<dd>If in doubt, cut it out. Generally, every state that I've ever lived in has not only kept the names of minors secret, but they have additionally ruled that such sealed records cannot be brought up at a later date, so it wouldn't even matter if the victim had passed the age of majority since.

<dd>I don't believe this block was justified. I have contributed to Wikipedia in many ways. As to questions on the reference desk, if questioning paradigms, and having a differing view on morallity &amp; ethics is trolling, then would <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosa_Parks_bff2.html" title="Rosa Parks">Rosa Parks</a>, and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socrates.html" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> also be banned from Wikipedia for their views? The reference desk should be a place for Wikipedia users to ask questions they would like answers to. Many of the questions I have may be provokotive to some, but so would have been "Hey, why don't we free the slaves?" in the early 1800s. I shouldn't have responded to rude comment made by another Wikipedian in the manner I did, but other than that I have done no wrong--certanly nothing close to justifying this ban. In the future, I will try not to respond to personal attacks, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63214972" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63214972" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63226480" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63226480" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

You might also try and keep the discussion to the topic at hand rather than trying to dredge up something to discredit me. It shows the weakness of your point, and the block was inappropriate.

<dd>Continuing to throw around accusations of vandalism is a poor way to address this situation. If we can shift the conversation away from who's "guilty" of what and towards what the contents of the article should be, that will be good. Nobody is vandalizing here, because we are all out to improve the encyclopedia, so be definition, no vandalism. The only disagreement is over how to improve it, and you won't resolve that by throwing accusations at one another. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 05:18, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The dispute, in a nutshell: The <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_Fandom_e746.html" title="Furry Fandom">Furry Fandom</a> article has long been the target of so-called "humor" websites who think it's funny to attempt to get misinformation incorporated into the article because they think the editors who fix it are "taking the internet too seriously."

<dd>Xydexx, you may be right, that our IP friend is deliberately adding misinformation, but it doesn't appear to me to be remotely <i>obvious</i> that that's the case, and in my experience, deciding that someone else is acting with bad faith intentions is a good way to guarantee that the discussion doesn't go well. Let's put the "v-word" aside and focus on the content, and explaining very clearly for anyone who wants to read just what's wrong with the IP's edits, preferably at the article's talk page. This is a content dispute, and there's no reason the people involved shouldn't be able to resolve it without an AN/I thread over who think's who is a vandal. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 07:46, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My addition was cited, and it's not actually vandalism to add content without proper citation anyway. You've yet to fully explain what you felt was inappropriate about my edits or sources in any case. - 81.178.86.15 05:17, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have on the talk page of the article. Maybe you should visit there as that is where the discussion should be taking place. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 05:20, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
