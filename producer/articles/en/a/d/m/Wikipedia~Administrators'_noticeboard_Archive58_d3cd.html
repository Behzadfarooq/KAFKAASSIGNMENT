There has been ongoing abuse by this user directed at <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">SandyGeorgia</a> for months - amongst other things, the allegations are that SandyGeorgia is stalking Zeraeph (in real life as well as on Wikipedia), using sockpuppets, and conspiring with administrators. There have been three mediation attempts, a request for checkuser which showed that the alleged sockpuppets were unconnected to SandyGeorgia, and frequent complaints to AN/I. Nobody who has looked at Zeraeph's allegations has come to the conclusion that there is any evidence for them at all, or that SandyGeorgia has done anything to provoke this. I've just extended Zeraeph's block to a month, because she was using her talk page to repeat the allegations despite being warned (by myself and <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> who reviewed the initial block) that her only option now was to open an arbitration case or stop the abuse.

<dd>i don't know how to say this politely, so I'll just say it. It's clear that editing Wikipedia is interacting poorly with, and perhaps aggravating, the particular issues this person has. A number of the things she or he says (particularly about being stalked for years by Wikipedia users, conspiracies reaching back into the past, multiple unrelated people out to "get" her) are classic symptoms of various problems that are very, very serious. Obviously, I don't think Zeraeph's editing is good for Wikipedia, but there's a more important issue. While normally I would say that this is the sort of thing that should go through Arbcom, I do not believe that any sort of formal proceeding involving a panel of strangers evaluating her behavior that will drag on for weeks and weeks is going to be healthy for this person. I think the most merciful thing we could do is to shut her down, and do it firmly and quickly.</dd>

<p>I've been dealing with Zeraeph on a more personal level, through email after an unblock request sent to the Unblock mailing list (for the record, I advised Zeraeph to take the block as an enforced Wikibreak and to be calm when the block is over). When conversing with me, Zeraeph has alternated between being quite calm and being very frustrated with the situation. I know that Zeraeph can be very calm and reasonable when approached the right way, and I also feel that Zeraeph very honestly feels that he (or she?) is being stalked online, off-Wiki as well as on. I think if I can look at what Zeraeph can present to me, I can either provide advice on actions to take, or possibly log an RfAR on Zeraeph's behalf if the information is valid.</p>
<p>As such, I'd like to volunteer to be a <a href="../../../m/e/n/Wikipedia%7EMentorship_190c.html" title="Wikipedia:Mentorship">mentor</a> (this would be my first time as a mentor), even during the block. I don't think a community ban is the answer. If you feel that Zeraeph will only cause more trouble in his talk page, the solution may be to protect the talk page so he can continue to converse with me. I don't think Zeraeph is ill-intentioned, but rather, feels that he has a valid complaint. I hope that if I can bring this off-wiki, and in private, we can deal with the situation without rubbing too many Wikipedians the wrong way. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 15:12, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no objections to your trying. You should also contact SandyGeorgia privately; apparently she has been receiving unwanted e-mails regarding Zeraeph, and suspects that <a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">A Kiwi</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/k/User_talk%7EA_Kiwi_e07c.html" title="User talk:A Kiwi">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Kiwi_e53d.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Kiwi">contribs</a>) is involved (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_A_Kiwi_b81d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/A Kiwi">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/A Kiwi</a>, particularly the talk page). It could be (and this is pure speculation) that Zeraeph <i>is</i> being stalked online, but not by SandyGeorgia. My personal opinion is that this is going to be too complicated to achieve a workable on-wiki solution.

<dd>Yes, your speculation had occurred to me too. For now, I don't think I need to be contacting SandyGeorgia via email just yet. I am open to on-Wiki communication if necessary. I don't want Zeraeph to feel like I am any part of this conspiracy, and for now I am just communicating one-on-one with Zeraeph. Currently, Zeraeph is being calm and reasonable with me (though clearly frustrated with the situation), and that may change if he thinks I'm carrying on any conversations with SandyGeorgia behind is back. I would like to wait until Zeraeph presents valid evidence that it is indeed SandyGeorgia that is doing the stalking. I can promise that I will keep an open mind, examine the evidence clearly, and not do anything rash or without thought. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 15:34, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(edit conflict)&#160;:Last month, a situation arose that should have been addressed discreetly by senior administrators and with a minimum of public discussion. Instead, it became the topic of extensive discussion on-Wiki that caused egregious harm to vulnerable editors. Although the specifics here are different, this is an extremely serious situation involving allegations of an 8-year history of stalking, legal threats, potentially delusional scenarios, and psychological issues as mentioned by Nandesuka. I strongly believe in transparency on-Wiki, but there are limits. An RfAr under these circumstances would be a horror show and should not be suggested again. We need to be able to identify and deal with the(<i>rare</i>) sensitive situations like this that need to be investigated and resolved in a highly sensitive and confidential fashion. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 15:43, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Nandesuka and Newyorkbrad. Zeraeph has been asked several times as part of mediation processes to put forward a coherent, evidence-based statement about what she thinks is going on. All that comes out is the typical conspiracy theory reasoning - the absence of evidence for the conspiracy is firm proof that the conspiracy is real and working well, there are special secret things going on that the "victim" can't explain (for reasons which themselves can't be explained), things are so obvious that a request for evidence is proof of the inquirer having underhand motives for asking the question, and so on. <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-08-29_Talk%7EAsperger_Syndrome_4695.html#What_exactly_are_Zeraeph.27s_accusations.3F" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-08-29 Talk:Asperger Syndrome">This</a> is typical. I don't think Zeraeph is ill-intentioned, I think she is (literally) deluded. In any case, the abuse of SandyGeorgia has to stop, and on present form an arbitration case would just be used as a platform for further abuse, and would do Zeraeph no good at all. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 15:54, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's why I want to bring this discussion off-Wiki, so it doesn't hurt established Wikipedians. If I act as a filter, you can be sure that anything I present is, in my opinion, valid. I won't present anything that I don't think is valid. Right now, I have some pretty good dialog with Zeraeph. If I can keep this up, maybe Zeraeph and I can discuss this calmly. I would like for Zeraeph to eventually contribute positively to Wikipedia, but I also don't want for this situation to cause undue stress to Wikipedians. That's why I feel carrying on private dialog with Zeraeph without the threat of a community permaban (just the current temporary block) is best. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 16:05, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, for now I think it's in Zeraeph's best interests to leave the talk page protected for now. I don't want Zeraeph to get into a situation where he (or she) will get blocked for even longer. I'm not advocating an unblock yet (indeed, when Zeraeph submitted an unblock request to the mailing list, I suggested that he take this block as an enforced Wikibreak): I'm only opposing the community ban (which is an indefinite block) as proposed here. I don't think a community bad is the answer here. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 16:19, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>It could be (and this is pure speculation) that Zeraeph is being stalked online, but not by SandyGeorgia.</i> I believe this to be true, based on the emails I have, but apparently it "takes two to tango": she has been stalked and has allegedly been a stalker as well. (Witness the threats against me: that she is going to have authorities deal with me in real life.) I'm not convinced that any amount of conversation or mentoring will be able to convince Zeraeph that I am not the stalker, because that person has an AOL account, and I have an AOL account which I use when I am in a hotel that doesn't have another internet connection. I appreciate your efforts, but I believe the other editors have valid points about dragging this out in public considering the issues involved: I, too, have encountered situations like this and have always believed that disengaging is the only way to handle them. I understand your concerns about contacting me privately in order to preserve your role as a mentor, but someone needs to look at these e-mails, and then deal with the AOL editors who appeared in the midst of this mess, complicating it even further. I have repeatedly encouraged those people to keep the off-Wiki situation off Wiki, to no avail. I am fairly certain at this point that the only person who is going to be damaged by all of this is me: yes, the edit history is instructive (and I'm having a lovely vacation&#160;:-). It also needs to be understood that Zeraeph's attacks on me began long before she thought I was "her stalker" and before I received the emails (the person emailed me to supposedly support me because of Zeraeph's attacks), so using that now as the rationalization for her behavior doesn't hold water.

<dd>With all due respect, someone else needs to look at them. While I understand and accept that you have an open mind and are assuming good faith, and I applaud your effort, the reality is that you don't see this as clearly as ajn, Nandesuka, many others and I do, and your role right now is as Zeraeph's advocate and mentor. First, I believe strongly in guarding the privacy of e-mail, and wouldn't want the information in these e-mails to fall into Zeraeph's hands, even unwittingly. Second, your relationship with her as a mentor is likely to be compromised if she knows you have corresponded with me: she has expressed several times that she is convinced that I can manipulate admins. Third, if the person who sent me the e-mails holds me responsible for the information falling into Zeraeph's hands, I am likely to have not one online problem out of this mess, but multiple. In short, I am the one at risk here, having done nothing to warrant this, and I need for an admin who is not Zeraeph's advocate and mentor to look at the information. Again, Zeraeph's attacks on me began long before she had any reason to involve off-Wiki disputes or to believe that I was one of the people she has had those disputes with: I merely happened to cross paths with her because of a FARC. I concur with ajn and Nandesuka's analysis of the situation: unless there is a very fast cessation of these attacks and recognition that there is no reason to believe I am one of the people Zeraeph has had off-Wiki disputes with, as soon as I'm home, I will bring the ArbCom case myself.

<dd>My once daily checkin: Brilliant solution, thanks. (I have never responded to the sender's emails, as I don't want to be part of the whole drama: it appears that the sender read this and has already contacted ajn.) I feel strongly that the sender needs to be protected. I also failed to make another thing clear yesterday: If the sender is to be considered a "stalker", the sender has violated no Wiki policies, and only came (apparently) to Wiki after seeing Zeraeph do to me what she has done elsewhere to others. Once I asked that I no longer receive these e-mails, they stopped. The sender has turned out to be right about everything I was warned about, so I consider the sender credible, and to be protected. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 15:40, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah. I thought these emails were the harassing emails, not information sent by other people. In that case, that's fine, I'd rather not know. FWIW, I have yet to correspond with Zeraeph today, so I'm not sure how she feels about the whole thing (or even if I could be considered a mentor). All that is moot if she doesn't accept me as a mentor/advocate anyway. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 18:54, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For whatever it might be worth at this point, I agree with ajn and others that this individual is not only very nasty but probably delusional, that everything reasonable that can be tried to get him or her to become a positive contributor to Wikipedia has been tried, failed and indeed has only made things worse, and that a community ban is both warranted and probably achievable. I <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-08-29_Talk%7EAsperger_Syndrome_4695.html#What_exactly_are_Zeraeph.27s_accusations.3F" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-08-29 Talk:Asperger Syndrome">attempted to be a voice of reason</a> in the most recent mediation attempt, and the response was a) a repeat of precisely the same vague and barely coherent non-evidence that I was trying to get past and b) the most vicious and potentially libelous things Zeraeph had said on Wikipedia to date at the time. I seriously believe that he or she should, not only be off Wikipedia <b>forever</b>, but probably in jail or a mental institution as well for that response, and can't imagine how anyone could defend its author. I actually regret that my next response to Zeraeph was so mild - to be honest I skipped over most of the stalking accusations and so on the first time through. Not only were his comments about Sandy at that time completely outrageous toward her, they were rather a slap in the face to me as well.

<dd>There's not much in the emails that anyone with eyes wide open can't figure out, or that will be news to you, ajn. The problem is, they do contain identifying information, and if I redacted that information, I couldn't forward the emails with headers. At any rate, I want this to end. It is taking as much of my time as bringing an ArbCom case would, and when I return from vacation, I will have lots of Wiki work to catch up on. I still agree with those who said an ArbCom case will not be good for Wiki or good for Zeraeph, but I have a feeling if I don't bring the case, I'll still be responding to this issue months from now. It is with some irony that I noted the comments above that Zeraeph was "frustrated". This is a situation wholly caused by her and brought upon herself by no one but her, with me as the target, so I'm not entirely sympathetic anymore to her frustration. The people who followed her to Wiki certainly complicated a situation which Wiki admins could have handled, but they followed her to Wiki because she apparently continued a pattern of abuse here she has engaged in elsewhere.

<dd>I don't think anyone doubts your good faith or integrity. What's worrying some of us is that any further attempts to give Zeraeph a chance to defend herself will be abused by her.

<dd>As with ajn, I don't doubt your good faith or integrity. I doubt <i>Zeraeph's</i> good faith and integrity. It's very nice of you to offer to help this individual, but I believe it to be naïve; all you are likely to accomplish is to directly or indirectly give him or her a platform for further abusive actions (as happened with my own attempt to introduce some rationality into the debate), and that's not a desirable outcome no matter how good the intentions of the person doing it. Zeraeph is not above attempting the same kind of manipulation of which s/he is so quick to accuse others, and I believe that is likely what will prove to be happening here. <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 19:59, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm experienced enough to not let facetious or invalid information leak to Wikipedia via my own edits. What I hope to accomplish is to look at Zeraeph's information closely and either tell her that the information doesn't indicate too much or find some way of correcting the situation if it does. Since most of you believe that her information is invalid, you shouldn't be too worried, because while I genuinely want to help Zeraeph, I also want to make sure that she is either made aware that her accusations are unmerited or that, if they are, I can help her correct the situation. My dealing with her gives her a way of dealing with someone on Wikipedia. It does not mean that she has a meatpuppet who will blindly post anything that she writes. Currently, she is blocked from Wikipedia (a block that I'm not contesting), and her talk page is also protected (which, despite your offer to allow me to unprotect, remains protected). This pretty much means that the only ways she can communicate with someone on Wikipedia are through email, and that's where I come in. What she writes goes to me. Yes, I read her recent post to the mailing list and while it's a little troubling, the language isn't over-the-top. If it becomes as such, the listmods will likely ban her from the mailing list anyway. Which once again just leaves me to deal with her. What's the harm in that? I'm not a vexatious litigant, and I'm not ignorant either. Sometimes, just sweeping something under the rug and ignoring it isn't the answer. ajn, you must know that we don't hand out permanent blocks like candy. Community bans only become as much if someone permablocks the user and no other admin bothers to unblock. I am fine with this long block you've put her on while I try to deal with this user, but I won't stand idly by and see this user get permanently blocked while I've got some fruitful dialog with her. And this fruitful dialog is nothing that everyone else should be stressed out about either. I'm not an ignorant meatpuppet who allows any statements made by anyone cloud how he sees other users. If result of my discussions with her are that she should stop editing Wikipedia, then so be it. I actually suggested that plan of action in our discussions, and she may consider it if it seems she can't edit Wikipedia without resolving these issues, but I would like me and Zeraphael to make that determination for ourselves, not via a community ban forced upon her. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 18:38, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"you must know that we don't hand out permanent blocks like candy" - I'd hardly say this is candy, this user should have been blocked a while ago. Constant, unrepenting harrassment of other editors; and yes, I've had a bit of first-hand experience in the articles as well (although thankfully I was never the target but I tried to defend those who were). Please, let this one rest in peace so this user can solve his/her issues; Wikipedia is not a very good place to do that, in fact it usually just makes them worse; LOL!!! <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a> 19:42, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yeah, the candy remark bugged me too. DP, you're making it sound like all he did was swear at someone or something like that. Frankly, trivializing Zeraeph's offenses, such as calling someone an "erotomanic stalker", is rather offensive. I'm sure you didn't mean it that way, but <i>at best</i> failing to consider how that might come across backs up my above charge of naïvety. <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 20:10, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I didn't mean it that way, and I resent the implication that I'm naive. You're entitled to your opinion, and I know you didn't mean it that way, but I find your remark at least as insulting as my inadvertent remark about candy. You'd be singing a different tune if you were to look at the nature of my discussions with Zeraeph. I am by no means trivialising what Zeraeph has done, and I am not saying that what she did was minor. What I am saying is that community banning Zeraeph will not solve these problems of which you speak. And no, I am not saying Wikipedia is therapy either. I am dealing with Zeraeph <b>off-wiki</b>. How many times do I have to say that? I am dealing with Zeraeph <b>off-wiki</b>. That and the fact that she is already being blocked for a month should be sufficient. I do not support a community ban. You guys are asking for a community ban, and I'm not supporting it. Simple as that. If you guys want to file an arbitration case to get her banned for a year, that's fine, go ahead and file, I have no problems with Wikipedia processes being followed. But if you think you can get her banned through a unanimous community ban, I'm afraid you are mistaken. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 20:28, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, first of all, as I understand a community ban does not need to be unanimous. Leaving that aside, though, let me come at this from a slightly different angle. Could you please explain what positive result for Wikipedia you hope or expect to accomplish? Under what circumstances do you think Zeraeph should be permitted to edit again, and what benefits do you beleive will result when that happens? You can deal with Zeraeph off-wiki as much as you like, and as long as it stays off-wiki it's no real concern of mine (though I can see why Sandy might have a different view), it's the potential ON-wiki consequences that bother me. <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 20:47, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, it does have to be unanimous. A community ban is simply an indefinite block that other admins can't be bothered to undo. If a single admin wants to undo an indefinite block as a result of a community ban, that community ban will not hold. To have an <i>enforceable</i> ban on a user requires the approval from ArbCom, Jimbo, or via an <a href="../../../o/f/f/Wikipedia%7EOffice_Actions_5803.html" title="Wikipedia:Office Actions">office action</a>, and unless things have changed since I last paid attention to it, ArbCom can only hand out one-year blocks on main accounts (sockpuppet accounts are another matter). As to your next question, I was hoping to tiptoe around it before, but I'll be frank. I believe that if you simply hand out a blanket block, Zaphrael will continue to find a way to make life difficult for the said parties. While I understand how harrying it is for you people, I may have found another angle with Zaphrael and how to approach her. She's already been blocked for a month, and right now, she can't really do anything on Wikipedia, unless she chooses to get around the block by using sockpuppets or anon IPs, but from what I see in our emails, Zaphrael is fully aware that I will not help her at all if she breaks the block on her in this fashion. I'm reviewing her information in a neutral manner, and I can have feedback that I can give her. Whatever the result, I can act appropriately. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 08:18, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

I am relieved to see that others have (finally) noted the severity of the statements Zeraeph has made against me, since I was surprised at the initial mild responses, considering how severely she has attacked me in so many places, with no foundation. Phoenix, I have no doubt at all of your good faith effort, but I do wonder if you've had experience with the particular issues and behaviors in evidence. I would also like to have an idea if there is a concensus here as to whether I should bring the Arbcom case. If some admins finally realize what I've been attempting to ignore, I will be glad to continue to ignore it if others think that is best for Wiki and she can be prevented from the continued attacks and smears, which are clearly beyond the pale of anything I've encountered on Wiki.

<dd>Please see my response above. And yes, I have experience with these particular issues and behaviours (admittedly, not as a formally trained professional) and it is precisely because of this experience that I am approaching it this way. Think of it this way: she's already blocked for a month and her talk page is protected. If she decides to write any further emails to the mailing list that the listmods deem unacceptable, they will reject it. Any of her other activities beyond this will be outside of Wikipedia, and these actions may occur regardless of whether she is community banned from Wikipedia or not. Please, this time is mine to use (and in all of your opinions, to waste). While I understand how harrying this is for you, I believe this would be equally harrying whether I expend this effort or not. At least give me the chance to expend this effort, try to talk to Zaphrael, and have us (me and Zaphrael) both come to an agreement on something before we act on it. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 08:18, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that a community ban won't stop her from harassing me, and my concern is that she will use socks and proxies, and may impersonate me. I have no concerns about off-Wiki attempts or activities: I have never encountered her off-Wiki, and to put it plainly, Zeraeph thinks she knows who I am, but since she's wrong and I'm not who she thinks I am, there is no chance she can harm me in real life or off-Wiki. The only concern is on-Wiki, so I am in agreement with any approach that might work in the long-term. As I've said from the beginning, I'm willing to follow whatever approach is best for Wiki, and will hopefully keep me safe from longer-term attacks via socks, proxies, and impersonations. I just hope others will have my back, because the viciousness is alarming. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 16:21, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Even while Zeraeph (I keep misspelling her name!) and I are engaging in useful dialog, I am aware of the possibility that she could be doing these things. If she is making any on-Wiki attacks via socks and open proxies, let me know and I will look into these cases myself or, if you are asking another admin to look into this, please let me know regardless. Wikipedia mentorship goes both ways: mentors are supposed to help and guide the people that they are mentoring, but they also issue warnings and blocks if the people they are mentoring continue with un-Wiki behaviour. However, sockpuppet and impersonator accounts can be blocked indefinitely, and this would not be contentious at all. If the account attacking you is a sockpuppet of Zeraeph, I would have no problem with an indef block because Zeraeph is getting around her block in an un-Wiki manner, and if the account attacking you is an impersonator of Zeraeph, she would happily have that account indef blocked because it's trying to get her punished even more. The simplest thing to do would simply be to indef block a sock or impersonator account (or temporarily block the IP) and revert any edits that those accounts make without further action. If, however, a CheckUser confirms the accounts as belonging to Zeraeph, further action would be relevant. I feel confortable saying this because I am certain that Zeraeph would not engage in sockpuppetry while we are in useful dialog, but have no problems with fixing anything that happens because of my misplaced trust. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 17:03, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I believe myself and Justdignity made some important contributions to the Bully and Workplace Bullying topics back around May 2006 but the text kept on being immediately deleted by Zeraeph on the basis of no citations. But very little else on those topics had citations either. Zeraeph said she would be happy to reinstate my text if it had citations. But that left me at her mercy as to whether in her view i had enough citations or in the right places. She should have left my text in place with citation markers in place and I would have gladly provided citations. On her basis i hardly felt motivated to bother doing any more work.

<p>Zeraeph had a large role in the banning of Sam Vaknin. In my view Zeraeph's contributions were poisonous. Sam Vaknin is a self proclaimed narcissist but not in my view a malicious narcissist like Zeraeph. Like him or loath him he is an important authority in the understanding of narcissism.

<p>About the only person not in favour of an immediate ban on Zeraeph is DeathPhoenix. Zeraeph has got form. She has a highly manipulative personality. For her, acting this way is a compulsion. Any idea of negotiating with her to reach agreement is doomed to failure. It is very naive to even try. She may play mind games and pretend to agree to a compromise solution but she would just be bluffing. It is Wikipedia that is much more important than the welfare of one contributor - Zeraeph. Why should we have to endure any more of her poison&#160;? --<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenbat_0359.html" title="User:Penbat">Penbat</a> 21:24, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My first involvement in the Z-affair was very tangential. I visited Keyne's Talk page to thank him for his plea for Z to halt her disruptive posting on the Asperger Syndrome talk page. The talk page had become emotionally stressful just to read and try to keep up with the others (a steadily dwindling number).</dd>

<dd>Then came the last of the attempted Mediations. I saw her refusal to cooperate and to divert attention from the issue. Then here, RN and others say they have had problems, too. I decided to check out her contributions history and so far I have, in this short time, found that she has gone after a PhD psychologist by impugning the quality of his education and, seemingly, his relationship with an online mental health site. She then implied that he wasn't at all qualified to write about the topic.</dd>

<dd>I found situations which indicates Z brought one, perhaps more, old grudges with people in the mental disorders topics.

<dd>This was the ending where she revealed that she has been personally upset with Sam for many years. On that page, many of her posts indicate her problems with him were of long duration before she came to Wikipedia. However, when I went hunting, her posts to Samvak started only in February of 2006, and she showed no sign of knowing him at all and he did not recognize her until later.</dd>

<dd>It looks to me like Sam Vaknin got badly wound up by Zeraeph, ref his "The Six Sins of the Wikipedia" for example. He presumably equated Wikipedia with Zeraeph as Wikipedia in general seemed to have sided with Zeraeph in preferance to himself. Far from being the monster that Zeraeph portrays him as, he still runs two popular support groups for victims of narcissists and commands the respect of many victims. --<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenbat_0359.html" title="User:Penbat">Penbat</a> 14:02, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Slowed a week ago. Deathphoenix wanted time for Zeraeph, see if she could ignore cetain people. He said she'd promised not to slip around in stocking feet. on that note, I got wiki mail from someone who may or may not be the someone others have mentioned. The party says they have had two socks in sight for the past week and 3 IP addresses to check against. Something about how it won't be sent unless it's wanted.

<dd>Just to respond to the above questions: Geni, we are using SurveyMonkey to host the survey, which is a common tool used in the research community. The articles/portals are selected using an algorithm which we will discuss more in the paper. RVTA, originally we targeted a randomly selected (by name) group of admins, but people told us to post here instead of to individual user pages. If the WP community has a better idea for a method for researchers to interact with the community, we'd definitely be interested in hearing it.

<p>A problem I see is that there is no way to ensure you are getting answers from administrators and editors, or trolls and passers-by. Anyone can do the survey and anyone can fill in whatever username they wish to impersonate.

<p>I assume most of us revert vandalism using the rollback choice but you notice it leaves no explanation of the reason. There are a few other categories of "rollback on sight", such as removing linkspam or removing personal info or removing personal attack or removing edit by banned person. I am sure a few others might occur to people. Is anyone else in favor of asking the developers for a choice of, say, 5 or 6 rollback buttons that function like the present one but put a brief explanatory phrase in the edit summary? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 20:13, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If it's anything other than vandalism, rollback isn't appropriate. I'm sure we've all broken that rule now and again, but to be honest, it's generally a good one. If you need to undo an edit for any other reason than vandalism, then you need to manually explain whay you're doing. Doing so will also help you think twice about reverting in the first place. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 20:23, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
A related question, what can be done for admins who continuously use rollback for reverts during edit disputes, and other cases where no obvious vandalism/link spam etc has occurred? I have tried politely requesting them in such cases, but most of the time, the offending admin simply ignores and does it again and again. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 20:26, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is of course problems in abusing admin features in edit disputes. According to <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html#Reverting" title="WP:ADMIN">WP:ADMIN#Reverting</a>, <i>Do not use one-click rollback on edits that are not simple vandalism; please revert manually with an appropriate edit summary.</i>. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 20:34, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If an admin repeatedly uses the rollback feature to get the upper hand in an edit war they should first be reported for violating 3RR or the spirit of the rule if appropriate, then send to arbcom if they keep ignoring requests not to. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:53, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I cannot see how using rollback is any different from leaving a blank or uninformative edit summary. 3RR is already taken care of. There is already guidance to not describe a good-faith edit as vandalism. Misusing one's position as an admin is understood to be wrong no matter what mechanism is used. How is using the rollback button worse than leaving as a summary "restored NPOV"? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 19:07, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure if the interface clutter is worth the trouble. Rollback is, in the vast majority of cases, used where the reason for its use is obvious. If an editor is confused or perplexed about why an admin used rollback in a particular circumstance, a polite talk page request usually clears matters right up. For admins (or other editors, for that matter) who would like more specific or more customizable rollback buttons, my understanding is that there are any number of homebrew scripts available for download these days. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 21:00, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It shouldn't happen in the first place, and having to talk to the admin first is quite a waste of time. I had a minor fight on a <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">WP:BJAODN</a> page - I added something and the admin reverted. I think we both wasted more time arguing about it on his talk page than if he had just spent <b>20 seconds</b> explaining why he didn't think it was funny. Hbdragon88 19:36, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, I know, we don't do that with edit wars, etc. So where can I find a "homebrew script" that would let me make a small menu of edit summaries for rollback? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 02:59, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Admin rollback has always been for vandalism only. If admins are making an edit decision, they should do it manually like everyone else, and leave an edit summary to explain the edit (which rollback can't do). This is for good communication with other editors. Past discussions about this feature have been unambiguous. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 07:38, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>All points agreed as above. This is about how, not when and whether. I am suggesting/requesting a measure to increase ease and detail of communication for those rollbacks that do not warrant a talk page discussion but might not look like obvious vandalism. I am one of those editors who feel a much stronger conversation obligation to named users with accounts than to anon IPs but would like to leave a more informative message than the automatic "reverted". Please don't repeat the points already stipulated, thanks. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 12:10, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is this at <i>all</i> normal? A series of user names, most of the form "name &lt;space&gt; name", all editing a single article, with very small edits quite quickly, over a short period of time but not overlapping. Is this someone trying to 'establish' a set of users for ... 'later'?</p>

<dd>I apologise. I didn't think that you meant that Bruce was a problem, only that you were just raising a perfectly valid concern that there might be a connection. But I'm discomforted that Bruce was included in a check user request <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser#Reformed_Baptist" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser#Reformed_Baptist" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. That's not because it wasn't done in good faith - it was. Just that it's rough on him to show up and accidentally be caught in a dragnet. I'm uncomfortable that we're discussing him and he doesn't (presumably) know it. But I don't what to do about it - leave a message on his page saying "By the way Bruce, just to let you know, we're watching you and we're know you're innocent?" That's wierd too.

<li>I only included him, because he appears (or appeared) to be connected by naming and edit habits. If he's innocent I'm sorry he got dragged in here, but I don't see anything implicitly wrong with innocents being included in RFCU when there's reason to believe there's a connection. The persons performing such checks will not reveal any confidential information, so information he is not related can only be good for him. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:07, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just got home from the pub so excuse my bad grammar. This has been discussed before. Nothing much more to add bar the info above but the evidence is overwhelming. Both had similar edit times, had similar edit summaries, edited the same articles and the account was used to voilate the 3RR rule, e.g. Victrix would rv 3 times then DG would step in and vise versa. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 23:43, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, the anon editor was trying to discuss this matter on the talk page, and in a very civil way. The dispute was over the accuracy of the article and the reliability of the article sources. The anon user reported the UtherSRG to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a> where he was himself blocked by <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinhunter_d2c4.html" title="User:Winhunter">User:Winhunter</a> for 3RR violation and UtherSRG was left without as much as a note on his talk page.</p>
<p>I came into this incident when <span class="plainlinks">154.20.161.143 (<a href="../../../1/5/4/User_talk%7E154.20.161.143.html" title="User talk:154.20.161.143">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_154.20.161.143_38a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/154.20.161.143">contribs</a> • <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ipall.ch?domain=154.20.161.143" class="external text" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ipall.ch?domain=154.20.161.143" rel="nofollow">WHOIS</a>)</span> put up an unblock request describing the matter. I found his 3RR report, reviewed it, and not realising that <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">User:UtherSRG</a> was an administrator, I have blocked him for 24 hours and put a note on his talk page informing him of the block. A couple of seconds later, on the admin channel on IRC, I was informed that I had just blocked an admin. After 10 minutes of discussion on IRC, <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlen_S_8ece.html" title="User:Glen S">User:Glen_S</a> decided that because a lot of his reverts were reverting {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} tags on a "referenced" article he could be unblocked.</p>
<p><i><b>However</b></i>, at the beginning of the revert war, there were <i><b>absolutely 0</b></i> references in the article (see the version at the time of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paranthropus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75397774" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paranthropus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75397774" rel="nofollow">the first revert</a>), later on the anon explained his concerns on the talk page, put in an unreferenced tag, and a disputed assertion tag on one of the statements, this again was reverted as vandalism using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paranthropus&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=75613005" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paranthropus&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=75613005" rel="nofollow">admin rollback</a>. The <s>admin</s> anon reverted the revert asking for discussion, this was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paranthropus&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=75666001" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paranthropus&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=75666001" rel="nofollow">removed again using admin rollback</a>, more links were added by the UtherSRG, the anon expressed futher very legitimate concerns about the reliability of the online sources and about neutrality of the article and put in POV and unreferenced tags but was again reverted multiple times. UtherSRG has made only two small comments on the talk page, not even bothering to address the last detailed statement describing his rationale for <i>each tag</i> - instead of addressing it 4 reverts were made, including 3 admin rollbacks.</p>
<p>I am not happy that an admin was favoured in this case for what clearly looks to me like a revert war NOT vandalism reversion as the edit summaries suggest. And I am not happy that admins can run around using their admin rollbacks in revert wars without decent attempts at discussion. I don't agree with the technicality used to lift the block on UtherSRG, that was pointed out to me on IRC - i.e. that the <span class="editlink noprint plainlinksneverexpand"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../u/n/r/Talk%7EUnreferenced_fc1a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../u/n/r/Talk%7EUnreferenced_fc1a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a></span> tags are meant to refer to articles with absolutely 0 references. An anon has no way of knowing all the tags available on wikipedia, otherwise he could have used something more like: {{<a href="../../../p/r/i/Template%7EPrimarysources_fe8b.html" title="Template:Primarysources">Primarysources</a>}}, which even I did not know of until just a couple of minutes ago! And in any case these are not the only tags that were reverted. For me it looks like that UtherSRG, who got out of this unscathed, is more at fault than the anon who was blocked for "3RR violation and disruption" while actually trying to discuss the matter and being the one who reported the incident in the first place!</p>

My first rollback was followed immediately by an edit where I add a reference, countering the anon's complaint. Etc. If the anon has relevant information to add to the article they should do so instead of complaining at the state of the artcle and slapping tags on it. I didn't add the majority of the information, but I helped clean up the edits of several other, well informed, editors. Perhaps my biggest offense is <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, where I have little patience for non-productive armchair quarterbacking.

<dd>This I did not know. I do not (and can not) keep up to date on all of the Wiki rules and policies. There are way too many and they change way too frequently to keep current on. Taht said, the edit summary of the rollback <b>must</b> be changed to indicate it is reverting vandalism if, indeed, that is the current policy. Until the edit summary matches the policy and is changed from its neutral wording to one that states it is revertin vandalism, then the policy is flawed and should be disregarded as it doesn't match the effect of the software. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 12:51, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So UtherSRG was unnblocked because he technically didn't break the 3RR since he only reverted the {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} tag twice, and removed the {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} tag. But if that is so, then I technically did not break 3RR either. How can I be at fault but not him?</p>
<p>I was not aware that adding external links was considered citing sources. On the Paranthropus talk page I explained why I had added the unreferenced tag. If it is true that external links are considered references, that could have been explained to me on the talk page and I would not have re-added the same tag.</p>

<p>I find this statement offensive and erroneous. In the Parathropus talk page I clearly said: <i>"There is no consensus in the scientific community that the species A. aethiopicus, A. boisei and A. robustus belong in the genus Paranthropus. They are commonly referred to as A. aethiopicus, A. boisei and A. robustus in current peer reviewed articles and books. To provide a neutral viewpoint, both models of classification systems should be described in detail. For these reasons I have added a disputed tag. Please do not remove until article is updated to be NPOV."</i> and <i>"What I am suggesting is that BOTH models of classification systems are mentioned and described in detail. For these reasons, I have added a POV tag. Please do not remove the tag until both classification systems are given the equal attention which they deserve"</i> I was not trying to promote my own POV as I do not have an opinion on which genus the three species belong to. All I was attempting to do by adding the tags was trying to bring attention to the false statement that there is a consensus on that subject in the scientific community. I even provided references on the talk page to show that it was not my personal point of view, but that of textbooks. There are many different ways to contribute to wikipedia, just because I don't make major changes to the article does not mean my edits should be discounted. IMO, alerting others that an article is POV is productive editing (if not, why even have the tags). I would also like to note I tried to continue the discussion on the talk page with UtherSRG, but he responded by saying "(<i>rv I tked, we disagreed, i have nothing left to say.</i>)" which I found to be very discourteous. 154.20.161.143 03:38, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Could you state the case briefly? If the point is that someone who has a sysop bit was given false favor in an edit warring situation, then this is a serious matter. Nobody should edit war.

<dd>I'm of the opinion that such a warning should be manually inserted in situations where civility actually becomes a problem. The majority of AFD pages consist of drive-by, pile-on "votes" in one direction or another with very little accompanying commentary. However a few of them actually evolve into meaningful, or possibly inflammatory, discussion, and may require a warning shot across the bow. Perhaps as an ironic counterpoint to {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd-anons_8039.html" title="Template:Afd-anons">afd-anons</a>}}, we need a {{afd-regulars}} template.

However, the anon editor was trying to discuss this matter on the talk page, and in a very civil way. The dispute was over the accuracy of the article and the reliability of the article sources.

I found his 3RR report, reviewed it, and not realising that <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">User:UtherSRG</a> was an administrator, I have blocked him for 24 hours and put a note on his talk page informing him of the block. A couple of seconds later, on the admin channel on IRC, I was informed that I had just blocked an admin. After 10 minutes of discussion on IRC, <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlen_S_8ece.html" title="User:Glen S">User:Glen_S</a> decided that because a lot of his reverts were reverting {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} tags on a "referenced" article he could be unblocked.</p>
<p><i><b>However</b></i>, at the beginning of the revert war, there were <i><b>absolutely 0</b></i> references in the article (see the version at the time of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paranthropus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75397774" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paranthropus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75397774" rel="nofollow">the first revert</a>), later on the anon explained his concerns on the talk page, put in an unreferenced tag, and a disputed assertion tag on one of the statements, this again was reverted as vandalism using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paranthropus&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=75613005" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paranthropus&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=75613005" rel="nofollow">admin rollback</a>. The <s>admin</s> anon reverted the revert asking for discussion, this was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paranthropus&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=75666001" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paranthropus&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=75666001" rel="nofollow">removed again using admin rollback</a>, more links were added by the UtherSRG, the anon expressed futher very legitimate concerns about the reliability of the online sources and about neutrality of the article and put in POV and unreferenced tags but was again reverted multiple times. UtherSRG has made only two small comments on the talk page, not even bothering to address the last detailed statement describing his rationale for <i>each tag</i> - instead of addressing it 4 reverts were made, including 3 admin rollbacks.</p>
<p>I am not happy that an admin was favoured in this case for what clearly looks to me like a revert war NOT vandalism reversion as the edit summaries suggest. And I am not happy that admins can run around using their admin rollbacks in revert wars without decent attempts at discussion. I don't agree with the technicality used to lift the block on UtherSRG, that was pointed out to me on IRC - i.e. that the <span class="editlink noprint plainlinksneverexpand"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../u/n/r/Talk%7EUnreferenced_fc1a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../u/n/r/Talk%7EUnreferenced_fc1a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a></span> tags are meant to refer to articles with absolutely 0 references. An anon has no way of knowing all the tags available on wikipedia, otherwise he could have used something more like: {{<a href="../../../p/r/i/Template%7EPrimarysources_fe8b.html" title="Template:Primarysources">Primarysources</a>}}, which even I did not know of until just a couple of minutes ago! And in any case these are not the only tags that were reverted. For me it looks like that UtherSRG, who got out of this unscathed, is more at fault than the anon who was blocked for "3RR violation and disruption" while actually trying to discuss the matter and being the one who reported the incident in the first place!</p>

My first rollback was followed immediately by an edit where I add a reference, countering the anon's complaint. Etc. If the anon has relevant information to add to the article they should do so instead of complaining at the state of the artcle and slapping tags on it. I didn't add the majority of the information, but I helped clean up the edits of several other, well informed, editors. Perhaps my biggest offense is <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, where I have little patience for non-productive armchair quarterbacking.

<dd>This I did not know. I do not (and can not) keep up to date on all of the Wiki rules and policies. There are way too many and they change way too frequently to keep current on. Taht said, the edit summary of the rollback <b>must</b> be changed to indicate it is reverting vandalism if, indeed, that is the current policy. Until the edit summary matches the policy and is changed from its neutral wording to one that states it is revertin vandalism, then the policy is flawed and should be disregarded as it doesn't match the effect of the software. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 12:51, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So UtherSRG was unnblocked because he technically didn't break the 3RR since he only reverted the {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} tag twice, and removed the {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} tag. But if that is so, then I technically did not break 3RR either. How can I be at fault but not him?</p>
<p>I was not aware that adding external links was considered citing sources. On the Paranthropus talk page I explained why I had added the unreferenced tag. If it is true that external links are considered references, that could have been explained to me on the talk page and I would not have re-added the same tag.</p>

<dd><i>"If the anon has relevant information to add to the article they should do so instead of complaining at the state of the artcle and slapping tags on it. I didn't add the majority of the information, but I helped clean up the edits of several other, well informed, editors. Perhaps my biggest offense is WP:BITE, where I have little patience for non-productive armchair quarterbacking. The anon showed little interest in editing, only in complaining that the article didn't reflect the POV they felt was more valid. - UtherSRG (talk) 00:54, 16 September 2006"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I find this statement offensive and erroneous. In the Parathropus talk page I clearly said: <i>"There is no consensus in the scientific community that the species A. aethiopicus, A. boisei and A. robustus belong in the genus Paranthropus. They are commonly referred to as A. aethiopicus, A. boisei and A. robustus in current peer reviewed articles and books. To provide a neutral viewpoint, both models of classification systems should be described in detail. For these reasons I have added a disputed tag. Please do not remove until article is updated to be NPOV."</i> and <i>"What I am suggesting is that BOTH models of classification systems are mentioned and described in detail. For these reasons, I have added a POV tag. Please do not remove the tag until both classification systems are given the equal attention which they deserve"</i> I was not trying to promote my own POV as I do not have an opinion on which genus the three species belong to. All I was attempting to do by adding the tags was trying to bring attention to the false statement that there is a consensus on that subject in the scientific community. I even provided references on the talk page to show that it was not my personal point of view, but that of textbooks. There are many different ways to contribute to wikipedia, just because I don't make major changes to the article does not mean my edits should be discounted. IMO, alerting others that an article is POV is productive editing (if not, why even have the tags). I would also like to note I tried to continue the discussion on the talk page with UtherSRG, but he responded by saying "(<i>rv I tked, we disagreed, i have nothing left to say.</i>)" which I found to be very discourteous. 154.20.161.143 03:38, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Could you state the case briefly? If the point is that someone who has a sysop bit was given false favor in an edit warring situation, then this is a serious matter. Nobody should edit war.

<dd>I've reverted the commented warning for now, because, as I said in my edit summary, this is a template which people subst without ever reading the full text contained in the template. And, frankly I couldn't care less if spammers are whining about their spam being deleted. That I didn't say in the edit summary.

<dd>I'm of the opinion that such a warning should be manually inserted in situations where civility actually becomes a problem. The majority of AFD pages consist of drive-by, pile-on "votes" in one direction or another with very little accompanying commentary. However a few of them actually evolve into meaningful, or possibly inflammatory, discussion, and may require a warning shot across the bow. Perhaps as an ironic counterpoint to {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd-anons_8039.html" title="Template:Afd-anons">afd-anons</a>}}, we need a {{afd-regulars}} template.

<li>Hm, interesting. There was a discussion about community probation last week (i.e. deciding that a user should stay away from certain articles, as opposed to a community ban which decides a user must stay away from the entire 'pedia). Based on the response there, it sounds like a good idea to give this a shot. Based on the heavy mailflow on the Admin Noticeboard, I figured it might be a good idea to log all current probations on a single page (but please keep all related discussion on <i>this</i> page). I've created a log at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_probation_92b5.html" title="Wikipedia:Community probation">Wikipedia:Community probation</a> with some deliberately vague language at the top (feel free to edit) because I'm quite sure we don't need a formal legislative process for this. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 22:48, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well the first three are legitimate authors, and IMO they meet the notability criteria. However, the article is a <i>List of African-American writers</i>, and there doesn't seem to be a notability threshold for inclusion. I didn't read up enough to figure out if they are actually African-American, which is an issue and should be verified. But what's the existing standard of verifiability on the article? Have all the 'blue-linked' authors been verified as A-A? If the issue is the red-links, IMO the discussion should wait until actual <i>articles</i> are written about them, whereupon it can be decided whether or not they are notable enough to warrant them. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 21:16, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(edit conflict) From what I can tell they appear to be notable writers, although I haven't checked every one.

<dd>It's someone else asking for a password reminder, it sends that to your registered and confirmed email address, as the message you got says "If someone else made this request ... you may ignore this message and continue using your old password".

<dd>For a brute force attack, requesting a new password increases the size of your target, because there are now two passwords that will work. However, I tend to ignore such emails - six random numbers and letters are fairly hard to crack (2 billion variants).

<dd>As far as I was aware, RoM would prefer "Macedonia", Greece would prefer "former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", and most Wikipedia pages use "Republic of Macedonia" as a neutral compromise.

<dd>Ummm, no. That is not the case. Greece would prefer "Republic of <a href="../../../s/k/o/Skopje.html" title="Skopje">Skopje</a>" or "Slavomacedonia" or "Vardar Macedonia". The country itself would prefer "Republic of Macedonia". The compromise solution in the UN was <a href="../../../f/o/r/Former_Yugoslav_Republic_of_Macedonia_5080.html" title="Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia">Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</a>. So, this is not Greek POV, it is int'l POV, as described in featured article <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia_%28terminology%29.html" title="Macedonia (terminology)">Macedonia (terminology)</a>.

<p>User:133.41.4.46 made an edit to add <a href="../../../g/e/n/Category%7EGenocide_a1e2.html" title="Category:Genocide">Category:Genocide</a> to the article <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodomor.html" title="Holodomor">Holodomor</a>. The following edits were all concerned with adding and removing this category. There were 5 reverts to delete it. He only made 4 reverts to reinstate it (the first of his 5 edits was not a revert). His first edit was at 10.28. The first and second reverts against him were at 10.32 and 10.36 by <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">User:Irpen</a>. The third was at 10.43 by <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">User: Alex Bakharev</a>. The fourth at <s>11.47</s> 10.47 by Irpen (his 3rd revert) and the fifth by Alex Bakharev (his 2nd revert) at 11.16.</p>
<p>This was an edit war which all three users engaged in. As it was two editors acting against one, 133.41.4.46 would inevitably fall foul of 3RR first. It does not speak well of any of the editors involved, particularly an admin, especially when the latter blocked his opponent and made his preferred edit 2 minutes later.</p>
<p>133.41.4.46 made his 3rd rv at 10.46 and was warned for 3RR a minute later. However, at 10.43 the 3rd rv had actually been made against him (Bakharev's 1st rv, following 2 by Irpen).</p>
<p>At 10.57, 133.41.4.46 had left a justification for his edit on Bakharev's talk page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alex_Bakharev&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76030276" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alex_Bakharev&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76030276" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> There was no response to this and at 11.07, Irpen made his 3rd rv and the 4th in total against 133.41.4.46., who rv 3 minutes later and was blocked. Then Bakharev made his 2nd rv and the 5th in total against 133.41.4.46.</p>
<p>The net effect is that an editing decision has been achieved by force rather than argument, and that an adroit use of the rules has been employed to achieve this. It is not in wiki's interest to tolerate such practice. Two users acting in concert have been as guilty in spirit, if not the strict letter of the law, as the single user.</p>
<p>I commend Bhakarev for bringing this to AN, but he cannot expect to receive a "get out of jail free" card for doing so. I propose that all three editors involved need to back off and cool down, and if Bhakarev considers that a block is needed to do this, then he and Irpen should also receive one; or he may decide that the block on 133.41.4.46 was unjustified in the circumstances and remove it, in order to <s>respond to</s> continue the dialogue which 133.41.4.46 initiated on his talk page. <s>and which he has so far ignored.</s> <small>See clarification below</small></p>

<dd>Clarification: 133.41.4.46 made the post initiating dialogue at 10.57. 133.41.4.46's final edit was at 11.10. Bhakarev responded to 133.41.4.46's post at 11.12 and then immediately blocked 133.41.4.46 at 11.14 (at which time Irpen also responded to the post).</dd>

<dd>The edits to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodomor.html" title="Holodomor">Holodomor</a> were repeats of the edits of <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Kov_4f0b.html" title="User:Alex Kov">User:Alex Kov</a> (see e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holodomor&amp;diff=72426072&amp;oldid=72424943" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holodomor&amp;diff=72426072&amp;oldid=72424943" rel="nofollow">this dif</a>) so all the five edits are reverts.

He did not answer Irpen's comments. In any case I warned the user about the 3RR rule but he choose to ignore it. That is my explanation.

<p>Thank you for your offer of being blocked, which shows integrity, though it is not something which I will do unilaterally. I wondered if something of what you said was occurring, but, assuming that it is true, a different approach is preferable. You are stating that a user is employing socks abusively, and the tack should be to resolve that situation. The anon has been editing as such for some time. Two against one, as in the current situation, always looks bad, especially when one is a blocking admin. It doesn't help our reputation for fairness. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 23:07, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BTW I find the Tyrenius's interpretation of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> to be extremely unusual. In my opinion the whole point of 3RR is that it is a surrogate of polling: if three editors prefer one version and two prefer another than the most popular opinion wins. So do not worry if you are right somebody else will restore your version. Now, if the interpretation is that you are not allowed to revert if somebody did two similar reverts before you then the effect on the editing process is quite dramatic. I am not sure how Wiki is suppose to work if everybody is allowed to revert against the consensus and the consensus is not allowed to revert back. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 03:13, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, it is a completely nonsensical interpretation of 3RR. 3RR applies to individual editors, not groups of editors. If one were to rule according to Tyrenius's view, it would mean that one editor could hold an article hostage against the will of any number of other editors, and we would have a "1RR rule", not a "3RR rule". Rather, if one individual is reverted by three other editors, that is not a sign that they have all violated 3RR, but rather a sign of consensus against that first editor's view. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 03:47, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd disagree with you there. The <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a> exists to encourage that people stop reverting, and actually take the issue to the talk page. Those reverting changes which are not vandalism should include "discuss on talk page" in their edit summaries. The 3RR rule can only be broken by a group when enforcing recient <i>agreed</i> consensus. Edit summaries do not provide enough space to include reasoning, preventing most forms of <i>informed</i> consensus being reached without having to use the talk page. If groups could act to ignore the 3RR, meatpuppetry and gang actions would become the prefered means to edit. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 03:50, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I completely agree with JayJG, at some stage I thought I have gone mad. Besides the talk page to the article and its archives are plastered with the discussion if the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodomor.html" title="Holodomor">Holodomor</a> was a genocide and how to better formulate the facts. The latest section <a href="../../../h/o/l/Talk%7EHolodomor_cf32.html#Genocide_once_more" title="Talk:Holodomor">Talk:Holodomor#Genocide_once_more</a> is specifically about the category.

<dd>Jayjg, consider a fairly common case wereby a group of editors wish to refuse to follow policy. In cases like this, their acts are simply not consensus. Wikipedia uses <i>informed</i> consensus, based on an understanding of policy, guidelines, good practice and so on. One does not create informed consensus through the brute pushing of a viewpoint (about all that's practical in the edit summary length), but through detailed discussion and evaluation. If 3RR represented a consensus, this would send the message that ignoring the concept of informed consensus is perfectly acceptable. 3RR must apply to groups also to stop group edit wars, another common occurance wereby the editors of an article all take sides, and there are enough of them to prevent 3RR from being noticably reached. If a consensus has formed on the talk page, the best approach is for the first reverter to state "See the talk page". If the original editor cannot find the entry, they then may leave a summary of "could not find the section". The next revert should then either point out the most recient clear consensus, or state "Let's dicuss this". It seems to me in this case that the group reverting was justified, but they allowed an edit summary argument to occur rather than continuing to attempt to drag the matter onto the talk page <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 04:25, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you check through my edits, you'll see I am contributing quite nicely, and the situations I am refering to are occuring in articles I am editing.

<dd>More so to prevent single editors from edit warring against consensus. When there are many editors in two groups edit warring protection is in order. If a single user disagrees with the general consensus it is that users job to either convince the other editors (or if that fails) get an outside mediator or opinion to step in. 3RR simply has no bearing on groups of editors. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 20:40, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If he had some questions on the issue, he could have asked for details if he is too busy to spend a little time to clear this up from the edit histories on his own.

<li>sterile revert warring in several articles trying to insert the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> images he drew in defiance of historical research (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?offset=&amp;limit=100&amp;target=Alex_Kov&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;namespace=6" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?offset=&amp;limit=100&amp;target=Alex_Kov&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;namespace=6" rel="nofollow">his images</a>). Involved articles include <a href="../../../s/v/i/Sviatoslav_I_of_Kiev_c88c.html" title="Sviatoslav I of Kiev">Sviatoslav I of Kiev</a> , <a href="../../../y/a/r/Yaroslav_I_the_Wise_2d39.html" title="Yaroslav I the Wise">Yaroslav I the Wise</a> , <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rurik_Dynasty_b162.html" title="Rurik Dynasty">Rurik Dynasty</a> and <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_I_of_Kiev_8f12.html" title="Vladimir I of Kiev">Vladimir I of Kiev</a> (in the latter he was also removing a photo from a historical monument as well as the dab on top</li>
<li>Finally, on the very same day something got to him to start a sterile rv war aimed at adding cat:Genocide to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodomor.html" title="Holodomor">Holodomor</a>. The latter issue has been discussed at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Talk%7EHolodomor_cf32.html" title="Talk:Holodomor">talk:Holodomor</a> to death and the current version reflects the outcome of that discussion that the article should reflect that some researchers consider it a Genocide but such a view is not as generally accepted as e. g. for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>. I am well involved on that article and I wrote much for it. I participated in lengths of discussions at the talk. I am intimately familiar with the state of the art in the research of the issue. The anon/sock was first reverting in silence and after multiple calls at several talk pages to talk, he defiantly stated that some laws exist that claim that Holodomor was indeed a Genocide. I pointed to him that no law can say such a thing. The law he probably means is the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Convention provides only a definition and does not list any specific cases. As such, it is up to scholars to agree or disagree on whether the definition fits a specific case. The scholarly debate is still unresolved as presented in the article. He did not respond and resorted to sterile reverting despite being warned multiple times.</li>
</ul>
<p>When finally Alex Bakharev blocked the editor who did nothing but disruption we get these strange "reviews", like the 14:27, 16 September 2006 (UTC) post by Tyrenius. More can be seen at anon's talks and <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex_Bakharev_c750.html#Holodomor" title="User talk:Alex Bakharev">User talk:Alex Bakharev#Holodomor</a>. The statement that "The net effect is that an editing decision has been achieved by force rather than argument," is plain incorrect. The article was simply restored to pre POV-push attempt that it reached through prolonged discussion and search by multiple editors. The "..don't be reckless" clause at <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">WP:BB</a> is there for a very good reason. I thoroughly agree with statements above that revert wars are harmful and useless and discussion should be always preferred but with certain editors it is imnpossible to discuss things. Editors who refuse to talk, ignore calls to read past discussions, refuse to use registered accounts and instead use multiple IPs to circumvent 3RR by such activity exhaust the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> guideline and need to be tought to become responsive if they can't be talked into that. If Tyrenius or anyone else has more questions on the matter, I am looking forward to hear from him. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 07:07, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I spent some time analysing not only the edits, but also the article talk page. Each situation has to be judged on its own merits. I am not suggesting a rigid rule that should be imposed everywhere. I am assessing whether this situation was conducted properly, and I find there are aspects which don't meet the standard we should aim for. Accusations of sockpuppetry are being made now: those things should have been addressed initially, not afterwards here, when the editor is not even able to participate. 3RR is never an excuse to get away with reverting 3 times: it is a barrier to reverting any more than three times. The spirit of this is that there should not be mindless edit wars.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am concerned that there was not dialogue, and that, even though the anon tried to initiate it,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alex_Bakharev&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76030276" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alex_Bakharev&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76030276" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> it was only responded to 2 minutes before he was then blocked. That is not something to be encouraged. The editors opposing him were relying on being able to escape the strict 3RR by having more reverts at their disposal. This is not in accord with the aim of the 3RR rule. That rule operates when there is a consensus to stop a rogue editor, but two editors is hardly a consensus. I don't find that this short but intense session of reverts over a single category in this way reflects well on any of the participants, especially when it is finally resolved by one of the involved editors blocking his opponent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Irpen's basis of argument is also questionable, as he has decided that the term "genocide" can only be agreed if scholars are united in its application, and that its use by governments is invalid. This, to say the least, is not definitive, but is now seen as the arbiter of consensus over the issue in this article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some of the arguments above have descended to <i>ad hominem</i> (and <i>pro hominem</i>). That is not the sign of a good argument. Let us address the points on their merit, not on who made them.</dd>

<dd>Tyrenius, with all due respect, it is not up to one individual to judge what is or not "in accord with the aim of the 3RR rule." The dialogue on that was established ages ago on the talk page, so if a rogue editor omits to read the dialogue, it's just about his problem.</dd>
<dd>And btw, the editor in question probably created socks to avoid the block, making his behaviour even more questionable. The issue was debated and is explained quite well in the "Was holodomor genocide?" section of the article. Being rogue does not prevent one from reading the damzor thing.</dd>
<dd>Consequently, I would rather not push things further and not run against a respectable and well-established policy.</dd>

If there is edit warring it is blockable with less reverts. The policy is the spirit of that, and not the letter of the law. I've made my points above, but if there is no consensus that they are of concern, then I'll leave it. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:32, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The whole purpose of 3rr is to let tempers cool down when a conflict between two people gets too heated. It is obvious to me that if others revert a particular user, we are dealing with an entirely different situation. Sometimes this happens with very obvious cases of vandalism or trolling. Sometimes it happens in more complicated situations. But no matter what, when it happens it is not because one person has lost his or her cool. Multiple people reverting a user is an example of the community at work.</p>
<p>Let's really look at this proposal to see how absurd it is. What is being suggested is this: once a person has been reverted three times, they are immune from being reverted. is this really the situation we want here? I do not think so.<a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 10:09, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What is being suggested is that 1RR is optimal followed by other solutions. This should involve discussion if the involved editors are in good faith. If there is a deliberate violation of consensus, then they can be warned for abusive behaviour and sanctioned if they persist. If thre is a sockpupper, then they can be blocked as such. I hope you find these suggestions less absurd. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 20:29, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tirenius, I find your suggestions not just non-absurd, but excellent. The problem isn't that what you say is wrong. It isn't! However, you are making a set of entirely correct statements but the problem is that they are not applicable to the particular case. 1RR is optimal, true. Non-reverting is even better. Discussing at talk between many editors with different views who are all acting in good faith in search of consensus is an ideal solution for an ideal world. This solution could not be applied in this case because the situation is different. The rogue user resorted to a series of sterile reverts using anon ip accounts. He repeatedly defied all attempts to engage him into any meaningful discussions. He was asked to log in which he also refused to do. Finally, he supplied his final revert with a frivolous statement that cannot be interpreted as a "discussion" but makes it clear that he either did not read the talk page where it was discussed or choose to simply disregard everything said there.</p>
<p>Socks are to be blocked in their own right. Users who resort to sterile reverts, then are asked to discuss, refuse to do so and persist with reverting are not proper candidates to have discussions with. In such case, there is nothing else to do but revert the user. That many users do so proves the consensus or at least violation of <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">WP:BB</a> "...but don't be reckless" clause. 3RR is by no means an entitlement. It is a guideline based on the principle that edit warring is harmful but discussions are preferable. However, you can't force the user into the discussion if he adamantly refuses to and ignores all the past discussions. There is nothing else left to do with such user but revert him, ask him many times to explain himself and, and if he persists with sterile revert wars, he's got to be blocked. 3RR is a very useful guideline <i>both</i> by a letter and by a spirit. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 22:00, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We've had thse farm to market roads since long before that AfD (I've checked one, and it survived an AfD in January 2005 with no consensus). So your example is invalid, and the idea that we have become "more inclusionist" is not reflected in policies or guidelines. There are some categories of articles where we have (sadly, IMO) become more inclusionist, to the point of dropping all questions of importance, notability, or even being somheow remarkable or exceptional, and where the only necessities are verifiablilty and NPOV. But for most articles, I don't have the impression that the "rules" have changed or that more articles are kept.

<p>Deleting this without discussion on the basis that it was "previously deleted content" is process over substance. It should not be speedily deleted on that basis.

What I'd like to do is generate a list of all PDPs that are older than, say, three months, and delete the lot of those (because I don't think most recreators are all that persistent in the first place). What would people think of that? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 10:35, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Absolutely, this is horrible clutter - and in some cases it's even blocking the creation of legitimate articles.

<dd>I'd say go for it. Most of the recreators are just bored schoolkids who will have wandered off elsewhere by the end of the day anyway. Deleting 3 month old deleteprotected pages should be no problem (even 1 month old should not be a problem in general), I think most of the "backlog" is simply due to the fact that most admins, myself included, just protect a page and then forget about it. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 11:35, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd also support this as long as a suitable time period is given (such as one to three months, per <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span>. While I don't want to name names, there is an administrator who is currently arbitrarily undoing these deleted pages with the edit summary "Old deleted-protected page unlikely to be recreated." The problem is that a number of the pages he/she is undoing were protected only days ago. While there is nothing wrong with getting rid of these pages once the risk of vandalism and such has passed, doing so after only a few days is a a waste of everyone's time. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 11:46, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well cl_timestamp is actually a field on the categorylinks database table, so I would suggest that this is actually being extracted rather than manually produced. That timestamp has its problems since IIRC it gets updated each time the page gets changed rather than when the category was added, however for this purpose that shouldn't be an issue... --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 13:15, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It's defenently possible, it requires accesss to the database though, and unfortunately the toolserver still doesn't have a working copy of the enwiki database. Guess the best bet is to download a dump of the categorylinks database (the most recent ones is only 6 days old as of now) and run some querries offline. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 13:31, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Some of these are protected after having been deleted for legal reasons and whatnot; perhaps we need another template (identical but for the category) for these? — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">talk</a> 20:02, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey, let's just keep them protected and redirect them all to bad title or something similar. A template could be used to categorize such redirects for later perusal, in fact it could even be the same template we're using now. —<tt class="plainlinks"><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Freakofnurture_77c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Freakofnurture">freak</a>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>)</b></tt> 21:09, Sep. 17, 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'd say that rather than making feature requests, our easiest solution is to delete most of those pages.

<p>It would make sense for someone to go through and clear out the old ones, but it is absolutely essential that we maintain a list of these pages somewhere so that we can, in the future, look over it to see which redlinks turned blue and determine if the recreation was valid.

<li>Also, you can watchlist deleted pages, and they'll show up if recreated.

<li>A watchlist doesn't do nearly the same thing because: it only works for one person not everyone; if multiple people are deleting these protected deleted pages then no single person will have the list; and watchlists are generally used for lots of other stuff, and if you aren't editing for over a day or so, you will totally miss it. Thus, it is essential that we create a page somewhere where we list all of these protected deleted pages that are deleted so <i>everyone</i> can keep an eye on the redlinks that turn blue and make sure that it is valid content. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 02:42, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Having a list of deleted deleted-protected pages might be over-kill unless it can be done extremely easily; most are not re-created and when they do they seem to be mostly found, and then that's just another backlog that has to be cleared of dead items. Keep in mind also that many of these topics actually do warrant articles, mostly for <i>different</i> persons other than the one that was deleted. That's the main reason for getting rid of these deleted pages. There are so few relative to the number of articles that readers getting them on a Random article is not a significant problem, but when you have major political figures, etc. blocked because some bozo with a similar name created a vanity page in a space of 2 minutes 6 months ago, that is a problem.</p>
<p>The list we currently have at <a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotepho_reports_deleted_page_by_cl_timestamp_0ec8.html" title="User:Kotepho/reports/deleted page by cl timestamp">User:Kotepho/reports/deleted page by cl timestamp</a> will last at least for the deletedpages until 8-10-2006. Whereas bots are necessary to do things on a daily basis, this list doesn't absolutely <i>need</i> to be created more than once a month really. It would be nice though to have it automatically created.</p>
<p>Another way to help out with deletedpages is through <a href="../../../s/h/o/Special%7EShortpages_8301.html" title="Special:Shortpages">Special:Shortpages</a>. Recently protected deletedpages show up there (mostly at 15 bytes). If the page was created in the space of an hour 4 days ago, delete. If it looks like it's a little more chronic problem, append a little comment that pushes it off the list, like &lt;!--Excess long comment to prevent listing on [[Special:Shortpages]]............................................................--&gt;. This <i>is</i> an automatically generated list and is cutting down the backlog from the other end, as well as doing it from the Kotepho list. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 03:23, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The rule of thumb I've been using whether to keep them protected is whether the amount of time between the first deletion and the last deletion is longer than the amount of time between the last deletion and now, with leeway if someone has talked about creating a legitimate article on the talk page.

<p>I have been JarlaxleArtemis' principle mentor for the last several months. During that time there have been many complaints and instances of JA repeating the specific behaviors which led to his previous bannings. Since this new ban has been placed on him he has once again acted in an immature manner. His negative inputs have exceeded his positive contributions, and I regret having to endorse this ban. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 05:37, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Admins, over the last few days I have run into trouble with <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">User:Jim62sch</a> on the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> article. Our actual disagreement is about whether to include certain comments or not: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pope_Benedict_XVI&amp;diff=76035397&amp;oldid=76033506" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pope_Benedict_XVI&amp;diff=76035397&amp;oldid=76033506" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>]. I opposed this as I think the comments uninformative and bloating the section, while he readded them time and again. But the real problem with him is that he does not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> when I state my reasons for removing them, instead accuses me of trying to "censor" or "whitewash", and is extremely <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">uncivil</a> in trying to use my religious persuasion, which I did indicate on my user page to ban me from editing in this issue. He has made similar remarks towards <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">User:Musical Linguist</a>, when she commented on the issue. Now, I want to be clear that I am not aiming at Jim being blocked or anything like this. I am sure he is a valuable contributor.

<dd>This is a content dispute. Please take it to <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a>. Jim is acting in his capacity as editor, not admin here. Please note that revert-warring is not endorsed as a way of resolving content disputes. While the relevance of individual criticisms may be debatable, there is no doubt that at this moment the controversy in question is headline news around the world and we need to give a flavour of that.

<p><a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERFM_dd02.html" title="WP:RFM">Requests for mediation</a> seems to have ground to a halt. There are 30 cases listed pending decisions to accept or reject, about 10 accepted cases that have not been assigned, and no substantive edits to the page in almost 2 months. Essjay, current chair of Medcom, hasn't edited anything in a month. I don't personally have anything pending but I noticed this through comments on Essjay's talk page, which I have watchlisted. Are there some former mediators who can take over temporarily and get things moving along again? It seems like a big part of the dispute resolution process is not functioning at the moment. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:44, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not part of Medcom, but I've watched how they worked in the past, and I'm kind of wandering aimlessly looking for a Wikipurpose at the moment. If X number of admins are willing to sign off on it, I'd be happy to step in on an interim basis to do the clerical work and try to stir up the active Medcom members to elect someone else. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 01:44, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, Medcom is kind of a closed club, with a closed mailing list and special procedures for accepting new members. I'm kind of hoping one of the mediators emeriti listed on the page will jump in as acting chair and get things going. If on the other hand there is no action in a few days and you fell like being bold, the worst thing that can happen is you'll stir someone else to action. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:54, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wonder if I might stir someone else to toss me into arbitration. Heh, could be interesting, couldn't it? I'll watch the page; if nothing at all happens after a few days, I'll come back and seek some sort of semiofficial sanction for my coup attempt. Hopefully they'll take care of it on their own, but it's already been an awfully long time for all those Medcom members to just sit on their hands, waiting for a sign from somewhere else. If nothing else, it's a sign that a couple of new rules should be enacted about the workflow, IMHO. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 02:02, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi. First of all, I'd like to thank you for covering for <a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User:^demon">^demon</a> in the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_Lost_episodes_478f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Lost episodes">Lost episodes mediation</a>. I know its technically against procedure for someone who is neither a member nor a nominee of the MedCom to take MedCom cases, but considering the circumstances, I'm glad you did.</dd>
<dd>As for who should accept/reject cases, it was my understanding that MedCom came to some sort of consensus (presumably by mailing list), and some member of the committee (which for some reason always happens to be Essjay) accepted/rejected the case on behalf of the committee as a whole. But, not having been on the committee for very long, I've never actually been part of this process, so maybe I have it all wrong.</dd>
<dd>There are six cases listed as "unassigned" on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_Open_Tasks_311f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Open Tasks">open tasks</a>, and of those, three have received offers from a mediator (two from <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrini_e6be.html" title="User:Drini">Drini</a>, one from me), but are still pending agreement of the parties to that mediator. If there are accepted cases missing from that list, maybe you could add them? Or I could try looking around.</dd>

<dd>Hello as well. To start, I do apologize for the current backlog in mediation cases. As mentioned above, Essjay, who is our chair and does invaluable work, has currently been busy and inactive for a while now; I, too, have also been too busy to do much until recently. This has led to a large number of cases piled up - we've been postponing the (now) inevitable task of finding someone in the committee to temporarily do his duties. I will personally address these issues on our mailing list — it is our goal to serve the community, and we need to get the ball rolling again. Again, apologies for our lack of activity. In addition, I encourage any trusted users who wish to help to <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">join us</a>: we always are looking for new mediators to help us! Finally, a word of great thanks to the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">Mediation Cabal</a> and other groups for doing their best in helping resolve disputes.

<dd><i>Three Admins have enforced the block, one was responsible for imposing it and another was on the receiving end of one of my comments which was deemed incivil in this circumstance. I do not dispute the findings of the arbitration case, but if you analysed my two comments since, they were not personal attacks so I am paying heed to the findings of the case. Furthermore, I am sorry that only 190 edits are too paltry a number for you reflect kindly on but some us have a busy day job too and a social life after work. Is that understood? Good.</i></dd>

<dd>He's currently indefinitely blocked. The block he returned from was mine, and I don't think it's coincidence that shortly after he was blocked there were a couple of anonymous edits to my page from someone obsessed with gay sex and using an Irish dialup account. There was also a pathetically transparent attempt at sockpuppetry to evade the block, not his first attempt at that sort of thing. See <a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.77.181.16.html" title="User:62.77.181.16">User:62.77.181.16</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarsweep_96f7.html" title="User:Starsweep">User:Starsweep</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Bazzajf_8a57.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Bazzajf">Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Bazzajf</a>.

<p>My feeling is that this project will be a better place without Bazzajf. From my first encounter with him where he was changing another user's userpage because some userbox there said "This user is from the British Isles" and that was apparently "horribly POV against Irish", which quickly devolved into him ranting "Syrthiss is a byword for inept!" on my talkpage (in archive 5's history now). He has troubles with civility, harassment, and wikilawyering. Someone could offer to mentor him, but I don't think he'd listen to the mentor and they'd end up blocking him again. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 22:20, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been trying to find a way to discuss some textual changes to the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Special%7ECategories_101d.html" title="Special:Categories">Special:Categories</a> page, but it (obviously) doesn't have a talk page. After some investigation, I found an old discussion <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia_talk%7ESpecial_pages_376b.html#Discussing_Special_pages" title="Wikipedia talk:Special pages">here</a> noting that some (but not all) Special pages indeed have custom talk pages.

Shall we go ahead and create custom talk pages for those Special pages which lack them?</p>
<p>Further, how do changes in Special pages actually occur? Back to my original concern, I'd like to change the opening text on <a href="../../../c/a/t/Special%7ECategories_101d.html" title="Special:Categories">Special:Categories</a> to state "This is <i>an alphabetical</i> list of all the categories in Wikipedia."

He's adding links to a commercial website all over the place, but some of them seem to link to actual information and not just to the commercial part of the site. I've removed the blatantly commercial links, but I'm uncertain as to the validity of the others. I'd appreciate another set of eyes.

<p>Approximately ten days ago, I made a request for the unprotection of this page at <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> so that I could remove comments made by an indefinitely banned vandal while he was banned, per <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBanning_policy_2e63.html#Enforcement_by_reverting_edits" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">Wikipedia:Banning_policy#Enforcement_by_reverting_edits</a>-- see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Dr_Chatterjee_e360.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Dr Chatterjee">Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Dr_Chatterjee</a>. So far, the request has been neither granted nor denied. Since retaining comments made by an indefinitely banned vandal while he was banned seems to encourage other such users to violate their bans, how would one go about getting this page unprotected? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 01:46, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In this case, the disruption from the banned user has already occurred and removing the comments that are integral to an existing archive would cause more disruption than their remaining and would gut the archive. The person already got his laughs; selectively removing the comments isn't going nullify the effect of him violating his ban. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:50, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course the comments by the banned vandal have already had some effect, but preserving the trolling contained in these comments indefinitely would seem to magnify their impact -- the comments were offered in a deliberate attempt to disrupt Wikipedia by weakening its defenses against vandalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADr_Chatterjee&amp;diff=73996504&amp;oldid=73984072" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADr_Chatterjee&amp;diff=73996504&amp;oldid=73984072" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. Avoidance of future disruption that might flow from these comments seems far more important than preserving the coherence of an archived MFD discussion initiated by a banned user. It might actually be advisable to delete all revisions of the discussion that contain the comments, to prevent them from being reinstated later. In any case, as <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a> protected this page himself, I wanted a "second opinion" on this matter. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 02:10, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see a lot of this "remove comments by banned users" stuff. I understand what people are saying, but this is tantamount to violating free speech. The implication is that Wikipedia users can't think for themselves, and will be 'contaminated' by what banned users say. You really should have more faith in the Wiki process to reject arguments that are wrong. If they are wrong, then people will point out why they are wrong. If they are correct, then the points should remain there, regardless of whether they are by a banned user or not. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> censorship.

<dd>Is this like how you can't 'see' your own eyes? Funny that, when I look in the mirror, I have no trouble seeing my eyes. Now what <i>is</i> difficult to see is the <i>inside</i> of the body. Yucky imges of the internal anatomy of the body would be a great boon to Wikipedia. Sadly, it seems all such images are copyrighted on medical websites. And medical students are probably not allowed to photograph the dissections they do. So most of the Wikipedia articles on internal body anatomy have drawings (usually the Grey's Anatomy ones).

<p>I have reviewed lots of human anatomy articles, and the general state of the articles is if the object is on the outside of the body and easily photographed, then someone has uploaded a photograph to Wikipedia. Unfortunately, many of these are of very poor standard, and would be laughed out of any publishing house or professional photography review forum. I would say that drawings are better until people can produce better images (better composition, better lighting, etc). At the moment, it just looks very amateurish. <i>"Look! We can photograph this thing so we have - aren't we clever?"</i> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 10:40, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

How is this issue in any way different from images of a penis or of breasts in their respective articles? Anatomy articles generally include an image of the relevant anatomical features. Why does this discussion focus on the correctness of including this image, instead of on the repeated and largely unexplained removal of this image by anonymous editors? The edit war referred to in the title should be the topic of discussion here. Please discuss the quality and nature of the image at <a href="../../../a/n/u/Talk%7EAnus_31c5.html" title="Talk:Anus">Talk:Anus</a>. Thank you. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 16:23, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am generalising to try and pin down an "anatomy" policy. It is already obvious that external body shots are included only because it is possible for amateur photographers to do so, with no thoughts for anatomical presentation. They tend to point the camera and click, and then think their pic of whatever is great. Most times the verdict should be "send back to photographer - try harder next time". If you were preparing an anatomy encyclopedia, you would commission a set of consistent pictures of human anatomy, both external and internal. Unfortunately, the Wikipedia way is to throw together a <a href="../../../h/o/d/Hodge-podge.html" title="Hodge-podge">hodge-podge</a> of pictures from multiple sources, with precious little organisation.</dd>
<dd>As for the edit war, yes, that should be addressed, and hopefully an admin will come along and help you. Sorry for going off-topic. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 18:02, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After a period of intense brouhaha including legal threats, forum shopping, <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a>, indefinite blockings and all the other accoutrements of low drama Wikipedia style, we finally have cautious agreement from the Foundation to write a neutral biography on this minor figure in British right-wing politics.</p>
<p>The latest act in this little play, though, is a message to <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">User:Edchilvers</a> stating that the subject is suffering from a very serious illness. Given that the neutral statement of certain facts (check the talk page archive) apparently causes the subject great distress, and taking the information and request at face value, it would seem to be decently respectful to stub or delete the article. Frankly I don't think this person's notability is worth the effort expended and I am all for deleting it anyway, but impassioned defence earlier in its life makes this a controversial move.</p>
<p>So: the matter of principle haivng been settled (yes we should paint the picture warts and all), should the matter of ordinary human decency now come into play here? My immediate reaction is that it should, and Ed Chilvers (who God knows has no reason to love Lauder-Frost) also seems persuaded.

Just to clarify since we don't seem to have a wiki article on the term yet (and I'm not convinced its notable enough for me to write a stub about) a goseis(sp? in English) is a person who in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halachah.html" title="Halachah">halachah</a> is so close to dying to that we don't interfere with them in any way lest we hasten their death. The metaphor might be a bit weak. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:57, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What does his illness have to do with whether or not we write an accurate biography about him? If he's so sick that he's going to die next week, and wants us to wait until after his death to write the bio, that's one thing, but I don't think that's what he's claiming. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 02:02, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wish Mr. Lauder-Frost a full recovery. In the light of his serious illness, I am surprised that the subject has time or inclination to bother with this article. However, I suggest that he does not read it, if it causes distress to him. If material is in the public domain, then it is too late to put Pandora back into the box. I would also request editors to handle discussions, as on this page, with suitable sensitivity as we are talking about a living person. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:24, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Amen. Being ill is bad. It has nothing to do with anything else, though, and his illness would only mean that he personally has trouble editing Wikipedia. Since he really shouldn't be editing his own article anyway, the illness is irrelevant to the article. I'm sure that we all wish him well, however. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 09:43, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seem that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Robert_Fuller" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Robert_Fuller" rel="nofollow">Robert Fuller</a> (and his IP&#160;: 154.20.46.132 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/154.20.43.99" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/154.20.43.99" rel="nofollow">154.20.43.99</a>) is a pure provocative vandal playing with wiki-commons democratic rules. He upload only sex files on commons (In fact probably his own sex).<br />
<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/user_talk:Robert_Fuller" class="extiw" title="commons:user_talk:Robert_Fuller">My own enquiry</a> show that Robert Fuller use at less this 3 "accounts" to spread his dozen of sex pictures accross wikipedias. His contributions are <b>only and at 100%</b> to spread this sex pictures across the wiki en/pt/es/it/fr/ca/vi. Then, he come back to commons-deletion page saying <i>"Look, wikipedians use my pics&#160;: you can't delete it."</i> His strategy is pretty good and he will probably do so again.<br />
I have the conviction that this user know what he is doing, play with our rules, and upload such ambigius sex files [<b>and only this</b>] <b>with the clear aim</b> to launch edition wars and to hurt wikipedia's reputation.<br />
Seeing a strategy like that when many others work to build a good wikipedia, I think this user and his IP have to be block on every wiki, that his pic should be move into the talk_pages, and then let other users peacely choice if these pics are need or not. I encourage administrators to do so (block him + move pics). Do nothing means "Welcome Robert Fuller".<br />

<p>I am the editor who created and developed the page "<a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_vs._Wade_for_Men_2a70.html" title="Roe vs. Wade for Men">Roe vs. Wade for Men</a>". <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua">User:Interlingua</a> found the page and (correctly) tried to change the name to "<a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_v._Wade_for_Men_185b.html" title="Roe v. Wade for Men">Roe v. Wade for Men</a>". However, he did this using a redirect rather than a rename. He expresses <a href="../../../r/o/e/Talk%7ERoe_v._Wade_for_Men_3cc3.html" title="Talk:Roe v. Wade for Men">here</a> his concern that by using the redirect, the history of the page did not move to the new name. I also share that concern because the work I did in creating the page is not listed in the history with the new name. We both would like the change made (see <a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html#Did_I_Make_a_Mistake_on_My_Redirect_Page" title="User talk:Interlingua">our discussion</a>), but based on what I could determine by reading <a href="../../../m/o/v/WP%7EMOVE_8a50.html" title="WP:MOVE">WP:MOVE</a>, we would need an administrator to do so.</p>
<p>There have only been two edits since the redirect: the adding of italics by Interlingua and one small typo correction. If someone could please remove the current <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_v._Wade_for_Men_185b.html" title="Roe v. Wade for Men">Roe v. Wade for Men</a> and then rename the version of <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_vs._Wade_for_Men_2a70.html" title="Roe vs. Wade for Men">Roe vs. Wade for Men</a> from before the redirect to "Roe v. Wade for Men", it would be very much appreciated, and it would be something over which there is a consensus among everyone involved.</p>
<p>Then, the two edits would have to be made and a redirect from <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_vs._Wade_for_Men_2a70.html" title="Roe vs. Wade for Men">Roe vs. Wade for Men</a> to the renamed <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_v._Wade_for_Men_185b.html" title="Roe v.

<p>I can't believe that even with semi-protection, that there was an absolutely ridiculous section on "Habbo Raids". That kind of bullshit is saved for crap like encyclopedia dramatica, they're just forum invasions of a chat room. You have 4chan clowns and YTMND and encyclopedia dramatica people trying to spam their forum invasions, and even the established editors there don't seem to care. I also removed an image advertising 4chan's noble events from the article, that image is Image:Habboraid11sep.PNG.

<p>Several users are continuously attempting to make far-reaching changes to this important WP guideline, which can have very disruptive effects for Wikipedia. While the discussion on the talk page now got difficult to follow for non-participants (and some participants as well), the major problem now is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AExternal_links&amp;diff=74841426&amp;oldid=74389238" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AExternal_links&amp;diff=74841426&amp;oldid=74389238" rel="nofollow">self-appointed edit</a> by one of the users, which he refuses to revert, and a group of users hampers all effort to restore the original form of the guideline.

<p>Can an admin take a look at this AfD and make a decision on it? It's a bit of a wild one, with only a few actual votes (most of them for deletion), and a whole ton of followers of the article's subject making long, rambling arguments about how it's notable because of it's growth, and not offering any verfiable evidence on this religious movement's notability. Not sure if the lack of votes means it should be relisted, or if a decision can be made on the article. Just would like to have this matter closed considering it's way past the 5-day period to discuss an AfD. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">[<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">contribs</a>]</font> 03:19, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am sorry, I am very, very green and I doubt I am doing this correctly, but there it is.</p>
<p>This user is a spammer: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Desg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Desg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Desg</a></p>
<p>All his contributions are adding his commercial links to Wiki pages.</p>
<p>In particular, on this page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stained_glass" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stained_glass" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stained_glass</a></p>
<p>He has removed a very valuable link about stained glass restoration and replaced it with a link to his newly formed forum. He has added a very plain stained glass window of his in the middle of the world's best examples, with a link to his commercial site.</p>
<p>On this page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_came_and_copper_foil_glasswork" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_came_and_copper_foil_glasswork" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_came_and_copper_foil_glasswork</a></p>
<p>He added a link to a tool he sells and did a similar trick with the external links as he did for the page above.</p>
<p>Most importantly, after the pages were restored, he promptly returned to spam the Wiki pages again, and added his spammy links once more.</p>
<p>I understand there is some sort of warning system but I am not confident enough to do this, I cannot be sure I will do it right.</p>
<p>I would appreciate if someone could oversee this matter. Thank you.</p>

<p>Presently he seems to be testing the limits of tolerance of Wikipedians regarding linking to his website.

Given his past behavior I suspect he is curious as to how many times he can insert his link outside of the "External Links" sections before being warned. I also suspect he is venting his frustration about being caught spamming with a NPOV dispute on this page <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead_came_and_copper_foil_glasswork.html" title="Lead came and copper foil glasswork">Lead_came_and_copper_foil_glasswork</a>.

<p>Hi. I'd like to ask my fellow admins for some advice. It has been demonstrated, after months of discussion and research both here and at Commons, that our reasoning behind <a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-USSR_abc6.html" title="Template:PD-USSR">Template:PD-USSR</a> was wrong. People interested in the ins and outs of the copyright issue can read the template talk pages here and at Commons. Some of the images so classified are PD for other reasons, some of them we will need to claim <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> on. The admin issue is that there is a small number of users who believe that the copyright issue is irrelevant and that the cleanup project is politically motivated (as I understand the complaint -- there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Lupo" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Lupo" rel="nofollow">an incoherent RfC on the subject</a>). What I want to see happen is that the template be changed to explain the problem, so that we begin resorting all of the effected images and, importantly, not acquire any more of them. Any such change to the template, however, is going to be reverted. Given the situation, should I protect the template on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:PD-USSR&amp;oldid=77195682" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:PD-USSR&amp;oldid=77195682" rel="nofollow">the explanatory version</a>, or do we continue to go on giving bad copyirght information because editors who don't care about the copyright issue have set up camp at the template and will edit war, or do I write a "please come help us" letter to <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrad_Patrick_1861.html" title="User:Brad Patrick">User:Brad Patrick</a> or <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">User:Jimbo Wales</a>?

<dd>You can ask, but there is something that people rarely keep in mind that needs saying. Brad doesn't work for us. He works for Jimbo and the Board, and exists to help keep the Foundation out of legal trouble. There are many legal questions that we could desire to ask him where publicly providing his interpretation of the law, either in support or in opposition, has the potential to expose the Foundation to greater liability than if he simply did not answer. The reason is that providing an opinion pierces the seperation between the Foundation and the community, and it is exactly that seperation that is in many cases the best shield that the Foundation has against suits brought because of editors' actions. If trying to help us could expose the Foundation to greater legal liability, then I have every expectation that he will ignore us (and rightfully so). Hence, while you can ask (and the answer might be informative), I think it is unlikely that Brad will actually step in to try and settle this (or any other) copyright question. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 21:54, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>My thanks to Lupo, Jkelly, Zscout and others for doing something proactive about this. As a general rule, I think we owe it to ourselves and reusers to ensure that copyright tags are unambiguously correct. In my opinion, any tag that draws such protracted dispute should have been taken out of circulation long ago, even before reaching a final conclusion about its objective truth. This goes a small way toward plugging the mess of holes in Wikipedia's treatment of foreign copyrights. (Probably the biggest hole is the assumption that being in the public domain in the country of origin is always a sufficient condition to be in the public domain in the US.) <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 21:10, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My first suggestions, as what Carnildo has done, is to prevent new images that could be used under this template from being used. My plan of action is to go after the duplicates, the orphans and the clear-cut casses (such as post 1973 images, I found a few of those.) Anything during the GPW should be looked at with care, since there could be PD items and some not free items. I also would begin to get rid of orphans or begin to launch emails to websites. I do not expect this taking a few days, but not everything has to be nuked. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 01:16, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have asked the editor to stop for now and have suggested that a proposal be made for the changes on the Village Pump. Report back if the changes continue, as I'll be asleep soon. If I understand it correctly, he or she is upset with the prominence given to the Swedish names of Finnish cities and has unbolded or removed them from various articles. I am unfamiliar with the subject. Is there a reason why the Swedish names are included? Are they often used in Finland or in English speaking countries? If there is not a good reason, I think they should be removed. <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> is known by various names in other languages (see <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exonym_and_endonym.html" title="Exonym and endonym">exonym and endonym</a>), but only the English version is given in the article. In other cases, however, the editor is adding the Finnish names to articles on Finnish cities. Do some Finnish cities have foreign names that are more well known than their Finnish names? Is there a movement to rename Finnish cities that have foreign names? This type of change is also being reverted by other editors. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 13:45, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Mr. Gastrich's inability to concede LBU's lack of meaningful accreditation as a problem because of x, y and z (for example, notable guest speakers at LBU); is an unfortunate indication he has firmly held POV's that aren't reconcilable with being a constructive Wikipedian. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 21:24, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

In every case, the <i><b>unbelievers</b> wanted sensational, ridiculous, unencyclopedic, and in many cases incorrect information included</i> and some others and I insisted on including the truth and excluding that nonsense. This opposition met us head on and I was eventually banned for one year. <i>I don't see myself returning to Wikipedia because I have shaken the dust from my shoes</i>. In fact, we even decided to end the Wiki4Christ.com web site that was sending Christians to Wikipedia. <i>It is an awful place for Christians who sincerely want the truth fairly represented</i>." All emphasis added was by me. So, if Wikipedia is an "awful place for Christians" such as Gastrich, why would he want to return? Notice that Gastrich implicitely denies using sockpuppets in the same commentary. Regardless, Gastrich has had a few unkind things to say about Wikipedia since his expulsion, and that includes recent comments. Those were certainly "sour grapes," but they're enough to bring his sincerity into question. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 18:28, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Interesting, wiki4christ.com now redirects to Jason's own ministry. Why am I not surprised. Such issues aside, one of the reasons I supported the final indef ban was the complete unacceptability of using an outside source to attempt to get outside help target and overwhelm articles here. If he has stopped doing so, for whatever reason, that is a good sign. Unfortunately, the reasons he gives for stopping in no way indicate he will be at all a helpful Wikipedian. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:58, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>During the discussion in arbitration, Gastrich wrote, "I'm going to avoid Wikipedia for awhile. However, I am going to encourage everyone I know to continue contributing. Therefore, don't expect to be hearing from me, but <i>expect to be hearing from them</i> [emphasis added]." The community certainly <i>did</i> hear from "them," didn't it? It might be especially noteworthy that Gastrich denied using sockpuppets during the arbitration discussion, and also on his "response" site, but then seems to tacitly admit doing them, according to what was related by Stifle at the beginning of this thread. This wouldn't be the first time that Gastrich has changed his story so that he might accomplish whatever it is that he wants to accomplish. What is clear is that he saw the problems at Wikipedia as being one of those who believe as he does being in battle with "unbelievers." He's posted that sort of commentary a few times since his expulsion, and it's clear from those comments that he <i>still</i> believes that. That should be taken into consideration during any discussion of a lifting of a ban that was imposed with good cause by the consideration of good evidence. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 18:28, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cape_Town_658c.html" title="University of Cape Town">University of Cape Town</a> has a course called Eco3025: Applied International Trade Bargaining. It is a simulation of a <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Organization_3f67.html" title="World Trade Organization">WTO</a> <a href="../../../d/o/h/Doha_Round_6a0f.html" title="Doha Round">Doha Round</a> negotiation (people are divided into countries and then compete with each other.

I think this is last year's information, but you get the idea). It is a course I've done &amp; tutored and it is <i>extremely</i> competitive (people have stormed out, ended friendships, punched each other etc.).</p>
<p>In any case, I was just chatting to a friend doing the course at the moment &amp; she informs me at least one person (possibly more) have sneakily vandalised a number of countries' articles on Wikipedia in order to sabotage their competition (i.e. students rely on the information on Wikipedia, so some devious person has deliberately added FALSE information to gain a competitive edge). She adds this guy says the information has not yet been fixed and added that he claims to have edited all the top ten countries by GDP (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_aeea.html" title="List of countries by GDP (PPP)">List of countries by GDP (PPP)</a>). These edits began sometime in early August.</p>
<p>So... we're looking for anon edits to these articles since August that have altered economic or political aspects on the article of countries that are top ten by GDP. If it helps, I suspect most of these edits would have come from the UCT computer system. Here are some ips I know to originate from that system (as these were my ip edits when I edited from UCT): 155.232.250.19, 155.232.250.51, 155.232.250.35. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkerpikker_c3cf.html" title="User:Mikkerpikker">Mi<font color="darkred">kk</font>er</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkerpikker_77de.html" title="User talk:Mikkerpikker"><sup>(...)</sup></a> 23:48, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure where to express my concerns, so am choosing here.</p>
<p>Inspection of the suite of articles showing the various theories, counter theories, conspiracy theories etc will show a hugely controversial area of accusations of propaganda, calls for the truth to be heard, and much "oddness" which is more of a discussion forum than an encyclopaedia.</p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/n/_/911%7E_In_Plane_Site_5078.html" title="911: In Plane Site">911: In Plane Site</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_demolition_hypothesis_for_the_collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_8913.html" title="Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center">Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center</a></li>
<li>Wikipedia:Association of 9/11 All Sides Editors</li>
</ul>
<p>and their corresponding deletion discussion pages.</p>
<p>To me it seems odd that this appears to be a partisan issue, human nature apart, since the various theories, counter theories and conspiracy theories are all a legitimate part of the same phenomenon, thus all within scope for encyclopaedic and neutral documentation.</p>
<p>I have no idea if there is a process for uninvolved admins to review both the actions of the participants and the various deletion review pages to ensure that guidance is given, where appropriate, to heavily involved editors on topics ranging from civility to editing and opining within the various Wikipedia policies, and also to ensuring that the closing admin (or admins) is (are) completely non-partisan in this set of issues when a deletion has been requested.</p>

<dd>Perhaps ongoing administrator oversight would be helpful to ensure that no one is allowed to import any partisan or nationalistic edits to these articles? The edit histories as well as the comments on the various AfDs are littered with what appear to be extremely nationalistic reasonings, which have no place. · <font color="#0518A7"><b>XP</b></font> · 02:46, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We need to be very clear, here. In this issue I think neither "side" is blameless. Indeed some of us who have attempted simply to take a policy based and neutral view are probably not blameless either. By raising this here I have hoped to highlight this to our most experienced and impartial admins, knowing that I also may have made contentious comments. My entire point is that we must all be open to community scrutiny, and the article(s) are the better for it if we are correctly scrutinised.</dd>
<dd>I believe we have a large enough pool of admins who both have sufficient experience of Wikipedia policies and guidelines and who have absolutely no interest in the subject matter of these articles in order to bring some order to what is currently a battleground</dd>
<dd>The most important thing in this discussion is to take a step back and look at our own comments with care, despite what we may perceive as provocation. We have metrics to judge what should and should not be included, and I believe we must stick to the wholeheartedly. The current situation simply saddens me. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 12:33, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These 9/11 articles are fought over between conspiracy people and people who are they complete opposite... maybe they believe there's no conspiracy... maybe they work for the government. All in all it's just point of view pushing both ways--the people who fight to have the information and those who don't have just want to push their POVs and they should be handled like that. It's not like the person who nominated the articles you listed above works for CIA or homeland security. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 00:18, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What you and many others continue to miss is the mere inclusion of an article on a topic in and of itself does not constitute POV pushing. Using XfD to delete everything you disagree with, does. Its just that simple. --<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShortfuse_4fcc.html" title="User:Shortfuse">Shortfuse</a> 00:37, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What the great majority of people appear to miss is that the documenting of the point of view of other people is not the same as documenting one's own point of view. And this is part of my concern.</dd>
<dd>As examples:
<ol>
<li>were I to say that, <u>in my opinion</u> all green haired people should be shot on sight, that is my point of view and I am pushing it.</li>
<li>However, if I were to say that, <u>according to the following reputable sources</u>, the following people, some of whom may and others of whom may not be notable in their own right, say that all green haired people should be shot on sight, then I create an article as part of a suite of articles on green haired people that is encyclopaedic.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>The difference is very clear, and very simple to understand. Example 1 is meet for deletion, or editing to remove my personal viewpoint, arguably original research. Example 2 is probably controversial, but is factual, supportable by the facts, is notable and has its notability asserted by references. It should remain.</dd>
<dd>If a person argues for the deletion of example 2, especially if they do so vociferously, then it can be argued clearly that they are seeking to stifle genuine encyclopaedic work. An extension of this, assuming they have not simply made an error in understanding, is that they have their own agenda, which may be to remove all comments against green haired people.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose I should state that I have occasionally used green hair gel and that I am not in any way opposed to green haired people, nor do I believe that they should be shot on sight. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 10:09, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In case it is not obvious, in Example 2, if any of the sources are not reputable, then those sources either should not be quoted as citations, or should be grouped as "sources which do not pass the reputability test, but which endorse this opinion". In other words, "Editing the article is ok". <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 10:15, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So then there should be many conspiracy articles about 9/11 simply so a single article does not become too long. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 10:32, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No. I have never said that and I will never say it.</dd>
<dd>There should be sufficient and correct documentation of this phenomenon, both the atrocity and the phenomenon of the conspiracy theories. But the cornerstone is that the material about any part of the 9/11 incidents should be verifiable, citable, and notable.</dd>
<dd>Where it is necessary to split an article because it is unwieldy and is suitable for splitting, that is a normal and healthy clerical process, and it is absolutely removed from any discussions about points of view. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 10:37, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

So, if anyone has the time, could you please: 1) Check the AfD and either give it a thumbs up for a few days' more discussion or make a decision and close it (it was originally listed September 20); and 2) Let me know whether I did the right thing here or not. If the closing admin says the decision is to "merge", then that's a binding decision, isn't it? And thus, by her closure, did she not nullify all the "merge" votes in that AfD out-of-process?

<p>Deleting is an administrative process. Merging is an editorial process. AFD is designed to address an administrative question, namely "Should this article be deleted?" Merge decisions are not binding in AFD, simply because merge decisions are editorial rather than administrative, and AFD is not intended to address editorial questions. When I close AFD discussions which have a consensus of "Merge," my closing note is always something to the effect of "The consensus is to <b>not delete</b> this article. Interested parties are cordially invited to merge this article with any other relevant articles as the mood strikes them." or something of that nature. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a>|<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yakkity yak</a></sub></font> 15:41, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Zeraeph is currently under suspension and will probably be permanently banned for constant Wiki violations and verbally attacking others. She has a long known history for persecuting and ridiculing experts. She herself is a malignant narcissist. She and her sockpuppets are very poisonous. She obviously worked Sam Vaknin up into a frenzy as he got to perceive Wikipedia in general in the same way as Zeraeph as for a while Zeraeph had full backing from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I am not in Sam Vaknin's fan club. My website barely even mentions him. He is a self professed narcissist but not a malignant one. He still runs two support groups for victims of narcissism and is generally respected on the internet. Like him or loathe him he is an important authority in the field of narcissism. I am trying to make improvements to the Workplace Bullying and related Wiki entries. There are a variety of experts relevant to this but I really find it necessary to refer to Sam Vaknin's work as one such expert. To be consistent with the way the other experts are treated (such as Robert Hare, Heinz Leymann and Tim Field with their own Wiki entries) it is not consistent for Sam Vaknin not to have his own page. NPOV in itself would be enough reason for Sam Vaknin to have his page back.</p>
<p>Is any mention of Sam Vaknin automatically forbidden in a Wiki entry even if a reference to his work is justifed in context, say, in bullying or narcissism Wiki entries&#160;?</p>
<p>Has no-one worked out yet that what Zeraeph claimed were Sam Vaknin's sockpuppets were most likely Zeraeph's own sockpuppets&#160;? --<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenbat_0359.html" title="User:Penbat">Penbat</a> 10:12, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You seem to be missing the point, OKmrGhey, using sockpuppets to evade a ban is prohibited, so no one is forcing them to do that. There's proper channels to appeal a block and it's not using sockpuppets. Also, if you want any sympathy, accusing admins of sockpuppetry is not the way to go. If people act similarly, they're not neccesarily sockpuppets, they could also be (more likely in this case) all be looking out for Wikipedia's well-being. Also, there's the difference that Herbert's sockpuppetry was proven through technical means. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:00, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi guys! I just unblocked <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">User:Miskin</a> who recently received a 24 hour block from <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">User:FayssalF</a> for moving two pages without consensus. The discussion can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cretan_Turks&amp;diff=77806684&amp;oldid=77805368" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cretan_Turks&amp;diff=77806684&amp;oldid=77805368" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I was first made aware of the incident on IRC in the #wikipedia channel when Mikskin, who goes as "dion" on IRC, asked for some admin help in the channel. He is not a vandal and he did not violate 3RR or anything while conducting page moves. The diff I provided shows that FayssallF might have been a bit misguided, as one doesn't need consensus to move a page. I'm aware that there's a dispute as to the page move, but Miskin seems to be very reasonable and let me know that he will attempt to work with his fellow Wikipedians on this. I just wanted to post here, as it's the first time I've undid another admin's actions and want to make sure that other admins have the opportunity to view the situation (also, feel free to revert me in this situation or in any other situation if you feel I've made a mistake).

<dd>Did you discuss the issue with <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">User:FayssalF</a> first? My first port of call would be with the blocking admin. Some moves can be part of an attempt to insert a POV, and some pages are subject to move warring. A look at <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">User:Miskin</a>'s move logs show a lot of recent page moves <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Miskin" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Miskin" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>, which do seem to give some cause for concern.

<p>Actually this page was moved without consensus sometime ago and me and other 2 editors agreed to move it back, as per wp:name and related conventions. A specific user (whose name is of no importance) kept reverting and "removing" in a troll-like manner, and familiar with a trick which blocked a page once it had been moved (by inserting a tag or something like that). Once this was performed several times, we couldn't move the page back without an admin's assistance. The same person who was responsible for blocking all possible article names, reported the incident and the admin involved gave out blocks in a blind and irresponsible manner that I have never encountered before. There was no policy violated, no POV-pushing and definitely not vandalism involved (which was the actual accusation). You can verify all of the above for yourself.

<p>I don't understand what you mean by "recent page moves" being subject to concern. The few moves I have performed in 2 years have preserved the names I (slash consensus) gave them. This fact alone proves that the moves I have performed so far were actual contributions. This will soon become evident for the article in question as well. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 00:28, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I was giving my comments on how to handle the situation to User:Hoopydink rather than commenting on your contributions. Your recent moving of pages over the last couple of weeks would have concerned me and therefore I would have investigated the reasons to ascertain any POV issues. As I am sure you can appreciate, the pages in question are related to what can be seen as sensitive issues. You seem to have taken offence at comments which were offered in a manner not intended to be judgemental to you but rather outline the thinking one would have to undertake when unblocking a user. I would hope you can appreciate almost every blocked editor requests to be unblocked, and so we need to be fully aware of why they were blocked. Page moving can sometimes lead to a block being issued. Blocked users will often describe blocks as being issued "in a blind and irresponsible manner". <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 00:48, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You also judged my editing behaviour hence I was obliged to defend myself. Administrators are only privileged users, and like all users they have to follow rules, which can be familiar even to a common editor. What I know is that there was someone out there who did a move&amp;lock pattern and was found "innocent", yet my logs are a subject of suspicion here. If you really continue to believe that this was a wise admin judgement, then I honestly have nothing more to say to you. Anything else stated in the defence of such an incident gives a bad image to the wikipedian administration. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 01:30, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You seem to be misreading me completely. Hopefully you can accept that. I never questioned your editing history, I said your move logs gave cause for concern. I'm sorry if you see that as a statement on your editing, it was rather a statement on the moving of those pages and that there was an underlying issue which needing resolving, something with which you agree. At no point have I condoned the block you were given or defended this incident. I have rather outlined to User:Hoopydink some areas of investigation it may be wise to look at before repealing a block. I hope you can assume good faith in my intentions. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 15:15, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Both users are now unblocked. Please note that blocking users is not our objective. It is not executed just for the sake of blocking people. If the block was meant to sort an issue out than i believe that this was achieved in our case. With respect due to Miskin intentions and Hoopydink's unblocking, please note that unilateral moves (twice or threeshold) may not be considered vandalism but it deserves the block. The block was not misguided. I also share most of Steve's opinions.

<dd>What I know is this: There are two editors trying to move an article while a third editor is opposing them by applying a move&amp;lock trick, forcing the two former to choose different names (actually my move was realised due to a typo), resulting on all possible names to be locked by him (except the one he wanted). Then it is required to ask for administrator assistance, and just because the third person happens to be the one who contacts <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">User:FayssalF</a>, he choses to block the two others without asking any questions. <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a> is a <b>POLICY</b>, and if you're not sure what the dispute is about, you don't have the right to give blocks around, let alone call it an act of "vandalism". Despite what you preach in here, what you did back there was nothing but plain irresponsibility and abuse of admin privileges.

<p>I suggest that the last version of the page be gotten from the history by an admin (without restoring), that the objectionable parts be removed and that whatever is left be copied and pasted to the page without restoring the history. A note about what happened should be put on the page and possibly the edit summary. If there is not a lot of text to remove, it might be helpful to indicate on the page when it is removed. If there is a lot of text to remove, then it might be a lot of work to do that. Does he have any specific objections?

<dd>Have I done something wrong here? These articles were deleted, as far as I can see, against the relevant policies. JzG and others have raised reasons for the deletions, and I have merely tried to debate those reasons (others have indicated that they believe tha deletions may not be valid and one article has already been recreated). Somebody else suggested that I should be blocked for "disruption". Is such debating not allowed, or is there a limit on debates? Do I just have to quietly accept a reason, when there appears to be very good grounds to question it? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevor_Saline_fdcf.html" title="User:Trevor Saline">Trevor Saline</a> 15:22, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I'd like to propose that this IP range be considered as an exceptional circumstance with regard to blocking edits.</p>
<p>Internet for Learning is an Internet provider that provides access for UK schools. As such all users on it are either school children or school staff in the UK. This means we have an IP range whose main users are schoolchidren and teenagers who basically have an anonymous way to post.</p>
<p>This IP range is, unsurprisingly, responsible for a large amount of vandalism and is regularly warned and blocked. However, warning an anonymous address used by thousands of children will have no effect whatsoever! A temporary block only temporarily solves the problem, as soon as the block is lifted, the vandalism restarts. This is, I woild say, fairly predictable.</p>
<p>Now that the software has been improved to ban only anonymous users, I would like to propose that the Internet for Learnig network be PERMANENTLY blocked for anonymous editing. So that teaching staff, support staff, and those pupils that wish to positively contribute to Wikipedia can still do so by siging up, but the vanmdalism is reduced.</p>
<p>I realise that such blocks are only used for exceptional circumstances, but would argue that this IP range IS an exceptional circumstance. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFork_me_d95a.html" title="User:Fork me">Fork me</a> 15:33, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The issue is that early news reports listed this murderer's name as "Dwayne" but the most recent name given by the Sheriff's office is "Duane" and includes his middle initial.</p>

<dd>It is not accurate to say I got "quite worked up about it"; but I don't agree and can't even understand the POV behind the deletions - controversial deletions which were not even explained. Here are comments I just posted on [[Talk:<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Cornell_University_people_03e3.html" title="List of Cornell University people">List_of_Cornell_University_people</a> (where this topic has been discussed before with some controversy) under a new section heading "Use of 'fair use' pictures of people on this page":</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seems obvious to me that accompanying an educational bio of a person (as it relates to Cornell University, or to some other university on a similar page) with a fair use image that helps to illustrate (and identify) the person in question for Wikipedia readers is helpful and fully in line with the statement on the fair use template. It should be in the same category as a more comprehensive bio on the article page for that person.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I am aware that this is one of those areas that is gray, and controversial. That's why it is important for editors who are undoing the work (and associated considerable time) of other editors should provide a fuller rationale than a short, terse sentence in an edit summary.</dd>

<dd>Two administrators today did not diegn to avail themselves of the talk page to explain sweeping deletions that have a record of controversy here, even when specifically requested to do so in large print. (The title of the topic just above is "Before making massive deletions please discuss.") If you are so sure that you are right, minimal courtesy would seem to dictate that you should cite the page where the applicable Wikipedia policy may be found. -<b><a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font color="#0000A0">Do</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DoctorW_9e6c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DoctorW"><font color="#008040">c</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoctorW_8300.html" title="User talk:DoctorW"><font color="#A00040">t</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font color="#0000A0">or<i>W</i></font></a></b> 05:20, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed this article being wikilinked when reviewing another editor's contributions. When I looked at the article, it looked rather redundant to information already contained in the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy</a> article.

<dd>Jimbo redirected the page out of human dignity (and because it is better covered in the controversy article), and only someone who wants to commit administrator suicide would revert him. Instead of making it a redirect to someone who is mentioned in an article, I moved <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Chase_%28drummer%29_58ea.html" title="Brian Chase (drummer)">Brian Chase (drummer)</a> there (I do not know if the drummer is very notable, but at least he has his own article). As I said on the AfD, if someone wants to put a disambiguation link at the top of the article, they can. I do not think he is notable enough, though. Generally, I think we should not have a disambiguation link for someone who is just mentioned in an article, rather than having his or her own article or being extensively covered in another article. If someone wants <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Chase_c5c1.html" title="Brian Chase">Brian Chase</a> to be a redirect to the controversy article and a link to the drummer to be put at the top of the controversy article, they can do a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">requested move</a>. If the drummer's article is deleted because he is non-notable, just make it a redirect or a disambiguation page with links to the controversy and the band articles. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 17:39, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my opinion, yes, and with no need to ask the user since it is clear cut. User pages should not be in the same categories as articles (or have cleanup, wikify, merge or any similar tags). Also, when I clear out user pages in categories, there is often so many of them that it would be a pain to ask to have each one removed. Some users are no longer editing or edit very infrequently as well, making it infeasible to ask. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 16:37, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes. User pages should not be in mainspace categories. Generally this is an oversight on the part of the editor (especially with sandboxed articles); simply disable the category by placing a colon in front of it. It's normal wiki editing (being bold), there's no need to ask. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 16:50, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just had this thought and would like some feedback. In the Spanish wiki, admins are called <i>bibliotecarios</i>, meaning "librarians". I somehow prefer the term <i>Librarian</i> over <i>Administrator</i>, as I associate the latter more with bureaucrat tasks than with working towards improving an encyclopedia by different means (fighting vandalism, safeguarding NPOV, etc). It is true that neither term is completely accurate, as <i>librarian</i> seems to exclude intrinsecally administrative tasks, emphasising the content management aspect instead. Personally, I find the idea of Librarian more profound and poetic. Do not understand this as a call to change policy or anything. It is just something that crossed my mind and wanted to know whether I am alone on this.

<dd>Many aspects of Wikipedia involve editors contributing in a Librarian capacity; sourcing articles, providing references and checking facts. Other related tasks are putting the books in order on the shelves - i.e. categorising, stub sorting, etc. Editors and admins differ from Librarians in that they get involved with the data that they present to other users, whereas Librarians as impartial, fulfilling the requirements of the enquiry without bias and to the best of their ability. <a href="../../../l/i/b/Librarian.html" title="Librarian">Librarian</a> also connotes a professional relationship with information, one that requires a postgraduate degree/diploma in order to satify entry requirements in to bodies such as the ALA (American Library Association) and CILIP (Chartered Institute of Librarians and Information Professionals). To call admins Librarians may well be poetic but it isn't entirely fair to hang a professional tag on those who have not earned it in the same way as those who worked for their degrees in Information Science did. You can call me either, as I have both tags!

<p>I've for a long time considered <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trusty" class="extiw" title="wikt:trusty">trusty</a> to be a better name for what we are.

<li>Calling admins "trusties" would imply that others <i>aren't</i>. Before I was an admin, I did not mind <i>not</i> being one. I would have felt somewhat undervalued if I had felt the imputation that I was not trusted. The mop and bucket analogy works; why not <i>janitors</i>? The element of "patrol" makes me think that <i>warden</i> might work, too. But "admin" is fine. --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 10:04, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>"Calling admins "trusties" would imply that others <i>aren't</i>." — which is a correct implication. The community's trust, that one will wield the extra tools to the project's benefit, is something that one has to earn. There exist people who haven't yet earned that trust. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:47, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, but my point is that admins have only been entrusted with a <i>small</i> set of extra facilities; the larger trust (that of editing the encyclopedia) is open to everyone. All Wikipedians are deemed to be "trusty" (unless they forfeit that trust in some way) - that's simply <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>! Perhaps my objection was also slightly coloured by the negative connotations of "trusty" - "a convict considered trustworthy and allowed special privileges," it says in Merriam Webster. You'll be glad to read that I <i>don't</i> feel imprisoned by Wikipedia&#160;:-) --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 15:34, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The attack is included in the diff I linked to above. He speculated that I was a Jesuit (which for the record I am not) and "thus allowed to use dishonesty". He also attacked fellow Wikipedian, admin and Catholic <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical Linguist</a> by calling her "disbarred from that order and from that general permission to lie". Formerly, he basically accused all Catholics of being Pope-controlled robots, even after the wording he based himself on was repeatedly pointed out to him. Regardless of any content disputes and any further difficulties with his behaviour, he should not be allowed to use his user talk page to attack other editors. The User talk page has been left to him in order to communicate and not to use it as a soap box - a thing he has been doing all the time, even creating such problems as his inability to archive -, let alone to attack other editors.

<p>Hi folks! Would people like to examine the case of <a href="../../../n/r/9/User_talk%7ENr9_b83e.html" title="User talk:Nr9">User talk:Nr9</a>? S/he was permabanned for "sockpuppet used abusively; vandalism" back in April.

I don't know if the 5+ month break is a good sign or a bad one. The blocking editor is, from a glance at his user page, on Wikibreak (sadly).</p>
<p>My critical faculties have deserted me on this one, probably because of a 28-hour sleep deficit. Also a good reason to stop editing for the night.

(Velten has said that my evidence can be explained by the fact that we both edit pop music-related articles, which does absolutely nothing to explain her strange habit of parachuting into articles barely days after I have edited them, particularly as several of her "stalking" edits were related to content within my own userspace. She also has a history of harassing editors who never edit pop music articles.) Because of this behaviour, I've blocked her for three weeks.</p>

<dd>I originally brought this to Extraordinary Machine's attention. I haven't even looked at Velten/Eternal Equinox's recent behavior yet as I haven't had time. Two things concern me. One is that the arbcom decision states that blocks may be up to a week. Second, EM may be too "involved" with Velten to make the blocks himself. He says above "Velten has a long history of parachuting into articles barely days after I have edited them." I do think that problem users can eventually wear out their welcome so the community may impose a longer block than decreed by arbcom, or even a ban. I think a review in this case would be a good idea. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:26, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was contacted by Bebe Buell via email today due to the continuing issue with this page. While I monitor her page, I do <b>not</b> monitor <a href="../../../c/o/y/Coyote_Shivers_9a25.html" title="Coyote Shivers">Coyote Shivers</a> (and with over 5000 pages on my watchlist, I'm not looking for more work). I wrote an extensive response to her which can basically be summarised as the following: don't edit his page or yours while you have an ongoing legal battle, complain about libel and slander to ANI, then the infoteam, then the Wikipedia Foundation. I also explained page protection, WP:LEGAL, etc. etc. This really is beyond my ability though I do seriously hope that my email to her was helpful. I'm mentioning it here because, well, it seems like a good idea. Any additional suggestions people have, please raise them. This issue is apparently of serious concern to Ms. Buell.

<dd>I have restored the AFD discussion (which had been deleted) - frivolous nomination it may have been, and a speedy keep it may have been, but I find it inappropriate to delete <i>any</i> AfD discussion, these things should be transparent. —<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 11:31, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I suppose there's no reason why an FA shouldn't be considered for deletion, because FA considers article quality not notability and so on. However, front page articles are our shopfront and having a deletion tag on a current front page article looks very bad. I propose we disallow nominating FAs for deletion <i>whilst they are on the front page</i>. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 11:36, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In practice, it's not going to be a big deal. That AFD was clear <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> material anyway; the article has lengthy, heavily-sourced sections on the game's creation, critical reception, status as a best-seller, and so on.

Is it usual for admins to delete pages like this without seeking consensus? I can understand speedy delete for article space, but speedy delete for administrative pages?

<dd>Ah. Now we find out that the AfD nomination was by a sock puppet of a banned user. Though this is not entirely clear from <a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames_M._fbf6.html" title="User talk:James M.">User talk:James M.</a>. For the block log, you have to go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:James_M." class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:James_M." rel="nofollow">here</a>. Is there a way to mark that user as blocked if they don't have a user page, or to mark the talk page? Anyway, this all means that the AfD page should be a speedy deletion under CSD criterion G5. Though to be fair, I should point out that I have reservations about CSD G5, as expressed at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html#Wikipedia:Numbers_need_citations" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">this deletion review</a>.
