<p>This topic was briefly (very briefly) discussed <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive63_a3a3.html#Template:Wr_deleted.2C_what_now.3F" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive63">here</a>, but there was no final opinion on the matter. I have a serious problem with admins beginning to issue one second blocks for something like removing warning templates. The templates can still be found in history, and admins should (and I believe do) check the history of a user before issuing a relevant block. A one second block, as implemented by <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Certified.Gangsta" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Certified.Gangsta" rel="nofollow">here</a> seems like more harassment/intimidation that any template warning ever did. I'd like to get some admin opinions on this before 1 second blocks begin to be implemented Wiki-wide, but was unsure of the proper place. If there's somewhere better...let me know. -- <i><b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="comic sans ms" color="mediumblue">Auburn</font><font face="comic sans ms" color="darkorange">Pilot</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></a> <small>20:32, 4 December 2006 (<a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>)</small></p>

<dd>I agree that one-second blocks are not a good idea. I frankly don't see much point in a one-second block.

<dd>It is a log of "warnings".Since the user removes warnings, admins don't know how to block.This shows up in the log and gives them a note of past problems, it is much like a "dummy edit". <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">Cbrown1023</a> 22:05, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are two valid uses of 1 second blocks- 1 sometimes they can be used to help clear out autoblocks. 2) Noting that a previous block in the block log was erroneous. Users sometimes prefer such notes who are senstive about their block logs. Either of these uses are fine. Using them as a form of warning doesn't serve any real purpose. If you need to warn a user about something use the user's talk page. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:01, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>His behavior is blockable in itself. Him threatening to block other users because he disagrees with article content is unacceptable; revert warring and removing others' comments from <i>article</i> talk pages is also unacceptable. Him removing a warning so that it is not easily searchable and likely ignoring it and previous warnings does not create a time-consuming obligation on my part to monitor his contributions endlessly, nor to require that I look through all his contributions to determine whether he has been <i>entirely</i> disruptive or whether there is some benefit to having him around and some hope of remediation; or to determine exactly how many warnings he has gotten previously and their validity; or to determine whether he is actually a sockpuppet of banned <a href="../../../c/u/t/User%7ECute_1_4_u_d42e.html" title="User:Cute 1 4 u">User:Cute 1 4 u</a>. He has the opportunity to amend this behavior, but that does not equate to a misleading clean slate; he has been given that opportunity before. If another administrator encounters this disruptive behavior on his part in the future, they should recognize that he has already been told repeatedly to stop. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 22:01, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One second blocks tend to be used as punishments- "I did this and I'll do more if you carry on". Blocks <b>aren't punishments</b>. And moreover, the block log is a log of blocks, not a place to put little administrative notes. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Deskana</a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">talk</a></small> 23:00, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Deskana</a> pretty much summed up my position on this subject. A block log is to be used as a <i>log</i> of a person's blocks. It is not a place for admins to make notes on a user's behavior and an editor should <b>never</b> be blocked, regardless of the duration, unless a block is warranted. Blocks are meant to be preventative, not punitive; a one second block doesn't prevent anything. -- <i><b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="comic sans ms" color="mediumblue">Auburn</font><font face="comic sans ms" color="darkorange">Pilot</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></a> <small>23:07, 4 December 2006 (<a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>)</small>

<dd>The behavior if it is not stopped warrants banning. The one second block prevents him from continuing this behavior without it being noticed. This is not a punishment. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 23:10, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The block does not stop him doing anything since it is for one second.

<dd>That was already done. The entry in the block log is a note to other administrators that he has already been repeatedly warned for this behavior, so that future disruptive behavior will receive an informed response, ending the ability to be disruptive if necessary. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 03:11, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I consider that block to be inappropriate, and potentially counterproductive. The idea of giving one-second blocks to users who remove warnings was discussed <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive63_a3a3.html#Template:Wr_deleted.2C_what_now.3F" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive63">here</a>. It was suggested by Centrx. I and another user opposed it, and then the thread was archived. Nobody had supported it. I do not suggest any impure motives on the part of the blocking admin, but such blocks seem designed to "show" the user that the blocking admin is more powerful. Additionally, the removal of warnings is discouraged, but not prohibited. And, idiotic though that practical joke banner is, it's not something that "must be removed at all costs", so why make an issue of it and cause bad feeling? There is absolutely no compelling reason to have a record in the block log, and there are very good reasons <i>not</i> to (potential for ill will, and impossibility of changing your mind later). The very troublesome users attract admin noticeboard attention regardless of block logs. If a user is slightly disruptive (and I have no idea if this is the case here), there's no urgency. If you feel a record is necessary, you can keep one (with diffs) on your hard disk without humiliating and frustrating a fellow editor until such time as you feel that his behaviour needs to be brought to the noticeboard. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 00:11, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Ann's summary puts it as succinctly as can be, and I fully agree. I would only add this: blocks <i>are</i> sometimes punitive. I know that people often claim they aren't but it seems to me I've seen more than a few cases where editors were blocked long after the incident that precipitated the blocking had passed. I don't necessarily have a problem with this, but I wish this status quo were either acknowledged or changed. It's a bit confusing otherwise. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 00:21, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is <b>some</b> truth behind this punishment/preventative thing that you say, IronDuke.

<p>So, what do you propose instead? Our options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>We watch all his contributions for several months (Are you going to do this or is this my burden?);</li>
<li>Let his behavior continue to be under the radar as it has been, accruing endless warnings, perhaps hoping that he will go beyond the pale or that a more aggressive administator will simply block him when he threatens to ban the admin;</li>
<li>Simply block him now as this is disruptive behavior for which he has previously been warned (Would anyone have objected if I had simply blocked him for 24 hours rather than 1 second?)</li>

<dd>I've been pondering for some time the idea of having a "warning log", which would be similar to a block log. It would be a permanent record, so to speak, so that admins could see what other admins had done in terms of warnings given. But it wouldn't be as hurtful or apt to cause disruption as an entry on someone's block log. Don't know if that's feasible with the software, though. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 02:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A 1 second block is obviously merely a note analogous to a warning log. I don't see why it would be less "hurtful". Also, having this feature would lead to "yellow card" warnings being put in the permanent log, where before they would be temporarily on the talk page, which would be more disruptive if the block log is. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 03:07, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It could be a good idea, but it would need to be technically implemented in the software (you could create a protected Warning page but you would then need to link it from the user page—a link which would then be removed by the user). Given that it is a minor feature request and the block is nearly functionally identical, I doubt it would be implemented soon, and until such time we are left with these options. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 03:07, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

Centrx, like Ann, I believe that your actions were performed in good faith and with good intentions, but please let the man keep a little dignity here. I have experience of how much better he responds to that. He's <i>very</i> sensitive about his block log.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=91887987&amp;oldid=91886246" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=91887987&amp;oldid=91886246" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> On the general issue, using one second blocks in this manner, I'm totally against it.

<p>In regard to the recent heated exchange between admin <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">User:Centrx</a> and myself, I decided to make a concise explanation of the entire matter from beginning to end. First thing I need to clarify is I didn’t know Centrx is an admin until I checked his logs after Bish calmed us down. I was actually quite surprised he is a sysop for a number of reasons. The reasoning behind my post on his talkpage was not because I disagree with the page move on <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigger.html" title="Wigger">wigger</a>, but because he failed to read the previous discussions on the possible page move in the relevant talkpage; thus he is moving it out of process (without consensus or discussion, factual accuracy). I have actually invested quite a bit of my time improving that particular article. Whether <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigger.html" title="Wigger">wigger</a> is an ethnic slur is debatable and the misconception of the use of word is widespread among people who do not understand hip-hop culture (some white rappers are self-proclaimed wiggers), so redirecting wigger to ethnic slur without prior discussion on talkpage seems to be rather POV.</p>
<p>The only thing I probably shouldn't have done was to post on his talkpage. I do admit my reflective response on his talkpage is not optimal. This immediately provoked Centrx’s violent response. Rather than start a meaningful discussion on <a href="../../../w/i/g/Talk%7EWigger_7a57.html" title="Talk:Wigger">Talk: Wigger</a>, he decided to post a warning on my talkpage as well as removing my joke banner from my userpage and talkpage, which has nothing to do with the content dispute. The joke banner could also be found on another user's userpage(whom I encountered on His excellency’s arbitration case). And it has been up there for quite a few months now and no one complained about the so-called “deception” or “non-joke”. All of these hatred toward my userspace seems to be out of personal vendetta.</p>
<p>In addition, Centrx also reverted one of my edits on <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese.html" title="Chinese">Chinese</a> (an area he was previously uninvolved in)[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese&amp;curid=5347&amp;diff=91879719&amp;oldid=91878428" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese&amp;curid=5347&amp;diff=91879719&amp;oldid=91878428" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]. which was later reverted back by admin <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">User:MarkSweep</a>. Once again, he demonstrated he is being rather personal (one of wikipedia’s policy is to comment on the contributions not the contributor).</p>
<p>Many other users have posted similar warnings on my page, many of them baseless and unjustified such as <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">User:RevolverOcelotX</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoolGuy_fbb1.html" title="User:PoolGuy">User:PoolGuy</a>, both of whom have been indef. blocked.</p>
<p>1 second block is a great way to admit administration error, like the link Bish provided above. Alex apologized to me about the unjustified 3RR block he imposed on me, which was brilliant. But it is hard to picture that happening here in the near future.</p>
<p>In regard to several unjustified accusations above, whether or not I disagree with the content is irrelevant, the point I am making is Certrx is redirecting out of process. I did not, of course, remove anybody's comment from article talkpages. Please provide evidence. The most outlandish accusation out of all is my connection to User:Cute 1 4 U, I'm not going to provide a diff. here (it's my bedtime). But if anyone is interested take a look at, Cute 1 4 U's talkpage and the previous thread about her on AN/I, I was actually one of the main advocate to have her blocked. The accusation is absolutely ridiculous. It is insulting.</p>
<p>On a side note, if anyone is interested to come to a resolution, I will be holding a discussion on my talkpage. All involved parties are welcomed to participate.

<li>I fail to see the point of a one-second block. If behavior is disruptive enough to warrant it, do a regular block; if not, don't block. We don't need to keep permanent records of any user's behavior that was "just shy of disruptive", least of all in the block log.

<li>Please do not use the block log as a notice area for admins. If the behavior does not warrant a block, don't block. If the behavior is problematic in a long-term way, someone will notice it eventually, at which point blocks can be issued or a user RFC started, where the behavior can be analyzed in detail. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 10:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This seems like the latest manifestation of an ongoing divide in 'conflict philosophy' amongst the community. One school of thought holds that we should label and warn and record so that users don't 'get away with' anything without it being easily and immediately visible to everyone. The other view is that such 'scarlet letter' notices are insulting/embarrassing, serve to increase conflict, and may be abused for harassment or issued questionably in anger. I belong very much to the latter group and think that this edit warring to enforce display of warnings / one second block to record it does more harm than good. A warning was issued. It was read. If the warning is valid and the actions prompting it are repeated then a block can be issued. If not... then the warning served its purpose and is no longer needed. If the same problem occurs a few weeks later the warning can be dug out of the history to show that the person knew about it. I don't think people 'get away' with misbehaviour because past incidents are overlooked very often at all. Generally they get blocked in very short order and if there are continual problems they are out the door. Barring some epidemic of people who commit dozens of disruptions and magically never get blocked I thus don't think any of these 'record-keeping' efforts serve a positive purpose... whether it be edit warring/talk page protection to force display of warnings, 'suspected sockpuppet' tags and the like on the pages of non-blocked users, one second blocks to record things in the block log, or what have you... it is guaranteed to annoy the user, easily lends itself to abuse/harassment, and accomplishes little or no positive benefit. It is natural to want to make a record of things you disagree with and make sure people know that 'this person is trouble'... but it is also inherently un-wiki. We need to try to cooperate with and support even the people we disagree with in order for collaborative encyclopedia building to work. Warnings exist not to note that the person is 'bad' with an eye towards blocking or banning them, but rather to <i>help</i> them get along with others. IMO any time your motivation is more akin to 'make sure they get what is coming to them' rather than 'try to help them avoid further trouble' you are headed in the wrong direction... down a path which <b>increases</b> conflict rather than helping to end it. It is a ridiculously easy trap to fall into, with all the best intentions of 'protecting Wikipedia from the bad guy', but in practice it does little except make matters worse. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:44, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
Centrx, you seem not to understand that an entry in a block log is a slap in the face. If I broke 3RR, I'd much rather have the article protected for 24 hours than be blocked for 24 hours, even if that article were the only one I was interested in editing. Most people <i>don't like</i> having their block logs soiled. Removing warnings is not forbidden, and honestly, the way you and two other editors descended on Certified.Gangsta's page repeatedly restoring the warnings and removing the practical joke banner did amount to harassment. In the last year, I have been in dispute with two very disruptive non admins, both of whom made numerous personal attacks against me. (They're both indefinitely blocked now.) They both had that silly, irritating banner on their talk page, but it never even occurred to me to start harassing them by removing it. As Bishonen says, let users keep a little dignity. If something is mildly silly but is not harmful to the encyclopaedia, and fighting it is going to cause a lot of bad feeling, then <i>just leave it</i>.</p>
<p>You say that his behaviour is potentially blockable. If that's really true, I wouldn't object to a proper block from an <i>uninvolved</i> administrator. But I don't know, as you didn't give diffs. I did a little research, since you spoke of him threatening to block other users, and I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Centrx&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91871397" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Centrx&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91871397" rel="nofollow">this</a> entry on your talk page. He simply says, "Next time you move a page without consensus, you will be blocked from editing." That's not a threat that he'll block you. Lots of non admins send warnings that say "next time you . . . you <i>will</i> be blocked", even though they don't have the power to enforce it. At worst, his massage to you is an inappropriate warning. I've sometimes removed spam or nonsense or copyright violations, and have received vandalism warnings. I've even (gasp with horror) <i><b>removed</b></i> those warnings from my talk page. But I have never considered blocking the user who sent them, except where the user was engaging in vandalism or other clearly disruptive behaviour.</p>
<p>You say that his removal of warnings might create a "time-consuming obligation on [your] part to monitor his contributions endlessly", and suggest that an alternative to your one-second-blocks idea is that "we watch all his contributions for several months". If he's a very disruptive user, then he will come to admin attention without anyone having to watch him for several months. If he's not, then there's no particular need to watch him for several months. Noticeboard archives are full of threads concerning Mistress Selina Kyle or Blu Aardvark or Alienus. A user who does a bit of edit warring (and remember, I don't know if that's the case here) or sends an annoying warning to another user is not such a threat to the encyclopaedia that we need to keep a record of it displayed on his talk page or in his block log.</p>
<p>A warning is intended to make a user — especially a new user — aware that he's violating a policy which he may not know about. Once he removes it, you know he's seen it, so you can keep the diff if you need it for an RfC or an RfAr. If you want a record, then put something like "disruption warning" in the edit summary — <i><b>once</b></i>. It can then be easily found in the history. (I always put "Test2 warning" etc in edit summaries for vandals.) If you want to go further than that, then you need to ask yourself if you are treating the warnings as genuine warnings (with the advantage of having a record for other admins through the history) or as a black mark that a user is obliged to display as a punishment for being naughty.</p>
<p>Finally, <i>please</i> remember that the block button is to be used sparingly. Regardless of what your intentions actually were, it should never be used to send the message, "I'm more powerful than you, so if you refuse to leave my warnings publicly displayed on your talk page, I'm going to put them in your block log, because there's nothing you can do about that." I don't imply that that was your motivation, but it is certainly the effect. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 13:21, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>God, Bishy, you think I'm the type? Anyway, in order to show genuine good-faith and my true intention to reach a constructive resolution to the incident, I have removed the joke banner on my talkpage (personally I think the banner's hilarious, but if y'all think it's obnoxious I gotta give it up).</p>

<p><b>Policy edit.</b> It seems to me that this thread expresses consensus that blocks are not to be used for the purpose of making notes in the block log of a user, with the sole exception of putting in something like a note of apology for a wrongful block. Centrx alone disagrees. I'm going to ask Centrx to oblige the consensus demonstrated here by discontinuing the practice, even though he himself thinks it's a good idea. Gangsta also urgently wants another note from Centrx (are you following me...?) in his log, to disavow the first. People do feel humiliated by this kind of thing, and I for my part would be happy to see him get what he wants. I've also made the following addition to the <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">blocking policy</a>:</p>

<dd>I could not disagree more that he and others involved in this 'crusade' have Wikipedia's best interests at heart.This is clearly a personal vendetta against blogs without any attention paid to Wikipedia's guidelines for notability.Reading their contributions and userspaces, no measure of notability is significant enough for them not to attempt to have every blog-related article deleted.Just spend two seconds looking into it, and you'll see what I'm talking about.I'm not going to continue the revert war that you've started, however, and would like to see this discussion continue. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbats</font></b></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><b><font color="#008000">e</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">ll</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 04:06, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>In my opinion, the way User:Timecop/The war on blogs is presented is not appropriate even for user space (e.g. "BLOGS UNDER TERMINATION FROM US QUEERS", "shit inane garbage blatantly promoting the said blog", etc.). That said, I am not convinced the project is entirely without merit. Timecop's deletion requests do often seem to be successful at AFD, and a review of his contributions did show at least one recent instance where he improved a blog (<a href="../../../c/l/i/Climate_Audit_6800.html" title="Climate Audit">Climate Audit</a>) rather than AFD'ing it (apparently having found that blog to be notable, or at least accepting the previous keep AFD as reason not to try again).My opinion right now is that I would be okay with keeping a project to clean up Wikipedia's blog-space if it were to be rewritten to have a serious tone and avoid throwing around intentionally abrasive language. Bloggers are real people, and as a serious encyclopedia project we should treat them with respect even if their work is non-notable and deserves deletion.I don't know enough about the vote-stacking and other issues to comment on those concerns. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 04:32, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd like to chime in on the presentation/attitude issue.I agree that there's a specific need to police blog related articles, but this "War on Blogs" is being conducted in a way that is obviously lacking on the NPOV front and contributes to the public perception that Wikipedia is solely populated by ego driven elitists.The childish language used in the proposed criteria removes Timecop's campaign of any credibility that it might otherwise have (especially with new/non-editing users), making it appear to be a campaign of one lone misanthrope, rather than a coordinated effort by multiple editors, which is what any effort to police blog related content should be. I for one, feel that any AfD nomination made by Timecop, GNAA or anyone else involved in this effort should be looked at with suspicion, based upon their stated motivations and their inability to articulate their position outside of their "blogging is worthless" perspective.If a project like this is going to be successful it needs input from people who have a better understanding of the blogging field than Timecop has.<a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 13:34, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've said this before and I'll say it again. If the GNAA wants to get vanity articles deleted in an orderly fashion according to Wikipedia's policies, more power to them. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:07, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Precisely.That was exactly the conclusion I recall we reached last time this was mentioned.As long as Timecop goes about it the Wikipedia way, with reference to policy and guidelines, what is the problem?And <i>keep</i>&#160;!votes based solely on the identity of the nominator are unlikely to get much weight either.Few bloggers are as notable as they may think.Writing about yourself every day is not a guarantee that your perception of society's need for your words is in line with reality, is it?<b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:55, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just to concur with the above, the objections (last time around it was <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">User:Bearcat</a> who got very upset) made respecting the effort to bring blog entries of questionable notability to AfD is entirely in keeping with overall principles and policies. The "problems" cited above seem to be completely contrived - that AfD nominations that are not as civil as they might be or that bloggers are not being treated with respect... What is that? And how are those grounds to issue blocks against users whose efforts have in effect been endorsed by the larger opinion of the community (if one reviews the list of nominations brought to AfD, many have been successful.

<p>Hi, Tony Pierce here. This might be surprising coming from me but I agree with those of you who think that timecop should stay. Every society needs a garbage man, a cockroach, a cop. And those roles are oftentimes looked down upon. If in his heart timecop feels he's doing the right thing focusing on bloggers and if the editors of Wikipedia agree with him, then he is doing good work in making this place even better.</p>
<p>Not everyone, however, who does good things does them in a friendly, polite, or even decent way, however, and I think that's where timecop and the GNAA do themselves a disservice. For example I tried to politely ask timecop to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Timecop#Please_delete_the_link_to_the_resume_of_Tony_Pierce_and_other_irrelevant_slanders" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Timecop#Please_delete_the_link_to_the_resume_of_Tony_Pierce_and_other_irrelevant_slanders" rel="nofollow">remove the link</a> that he found to a resume of mine from 2000, as well as delete the lie that I hadn't ever been employed for one full year from the AfD page and he refused. After I reminded him that knowingly keeping something posted that you know (from the resume) is false is tantamount to lying (and possibly worse: libel), he basically told me to piss off. That's a bad cop, despite his possible initial good intentions. And it lends to critics' arguments that someone with an agenda against blogs fails the Wikipedia standard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" rel="nofollow">Neutrality</a>. If somehow you can get timecop to play by the rules I think you'll have a really dedicated editor who is passionate about Wikipedia. Unfortunately there's very few worse things than a bad cop. And if you're just as diligent about getting rid of bad entries, why wouldn't you also be just as rigid about getting rid of bad editors?</p>
<p>With that said, there are two things that I have learned from the two discussion pages in regards to my case. The first is, as you can see from the information gleaned in the debate, there is far more information about me and my career in blogging that was ever on my Wiki entry. Sometimes it might be that the entry is lacking, not the subject. In which case it's unfair to debate the entry until it's complete. I'm not saying that's the case here, but it could be, and it could be the case for some one else down the road. Several people said "Delete, he has only appeared on G4TV? Big whoop" before seeing the information that I've been quoted in newspapers around the world, and that my award-winning post has been translated in several languages. Therefore I am grateful that mine wasn't one of those Speedy deletions. And I'm also grateful that the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/02/AR2006120201111.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/02/AR2006120201111.html" rel="nofollow">Washington Post</a> story was published this Sunday which made me check in on my entry to see if I was in the same boat as the band in the WaPo article - and sure enough, I was. And I was lucky that it was on Digg, and I was lucky that there was time afforded for an intellectual discussion. I say "lucky" because I simply want a fair discussion based on facts, not a hurried debate based on a poor entry.</p>
<p>The other thing is there really needs to be, in my humble opinion, a better test than there currently is for determining the notability of a blogger and/or a blog. This too was brought up in the current discussion. The media has also had to struggle with this one while debating if bloggers are journalists, whether blogs are credible news sources (something we share with Wikipedia), and if blogging is merely a fad. Many of those questions are no longer debatable since bloggers have been granted access to attend and report on political conventions, a few blogs have broken news stories orseverely changed political discussions, many newspapers now have blogs, and some blogs are hiring full time bloggers and editors.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that I know what should be included in the test of notability but things like Technorati's rankings, mentions in major newspapers, longevity, money made off blogging, or bloggingprofessionally are the types of things that could be determined in separating the average blogger from the notable one.</p>
<p>There is a strong relationship between bloggers and Wikipedia, and I dare say that we are probably the source of more links and more traffic to your site than any other place. And if we're not we're way up there. Therefore the likelihood of more blogs being nominated for entry/deletion will be high. If that's true, it means a good standard specifically for blogs is something that I believe should be set at some point since we are (sadly) different than other forms of media.</p>
<p>Regardless of the fate of my entry, even if I disagree with it, I'd be happy to answer any questions you all might have in the future, if there ever are any, regarding blogs, bloggers, and blogging and its history, and I can be reached pretty easily in the comments of the <a href="http://www.busblog.com" class="external text" title="http://www.busblog.com" rel="nofollow">busblog</a>, <a href="http://www.Laist.com" class="external text" title="http://www.Laist.com" rel="nofollow">LAist</a>, or via email at busblog @ gmail.

<dd>Pardon my irreverence, but I don’t think a link to the resume of an individual whose Wikipedia article is being discussed is totally off-topic. Also, why do you insist the link be removed and at the same time continue to serve the image from your website? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Hocevar_dccf.html" title="User:Sam Hocevar">Sam Hocevar</a> 15:37, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the resume is irrelevant and off topic because it spans years up to 2000. i hadn't started blogging until fall of 2001. also the point of him linking to it was to expose me as someone who hadn't held a job for over a year, which if it were true, would also be irrelevant to what i have achieved in blogging, but it is a false claim. if you or he can justify linking to my pre-blogging, 2000 resume as a way to prove or disprove that i deserve a wikipedia entry go for it. but the claim that i havent held a job for over a year is not only a poor argument for a Delete vote, but it's untrue based, ironically, on the resume timecop linked to. therefore keeping the statement that i have not held a job for over a year is a blatant lie and possible libel since its sole intention is to defame me based on something that he knows to be untrue. tony pierce 75.201.132.119 21:10, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We had to 1) replace Tim Shell, 2) plan next elections, 3) make decisions over how to expand the board It was a set of issues I expected would be problematic, but we actually rather easily and quickly settled down on an agreement. A very detailed resolution will make that plain official, but the basic ideas are these ones:</p>
<p>We will work toward a progressive expansion of board, up to a number of probably 11, to be expected in july 2008. 2 new members will be added (by appointment) before the end of the year on the board, until next elections in july 2007. Tim Shell will be replaced before the end of the year, by appointement, for a term of one year. All appointements will be for one year from now on, which means Jimbo and Michael Davis terms will expire in a year. Appointements may be renewable.</p>
<p>Elections will take place every year for 3 positions (3 positions in july 2007, 3 positions in july 2008). Elected seats is for 2 years term and may be renewed. Elections will stay direct elections, but procedures and rules (such as requirements for candidacy or voting system) may evolve. The board is apparently opened to the concept of appointing in the future, a member which would be warmly recommanded by chapters. Last, the board pledged the majority of the board would be from the community (through appointements or elections)</p>
<p>To be very specific</p>
<p>The board was also concerned by the risk of instability at next elections, due to the important influx of new members (possibly very knowledgable about the Foundation, or possibly not) and important departure of current members (Erik, the two new temp members and myself). The board consequently suggested that I, be appointed to the board from july 07 till june 08, which I accepted (OMG). The board came up with names for the three newly appointed members, but we first need to check whether they agree&#160;:-) You'll be informed once agreement is given. Stay tuned&#160;!</p>

<dd>The way I read it, it's a temporary move.A possible timetable:
<ul>
<li>February 2007:7 members- 3 appointed, 2 voted (Florence and Erik), and Jimbo and Michael Davis.</li>
<li>July 2007:7 members- 5 voted (though Florence would stay until 2008), and Jimbo and Davis, assuming both are reappointed.</li>
<li>February 2008:11 members- 4 appointed, 5 voted, and Jimbo and Davis, assuming both are reappointed.</li>
<li>July 2008:11 members- 6 voted, 3 appointed, mainly from the various foundation chapters, and Jimbo and Davis.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>This is obviously a guess, but I imagine something similar would be done.<a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 07:07, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It reads to me that Florence will become an appointed member starting in July 2007, so we would have 4 elected (Erik + 3 new) from 2007 to 2008, and 6 from July 2008 on. Converting elected members into appointed members is not a bad thing, preferable to plucking chapter members who have never demonstrated any broad support in the greater community. We should elect them first, then convert those that prove to be excellent board members into appointees. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature12_b3bf.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature12"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 11:54, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I need other adminsitrators to visit <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_Security_d296.html" title="Starfleet Security">Starfleet Security</a> as a user has declared the article to be a copyright violation against Memory Alpha since, months ago, the initial version of the article (then 2-3 sentences) was coped over from MA.since then, the entire article has been rewritten with new material and sources added.In its present form the article <i>looks nothing like</i> the version from Memory Alpha.I tried to explain this to the user and remove the notice, but he reverted demanding the notice stay up for several days until other adminsitrators look at it.I think this might be bad faith since the same user posted some very harsh reviews of the article on the talk page and then, after all this, decieded the article was a copvio.I am asking for a speedy removal of this notice since the article does not appear to be n any way a copyright violation. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 20:07, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, technically we could do this, but since all versions in history are copyvio we would lose the attribution required for the GFDL for the new non-copyvio content.This is why starting a new article is the procedure.<a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html#Instructions" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems#Instructions</a> specifically instructed me to do what I did.I see now after the required tag has been removed twice by various users, someone had now purged the article of the sentences i specifically identified as copyvio, leaving a kind of a mess.<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 20:46, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The entire article itself indeed did not and still does not appear to be copyvio, but there were indeed subtle sentences mixed in that, while not obvious at a glance, have since been removed.

<li>The article is referneced with in-line references to movies and shows and a reference is given at the end with others soon to follow.So, I cannot agree when you say this article "is not a good one at that", we don't need personal opinions about an article beng good or bad, lets all work together to make them all better.As for Coolcat, he is concerned becuase the same people seem to be visiting the Star Trek articles he has worked on and are nominating them for deletion.To date, two have been nominated and when one survives an AfD, the same people who nominated it will visit another one of the articles and try to AfD that one instead.I have to give Coolcat's fears some credence here.I am really hoping that there are no personal motives here and that people are not nominating these articles becuase Coolcat or I worked on them.I can only hope that is not the case. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 23:37, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's a great little nugget, Mackensen.The last line particularly struck me since I always figure two people should be grown up enough not to edit war on a page and, if they're not, they and only they need to take a break.But "This focuses attention on the thing that matters most" is a thought-provoking point...—<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 01:54, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seems to be fixed now (at least that I can tell); I'd venture to guess that someone tagged one of the templates used on the pages as a speedy without &lt;noinclude&gt;, which then caused all the pages it was transcluded on to be listed in the category.

<p>I've noticed that some admins are blocking IPs for increasing amounts of time. Some of these are shared university IPs, some are probably dynamic, and they are blocked for a week, month or even 6 months(!). That's completely useless for our purposes. We are blocking IPs to prevent specific persons from editing, not to punish the IP addresses. In most cases, the person behind the IP changes within hours, so blocking the IP for a week brings no added advantage for our purposes. Even when you have reasons to believe that a prolonged attack over a couple of days is coming from the same person, there is no reason to expect that the same person will be using the IP next week. I strongly advise less fancy template work on talk pages, shorter blocks (3-24 hours is almost always enough), and in cases of prolonged attacks coming from the same IP over a number of weeks - if you really want to be useful, inform the school. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 05:37, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do the longer blocks on IPs when there are not any constructive edits coming, but just more vandalism everytime the block expires.

<dd>Remember the point of blocks, by <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>, is to protect Wikipedia.

<p>I understand the need for long blocks when shorter ones have not worked and virtually no good contributions are being made. I've found some IP addresses, especially those of schools and universities, to be chronic vandals. Also, Wikipedia seems to be doing significantly worse lately when it comes to catching vandalism, especially in a timely manner. I've been finding vandalism that has gone unreverted for many hours and sometimes days on high profile articles. Sometimes the vandalism is not even caught and the article is edited without being reverted. Therefore, more aggressive blocking of IP addresses that make few or no constructive edits might be appropriate. However, I have seen some admins block IP addresses for six months or a year when the account has only made one or two edits. Also, before going past the one month mark, I think that the ISP, college or company should be contacted. In many cases, they can identify the vandals and either greatly reduce the vandalism or stop it completely. Perhaps it should be part of the blocking procedure before long blocks are made. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:43, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm...I don't have any idea, this needs a community concensus. I would like it to stay as it has encyclopedic value. But due to the criteria for speedy deletion, I have to consider this, this is a very tough decision to make. If we apply CSD G5 here, then it has to go. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">Ter</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">nc</a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerence_Ong_215c.html" title="User talk:Terence Ong">e Ong</a> 07:53, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>G5 it. The article is not something you'd find written in an encyclopedia, there are obvious tone problems, and it wouldn't hurt us if it was gone. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 07:58, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't necessarily be that quick to dismiss the article. The AfD has established some form of community consensus that this is something we can have - the introduction can be rewritten to conform with tone quite easily and you do find comparative tables in encyclopedias. The question is how strictly the speedy deletion criteria should be applied. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 08:07, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe that in this case the AfD acts as a community consensus for keeping. There is a similar qualifier on the notability CSD criteria G11:"If a page has previously gone through deletion process and was not deleted, it should not be speedily deleted under this criterion." That line was instated following a discussion <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_Archive14_c725.html#Speedying_A7.2FG11s_that_have_survived_an_AfD" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion/Archive14">here</a> which decided that AfD's overruled CSD's, and I would suggest that this principle extended to all (non-copyvio related) speedy deletion criteria: surviving a formal deletion process should make the page ineligible for speedy deletion. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 08:05, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Someone raised something along these lines on IRC the other day (I forget who). I said to them that to delete whole articles, which have no other problems, only because they were contributed to by a banned user or a sock thereof, is simply cutting off our noses to spite our faces. The article is the community's now, and we can do with it what we like. If there's a consensus to keep it, evidenced by an AfD, then we should naturally keep it. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 09:13, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's an interesting proposal actually, that once a page survives XfD, it should be exempt from speedy deletion (except if it's patently not the same content). Is it worth putting into the CSD guidelines though? I'm thinking this is a rather small minority of cases, but it might be worth noting just to prevent future confusion. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 09:20, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just because something is technically eligible for speedy deletion under the criteria doesn't mean that it must be deleted, only that it can be. Conversely, just because something has survived one of the deletion processes, doesn't mean that it should never be deleted. That said, in a common sense approach to deletion, the fact that an article like this (where the only issue relating to the criteria is that it was contributed to by a banned user) has been kept by an AfD would almost always mean that it should be kept. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 12:33, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This seems like process for the sake of process. Say I copy and paste the article to my sandbox and then you delete the article, I could then repost the material and the process would have been honoured. What a waste of time. The argument that the article is non encyclopedic is also a nonstarter - it's demonstrably a minority POV, as it's passed an Afd. If I've ever seen an occasion demading Ignore All Rules, this is it. It's a good article and should stay - don't cut off your nose to spite your face. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 10:12, 6 December 2006 (UTC) <small>P.S.

<p>I understand that <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_expert_6664.html" title="User:Tennis expert">User:Tennis expert</a> is a confirmed sock of <a href="../../../c/u/t/User%7ECute_1_4_u_d42e.html" title="User:Cute 1 4 u">User:Cute 1 4 u</a> with checkuser evidence, but in my dealings with <a href="../../../c/u/t/User%7ECute_1_4_u_d42e.html" title="User:Cute 1 4 u">User:Cute 1 4 u</a> before he/she was banned, they were not of the intelligence to write the article in that tone, or with that degree of knowledge of the wiki syntax. They seemed to be very ameteurish/childish. This is evinced by their userpage when they were not banned (have a look at the deleted edits). Is it possible that checkuser has got this one wrong, and we have banned a worthwhile contributor. Possibly because they share an isp? The only other option as I see it is that they were putting on the 13 year old girl act (guessing the age here) and that messy myspace like userpage? And to what end would all those thousands of edits have been. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 09:08, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I asked several administrators to look over that message before I sent it to her, including the blocking administrator. Frankly, there is not much that can be done in a checkuser block (from what I was told) other than to request that another checkuser be performed. And my actions such as that there have been discussed before in that they are not harmful. I know I cannot unblock, and I don't expect to do that for a while, but things such as checkuser blocks or blatant attacks are things that can be reviewed and declined. However, I will "un-review" it, and just place all of my commentary beneath it, seeing as this is more complex than usual.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Řÿūłóñģ</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 18:19, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dmcdevit, you appear to be saying that I am a sock puppet of cute 1 4 U because I'm a sock puppet of cute 1 4 U."... two socks edit the same set of articles...."It also appears that one of your criteria for making a sock puppet conclusion is similarity in user names.What is similar about "Tennis expert" and "Tennislover"?We both have "tennis" in our names.But so what?I chose "Tennis expert" simply because I anticipated that most of my registered edits would be in tennis-related articles, and my unregistered edits had been almost completely in that area for the previous 8 or 9 months.(I then started editing tropical cyclone articles because I have been interested in that subject since about 1971, when I experienced my first hurricane.)Is everyone on Wikipedia who has "tennis" in his or her username a suspected sock puppet of cute 1 4 U?Also, why don't you check the IP addresses I've used today and yesterday and the day before and really at any time in the past since I registered.You've apparently concluded in the past that cute 1 4 U is in the Chicago, Illinois area.As you will see, I am no where close to that location, and the first two or three digits of my IP addresses are different from the first two digits of the IP addresses used by cute 1 4 U.Your other reasoning is that cute 1 4 U has varied personaes.But that makes Chacor and everyone else in the world a suspect who has a personae different from cute 1 4 U; therefore, that is a useless criterion.What will it take to convince you that I am not a sock puppet for cute 1 4 U or any other past or present Wikipedia user?Or is your mind closed to that possibility?You have my email address.I'll provide whatever private information you need, within reason.<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_expert_6664.html" title="User:Tennis expert">Tennis expert</a> 08:46, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Has Dmcdevit actually said that I am using the same computer as cute 1 4 u?I haven't seen where he has said that.The closest anyone has come is that my IP address is within the same IP address range as that used by cute 1 4 u.I'm not sure what it takes to be within the "same range."But if my IP address is different, how can it be said that my computer is the same as the computer of cute 1 4 u?And how are dynamic IP address assignments handled by checkuser, which is my situation?Aside from all this, I would like to know what "other evidence" existed to cause the checkuser to be conducted.No one requested it as far as I can determine.The only "other evidence" talked about so far is that Tennislover and I both have "tennis" in our user names and that we have edited some of the same tennis articles.The logic (illogic to me) appears to be that if Tennislover is a sock puppet for cute 1 4 U and given that Tennislover and I both have "tennis" in our user names, then I also must be a sock puppet for cute 1 4 U.That makes no sense.And where is the good faith presumption when it comes to my account?What about fundamental fairness, which to almost any rational human being includes notice and the opportunity to contest the evidence before adverse action is taken unless an emergency situation exists.And even then, a meaningful opportunity to overturn the adverse action should be provided after the fact.Refusing to discuss the evidence and reflexively saying that "if A said it, then it must be true and accurate" is wholly insufficient in my opinion.<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_expert_6664.html" title="User:Tennis expert">Tennis expert</a> 09:53, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just read the discussion on Dmcdevit's talk page. If Dmcdevit says on his talk page - "You are on the same IP as Cute 1 4 u" - then I it means Tennis expert is on the same IP as C14U. Note: Dmc doesn't even say same range, or same ISP. And as the community has already banned C14U, I would support a reblock of Tennis expert. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 16:13, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Have you read my talkpage on this issue?Řÿūłóñģ originally said, "This block was made because it was proven through CheckUser evidence that shows you and Tennislover are the same person, and Tennislover and Cute 1 4 u are the same person."BUT, he then amended his post to say the following, "This block was made because it was proven through CheckUser evidence that shows you and Tennislover utilize the same IP address range, and Tennislover and Cute 1 4 u do, as well."That is his last statement on the matter.Notice the reference to "IP address range."What Řÿūłóñģ says about this is relevant because he claims to have talked with Dmcdevit about this situation.So, given Řÿūłóñģ's change in position, I am not sure how you know what Dmcdevit meant when he said, "You are on the same IP...."If I wanted to say that Person A is using the same IP address as Person B, it would be very easy to be clear about such an important point and write, "Person A is using the same IP address as Person B."If I wanted to say that Person A has the same Internet provider (IP) has Person B, I might easily say, "Person A is on the same IP as Person B."And no one so far has disputed the simple fact that my IP addresses are 204.XX.XXX.XX or 76.XXX.XXX.XX (I use two Internet providers) while cute 1 4 U's IP addresses are 75.XXX.XXX.XX.<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_expert_6664.html" title="User:Tennis expert">Tennis expert</a> 17:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As someone who has been tracking the Cute 1 4 u problem since before the first block, I can assure you that this editor has caused a great deal of difficulty.My position regarding the Tennis expert account is that <i>I am sure</i> that appropriate policy has been followed and that the blocking admin and supporting admin have good reason to believe the account is another sockpuppet.I do not understand how checkuser works, technically, so <i>on the basis that I do not understand</i>, I maintain the hope that the blocking admin has made a mistake (despite good intentions and following policy).Is it possible that Tennis expert has the misfortune to edit using the same ISP as Cute 1 4 u and so <i>coincidentally</i> used the same IP address at a different time?On the assumption that this is possible, I would say that we should extend the benefit of the doubt, given that the account seems to be used only for productive edits.If this is not the case, if we are really sure that this is a sockpuppet account, it should of course remain banned.I would support an unban of the Cute 1 4 u editor only after a <b>full year</b> of no more abuse.That is, no editing of Wikipedia whatsoever.And with the understanding that the account would not use Wikipedia as a chat site, would not violate copyright (basically, would not deal with images at all), and would refrain from even a hint of personal attacks, whatever the provocation.So far, Cute 1 4 u has been unable to go even a week without violating these since the original ban and has shown absolutely no intention of editing productively since the ban was placed.I'll also go on record as stating I believe the unblocking admin made a mistake.--<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 17:30, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I no longer think that any block is supported by the evidence, and thank everyone here for the time put into this. With help from Mackensen, the evidence from CheckUser, not just behavior, doesn't support that claim. I think it was a giant misreading of the evidence, perhaps compounded by a bit of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation_bias.html" title="Confirmation bias">confirmation bias</a> in seeing Tennislover and Tennis expert at the same time. I can't really give the technical explanation that would make this mix-up seem more plausible without giving away personally identifiable information, but another checkuser agrees in the assessment based on IPs that they are different. Apologies for the undue hassle this may have caused (and note that the other two users blocked at the same time, Tennislover and Twister Twist are still confirmed Cute 1 4 u). <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 19:43, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am unsurprised by this outcome, because although I implicitly trust 99% of checkuser results, the behavioral evidence tying Tennis Expert to Cute 1 4 U in this case was exceptionally underwhelming. Dmcdevit's willingness to review the matter again is a Good Thing. I would urge that he post to Tennis Expert's talkpage as well. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 20:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It will take me a long time to get over the stuff that's been said about me all over Wikipedia because of this incident: the presumption of my evildoing by so many different editors, the unwillingness to listen to me or the evidence I've presented, the devaluing of my contributions and character,and the unfairness of the procedures that were followed.All that stuff about me is going to be "out there" (on several different user talk pages) for anyone to see.People who were not involved will wonder about me: were the allegations really true despite the ultimate outcome?There is no practical way, to my knowledge, to ensure that the stuff is deleted.The damage is done.I cannot begin to express how appalling this whole thing has been to me.<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_expert_6664.html" title="User:Tennis expert">Tennis expert</a> 20:40, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tennis expert, you should know that this discussion will be archived (and therefore pretty much won't be seen by anyone not specifically looking for it) within 48 hours after the discussion is over. You can also archive the discussion on your talk page if you are sick of looking at it (if you don't know how to create a talk archive, someone will help you), and I'm sure others with this discussion on their pages will do the same. The checkuser process is important and generally reliable, and I'm sure that the checkusers do their best to prevent this type of scenario from happening. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:09, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please note that the block summary is seen by the blocked user. It should explain to someone who unfamiliar with Wikipedia why they have been blocked. For this reason it should be a sentence without jargon and should ideally link to the policy they have been blocked for violating.</p>
<p>The summary above is not sufficient in this regard. Although in this instance the reason the username is inapropriate is clear, there are other occasions when the reason would not be obvious to anybody not intimately acquainted with our blocking policy. Compare the following edit summary, which (with the exception of the accidentally repeated word&#160;;) ) is a model of good practice:</p>

<dd>Let me explain why I did not slap a notice on the said user. This was because, after a discussion of what name a disgruntled vandal would use to impersonate <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">User:Coredesat</a>, we came up with the name of Cordlesstwat. So, one of the admins in the channel, created the user, and I, while monitoring the new user log noticed it, and immediately blocked (without autoblock checked, of course). <b>This example in question is a wrong one to take</b> (since nobody will notice it save the <b>admin</b> who created the account), though I am inclined to agree that we should be making an effort to use more descritptive block summaries in cases where the user may be confused as to what he has done wrong (shared IPs, policy infringements like 3RR), and not in cases of username blockages, where the person knows full well that they have deliberately chosen an offensive username. --<span class="user-sig user-Shreshth91">May the Force be with you!<a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShreshth91_b54e.html" title="User:Shreshth91">Shr</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../s/h/r/User_talk%7EShreshth91_b218.html" title="User talk:Shreshth91">shth91</a></span> 10:45, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>A small dent was put in the backlog on 6 Dec 2006, but the backlog is still 12 days long.Some of the items remaining in the backlog look rather complex; expert attention may be warranted.</p>

<dd>I wish I knew WP policy a bit better, but content like the Celebrities section would not appear in a published encyclopedia, so I don't think it should appear on Wikipedia.However, dictionaries do use published works to decide what to publish, and often use those quotes.So perhaps a compromise I could live with is to only keep those sections where the word "Going commando" was used -- however, the editor is choosing to add any reference to a celebrity not wearing underwear.My preferred solution is still to have the section removed, because 10 years from now it will be completely outdated, and I don't think the talk of the day should be in an encyclopedia (Unless there was a Talk of The Day December 6th, 2006 article&#160;:)). <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonemerson_b0c9.html" title="User:Jonemerson">Jonemerson</a> 20:29, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>User pages are for the users themselves to edit (usually); user talk pages, just like regular talk pages, are where discussion goes.

<p>I recently stumbled across <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_People_%28disambiguation%29_d9ce.html" title="Black People (disambiguation)">Black People (disambiguation)</a>, moved it to the correctly capitalised title of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Black people (disambiguation)">Black people (disambiguation)</a>, realised it was not linked from anywhere, and linked to it from <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a> by putting the {{<a href="../../../o/t/h/Template%7EOtheruses_bbf8.html" title="Template:Otheruses">otheruses</a>}} disambiguation hatnote at the top of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a>. Unfortunately this dab hatnote got reverted, as some people think the existence of a disambiguation page itself implies the wrong things. Anyway, the material at <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_People_%28disambiguation%29_d9ce.html" title="Black People (disambiguation)">Black People (disambiguation)</a> is mostly duplicated in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a>, but the dab page remains orphaned. Possibly <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a> is itself acting as an unorthodox type of dab page, though it should really, in my opinion, aim towards a summary style to act as a portal. The issue seems to be the conflict between having <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a> be about Black culture (compare things like <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaf_culture.html" title="Deaf culture">Deaf culture</a> where both Black and Deaf are spelt with an uppercase letter), or whether <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a> should be a summary-style article about the different 'black' peoples. Can anyone say what should be done with <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_People_%28disambiguation%29_d9ce.html" title="Black People (disambiguation)">Black People (disambiguation)</a>? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 11:58, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

But, Wikipedia is specifically not a forum, and if a talk page or project page turns into excessive irrelevant chatting, someone may come by and clean out the irrelevant content.<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 01:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see what the problem is. The day of the year articles, e.g. <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_7.html" title="December 7">December 7</a> are getting quite full. There is continual pressure to remove events that may well be notable to keep the lists short. Do you really want me to add a "films" heading to every day of the year? this is an indexing problem. There is no way to look up films by release date. I carefully combined the use of categories and lists to avoid an overly long list or an overly large category. This, my friend, is the wave of the future as people get tired of the size of the day of the year articles. Within a few years you will see "December 7 in science", "December 7 in politics", "December 7 in archeology" to get around this issue.

<p>I don't see what the problem is. The day of the year articles, e.g. <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_7.html" title="December 7">December 7</a> are getting quite full. There is continual pressure to remove events that may well be notable to keep the lists short. Do you really want me to add a "films" heading to every day of the year? this is an indexing problem. There is no way to look up films by release date. I carefully combined the use of categories and lists to avoid an overly long list or an overly large category. This, my friend, is the wave of the future as people get tired of the size of the day of the year articles. Within a few years you will see "December 7 in science", "December 7 in politics", "December 7 in archeology" to get around this issue.

<dd>Look, that's why I created separate articles, okay. I thought about it. I'm tired of your use of "cruft" and your use of the word "pointless". Why is it that WP is full of &lt;insert your own PA&gt; who refuse to even entertain that another person's point of view might be valid? I'm sure there are plenty of things you think are significant that I think should be deleted on sight. I don't do it, because there's a little thing called respect for other people that you and your ilk seem to have behind the door when god handed it out. —06:23, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I completely agree.It's doubly arbitrary in that most films go through premiere, then restricted release, then general release, then distribution, and the dates will be different in different regions (e.g. US restricted release may be weeks or even months before European general release) - and then we have the dates of release on video / DVD.You can say that a given film is a 2005 film without much controversy, but calling it a March 15 film is much more problematic. And besides, who would care? If the release is tied to a notable event - riots because of the film's content, for example - then it belongs in the main date article, otherwise it gets an official "so what?"<b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:22, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Alternative</b> - why not just create a single article entitled something like "List of movie release dates" or something like that?The article could contain a list of movies sorted by release date (year / month).<a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 14:33, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Forgive my naivete, but I also think the dates of film releases shouldn't be listed under "Events" on the Wikicalendar ("not notable on a global scale"), and I've always directed people who list them to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_film.html" title="2006 in film">2006 in film</a> and similar pages.I know this doesn't provide the exact information that a page like "March 15 in film" would provide, but the impression that I get is that "March 15 in film" is kind of getting trivial and that a user interested in what was released on March 15 would hopefully surf through a few "x-year in film" pages to find what he or she needed.<a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabricationary_b588.html" title="User:Fabricationary">Fabricationary</a> 17:30, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Ok, many editors saw use in Timecop's War on Blogs, while admitting is was a disruptive way of going about it. I say we we keep the good and remove the bad.

I have put up a first draft here User:HighInBC/Potentially not notable articles which is based off Timecop's project.</p>

<p>I have a problem. I think this is the first problem I've had on Wikipedia so far, and I've tried to solve it, but I'm afraid that my attempts to stabilize the situation were unsuccessful. Therefore, I have to bother you, the administrators of Wikipedia, for just a bit and I hope you don't mind.</p>

Almost immediately after I added the interactive map to all the links, <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a> reverted every single edit, removed the interactive map and re-installed his old map, which is basically identical with my map, but with no links to the city names and different colors: <a href="../../../s/u/b/Image%7ESubotica.png_05de.html" title="Image:Subotica.png">Old map</a> - <a href="../../../s/u/b/Image%7ESuboticaMunicip.PNG_4cd7.html" title="Image:SuboticaMunicip.PNG">New map</a>.</p>
<p>First of all, I was informed by PANONIAN that he had reverted my edits and that the map is not good. I told him that if he had a problem with the map, we can discuss it, improve it, talk about it before he starts reverting my edits (and it took me a while to add the map to all these cities:</p>

<p>I therefore reverted back to my version (which is, I repeat again, absolutely identical to the old map, except now it's better because it has links to the city names and the colors are different. He then reverted my map again. I don't understand why his version needs to be there while I'm working on a compromise between us. My map is obviously better and more functional, and Wikipedia is not the private property of PANONIAN. I put in a lot of effort into creating this map and I don't think I deserve to be undermined by this user who just wants his map there for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>He told me to add stuff to the map, I agried to do that, but not before my map is re-installed. I don't deserve to have to put my version back to every article just because he keeps reverting it. Just compare <a href="../../../s/u/b/Image%7ESubotica.png_05de.html" title="Image:Subotica.png">his map</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/b/Template%7ESubotica_Labelled_Map_fcaf.html" title="Template:Subotica Labelled Map">my map</a>. Please decide for us which map is better for the articles. If you pick my map, I will add more stuff to make it better, but I will make no changes untill PANONIAN's rude edits are reverted.</p>
<p>Once again, sorry to bother you, I know this might not mean too much to you guys, but I would like to do this for every municipality in Serbia, and if PANONIAN is going to be obstructing my work, better to solve the problem right now before this turns into something bigger, right?</p>

<dd>I cannot believe this. I removed his map and told him why I done this and asked him to improve this map before posting it again into articles, but instead to discuss this, he started to insult me personally on my talk page: he told me that "I am the most unpleasant person that he ever met" (and my previous message to him was very polite), and later he started to blackmail me that he will not improve his map if I do not revert articles to his version!!!. You have this written here, but he wrote that in Serbian, so only some admin who understand the language could read it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:PANONIAN#Mapa" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:PANONIAN#Mapa" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:PANONIAN#Mapa</a> And now he came to report me here? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 02:25, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was hoping that at least he wouldn't lie about this, but I was wrong. His first message was very unpleasant, and I said that he is the most unpleasant person that had left me a message on my talk page, not met. He later told me "What the f**k is the matter with you" (something in that sense, using a swear word). Blackmail? This user is really something.. I said that I will not change my map untill my map is re-installed (since he obviously didn't give a single good reason to remove my map). His main reason for removing my map was "its ugly and wrong". Well, I don't know about the ugly, but the content is identical, that would make his map wrong as well, right? I mean, just compare the two.. --<a href="../../../b/o/%C5%BE/User%7EBo%C5%BEe_pravde_dfae.html" title="User:Bože pravde"><small><b><big>G</big></b>OD <b>O</b>F <b><big>J</big></b>USTICE</small></a> 02:31, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>PANONIAN, could you elaborate on what problems you have with the new version of the map?Bože pravde says, "He told me to add stuff to the map," but I see no differences in content between the new map and the old map, except that the new map is more functional.If you could explain your problems with the map, perhaps all involved can understand where you're coming from.Also, if I may, I make a humble request that future discussion be in English — this is the English Wikipedia, and it's hard for English speakers to follow along if it's in a different language that not everyone is familiar with. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbats</font></b></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><b><font color="#008000">e</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">ll</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 02:40, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah-ha! That would explain it&#160;:) I'm not sure why you're not able to see the map correctly, though — I took a look at the HTML code being generated by the template in question and it appears to be very simple and should pose no problems to browsers, but perhaps try upgrading or using a different web browser, such as <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozilla_Firefox_3b86.html" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a>?

<p>After a user attempted to get me topic-banned from several articles I edit (and have recently started up a WikiProject for), I thought nothing of it, but did send messages to the various users involved, but then after an IP posted to my user talk, I found these <a href="http://www.funaroverse.db-destiny.net/fbBB/viewtopic.php?t=1372&amp;highlight=ryulong" class="external text" title="http://www.funaroverse.db-destiny.net/fbBB/viewtopic.php?t=1372&amp;highlight=ryulong" rel="nofollow">three</a> <a href="http://www.funaroverse.db-destiny.net/fbBB/viewtopic.php?t=1089&amp;highlight=ryulong" class="external text" title="http://www.funaroverse.db-destiny.net/fbBB/viewtopic.php?t=1089&amp;highlight=ryulong" rel="nofollow">wonderful</a> <a href="http://www.funaroverse.db-destiny.net/fbBB/viewtopic.php?t=1167&amp;highlight=ryulong" class="external text" title="http://www.funaroverse.db-destiny.net/fbBB/viewtopic.php?t=1167&amp;highlight=ryulong" rel="nofollow">threads</a> that come up on a search of my username (<a href="http://rangerboard.com/showthread.php?t=97927" class="external text" title="http://rangerboard.com/showthread.php?t=97927" rel="nofollow">this one at another board mentions me in passing</a>), several of which do reference actions I took concerning the validity of source material from people who work with Disney/ABC/ESPN etc in the topic of Power Rangers.

<li>The very first edit I looked at confirmed my suspicions. This is the sockpuppeteer Licinius/J is me/Jimididit/NSWelshman/FactoidKiller/Jebus Christ/etc/etc/etc. He has literally hundreds of socks. He is recognised by his penchant for insisting that <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a> be called Victorian rules football. Block indefinitely on sight as a sock of a banned troll/vandal. <a href="../../../h/e/s/User_talk%7EHesperian_5634.html" title="User talk:Hesperian">Hesperian</a> 04:49, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hi, unfortunately came upon this. Do not wish to seem that I am trolling but by all means, do a checkuser etc. because I am not <a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELicinius_c6d0.html" title="User:Licinius">user:Licinius</a>. To Hesp, I left a mention on your talk page about the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_cringe.html" title="Cultural cringe">Cultural cringe</a> edit(sorry it had to be your first that you saw of mine, please check more). It is not revolutionary to make mention of terms like gayfl, VFL. Victorian Rules is not one I had seen much, but I will endeavour to use it more as a payout. Please direct me in whatever means of proof that I can provide that I am not user:Licinius. Here is some further evidence, on Licinius's homepage, it says that he loves soccer, definitely not my opinion, nor would I refer to <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> as not directly being football. Hesp has also been attacked by the same user here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:J_is_me&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57791482" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:J_is_me&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57791482" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> which would tend to indicate that this whole conspiracy does not really exist. Also on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:J_is_me" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:J_is_me" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, J is me is trying to prove that factoid and NSWelshman is the same editor so that blows the whole one giant crusade out the window. In fact if you put a Licinius IP number&#160;:User:60.225.200.50(from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Suspected_Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Licinius" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Suspected_Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Licinius" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> into www.ip-address.com it comes up from Sydney, at <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortdale.html" title="Mortdale">Mortdale</a>, if you put the the FactoidKiller IP:62.254.168.102 at user:talk Jisme(which is referenced above), it is in north Yorkshire in England. --<a href="../../../r/u/g/User%7ERugby_666_1790.html" title="User:Rugby 666">Rugby 666</a> 11:59, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Wow. That's an amazingly sophisticated analysis for someone who has been here less than a month. So I guess you're not Licinius; you're just someone who edits the same pages as Licinius, uses the same obscure phrases as Licinius, and has intimate knowledge of what Licinius did several months before your first edit.</dd>
<dd>I can't block; I've been hosing down Licinius sockfires for so long my judgement may be clouded.

<dd>Jaysus, I defend my bloody self that I am supposedly a huge conspiratoralist vandal, as the bloody advice is, by readin the bloody talk pages of one of the bllody IDs that I am supposed to be, which repudiates in itself the whole bloody conspiracy.

<dd>If the rules of wiki is so, then if two users decided to revert a third persons edit, they can going on edits closely following him.

<dd>Also I noticed commonly, this user <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">User:Venu62</a> use to note this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Ayyavazhi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Ayyavazhi" rel="nofollow">What links here</a> section of Ayyavazhi page and complain to many user as spamm, spammer etc...

One who is intrested in Christianity will edit and write many Christianity related works, and who is interested towards Religion, then he will contribute to Religion related works. They use to spend more effort and time the more they are devoted to the topic. If it was called as spamm then Religious users want to be called as Religious spammers, and Christian users should be called as Christian spammers and etc...</dd>

<dd>If Tamil Nadu is a state in India, then unavoidably it should be be noted in India article as its Sub-national entity.

<dd>So, let me get this straight, if an admin wants to speedy delete something you have to go through DRV and then through AFD to get it kept? Am I the only one who things this not only goes against the spirit of the undeletion policy that this could potentially lead to all sorts of trouble? -<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 10:09, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely not. DRV frequently comes back with a result of <b>undelete, do not send to AFD</b>. Frequently the deleting admin will undelete it themselves upon seeing the consensus emerging at DRV after a day or two. Talking <i>to the deleting admin directly</i> is another (and quicker) alternative, but posting for an admin, any admin, to undelete is asking for a wheel war IMO. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 19:08, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, here goes: <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHildanknight_74fc.html" title="User:Hildanknight">User:Hildanknight</a> suffers autoblocks due to his IP address being in Singapore (and belonging to half the place) and therefore thinks that anons should not be allowed to edit. He's been blocked for sockpuppetry involving the creation of inflammatory usernames that protested anon editing and he has made clear that he will not rest until they are not longer allowed to use Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I think he has taken it to a whole other level, however. My suspicion arises due to the heavy number of articles he requests for protection that actually <i>get protected</i>. He has a nasty habit of going to <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">RFPP</a> everytime anyone vandalises just about <i>anything</i>, and usually he gets told off for doing so.</p>
<p>But all of a sudden, every request he starting making would go through. Whenever he would add a page to RFPP, it would have enough vandalism to merit protection. Why? That's what I wondered.</p>
<p>Until I discovered that ninety percent of the edits were from <b>Singapore's common IP address</b>!</p>
<p>Take, for instance, <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everton_F.C._db0c.html" title="Everton F.C.">Everton F.C.</a>. Hildanknight requested page protection because of its extensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Everton_F.C.&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Everton_F.C.&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history of bad edits</a>. Look closer, though, and you will see that <a href="../../../2/1/8/User_talk%7E218.186.8.12.html" title="User talk:218.186.8.12">218.186.8.12</a>, aka Hildanknight's IP, vandalised the article eight times in a row. Notice also, that <i>Hildanknight reverts the edits every time</i>-<b>but</b> he's always <i>one minute off' the IP's edit. Just enough time to log in and out, I'd say.</i></p>
<p>You will notice that these edits are always one-two minutes apart and Hildanknight almost always reverts. The revert(s) that are not his were probably caught in RC.</p>
<ul>
<li>Singapore IP blanks, one minute later HK reverts: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Everton_F.C.&amp;diff=92454861&amp;oldid=92450040" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Everton_F.C.&amp;diff=92454861&amp;oldid=92450040" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Everton_F.C.&amp;diff=92455001&amp;oldid=92454861" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Everton_F.C.&amp;diff=92455001&amp;oldid=92454861" rel="nofollow">[47]</a></li>

<li>Check Hildanknight's contribs for the time those four vandalism edit took place: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hildanknight" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hildanknight" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>. He has absolutely no edits in the timeframe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking through his contribs, I found this behavior increasingly common and very disturbing. As I don't have an account, I am unable to open an RFC or RFCHECK against him. Also, me internet connection is very limited and I'm burning the little time I have writing this. Could someone with more time please dig deeper into this scary anti-anon hole I'm looking at? Hildanknight, I think, is trying to give the IP's everywhere a bad name and make it seem like they should no longer be allowed to edit by vandalising under his shared IP and then requesting protection after <i>reverting his own edits</i>. Please, someone help.--172.191.155.230 00:40, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe it is time to get an account? Anyway what is your theory? HK vandalising an article many times just to get it semiprotected? Looks like a big effort for a very small gain IMHO. It is easily to imagine that the article is on his watchlist that he refreshes frequently (or monitors using the Lupin tool, or whatever). <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 00:51, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Pasting my message to Admin:Ragib</b>&#160;:I'd like to request you to warn Parthi to stop his mudslinging against srkris.He has no proof that the anon ip is srkris and yet even after his attempts for a checkuser were ignored by the checkuser admins, he's acting like he has solid proof that the ip and srkris are the same and is continuing with his shameless mudslinging.Until the checkuser results come in(he has appealed again), this mudslinging by Parthi so 'matter-of-factly' is nothing short of misinformation and slander.Even if the checkuser rules in favour of Parthi, these messages(he has spammed these messages to all and sundry and even on talk pages of articles!) are still slander.</dd>

<dd>For all we know the ip may even be User:Parthi himself or maybe some other totally unrelated user(<i>anybody</i> for that matter) who is trying to impersonate User:Srkris.Neither the ip nor srkris have done anything against the rules of wikipedia and whatever disputes there may be they are all still under consideration and deliberations.User:Venu62 has no right to appropriate the moral high ground for himself and the reason i am intervening(note that I had scrupulously stayed out of this for nearly 2 months and have entered it only in the last couple of days) is because his private fight with srkris is spilling over everywhere and disrupting constructive editing.</dd>

<dd>And as far as srkris' supposed copyvios are concerned, I'd just like to say that as one who has attempted to upload pics unsuccessfully in the past, all the rules concerning uploading pics are very very vague for people new to uploading pics.As an admin, I'd like you to discuss this with other admins on irc perhaps, and come up with better wording for what is permissible and what is not.As it stands now, there's just too many vague rules and guidelines out there.Thanks. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 23:27, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, Essjay hit the 84.166.0.0/16 range with a month-long block. Gazing at the log, there were certainly some sound reasons for doing so.

<p>I am confused with <a href="../../../i/m/a/Category%7EImages_with_no_fair_use_rationale_0e68.html" title="Category:Images with no fair use rationale">no fair use rationale category</a>.

<ul>
<li>Image:Anthony Mark Greene.jpg</li>
<li>Image:Ayaotdcab.png</li>
<li>Image:CarusoMilos CSIMiami.jpg<br /></li>

<dd>The first has a source but no rationale; the other two have rationales, but they're woefully inadequate.For comparison <a href="../../../f/a/i/Image%7EFairuse_Gruffalo.jpg_2965.html" title="Image:Fairuse Gruffalo.jpg">Image:Fairuse Gruffalo.jpg</a> has a reasonable fair use rationale. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 15:12, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note specifically that an image can not be intrinsically "fair use", it's only fair use <i>on a specific article</i>, and the rationale has to mention that article (or a <i>small</i> number of articles) and explain <i>for each</i> why it's fair use <i>in that specific context</i>. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 15:13, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the input Finlay McWalter, now I got a better idea for that. For example, <a href="../../../f/a/i/Image%7EFairuse_Gruffalo.jpg_2965.html" title="Image:Fairuse Gruffalo.jpg">Image:Fairuse Gruffalo.jpg</a> has two file links, whereas it is fair use rationale for only one article, i.e. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gruffalo_cf23.html" title="The Gruffalo">The Gruffalo</a>. Then image should be removed from another listed article? How these cases could be handled, once it was removed from the page and again someone uses the image on another article? <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyam_Bihari_9010.html" title="User:Shyam Bihari"><font color="black"><b>Shyam</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/y/User_talk%7EShyam_Bihari_b27a.html" title="User talk:Shyam Bihari"><font color="orange"><b>T</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shyam_Bihari_1d48.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shyam Bihari"><font color="red"><b>C</b></font></a>)</sup> 15:24, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've removed it from the other page, indeed the fair use rationale only covers one of the pages and on the page about the author doesn't even meet the basics of the tag applied to the image "to illustrate an article discussing the book in question", where the article on the author doesn't do. It would fail <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html#Policy" title="WP:FU">criteria 8 of the fairuse policy</a> "The material must contribute significantly to the article (e.g. identify the subject of an article, or specifically illustrate relevant points or sections within the text) and must not serve a purely decorative purpose." --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 16:46, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheikh_al-Hilali_70c3.html" title="Sheikh al-Hilali">Sheikh al-Hilali</a> is listed at AfD.

<p><a href="../../../s/c/_/Category%7ESC_Johnson_brands_d827.html" title="Category:SC Johnson brands">Category:SC Johnson brands</a> was malformed.It shows as a redlink, but when you click the redlink start this category the category shows up. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> 01:32, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>That's not unusual.It means that there are several articles that have had the category added to them; it works similarly to 'what links here' for red-links, at the title level.Take a look at <a href="../../../d/r/%C4%81/Dr%C4%81no.html" title="Drāno">Drāno</a> and you'll see a red cat-link at the bottom.There are a variety of reasons why this might happen, but I think we can rule out prior existence followed by deletion because the deletion log for the category is empty. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 01:38, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>P.S. note the category Category:S.C. Johnson brands, which is empty and up for renaming - it looks like there's been some activity around trying to create a category by perhaps an inexperienced editor. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 01:41, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.P.S. Well - there you are, participating in that discussion - gee. I didn't mean to insult if I did with the 'inexperienced' comment - it was a speculation. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 01:43, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed.Someone moved the articles in the category but not the category itself.--<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 02:46, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
