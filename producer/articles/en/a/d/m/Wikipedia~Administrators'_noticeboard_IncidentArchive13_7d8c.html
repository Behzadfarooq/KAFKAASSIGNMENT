<p>There is a "semi-policy" which says that it is advisable to delete personal attacks on Talk pages. I don't know what a "semi-policy" is, but clearly it countenances the deletion of comments on Talk pages. As soon as you have a policy that sanctions the deletion of personal attacks, it opens the question as to what is a "personal attack". When is a personal attack just "criticism"? Who decides what is a personal attack and which personal attacks to delete? The person who feels attacked? Some neutral third-party? Also, again I ask: what policy gives RickK the authority to block somebody for this reason? The policies give administrators authority to block people in a limited number of situations. This is not one of them. We have an Arbitration Committee for dealing with behaviour that might require sanction that falls outside those specific situations. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:16, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The policy that gives RickK the authority to block somebody is vandalism. <a href="../../../c/p/s/User%7ECPS_4612.html" title="User:CPS">CPS</a> is deleting other user's comments on article talk pages (ie, not the user talk page). This can be construed as vandalism, and IMO, is a blockable offense. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 15:25, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well deleting user's comments on article talk pages is not <b>prime facie</b> vandalism since, as I said, there is a "semi-policy" that actually advises people to do this in the case of personal attacks; namely <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks</a>. There might be some debate about whether something is a personal attack, but the consequence of getting that wrong should not be that one is summarily found guilty of "vandalism" and blocked forthwith. Moreover, assuming the behaviour in question is vandalism, with respect to vandalism, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a> states: <i>Logged-in users that do essentially nothing but vandalism may also be blocked for the same time periods. However, user accounts that perform a mixture of valid edits and vandalism should not be blocked in this manner. Blocks should not be used against isolated incidents of vandalism.</i> In other words, even if this behaviour is "vandalism", which is debatable, administrators are not authorized to block a logged-in user for vandalism, unless the account is only be used for vandalism. What do these policies mean if administrators can make up the rules as they go along? Do administrators blocking people actually pay any attention to these policies, or are they all doing what they consider to be "the right thing", reckoning that they will be backed up by the consensus? Are administrators actually expected to read and comply with these policies? If the administrators aren't expected to read and comply with them, why should anybody be expected to? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:05, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Obviously trying to apply <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks</a> and getting it wrong is not a reason to be blocked. But that's not what happened here, so what is your argument? The key thing that you don't understand BM is that administrators are trusted members of the community and are <i>supposed</i> to use thier judgement. RickK warned the user that he'd block if he removed anymore comments.This is not a well meaning but misguided user trying to apply policy. This is someone who deleted comments from a vfd debate because they critisised his behaviour. I for one fully support the 24 hour block.

If applied widely it might well make a Wiki unusable because it could become infested with trolls determined to take offense at the least negative statement. It can be a very effective tool, however, for keeping a discussion on track where one or two participants get into flame war mode, or where one obnoxious person is trying to bait you with insults. My rule of thumb is that if a sentence or fragment is solely intended to draw a negative inference concerning another editor it can be removed without changing the salient facts conveyed. "There is no evidence to support X's claim--he's clearly lying" can be reduced to "There is no evidence to support X's claim." --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:11, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whether the behaviour is appropriate or not, neither Mgm nor Theresa is addressing the fundamental point. The main question is not whether this behaviour is appropriate or not, it is WHO DECIDES and WHO APPLIES THE SANCTION for misbehaviour. The project has policies. What do those policies mean? In this case, one can argue about whether the behaviour was permitted under <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks</a>. But even if it was inappropriate behaviour, it is not VANDALISM, and even if it were, administrators cannot block logged-in users for VANDALISM under the blocking policy. Whenever this type of topic comes up, people always dodge the basic question as to administrator powers and conformity with policy, and try to focus on the behaviour that prompted the admin action. The presumption seems to be that if the behaviour was inappropriate (even if there is no policy against it), then any administrator has power to deal with it. It is like trying to excuse a cop for roughting someone up by arguing: "Well anyway he was guilty, and look, besides that, he isn't a very nice guy". My point is that in general ADMINISTRATORS HAVE NO POWERS to discipline logged-in regular members for misbehaviour, except in certain specific situations defined by policy. This isn't one of those situations. The only people with power to deal with it are JIMBO and the ARBITRATION COMMITTEE (as a group). That is the issue here. If you want to tell me I'm wrong and that admins have greater powers than I think, please point me to where it says that. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 21:06, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, it isn't me who is excessively legalistic. The whole ethos of the Wikipedia is legalistic -- what with its extensive "policies" and "semi-policies" (good grief!), and a quasi-judicial "arbitration committee", with "petitioners", "respondents", "evidence", etc. However, it is all a bit of a sham, in my opinion, because there seems to be a group of administrators who basically discipline other members as they see fit, and the fact that there is no policy which authorizes their actions doesn't seem to slow them down much. I really don't even object to this, since I'm the God-King on my own web-site, and on my own site if the Terms of Use stop me from keeping things running smoothly, I just change the Terms of Use. If Jimbo wanted to designate "super-administrators" with greater discretion than others to block other users, etc, regardless of policy, I wouldn't object. The only thing I object to, really, is the intellectual dishonesty of the current situation -- the fact that administrators are described as "janitors", etc, subject to the same policies and consensus as everyone else, but that it is not really so. I think the actual system should be made clear. It would be kind of nice to know who those super-administrators are, too, and how and why they were chosen. Either that, or maybe people should be doing what the policies say they are supposed to be doing (and not doing what the policies say they shouldn't be doing.) --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:13, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Firstly blocking someone for 24 hours from editing a website is nothing like a cop roughing someone up. Please let's keep things in perspective. Really BM you need to pick your fights mate. Yeah you're right administrators are more than janitors. They are <i>trusted</i> members of the community. trusted that is not to abuse their powers. RickK did not abuse his powers in this case. We are all here for the same reason. Namely to build an encylopedia. Our policies are here to help us do that, and to prevent admins from <i>abusing</i> their power. Policies are not laws, and they are not straight jackets. This is a clear case of someone who was being disruptive, they were warned not do do something, and that warning was reasonable, yet they persisted. Note that we have no policy that states admins should use a measure of common sense. The power that RickK, and other admins have comes from the community. If you think he shouldn't have blocked CPS you are going to have to go to the community on it. Start a rfc. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(ask the rotten)</a> 23:24, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there's a problem in that admins tend to make reference to their powers too often. When asking someone to stop doing something, one need only ask; there isn't necessarily any need to threaten: most people will stop even if they have no idea you're an admin. But an arrogant pretense of authority is enough to goad some people into continuing whatever behavior they shouldn't have been doing. A person should <i>really</i> have to be causing some problems to warrant a block. Page move vandalism, uploading vandalistic images, repeatedly blanking pages, etc. Blocking people is serious business: if a revert is a slap in the face, then a block breaks a nose and knocks out some teeth. It's not something one should do without a very clear and indisputable reason. A block does two very serious things: it prevents a person from contributing, when they could be doing a lot of good work, and it marginalizes the person and fills the person with animosity, and turns them off from the project. So we need to be more careful. If you can reasonably expect some people to dispute the block, don't do it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 00:12, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Theresa, I appreciate the advice, but in fact I am picking my fights. If I chose to protest cases where everybody was protesting -- where everybody thought that the admin had been unreasonable and the outcome unjust -- the issue would be buried. Nobody argues that administrators should be able to abuse their powers in order to achieve an unreasonable result. Everybody will be saying the administrator abused his powers in those cases. Those are not the interesting cases. I am saying it is an abuse of powers, EVEN WHEN THE OUTCOME IS REASONABLE. It is only when the result is reasonable that there is an issue about the process. My argument is that Wikipedia cannot have 400+ administrators all exercising their "judgement" about what is reasonable. If the policies are getting in the way of administrators dealing efficiently with problems, then we should fix the policies. The blocking policy SAYS, very clearly, with no latitude for interpretation, that administrators are not supposed to block logged-in users for vandalism unless the account has been, in essence, used exclusively for vandalism. If that is not the consensus of the community, and administrators are not obliged to follow the policy when in their "judgement" it shouldn't be applicable, then why does the policy state that? The policy could easily state what you say is the de-facto consensus: "Administrators can block logged-in members for vandalism after a warning for up to 24 hours. But it doesn't state that. Why not? If you think it should, then why not try to get consensus for a change in the policy. If the de facto consensus is already there, it shouldn't be hard. What is the meaning of these policies if any administrator can substitute his or her own opinion as to what the policies should be? Why bother having written policies that contradict what you claim is the unwritten consensus? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:16, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let's look at the blocking policy:</p>
<p>"Sysops may, <b>at their judgement</b>, block IP addresses that disrupt the normal functioning of Wikipedia. (emphasis mine)</p>
<p>Now does removing people's signed comments from a vfd debate disrupt the functioning of vfd? Of course it does! When the admin who has to decide whether to delete a page or not comes to the page they need to be able to read through what everyone has said. If you don't agree that this user should have been blocked you really should start a rfc and see what the community thinks <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(ask the rotten)</a> 00:50, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, now you a shifting to another pretext for the action. The disruption policy. Which is it, disruption or vandalism? And you've dodged my basic point and your previous answer, and are now arguing about policy again. So does that mean you have conceded my point that administrators should follow policy?

Here is where we have a difference of opinion - I'm saying that administrators have to use thier judgement sometimes, whereas you are arguing that they shouldn't. We can argue this all day but we won't get anywhere. I feel admins are there to serve the community by making descisions and exercising good judgement. They shouldn't abuse thier powers, but they shouldn't be afraid to use them when doing so is the right thing to do. You are not going to change my mind on that. BTW I never claimed he was blocked for vandalism and neither did RickK, and we are not arguing pretexts we are giving reasons.</dd>

<dd>You are correct that it wasn't RickK that claimed this block was under the rubric of vandalism. He didn't bother to mention which policy sanctioned it, and I dare say he was not detained much by the need to find one, since he was exercising his "judgement" and that, according to you, is sufficient.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yep, you'll notice how he also posted his actions here for review.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So lets look at "disruption". If you actually look at User:CPS' edit history, you find only two cases where CPS edited Talk pages or VfD and removed comments, going all the way back into February. One of these was on Mar 24, where he twice removed the same Megan1964 comment from a VfD vote that was referenced above. This was not a vote, but a comment critical of CPS' vote on VfD. One can argue about whether it was a personal attack,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It clearly isn't and he was warned not to do it a second time but he went ahead and did it anyway.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>but as we discussed above, there is a policy allowing removal of personal attacks,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No there isn't.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>and if there is a (semi-)policy allowing for their removal, then it should not be deemed a blockable disruption if someone somewhat oversteps consensus about what constitutes a personal attack.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes it should in a clear case like this one</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The other case was on Mar 21, where CPS blanked <a href="../../../1/9/8/User_talk%7E198.82.71.55.html" title="User talk:198.82.71.55">User_talk:198.82.71.55</a>. This was his own Talk page from before he registered as User:CPS, and the comments he removed were all in Nov-Dec, 2004.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Irrelavent. The block was for the above two removals of other people's comments from a vfd page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, removing one marginal comment on VfD, and blanking the Talk page he had as an anon before registering. Still think this was sufficient disruption of Wikipedia to warrant being blocked, Theresa? To me it doesn't look disruptive at all. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:12, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I know exactly what he did, i read through his past contributions before commenting here. I even posted a link further up the page where he removed a vote from a vfd listing.

<dd>Yes, IMO, it was vandalism, and my opinion only, no-one else's. BM, I think I mentioned this before, but if every admin did things the way you suggest, they'd be looking up policy 2.3, section A, paragraph 32, subparagraph C "Woops, better check another section", while bad faith editors are hammering away at Wikipedia and laughing at us for being so slow to react. Sometimes, police, customs agents, detectives act on instinct honed from experience. I think admins are trusted members of the community who are experienced enough to spot a bad faith editor when they see it. If they're wrong, there are many other admins who can revert. I've read this board long enough to know that other admins can and will revert when they think the action is wrong. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 03:06, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nonsense. <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a> is short. So are the other policies. An admin can be reasonably expected to know these policies. You'd think before an admin blocked somebody, he might concern himself with whether he is allowed to do that. Nobody compelled them to become admins, and since the community is trusting them to follow policy and comply with consensus, they had better know what the policies and consensus are. Besides, the policies are simple. For example <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a> gives admins wide latitude to deal with vandalism by blocking anonymous IP's. That is the "mop and bucket brigade" part of the job. It cautions admins to be very circumspect and conservative when blocking logged-in users. Admin's don't have to carry and thick law books. It is simple: when dealing with other established members of Wikipedia, you have very little weight to throw around, so don't. That is why we have the Arbitration Committee. Unfortunately, there are quite a lot of admins who won't accept this. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 03:40, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Theresa so we are down to whether removing one comment on VFD was "disruptive". Note that RickK's justification above is "repeatedly deleting other people's comments on VFD and Talk pages". "Repeated" turns out to be one comment deleted twice. Let us look at the edit histories.</p>
<ol>
<li>At 6:21 21 Mar, he blanked his old User_talk page from when he was an anon.</li>
<li>At 6:24 21 Mar, RickK asked him on his Talk page why he had done this. CPS doesn't seem to have replied.</li>
<li>At 10:26 21 Mar, Megan1964 made the following comment on VfD/List of dead rappers: <i>Well I guess your plea is better than simply blanking/removing/censoring other people's votes you dont agree with which you have a previous record of doing btw. Thank goodness you don't run a democracy. P.S. I seriously doubt there is a pro-Libertarian bias on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 10:26, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</i> This seems like a personal attack to me, although in fairness, it is in response to an ad hominem comment by CPS concerning Megan's vote. Whether it is a personal attack or not, I can see someone reasonably considering it to be one. Incidentally, I'm not sure where Megan1967 found evidence for this accusation; certainly it wasn't recent behaviour.</li>
<li>At 10:47 21 Mar, he reverted the comment, with the edit summary was <i>rv immature and irrelevant remarks</i>.</li>
<li>At 20:34 21 Mar, RickK restored the deleted comment, with the edit summary <i>restoring Megan's comments improperly deleted by CPS</i></li>
<li>At 20:36 21 Mar, RickK wrote on his Talk page: <i>PLEASE stop removing other people's comments from Talk and VfD pages. This is vandalism, and will result in your being blocked from editing. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 20:36, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)</i></li>
<li>Three days later, at 3:15, 24 Mar he reverted the Megan1967 comment in the VfD again, this time with the edit summary, <i>these are personal attacks meant to distract from the actual issue at hand...please Megan1967, grow up</i>. This makes it clear that he considered the comment to be a personal attack, the removal of which is allowed by the "semi-" policy, <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks</a>.</li>
<li>A few minutes later at 3:21, 24 Mar he removed the two edits by RickK from his Talk page.</li>
<li>At 5:43, RickK blocked him for <i>repeatedly deleting other people's comments on VfD and Talk pages. Has been cautioned before)</i>.</li>
</ol>
<p>From this sequence, it is clear to me that CPS thought he was removing personal attacks from a VFD, and the User Talk pages he was editing were his own. Also, RickK warned him about vandalism, but these edits were not vandalism, and anyway as we discussed above, administrators don't have the authority to block logged-in users for vandalism. As for whether it was disruption, I don't see how removing one comment from a VfD vote, especially the one in question, could be construed as disruption of the Wikipedia rising to the level of blocking. Nor can I see it being disruption justifying a block to edit your own Talk pages. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 03:22, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, if any admin agrees with you, they will unblock CPS. FWIW (not being an admin), I don't think RickK was in the wrong here. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 03:38, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The amount of time spent in pointless, wasteful, inane wiki-lawyering here boggles my mind. Get a life, and use that energy doing something which actually contributes to the real point of this project - produce some content.</p>
<p>Having said that, one comment, about the claim that "administrators don't have the authority to block logged-in users for vandalism". If that were true, all vandals would have to do is sign up for a user-name, and we'd have to resort to the ArbComm to get rid of them. People block vandals with user-names every day. The policy says something rather different. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:02, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not really. Why do we have these policies if it is "inane wiki-lawyering" to actually read them? Have you not read the blocking policy? What it actually says is that a logged-in user cannot be banned for vandalism unless the account is used "effectively" only for vandalism. So, yes, what you put forward as obviously stupid is precisely what the policy states: if someone intent on vandalism creates an account and makes some number of reasonable-looking edits, then according to the policy he cannot be blocked for vandalism by an administrator. It also says that a logged-in user cannot be blocked for "isolated vandalism". Presumably the vandal can still be blocked by Jimbo or the ArbComm. I would not argue that this policy is especially logical, but that is what it clearly states. (Really. Read it.) So what is the solution? (1) all the administrators just ignore the policy and try to follow the "unwritten consensus" about when they can block people, whatever they might think that consensus is; or (2) we revise the policy so that it reflects the de facto consensus. It is obvious that most admins have decided on option (1). Since few people seem to care what the policies really state, option (2) is just too much trouble. This is basically my point: the policies are more or less shams and nobody pays much attention to them except when they happen to support his pre-conceived position. When they don't support what someone wants to do -- well too bad for the policy and any "inane wiki-lawyers" with the poor taste and lack of common sense to mention the policies. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:25, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BM, I think you may be slightly misinterpreting the blocking policy. You have repeatedly quoted the following line: "Logged-in users that do essentially nothing but vandalism may also be blocked for the same time periods. However, user accounts that perform a mixture of valid edits and vandalism should not be blocked in this manner." Taken out of context, it appears that logged-in users should not be blocked, but if you notice, the phrase "the same time periods" and "in this manner" refers to the earlier sentences. I recently became an administrator and I have read through the relevant policies very carefully; this is how I interpret the Vandalism section: Dynamic IPs should be blocked for 24 hours. Static IPs should initially be blocked for 24 hours; repeat violators for increasing amounts of time up to one month; and that there are various rules of thumb for the schedule of increases. Then comes "Logged-in users that do essentially nothing but vandalism may also be blocked <i>for the same time periods</i>. However, user accounts that perform a mixture of valid edits and vandalism should not be blocked <i>in this manner</i>." (emphasis mine) I interpret this to mean that if a logged-in user is only vandalizing, he may be blocked <i>for the same time periods</i>, that is, up to a month for repeated vandalism. However, an account that is performing a mixture of edits should not be blocked <i>in this manner</i>; that is, not using the same increasing block lengths. However, it does not say that logged-in users who have good and bad edits should not be blocked at all. This seems the most logical interpretation to me, but perhaps we can reword it if you feel it is ambiguous. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 18:43, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BM, there's some page I spent a while looking for (and couldn't find) that basically said "not all policy on Wikipedia is written down". (It might have been <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html#How_are_policies_decided.3F" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines#How are policies decided?</a> that I was thinking of: <i>In many cases, policies are not always formally written down</i>. Or perhaps the page I was thinking of has been edited since I saw it. And of course there's always <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Wikipedia:Ignore all rules</a> - <i>simply use common sense .. Being too wrapped up in rules can cause you to lose perspective</i>.)</dd>
<dd>I agree that there is a problem where <i>policies are more or less shams and nobody pays much attention to them except when they happen to support [their] pre-conceived position</i>. However, more detailed written policies aren't the answer to this - without more time and energy than we are (in practise) willing to expend (first to formulate policy, second to have everyone learn it, and third to do it in practise), that will make the problem worse, not better. Perhaps we have some janitors who aren't suited to mop-n-broom duty, whose "common sense" (above) isn't up to snuff. But the answer to that is to exercise better care on selecting janitors. I myself would be in favour of a mandatory "probationary period" - i.e. new janitors get a month on the job, so people can see them actually in action, and then have to go through the approval process again to get permanent janitor status. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 16:00, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BM is absoluetly right. If people think that current policies are unworkable, they should change them, not disregard them. The persistent attitude that procedure and consistency in enforcement of policy are irrelevant, as long as there is a general consensus that the result is right, is what gives rise to the sneering and the threats and everything else that gives Wikipedia the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Flies_1843.html" title="Lord of the Flies">Lord of the Flies</a> feel. At least that's what turned <i>me</i> off Wikipedia. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 22:42, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Coming back to this discussion after a bit of gap, I think Noel is leaning a bit hard on the "in this manner" phrase to find justification in the blocking policy for an admin blocking a logged-in user with a reasonable number of edits for "vandalism". Why would the policy make an exception for a logged in user, anyway? It seems to me clear that the intent of the policy is that a logged-in user who has made a reasonable number of good faith edits and is a "member of the community" is to be given the benefit of the doubt and some immunity from the actions of administrators. That is why we have the Arbitration Committee and Jimbo. A user who is not logged in need not be treated with that deference, and administrators need not be slowed down in dealing with vandalism from such users. The in-between case of a named user who starts committing vandalism without having established himself as a member of the community (by making a reasonable number of good faith edits) is treated more or less the same as an anon user. That is, creating an account is not a get-out-of-jail free card.</p>
<p>As for whether the policies should be revised, I think there are several people who would be willing to work on revising the policies, if it was not apparently a waste of time and if they were not so likely to be insulted as "wiki lawyers", etc. Such a revision would be difficult: many users would resist policies that gave administrators de jure the authority which they habitually assume de facto. If you look at the history of these matters, only policies that very clearly circumscribe the authority of administrators ever pass. (These circumscribed policies are then very liberally interpreted by the administrators: look at 3RR.) But any revised policies which did not give administrators something approaching their de facto powers would simply be ignored in the name of "common sense", with the Arb Comm (and Jimbo) more likely to censure critics than admins who overstep the policies. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:12, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd really like to hear from Neutrality about what he thought the justification was. This seems worse than just an honest mistake, based on a reasonable, but erroneous, interpretation of events.

<p>The subject has been stalking me from forum to forum since long before these discussion threads represent. I've warned him repeatedly and simply finally decided to report him. There should be absolutely no place on Wikipedia for this kind of blatantly racist vitriol. In the past, I have at times lost patience with him and responded angrily. In the last several weeks, however, I have maintained my composure, admonishing him to stop such behavior -- without success. Interestingly, when I've lost my temper with him (or with other Wikipedians who have engaged in unfortunate behavior directed toward me) other Wikipedians have admonished only me. Keep in mind that the posts that follow are only some of exchanges that have taken place between this user and me. Not once has anyone in these forums reproached this person about his behavior -- not once. This kind of selective treatment and the repeated overlooking of such despicable behavior on the part of a member of the Wiki community is unacceptable. I can only interpret such behavior as racism. It's time for Wikipedia to do something about this individual, and it's time for other Wikipedia members to clean up their act as well in this regard. deeceevoice 13:20, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jayjg is correct that the personal attack policy does not empower admins to enforce it by blocking. There has even been an attempt to gain consensus to revise the policy to allow admins to block people who make personal attacks. This failed. However, this does not stop administrators from blocking people for personal attacks anyway. As you see from Calton's post, in reality it happens all the time. Basically, many of the administrators don't bother too much with policies. They assume authority that they think the policies SHOULD give them, and for which they think there should be consensus, without too much regard for what the policies actually say and what the consensus has proved to be when actually tested by votes, etc. Accordingly, it really shouldn't be hard for deeceevoice to find some admin willing to block wareware for his racist comments. Nevertheless, I would suggest that deeceevoice bring this case to the Arbitration Committee. Because when there are 400+ administrators all deciding for themselves what the policies and consensus are, it might be easy to find an admin to block someone, but it is just as easy to find another admin who will unblock him. It is better to go to the Arbitration Committee so that the block will stick. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:34, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hi, MacGyver. Thanks for your comment. But, yes, editors indeed have been purposely selective. Certainly, some of those participating in the pertinent discussion threads have been. Wareware's racism is precisely that blatant; you can't <i>not</i> notice it. There is one particular instance where I actually call someone out for criticizing me for what he sees as subject-matter bias on my part and refusing to comment at all on Wareware's repeated use of simian references (I am an African-American) and other such slurs. I ask for an explanation, and the editor simply refuses to respond. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 12:24, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, there are any number of subjects on Wikipedia on which Wareware and I have differed. <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrocentrism.html" title="Afrocentrism">Afrocentrism</a> is by no means the genesis of this. With regard to what is "behind this" ugly, little situation, ideological disputes and differences of opinion are no excuse for this kind of conduct.

<p>The blocking policy allows for blocks in certain cases based on "disruption". Personal attacks are disruptive. When I see personal attacks as a justification for a block, I treat it as this type of block - basically, the admin is trying to explain exactly what type of disruption was involved. It may be possible to question whether some of these blocks were acceptable based on the policy. However, I don't think that a block reason that mentions personal attacks is automatically invalid. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 00:09, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

Those of you who have an interest in speaking out against the use of racial slurs (of the vilest kind) on Wikipedia may want to take the time to drop by and read the documentation; it is considerable. And, if you are so moved, weigh in on the matter by endorsing the complaint (or the defense). Because of the repeated silence of some Wikipedians in the face of such behavior, I think it important that as many people take an opportunity to weigh in on this matter as possible. It's an opportunity for the Wikipedia community to take a stand. And, yes, I would write the same thing if I were not the aggrieved party.

<p>It seems like a personal attack to me. There are a very few places on Wikipedia where criticism of another Wikipedian is not a personal attack. For example, RFC, RFA, and the Administrator noticeboard and its sub-pages are among the few places where a criticism of another member is not a personal attack, and only if it factual and civil. The RFDA process does not have the consensus of the community behind it. Despite the official sounding title, it is just another Wikipedia namespace article started by Netoholic. Therefore it is not a safe harbour for mounting a criticism/attack of another person. It should simply be deleted. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:26, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>criticism should be allowed. sure, netoholics criticism is condemning and repetitive, but saying "snowspinner is doing a terrible job as an admin" should not be considered a personal in the same category with "snowspinner is an ugly, bad man who likes to crucify kittens". it's just pointless to keep aiming potshots at him when nobody else seems to be eager to de-admin him, and of course personality is involved, but that doesn't make it a personal attack in my book. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 08:52, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<li>Newly returned from a multi-day block for various other obnoxious behaviors (personal attacks, sockpuppetry, etc.), Trey has now returned to take up his POV edit warring. After three reverts affecting several bits of the article, he attempted to evade the 3RR by removing only a specific phrase about war crimes; once that was reverted, he removed the phrase again, this time removing the descriptive "Cold War" along with, I assume in an another attempt to game the 3RR. It seems another block would be in order. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 06:38, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't see anything complex about the third -- do you mean the fourth? If so, I think that's unfortunate: here we have a user whose history makes clear that he's not willing to abide by our policies (either editorial and procedural) -- it shouldn't take a prolonged dispute resolution process to get such a person blocked for obviously and blatantly violating the spirit of the three-revert rule. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 12:11, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This time both Cantus and Jooler reverted him . Again no reference to talk page. Just unilateral unasked for action quicklly taken to the point of edit war with whoever ignoring 3RR rule.

<p>Yes, you create needless work through your vandalism.

As you can see from my note <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERfD_9250.html#March_17" title="WP:RfD">here</a> about this batch, I'm going through this list carefully, and not simply bulk-deleting them.

<li>I just added the diffs, but haven't analyzed them. I don't see a self revert, however, I see that Christiaan was reverted 4 times by different people, more analysis is needed to see if his edits are similar enough to be reverts.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 22:00, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>In all four edits he created roughly the same version with the <i>"U.S. would invade Iraq whether or not"</i> language that was being objected to as a POV modification of what was actually said. Only 3 or 4 other words with may a wikilink or two difference was all that was changed. Not enough to even qualify as a complex edit.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 22:11, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is necessarily retrospective, we don't want admins to punish for anticipated violations. The point of the punishment is to make sure that if you really want to use your 3 reverts on several articles each day, then you best avoid making 4 reverts or you won't get to make them because you are blocked for 24 hours.

<dd>Really, 3RR is arbitrary (why not 2RR or 4RR?), but helpful in throttling, if you make it a little softer limit, you perhaps increase the perceived subjectivity of its enforcement. It is already subjective enough with the judgement of complex edits. Why increase it. We've all been notified and are adults here, if we go over the arbitrary limit whether by mistake or in the heat of the moment, we should take our medicine.

<p>I have reported to the arbcom, my suspicion that User:KingOfAllPaperboys is <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">User:172</a> or some other administrator who has left. I suspect that the committee will be requesting this because I documented my evidence and suspicions here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/172_2/Proposed_decision#Has_172_returned_to_harass_and_disrupt.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/172_2/Proposed_decision#Has_172_returned_to_harass_and_disrupt.3F" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Since the information needed will be time sensitive, I am giving y'all a heads up here. It may not be appropriate to reveal the IPs to me? but the results should be sent to the arbcom committee. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 14:46, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I guess it's always possible, but why would a leaving admin return under a different name? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:58, Mar 26, 2005 (UTC)

<li>A fresh start, because old identity has too much baggage? Revenge? Gaming sanctions? This KingOfAllPaperboys has taken an interest in harassing Netoholic.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 15:05, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Whoever he may be, KingOfAllPaperboys is not 172. I'm not aware that 172 ever used sockpuppets for any purpose, and this behavior is not at all 172's style. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 22:03, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What made me suspect 172 was the KingOfAllPaperboys claim that he was not a sockpuppet and challenge to Netoholic to prove that he was. Since 172 had just left wikipedia, once again, earlier in the day, he could technically make that claim. However, 172s return with a different nom de plume, would be a serious breech of trust based on the good faith the arbcom is showing in his representations. KingOfAllPaperboys is merely suggestive and circumstantial. The evidence against 172 being Such as serious possible offense should at least be investigated. Of course another admin using a sockpuppet to harrass would also be a serious offense.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 08:27, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>You might want to ponder their point for a while, though. Having rocky relationships with lots of people makes what you are trying to do here - create encyclopaedic content (or, at least, I <i>assume</i> that's what you're trying to do here) - that much harder, no?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know the counter-argument - that for many of those of us who aren't in that state, we get that by simply staying away from contentious issues, and leaving the POV-battling to others, and there is <i>some</i> truth to that. (I am <i>so</i> tired of arguing with people about Dresden, Hiroshima, etc.) But I do think there's more to it than that - and the number of people you have problems with has to be making what you're trying to do harder. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 17:20, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">User:Snowspinner</a> is also a candidate to be KingOfAllPaperboys, because his contributions also bracket the Nov 10th activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>06:31, 11 Feb 2005 (hist) (diff) Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Stub sorting (→film-stub, movie-stub, mov-stub)</li>
<li>19:31, 10 Feb 2005 (hist) (diff) User talk:Anthony DiPierro/Archive</li>
</ul>
<p>And he may be more likely than 172 based on the pages edited, especially the templates where Snowspinner was already involved. I will also document this at the 172 arbcom page. Sadly if it is Snowspinner, then he would have been lying when he denied being a sockpuppet when he harassed Netoholic, so I prefer to believe it is not him. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 20:31, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Admin <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> has been trying intentionally to get me banned (with success before) ONLY because I stand in his way when it comes to his personal taste in making one wikipedia article out of line with wikipedia standards. How does a person like this become an admin is beyond me. The fact that such a person is an admin here is a good indication that there is something wrong in your admin selection process and procedures. Anyway, he has been trying for a long long time to make <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h.html" title="Bahá'u'lláh">this one article</a> out of conformity with Wikipedia standards and style, and even when consensus has CLEARLY failed to be reached (INCLUDING SOME OTHER ADMINS disagreeing with his unreasonable insistence), still, he waits for a while, and starts his attempt all over again, and again, and again. Somebody have the decency and courage to nominate this idiot for losing his adminship. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin2000_67b8.html" title="User:Martin2000">Martin2000</a> 02:44, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">User:Albanau</a> moved the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_Albanians_25c1.html" title="Origin of Albanians">Origin of Albanians</a> article to Testttttttttttt and then wrote "delate" all over it. He then wrote on <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedWolf_5a86.html" title="User talk:RedWolf">User talk:RedWolf</a> asking RedWolf to delete it, since it was Albanau "testing".</p>
<p>The only reason why the page didn't wind up getting deleted is because it has block compression problems. I just happened to notice an extensive edit history and had to work my way through things to try to figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>These actions should lead to Albanau's being blocked for vandalism. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 09:07, Mar 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with RickK, and furthermore I wouldn't be surprised if <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbanau_cdb4.html" title="User:Albanau">User:Albanau</a> again attempts such a deletion on another page, as his previous behavior (see the history of the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_Albanians_25c1.html" title="Origin of Albanians">Origin of Albanians</a> article) shows that he disregards Wikipedia standards by constantly adding and readding nonsense to articles after repeatedly being warned not to do so (but he doesn't seem to care). He should be blocked, and even banned. Decius 10:22, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It does sound serious. Is this a POV dispute at the core of the issue, or a plain vandal? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:24, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No POV, see the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_Albanians_25c1.html" title="Origin of Albanians">Origin of Albanians</a> article. Point of Views have been stripped from the article, and every argument against the Illyrian origin theory is taken from a current scholarly reference. Decius 10:33, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The extreme dishonest manner in which he tried to illegally delete the page is outrageous, and I would say disgusting, and shows that he has no regard for Wikipedia as an encyclopedia. Decius 10:36, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The article in question is mainly presenting the two sides of a debate regarding the ethnic origin of the Albanians. Albanau apparently does not agrees with some of the arguments given and tried to remove them from the article and then tried to add other arguments not supported by any reference or supported by references to dubious homepages. He was asked in the talk page to bring in real references to an actual published article/book whenever he adds a controversial argument, but did not comply. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a> 10:47, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>is he blocked now? pov or no pov, his dishonesty and "criminal energy" should lead to a short block at least, and any future disruptive edit should be slapped with another short block.

<p>I suppose we could be attributing to malice what we could explain by ignorance. Maybe he moved it by accident and didn't realize that deleting his "testtttt" article would kill the old article history too? I doubt it, but I hesitate to convict someone of such an underhanded move so quickly. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:16, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I sent BugMeNot an e-mail, and they say they've stopped supplying accounts for any of the Wikimedia projects. They were very friendly about it, and complimented the project, so that should make the public account problem a little better. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 17:13, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There's no need to block public accounts, which clutters up the block list. Instead, just change the E-mail and password in the account preferences, you don't even need to be an admin to do so. --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">Weyes</a> 13:23, 2005 Mar 30 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm inclined to disagree. Such accounts are easily abused by vandals. Simply change the password and lay low. I certainly support preventive blocking in this case. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:52, Apr 1, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think we have some misunderstanding here. I'm arguing <b>for</b> disabling public accounts, but for doing so by changing the password instead of through blocking. Blocking means the account will clutter up the block list for all eternity, which in the long run doesn't scale. Changing the password prevents use of the account too, but without cluttering up the block list. --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">Weyes</a> 14:18, 2005 Apr 6 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well done! Unknown public accounts are a big security hole for our Wikipedia society. Wikipedians must find them all asap! We, the known public accounts, in order to help wikipedia community to escape from the unknown public accounts curse, we are declaring that we join the admins, the arbitrators, the private accounts and the anonymousIP accounts in their fight against unknown public accounts. We are going to find them all and burn them to fire! <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgasias_c752.html" title="User:Agasias">Agasias</a> 17:56, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>User:GRider is removing a comment by another editor claiming that he is attempting "vote-swinging" claiming this is a "personal attack". I don't think this meets the standard for personal attack and that the voters have every right to know (and factor in or discount) if he is rallying votes for this vfd. I don't think the "remove personal attack" rule should give people grounds to remove whatever they dislike from a discussion and frankly this veers pretty close to vandalism.

<ul>
<li>I agree with violet. Even though GRider and I disagree with each other on most VfD votes, Chriscf's comment is inappropriate. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 00:16, Mar 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>In all fairness, similar remarks have been made previously (on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Robert_Frost_Middle_School_992c.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Robert Frost Middle School">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Robert Frost Middle School</a> and others by <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a>, and on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Ginglith_3259.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Ginglith">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Ginglith</a> by <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a>). —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 00:37, Mar 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think what Chriscf did is any worse than comments like "bogus vote" or "invalid vote" posted beneath many comments in vfd discussions which use notability as a reason for deletion. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 03:16, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Those suck too. VfD is inherently subjective - any vote by an established user should be counted, even if it's followed by an "invalid" argument. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 03:18, Mar 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Highlighting "invalid" votes (because a user is a potential sockpuppet) is not the same as trying to discount someone's vote just because someone posted something on their talk page. I really doubt that these people would vote one way because of peer pressure! <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 17:49, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>True, you didn't. <i>Discussion</i> of a vote is OK, but I agree that too many people "invalidate" votes for silly reasons. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 22:04, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Although I think blanking like this is simple vandalism, it's certainly a 4RR. Note that the user was warned after the first vandalism for vandalism, and after the third for 3RR. So he can't claim ignorance of the rules. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Fader_67b5.html" title="User:John Fader">John Fader</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Fader_436f.html" title="User talk:John Fader">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John_Fader_67c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/John Fader"><i>contribs</i></a>) 22:24, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Blocked for 24hrs for 3RR violation and vandalism. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:59, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not a 3RR violation. one insert/deletion and 3 reverts<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 23:06, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are mistaken. You'll notice that the fourth one listed about is "current", i.e that it has a diff=0 entry. As Jayjig reverted the vandal, the current changed. Now that Jayjig has done this, the vandal's fouth edit has been assigned a permanent diff <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=L._Paul_Bremer&amp;diff=11664904&amp;oldid=11663518" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=L._Paul_Bremer&amp;diff=11664904&amp;oldid=11663518" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. All four edits are identical: deltion of exactly the same content. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Fader_67b5.html" title="User:John Fader">John Fader</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Fader_436f.html" title="User talk:John Fader">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John_Fader_67c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/John Fader"><i>contribs</i></a>) 23:11, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I know this. the problem is that what has been labled as the first revert isn't. It doesn't revert to any previous version that I can find (I admint I did not do a complete search though. In short you have creation of a new version of the article followed by three reverts to that version<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 23:23, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's still vandalism, and a 24 hour block for this kind of persistent vandalism is entirely warranted. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:30, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not arguing this point.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 23:50, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Me neither. ;-) <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:54, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It removed the same content as was removed the previous week by User:Paradigmbuff, except that he removed more than Paradigmbuff did. Rather than a "complex revert", one could argue this is a "super revert" :) -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Fader_67b5.html" title="User:John Fader">John Fader</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Fader_436f.html" title="User talk:John Fader">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John_Fader_67c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/John Fader"><i>contribs</i></a>) 23:38, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
