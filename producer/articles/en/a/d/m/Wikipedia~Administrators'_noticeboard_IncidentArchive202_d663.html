<p>I originally listed this at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a> but they said this was a better forum. Saberscorpx is not exactly a vandal, but his sole contribution to Wikipedia has been to create and defend the article Saber's Beads which is a vanity neologism he created. He recreated it after a first AfD and I listed it for AfD a second time<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Saber%27s_Beads" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Saber%27s_Beads" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I've also tried to get the image associated with the article deleted. Since then he's been doing slow scale spamming of my talk page with minor edits to the comments he's made on it, causing me to get the new messages link, sometimes several times a day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I asked him to stop and his response was <a href="../../../n/a/r/User_talk%7ENardman1_f0dc.html#Saber.27s_Beads" title="User talk:Nardman1">an odd accusation</a> that I had deleted his comments. I have done no such thing. He's been at his game of adding nonsense to Wikipedia for months now <a href="../../../d/u/a/User_talk%7EDual_Freq_Archive_2_d312.html#People_from_Illinois_.2F_Stephen_Saber" title="User talk:Dual Freq/Archive 2">as seen here</a>. Given his obvious COI I think the time has come to do something about him. I will admit I initially listed him at WP:RFCN after being annoyed with yet another useless edit of his to my talk page. And yes his talk page is mostly made up of warnings from me. I'm on my PDA now but later I'll link to diffs explaining things like why I warned him over the New Moon article (for adding his neologism to it several times after his article had alread been deleted.) <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENardman1_ed82.html" title="User:Nardman1">Nardman1</a> 17:10, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Right, here's the amplification of the case I promised. First, here's the link to the user's defense at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a>:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WP:RFCN&amp;oldid=108640230#Saberscorpx_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WP:RFCN&amp;oldid=108640230#Saberscorpx_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. You'll notice he's so consumed with his COI he ignores the fact that submitting information about yourself on Wikipedia is simply not allowed. Instead he accuses me of being jealous he came up with a new astronomical discovery. As to the diffs I promised for <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Moon_a0ba.html" title="New Moon">New Moon</a>, he added his link twice in a day in January <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_moon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98383897" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_moon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98383897" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_moon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98451926" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_moon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98451926" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and again a month later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_moon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105703671" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_moon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105703671" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> even after the second AfD started. He added this link to New Moon another time before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_moon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85690000" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_moon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85690000" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and added a link about himself to "Lunar phase" 2 times. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lunar_phase&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73238887" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lunar_phase&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73238887" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lunar_phase&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73291330" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lunar_phase&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73291330" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and moved it up the list of links so it was almost first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lunar_phase&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73291330" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lunar_phase&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73291330" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.He even once nominated his neologism for featured article status <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_articles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73235516" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_articles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73235516" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. He's also variously attempted to create a personal article about himself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Saber_%28Musician%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Saber_%28Musician%29" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and add info about himself to various articles such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_drummers.html" title="List of drummers">List of drummers</a> and <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a> too many times to list all the diffs. More recently he's edited his comments on my user page several times in minor ways I believe is just calculated to annoy me. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105552918" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105552918" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107984095" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107984095" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107991100" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107991100" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107991334" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107991334" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108212262" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108212262" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108430633" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nardman1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108430633" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENardman1_ed82.html" title="User:Nardman1">Nardman1</a> 20:11, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh argh, I remember dealing with this user back in December. Yes, he posted and reposted a lot of copyvios, both images and articles. If you're really interested, you could probably find many of them by checking my delete log for 9 December 2006 (and probably a couple of days afterwards too) for articles and images about aircraft and military equipment. He never responded to the numerous messages I left for him, and I had the impression that English might not be the best language for communicating with him. Maybe someone could try in Arabic and/or French?

I'd not encountered BD before this week but frankly, I haven't been impressed by his confrontational approach - he doesn't seem to have understood that Wikipedia is supposed to be a <i>cooperative</i> project. I note that he's already been cited and blocked for this in the past (see <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive163_34df.html#Personal_attacks_and_formal_warnings" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive163">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive163#Personal attacks and formal warnings</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive196_69b2.html#Text_removal_ban:_BabyDweezil" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive196">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive196#Text removal ban: BabyDweezil</a>).

<p>Given the subject matter at issue, I think we may be dealing with a sock puppet of a known abuser or banned user here.

<dd>Is that the case? If so, could you give examples of banned editors?

<dd>My feeling is that BabyDweezil came to the Barbara Schwarz article less to improve it, more to enjoy arguing with the editors there.

<p>BD is spot on about the rampant abuse of [WP:RS] in many Scientology articles. Additionally his critics are exaggerating when they say that by voicing his concerns he is engaging in personal attacks. He is being railroaded in an attempt to get him banned by a group of editors that believe that the only rational POV RE: Scientology is a negative, mocking and hateful one. They defend this blatant anti-Scn POV (which, in fairness, they likely do not see.) by happily accepting as valid, heaps of cites from web pages maintained by Scientology hate groups. Anyone that tries to be bold and stand up to the bias gets gang tackled by the Scn despising editors here: witness the above piling on...It is an obvious and deliberate attempt to get him lynched.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think BD is a good editor who is exercising good faith and lots of courage in an attempt to combat the entrenched, deliberate and systemic bias against Scientology (which doesn't exist of course) - the net effect of which is that Wikipedia contains almost no accurate information about scientology in its scientology pages just inflammatory, mocking and hatefully exaggerated distortions.</p>
<p>Hang in there BD. There are those of us that agree with you. Don't get frustrated. And tone things down! The mob is incensed and hunting for a rope.---<a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlightlyright_e659.html" title="User:Slightlyright">Slightlyright</a> 00:03, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are indeed real problems with the Scientology articles, just as there are with many other Wikipedia articles - poor sourcing and poor writing in particular. The problems do need to be dealt with. But the way to do that isn't to make the whole thing into a drama, edit warring, deleting content, making accusations against other editors and so on. People with strong views on any side of an issue edit Wikipedia all the time - all we ask is that they abide by the core rules of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, assume good faith and behave in a cooperative and non-confrontational way towards other editors.

<dd>I am quite cool; however, the response to my posting on this board was laced with personal attacks, pseudo psychiatric diagnoses, false and distorted claims about my behavior, and (bs) allegations of sock puppetry. Is that how claims are evaluated? If its without merit, just say so. If I am going to be attacked instead, I will respond as I did.

Her FOIA related lawsuits and appeals number between 800-1200, many naming specific government employees as defendants. Ms. Schwarz is regretably now a prominant example of how far a <i>pro se</i> person can take a grievance against federal and state governments. The unique reality that drives her litigation is in part due to her views of and experiences with the CoS. It is also her association with the church that led to a violent de-programming attempt by Cyril Vosper, at the behest of her family. Ms. Schwarz has also had many ongoing fueds with groups like AHBL, and even Wikipedian editors on her article's talk page. <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a> is an article which must be carefully written, and I believe it was before <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> began editing it. At first I thought <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> felt sorry for Ms. Schwarz and was defending her. Then <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> renamed a section of the article labelling her views as conspiracy theories, which is technically accurate but perjorative. I started to wonder if <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a>'s motivation was Scientology's image so I searched a few articles about the CoS and noticed <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> on some of the talk pages.

<dd>I second this report -- BabyDweezil is a highly disruptive editor. He seems to have a particular habit of using a tiny sliver of barely plausible concern for policy and loudly declaring that as justification for edits far beyond what is justified by his supposed source of concern. An excellent example is his action in regards to the following sentence and its reference:</dd>
<dd>This was in contradiction with police reports that had discovered at Aum's main compound in March, of a sophisticated chemical weapons laboratory that was capable of producing thousands of kilograms a year of the poison. <i><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol5no4/olson.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol5no4/olson.htm" rel="nofollow">CDC website</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention_f18d.html" title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>,</i> Aum Shinrikyo: Once and Future Threat?<i>, Kyle B. Olson, Research Planning, Inc., <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington%2C_Virginia_fc7c.html" title="Arlington, Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a></i></dd>
<dd>What was BabyDweezil's <i>claimed</i> concern about this sentence? Simply the word "contradiction"; he purported to find it "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult_apologist&amp;diff=105092576&amp;oldid=105091565" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult_apologist&amp;diff=105092576&amp;oldid=105091565" rel="nofollow">original research</a>" to note a contradiction between the police reports and other publicly given opinions that had been mentioned previously. Did he suggest any alternate phrasing that would avoid the statement of there being a "contradiction"? No -- he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cult_apologist&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106755071" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cult_apologist&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106755071" rel="nofollow">removed the entire sentence</a>.

<dd>I was also involved in that one... I remember that I asked him several times what his exact argument was.</dd>
<dd>My feeling about him is that he edits more because he loves "fighting" with certain people (including me), and less because he wants to improve articles. He came on <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a> without bothering to read the sources and inform himself about the topic, and immediately started his usual behaviour, and started arguments that had been discussed months ago already.

<p>I don't know if this is the right place for this, but I would like to call for a resolution on the matter of <a href="../../../l/e/x/User%7ELexiLynn_45e7.html" title="User:LexiLynn">User:LexiLynn</a>. At the very least, he is a bully who adds nothing of value to wikipedia. At the most, I have reason to believe he is a sockpuppet of the banned user JuliannaRoseMauriello, among others. He has made harrassing remarks on the topic of Stephanie Adams, as did JuliannaRoseMaurielllo. He has also made edits to the Jessica Lunsford page, as had either JuliannaRoseMauriello or WorkingHard, who I believe to be the same person anyway. He has also made libellous remarks about the user Cumberbund, as did WorkingHard. I'm sorry if this seems long and convoluted. It's hard to keep up with all his banned nicks. I believe a checkuser is in order. I am not an impartial observer as he has made libellous remarks about me as well, using an IP that is clearly not mine. I will submit to a checkuser test myself, to prove that point. Thank you in advance for your assistance.</p>

<p>That might work except you have about 15 administrators on here that have been following your wikistalking off and on wikipedia over the last few days. While maybe you'll get an admin here caught off guard, you certainly won't impress any of the admins who have already done checksums with you and seen your sock puppets.</p>
<p>While it's nice to pretend to be innocent on wikipedia and throw around terms such as libelous and others, just remember this: It's not nice when a 37 year old man stalks a 10 year old girl, and 4 admins have already seen the court paperwork against you.

<p>Since LexiLynn thinks I'm Ispy1981 I also take great offense to the despicable attack charges. I'd like to see a link for this imaginary court paperwork or be contacted by an admin who puts any weight to these disgusting charges. What remains available for any admin or other Wikipedian is the ability to compare the edit histories of WorkingHard (banned by JimboWales), JuliannaRoseMauriello (also permanently banned), and LexiLynn to see the similarities. --InstaTornado 07:57, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>InstaTornado, I never said you were ISpy, please don't try and mislead admins on here. The admins I have been dealing in email with know exactly who you are, they know what is going on, and though some admins who don't know what is going on like InShaneee above, there are enough admins that do know. Some of them even have a copy of the police report. <a href="../../../l/e/x/User%7ELexiLynn_45e7.html" title="User:LexiLynn">LexiLynn</a> 19:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If any admin here says it is okay to post the court paperwork let me know on my talk page, it WILL be posted.

<dd>Several points here. #1 LexiLynn refuses to answer any questions regarding his/her/its various abuses here, just throws out unsubstantiated claims of sockpuppetry and hints at pedophilia. "A 37-year-old man"? Yes, that's why my username is Ispy1981. 2007-1981=37. Must be the new math. I have often said and will AGAIN say it clear, so that LexiLynn may understand, I will submit to any test wikipedia has to offer, to answer LexiLynn/65.184.20.38's outlandish claims. #2. I fail to see why no admin has come forward with a solution to this problem, given LexiLynn/65.184.20.38's history of abuses (check the edit histories). Perhaps Jimbo should be called in on this matter, as he has dealt with this user before, if indeed it is WorkingHard/JuliannaRoseMauriello. #3 If it is true, and I believe Leebo touched on this, that LexiLynn/65.184.20.38 has contacted "several admins" regarding me, why am I still here? Why is InstaTornado still here? Why have I been continuing to post/edit (I edited an article this morning, in fact.) I call pure BS on LexiLynn/65.184.20.38's part and would invite ANY admin who has had contact with LexiLynn to write to me on my talk page. I would like to review any court documents LexiLynn gave you or any correspondence you've had with LexiLynn. I doubt very seriously there are court documents, as LexiLynn does not know my true identity. I know LexiLynn's identity, but due to privacy rules on Wikipedia, I have held my tongue. There is more than enough evidence to see who LexiLynn really is, if one looks hard enough.</dd>

I suspect that this disruptive activity is coordinated outside of Wikipedia, because a few users, including Nareklm follow my edits and undo them without any explanation.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Most of Atabek's and Elsanaturks edits are pointless edit warring. They simply go around removing information they dont like on several pages. They start needless and pointless edit wars, which then drag other users in to stop the removal of sourced information.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 15:51, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would say that the above pretty accurately describes what you do. You go around and revert the articles to which you never contributed a single line just to undo the edits by Azerbaijani users. I can illustrate my point by examples of such behavior. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 16:41, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Oop. Didn't notice this discussion. Whether it was an individual or a group, they had access to a very wide number of IP ranges, including multiple ISPs. After sprotecting a fair number of pages, I realized they were trolling through the contribs of most of the users reverting or cleaning up after them -- finding this entirely unacceptable, and considering their apparent refusal to take a hint from narrower blocks and protections, I laid down some pretty heavy rangeblocks for a few hours. I haven't seen a sign of them, since then, but if anybody sees it pop up again, let me know. – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 01:17, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've blocked the user indefinitely. That's a very shocking edit, and highly similar to the one that got the other editor you mentioned blocked indefinitely... This is weird though, because JBAK has a solid contribution history. Everyone else, please jump in and review... I think I'm going to bed soon. But I think this qualifies somewhat as a "death threat" and we shouldn't tolerate this kind of behavior under any circumstances anyway. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="#FF0099">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="red">ka</font></a> 09:16, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Endorse block</b>, based on the severity of the comment, his editing through other accounts, and likely sockpuppetry (which is even more likely now). I've got no tolerance for shit like this myself. <i>However</i>, the edit almost makes it sound as though he wanted to be blocked, which might imply some sibling rivalry or something. That shouldn't be our problem, though. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">talk</a>)</small> 09:23, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd have given him a week's vacation, enough for him to see what happened and claim that the rogue edit was made by a retard who happened to come across a computer from which he hadn't logged out, or that he has some psychiatric disorder in which (for example) one personality is embarrassed by and apologizes for the behavior of the other personality. If that claim were made, I'd read it very sceptically; if such a thing happened again, I'd ban him permanently. One thing's for sure: the author of those comments (whether a child, a retard, or a mock-retard) isn't worth anyone's time. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>There has been an ongoing conflict between the two users <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> and <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdean1963_fc4c.html" title="User:Bdean1963">Bdean1963</a> on Peru-related articles. Their edit warring had caused the <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacna_Region_c3df.html" title="Tacna Region">Tacna Region</a> and the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Pacific_ca2d.html" title="War of the Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> article to be protected. They then went on to edit war in the main <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peru</a> article, when I saw this I warned both of them to stop. They said they would stop but instead the user Bdean1963 tried to sneek around this by making the same edits to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Peru_247e.html" title="History of Peru">History of Peru</a> article and Messhermit responded the same way by reverting. So I blocked them both for 24 hours on that occasion. Today I saw that they were again edit warring in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Presidents_of_Peru_9284.html" title="List of Presidents of Peru">List of Presidents of Peru</a> article. They had been doing so for maybe three days now. So I gave them both a 48 hour block. I would like the advice of some administrators on how to handle this situation because it seems that both users think they are in the right and are unwilling to stop their edit warring.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 20:39, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've been observing proceedings for a while from the sidelines. The pair of them should agree not to edit any Peru articles until these disputes have been resolved through mediation on talk pages etc. They have been raging for months and causing a lot of disruption. If they continue to edit any of the affected articles without going through the dispute processes, they should be blocked for increasing periods. Actually, wasn't Messhermit already banned from article mainspace by arbitration?-- <a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen"><font color="Firebrick">Z</font><font color="darkgreen">eitzen</font></a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/l/e/User_talk%7EZleitzen_2592.html" title="User talk:Zleitzen"><font color="Orange">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:50, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I'm not an admin, but I was making a small effort to get agreement on the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Pacific_ca2d.html" title="War of the Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> spat. As to the background, Messhermit was banned from <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fujimori_b38a.html" title="Alberto Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a> and articles regarding the Ecuador-Peru dispute at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Messhermit_c07a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Messhermit">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Messhermit</a>; the ban expires in May. On the up-side, Messhermit and Bdean1963 have made some attempts to undertake dispute resolution. There's a case at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2007-02-08_War_of_the_Pacific_010d.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2007-02-08 War of the Pacific">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2007-02-08 War of the Pacific</a> opened by Messhermit. Bdean1963 created Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/War of the Pacific, but that was rejected as Messhermit didn't sign up. As with many multi-article content disputes, it's very difficult for an outside observer with a fuzzy grasp of the topic(s) to understand what's actually disputed, and where, and why it should matter anyway. In general, Bdean1963 isn't terribly communicative, while Messhermit is rather the opposite. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 00:33, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

For purposes of full disclosure, I will bluntly tell you that most of my experience with Messhermit has been extremely negative: he frequently calls me a communist, a terrorist sympathizer, a Shining Path member, etc. That being said, he has engaged me in civilized conversation on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Presidents_of_Peru_284f.html" title="Talk:List of Presidents of Peru">Talk:List of Presidents of Peru</a> in the past few days. I still think he's <i>wrong</i> on the issue there, and is in violation of policy by refusing to provide sources for his own claims and deleting sources provided by me, but at least he's avoided calling me names, and I'm quite thankful for that. Frankly, I'm willing to deal with anyone who is at least somewhat polite.</dd>

<dd>I definitely support a block. Despite the fact that he has good intentions, he has stated that he is unable to do edit these articles without inserting copyvios (see edit summaries that are most likely deleted). I originally discovered his copyvios on new page patrol and brought the original complaint against him on AN/I after many, many copyvios and subsequent deletions and I can't see any way to deal with him. Even after some very tolerant and good faith intervention (by Jkelley), I really don't see any other solution. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reaves_5821.html" title="User:John Reaves">John Reaves</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reaves_aeb9.html" title="User talk:John Reaves">(talk)</a> 05:25, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>A previous incident involving admin <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarwinek_e9a2.html" title="User:Darwinek">Darwinek</a> was discussed at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive182_ecf1.html#Improper_blocking_by_Darwinek" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive182">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive182#Improper blocking by Darwinek</a>. That involved his block of me, reversed by another admin.</p>
<p>Now <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarwinek_e9a2.html" title="User:Darwinek">User:Darwinek</a> continues to abuse his admin powers in relation to a different article, <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoran_Petrovic_3006.html" title="Zoran Petrovic">Zoran Petrovic</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_17.html" title="February 17">17 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 15:57 UTC <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarwinek_e9a2.html" title="User:Darwinek">User:Darwinek</a> moved <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoran_Petrovic_3006.html" title="Zoran Petrovic">Zoran Petrovic</a> to <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoran_Petrovi%C4%87_1d08.html" title="Zoran Petrović">Zoran Petrović</a> with the edit summary "moved <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoran_Petrovic_3006.html" title="Zoran Petrovic">Zoran Petrovic</a> to <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoran_Petrovi%C4%87_1d08.html" title="Zoran Petrović">Zoran Petrović</a> over redirect: Serbian name".</p>
<p>In the same minute, Darwinek protected the page "Protected Zoran Petrović: move protected unless dispute is solved [move=sysop]"</p>
<p>If there is a dispute, however, <b>User:Darwinek is one of the two disputants</b>, and just as he did in abusing his blocking power to gain advantage in a content dispute, he is now using his page protection power to gain advantage in a content dispute.</p>
<p>Furthermore, is there really a dispute? There is <b>no discussion</b> of any dispute on the talk page; in fact, Talk:Zoran Petrović and Talk:Zoran Petrovic remain redlinks. There is <b>no discussion</b> of any dispute at <a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDarwinek_56c8.html" title="User talk:Darwinek">User talk:Darwinek</a> nor at <a href="../../../g/e/n/User_talk%7EGene_Nygaard_2939.html" title="User talk:Gene Nygaard">User talk:Gene Nygaard</a>, and there aren't any other participants in any dispute as far as I know.</p>
<p>Darwinek has also not requested a move under <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">Wikipedia:Requested moves</a>, so there is <b>no dispute under discussion</b> there.</p>
<p>Prior to this, on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_17.html" title="February 17">17 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> at 12:27 UTC, Darwinek had moved Zoran Petrovic to Zoran Petrović with the edit summary: "moved <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoran_Petrovic_3006.html" title="Zoran Petrovic">Zoran Petrovic</a> to <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoran_Petrovi%C4%87_1d08.html" title="Zoran Petrović">Zoran Petrović</a>: Serbian name".</p>
<p>Three hours later, at 15:40 UTC, I (<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">User:Gene Nygaard</a>) reverted that move with the edit summary: "moved <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoran_Petrovi%C4%87_1d08.html" title="Zoran Petrović">Zoran Petrović</a> to <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoran_Petrovic_3006.html" title="Zoran Petrovic">Zoran Petrovic</a> over redirect: revert undiscussed, unreferenced move by User:Darwinek contrary to all cited sources."</p>
<p>It remains a totally undiscussed, unreferenced move by Darwinek.</p>
<p>In fact the only substantive edits Darwinek has made to the article were the early addition of a stub category, and since the first renaming his only substantive edit was to change one Petrovic to Petrović, and at the same time delete the <a href="../../../1/9/5/Category%7E1952_births.html" title="Category:1952 births">Category:1952 births</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> entries, in an edit marked minor with no explanation of why he was doing so.</p>
<p>It <b>remains true</b> that all references cited in the article use the "Zoran Petrovic" and that <b>none</b> use the "Zoran Petrović" spelling. It isn't even established by any <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citation</a> to any <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">Wikipedia:reliable source</a> that "Zoran Petrović" is an acceptable variant spelling deserving of mention in the introduction, let alone that it is worthy of consideration alongside the verified "Zoran Petrovic" spelling in choosing the proper name under <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>.</p>
<p>As an admin, Darwinek is also presumably aware of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy. When it has specifically been pointed out that there is no source for a claim, then it is his obligation to provide one if he wants to continue making that claim. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 17:13, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The only difference in most of those cases is that, unlike this one, the earlier unreferenced undiscussed moves were made by a different editor, in most cases <a href="../../../s/n/d/User%7ESndrAndrss_ac9a.html" title="User:SndrAndrss">User:SndrAndrss</a>, who not only has a propensity for making unreferenced, undiscussed moves, but also completely fails to address the various attempts by several editors to discuss his various headstrong actions at <a href="../../../s/n/d/User_talk%7ESndrAndrss_61ab.html" title="User talk:SndrAndrss">User talk:SndrAndrss</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 17:49, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This is NOT a content dispute, this is vandalism by his person, vandalism aimed to whitewash all diacritics.

<p>But it remains a half-finished job. Darwinek was using his admin privileges to gain advantage in a content dispute. He was protecting his own changes in spelling, in deleting categories, and in moving the article. What he was protecting, to improperly gain advantage, remains there. Somebody still needs to level the playing field by restoring the article to its original name, before the undiscussed and unreferenced moves, and then if Darwinek wants to make a move, he can make his case for doing so. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 04:43, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The protection was clearly inapropriate... However the argument over the move is a Content Dispute. This page is NOT for resolveing content disputes.

<p>Further moving of pages around, while the dispute is pending, will only increase the dispute and rancor and confusion, and will not be done. Proceed from here. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 15:03, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Looks like you hit the brad right on the head there, Newyorkbrad. Were I to be the one to move it, Darwinek would indeed step up the rancor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But he will be quite satisfied if his misconduct achieves the desired result, sitting back with a smug grin, even if the actual misconduct itself is reverted. He will have gotten away with it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Note that this is not a case where there has been an ongoing discussion. Note that Darwinek has never offered up any reason for making his move, he has not cited any sources which would justify his move, and he has not done any discussion whatsoever on the article's talk page. Or anywhere else for that matter. There is no reason whatsoever to leave the move he tried to protect by his improper abuse of powers standing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would be quite reasonable and proper, and quite likely to avoid increasing rancor and confusion, for some disinterested party to go there and say "I'm putting you back at square one, to the state it was in before the dispute started, now continue with appropriate discussion and/or requested moves". I can tell you for damn sure that my anger and rancor are going to increase significantly if something along those lines does not happen. There is something broken in the process if that does not happen.</dd>

<dd>Sometimes, of course, it is important to avoid even a perception of impropriety. It doesn't take much to convince many Wikipedians that the sysops are a bunch of back-room backslappers, reluctant to take one of their own to task for even glaring wrongdoing. That they might, for example, say one thing in public here or on the talk pages everyone can see, then go off-Wikipedia in a private conversation that might be the complete opposite.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Darwinek&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=108876439" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Darwinek&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=108876439" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Guettarda&amp;diff=108877709&amp;oldid=108555948" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Guettarda&amp;diff=108877709&amp;oldid=108555948" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 00:06, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, that's definitely spamming (you don't need to be able to read Hebrew to see spamming). Blocking the IP doesn't appear to be an option right now, as it appears to belong to an Israeli ISP. I would suggest requesting that the page be <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Spam_blacklist" class="extiw" title="m:Spam_blacklist">blacklisted</a>.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="orange">竜</font><font color="green">龍</font></a>) 04:18, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But blocking the IP wouldn't prevent those IPs from account creation, right? It seems far more difficult to take up a policy of blacklisting instead of banning when the spam isn't widespread. In this case it's one person who's made less than 50 edits, spamming for two different websites. Blacklisting requires following this persons contributions, whereas blocking is much simpler and doesn't actually keep people who have this shared address from becoming legitimate editors. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 22:31, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
<p>First and foremost I must say that the reason I appeal in this fashion is because my talk page is protected. For what reason, I do not know. Perhaps an effort to silence me. My silence will not be mistaken for complicity. Thus I present this argument demanding an immediate reversal of this baseless ruling. It is my blind hope that this appeal gets taken seriously as i have taken the time to write out my thoughts and defend myself.</p>
<p>User name: WikiTony Who you were blocked by: Teke The exact reason given above for your block: Multiple warnings about civility and other issue blankings, uncooperative, etc. Your IP address (as provided by this page): yeah right</p>
<p>I was blocked (attacked is a more accurate description) shortly after editing my own talk page (i forgot to sign). What i had written was an open question to any reader asking for help in identifying what i perceived as a curse (or spell) written to me in a language i could not understand. It looked like a cross of Italian and Spanish (y hablo espanol pokito).</p>
<p>The message:</p>
<p>rispondo</p>
<pre>
            S'io credesse che mia risposta fosse
</pre>
<p>A persona che mai tornasse al mondo, Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse. Ma perciocche giammai di questo fondo Non torno vivo alcun, s'i'odo il vero, Senza tema d'infamia ti rispondo. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Neckrow (talk • contribs) 18:28, 14 February 2007 (UTC).</p>
<p><br />
Did somebody put a curse on me? I have no idea what this is about or what it even means. I can't even tell if it is Spanish or Italian. If anyone knows, please help." Shortly after this request for help I was blocked and here i am now writing this appeal. The "prosecutor," (more accurately, persecutor) "Teke," gave the following reasons:</p>
<p>Multiple warnings about civility, and other issue blankings, uncooperative, etc.</p>
<p>I will start with the easy one. Is "etc." really an argument that can be considered serious? If you cannot take the time to actually list your arguments against me, how can any accusation be taken seriously.</p>
<p>"Issue Blankings:" The only page i blanked was another user's page which i accidentally wrote on instead of that user's talk page. In other words, I left the page the way i found it. If Teke had actually researched this charge he would see what the the truth really is.</p>
<p>All i have left to say about "multiple warnings about civility" is that i personally responded to each person who left me a notice explaining to them my position and explained in rational words the reasons for my anger (see below).</p>
<p>In almost the time it took me debunk all these listed charges, Teke left another message on my talk page. This time Teke changed the charges:</p>
<p>Supplement: I apologize for writing on the fly. The specifics of the block relates to ownership of Portal events, uncivil remarks against Charcor, and the refusal to cease and discuss problems. Nothing but incivility and talk page blankings. Cool off. Teke</p>
<p>Imagine for one moment a lawyer in a court room saying, "Sorry your honor, The charges against the defendant may not be accurate. I filed those charges on the fly. Here are some more charges. I hope one of them works. Cool off."</p>
<p>As much as it pains me to give this illegitimate "supplement" any recognition, I feel i must defeat these baseless accusations to the furthest extent possible. Thus, first addressing the "Ownership of Portal events." I have never claimed to own any page on Wikipedia. In fact, Charcor started this whole mess by saying that i could not remove what i considered an irrelevant event from the Current Events page. And i have an ownership problem?</p>
<p>I cannot further address the issue of incivility without submitting my extension to Charcor, in what i called "The Olive Branch:"</p>
<p>Hi, Although the wording i used may have been a bit impolite, i stand by my opinions and edits. The plane crash story is not internationally relevant, and IMHO, does not belong on current events. Planes crash all the time. People even die. Nobody died here. Just because the BBC covers the story does not mean it belongs on the current events page. And by the way i never directed you away from the current events page. i just suggested you learn how to properly write a current events blurb (including proper grammar). i also think it was rather childish of you to run to your admin buddies instead of at the very least attempting to sort the problem out amongst ourselves. I mean you no personal hostility- i just think your selection of relevant news stories and writing style is questionable. If you want to see how current events "should" be written, explore my contribs. I know i do not own the current events page (another cheap shot AND personal attack by you) but i do take pride in making sure all entries are relevant, factual, and grammatically correct. I hope we can put this unpleasantness behind us and work towards continuing to build wikipedia's excellence, which we both obviously care about. If you have any further problems with me please approach me directly so we can handle it like mature adults (if you are one). Peace and love. WikiTony 17:26, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I honestly do not know if Charcor is an adult, but i fail to see how this extension from me can be considered "incivil."</p>
<p>I even wrote this on the talk page of coredesat, the admin who first warned me:</p>
<p>I apologize for the words i used on your talk page (but not what i meant) perhaps it was "incivil," as you say (still not sure if that is a word) but i hope you can see where i am coming from. I do not believe i am the only one who deserves a talking to. peace and love, WikiTony 22:17, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>How can Teke seriously say that I "refused to discuss" anything? I INITIATED the discussion. This is just one more falsehood in this litany of lies that has been launched against me.</p>
<p>"Nothing but incivility (there's that word again) and page blankings:" As I already mentioned, the only page i blanked was one that was already blank. I accidentally wrote something on it and deleted it, thus making it blank. There is nothing criminal about this and i reject it as a baseless accusation against me.</p>
<p><br />
Upon completion of this draft i have now learned that Teke has changed the blockage time from one week to 3 days. How lenient. Apparently i do not need to "cool down" that much after all. While this new blockage is of less quantity, it's substance is equally illegitimate as the original decision. I am an active contributor to Wikipedia, in particular the Current Events section. I have never claimed to own this section nor any other. I do, however, contribute excellent, accurate, and grammatically correct information to the Current Events page on an almost daily basis. I encourage anyone reading this to look at the quality of Current Events entries that i have edited. Thus, I do believe i was right in deleting the original story from the current events page and the way i defended my actions amid personal attacks against me. Even as I write this, the current events pages is being edited improperly. User: Capitalistroadster just incorrectly sourced a blurb and the whole 88 character http is visible. And I am powerless to fix it. Is this justice?</p>
<p>Is this truly the reality of the Wiki Justice System? Can baseless charges and arbitrary sentences be thrown around by overzealous admins? I reject the baseless charges against me and I reject the notion that a posting asking fellow users to help me understand what i can only interpret as a curse against me on my talk page leads to me being blocked. I deserve no blockage and demand this blockage be lifted immediately, and furthermore request disciplinary action against Teke for baseless personal attacks and abuses of authority.</p>
<p>Peace, Love, and Justice,</p>
<p>WikiTony,</p>

<p>I recieved an email from a sympathizer (not wiki admin) entitled "How Wikipedia really works:"</p>
<p>I follow Unblock-en-l and your case appeared in it, hi. Anyone who belongs to the dominant block of opinion on any subject can get anyone else blocked. Wikipedia has no policies applied consistently.</p>
<p>All the admins who talk on Wiki-en-l (Unblock-en-l was set up separately from it summer 2006) openly admit counting any shred of personal fairness as mattering less than developing Wikipedia as they wish. Blocking of only 1 side when 2 sides have done exactly the same thing that the block is supposed to have been for, is routine. It's what happened to me, and claiming to have any rights against a biased 2-day block actually was the offence that got me permablocked, after only 5 weeks' membership. Look at all these:</p>
<p>a voice from within Wikipedia's own system describes how the ArbCom and dispute resolution systems are rigged with discretionary catch-alls that always enable admin to win <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-June/024230.html" class="external free" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-June/024230.html" rel="nofollow">http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-June/024230.html</a> on how force of group numbers dictates Wikipedia pages's content <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-July/025936.html" class="external free" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-July/025936.html" rel="nofollow">http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-July/025936.html</a> this is actually called "don't bother reporting abusive admins" <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-July/025921.html" class="external free" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-July/025921.html" rel="nofollow">http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-July/025921.html</a></p>

Instead, what I saw were users who were systematically hounded until they finally broke down and broke the civility rules, and then as an afterthought someone came up and said "oh, it doesn't matter, they were a sockpuppet of X anyways", thereby removing all culpability on the part of the abusive users who had spent time hounding and abusing the newbie...</p>

"It shocks me that there are still people out there who are so ignorant and closed minded - they don't know the meaning of logic - yet it is they who write the Wikipedia encyclopedia: ironic." From her first message to Unblock-en-l, 19 Jan 2007:</p>
<p>" My account name is Agnes Nitt, I was blocked by Adam Bishop who banned me for this reason: troll. I will copy and paste the details: Your account or IP address has been blocked from editing. You were blocked by Adam Bishop for the following reason (see our blocking policy): troll.

Adam Bishop 00:34, 19 January 2007 (UTC) As is quite evident from the reason why I was blocked, and his rude comment afterwards, it is clear that I have had misjustice done against me. I didn't expect administrators to be so childish, and unacademic, I mean, just because someone was having a debate with me on the discussions page and I had been proving them wrong, so an admin comes along, disagrees with me, cant counter my argument, and therefore blocks me from editing, and to crown it all, he leaves an abusive message against me and ridicules me (out of context from the debate-he should know that this isn't a regular chat room, where he can poke fun at me, but a discussion page confined to the Crusades and related topics) Just because he knows I cant reply.

<p>This message here has been prompted by the actions of <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames116_5843.html" title="User:James116">User:James116</a>, and the single warning this user got from <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">User:SpuriousQ</a>. James116 indulged in multiple incidents of vandalism today, and, although by the time SpuriousQ gave him a warning message on his talk page, he had carried out 4 such incidents, only one, non-specific warning was issued. I took some time to look at James116 contributuons today, and so could see that a total of 6 incidents of vandalism had occurred, including two after the warning given by SpuriousQ. If each incident had been separately logged and warned, the threshold for logging James116 at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> would certainly have been passed, and appropriate action could have been considered by the admins there. As it is, I feel an opportunity of prevention and stopping has been lost (until perhaps now), and a appropriate sequence of warnings has been "thwarted a little" (as I wrote in a message on SpuriousQ's talk page). I have, however, noticed that this failure to log each act of vandalism is very common and, in my opinion (though I'm only an editor) it subverts, almost certainly unintentionally, the means that are in place to combat persistent or "binge" vandals.</p>
<p>I've gone through and given James116 separate warnings for today's vandalism attempts (with the times at which they happened), but I thought it useful to raise this issue here, rather than log a report to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, because of the mix-up over reporting that I think took place. This has meant that the vandalism is now more then two hours old (arguably not recent enough for action now to be taken). What is the recommended course of action? I know that flexibility should be allowed, but the amount of flexibility shown here has been, I argue, sub-optimal. Am I correct? What should be done about <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames116_5843.html" title="User:James116">User:James116</a>? Finally, it has made me think that perhaps a "cheat sheet" could be produced which gives a more clear sequence of actions editors might follow if they detect vandalism. This would only consist of guidelines, but it may be useful, and I wonder what the reactions would be to this?

<dd>Long story short, I noticed a vandalism from James116, checked his history and saw he had committed a few others since his most recent warning (he had two priors), so I gave him a final warning that he would be blocked if he vandalized again. There's no reason to issue separate retroactive warnings for each prior vandalism that went unnoticed; in fact it's just more confusing both to the user and anyone reviewing the talk page. I've already reported to AIV, since DDstretch informed me he vandalized twice after the final warning. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESpuriousQ_b285.html" title="User talk:SpuriousQ">talk</a>) 16:05, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks or the summary. I personally find it most confusing to not have any indication of which vandalism attempts the warnings refer. It also makes it difficult to see whether any report to [[WP:AIV}} would result in action, because there, it advises that: "Editors: Before listing a vandal here make sure that: 1. The vandal is active now, has received a <b>proper set of warnings</b>, and has vandalized after a recent last warning, except in unusual circumstances." (my bolded text). It would be better, surely, to specify the "unusual circumstances" that are mentioned in the advice somewhere, pethaps in the warning issued, because one person's "unusual circumstances" may not be another's - certainly more likely not if those circumstances are not given and the reasoning or justification made clear. It may be a small amount of extra work, but I think an explicit warning for each act would be simpler and less likely to result in disputes, fit in <i>more clearly</i> with the guidelines given, and be simpler to work with when there are multiple editors potentially trying independently to combat vandalism. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch"><span style="border:1px solid DarkGreen;padding:1px;"><font style="color:White;background:DarkGreen" size="0">&#160;DDStretch&#160;</font></span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../d/d/s/User_talk%7EDdstretch_65ba.html" title="User talk:Ddstretch"><font color="DarkGreen" size="0">(talk)</font></a> 16:17, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps the AIV guidelines can be better explained somewhere, if they are not already. The basic idea is that AIV is to stop immediate future vandalism from happening rather than punish for old vandalism; i.e., the user must show a strong likelihood that they will vandalize again even after being told not to and informed that they may be blocked. That's the purpose of "proper set of warnings" and "vandalized after a recent last warning" (though the latter is more for IPs than for vandal-only user accounts). Given the blatant vandalism of James116 before and after the final warning, reporting to AIV was appropriate. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESpuriousQ_b285.html" title="User talk:SpuriousQ">talk</a>) 16:42, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If there is a multiple, obvious, string of vandalism, I see no issue in going right to level 3, 4, or 4im if necessary. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 16:46, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Also, sometimes a vandal clearly knows what they are doing, in which case I think it's appropriate to jump right to level 3, 4, or 4im. For example, a vandal who is marking their edits as minor and giving an edit summary of "spelling" and then replacing the page with some all-caps screed obviously knows what they are doing and that it is wrong. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 22:20, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no problem with people jumping levels of warnings - I have done this myself on many occasions when i have warned people of vandalism. In one case, an anon IP (probably a sockpuppet) introduced some vandalism which a non-anon user apparently reversed, but which, in fact, added new and much more disruptive vandalism which had obviously been pre-planned given its nature and the additional resources, uploaded by the anon user, that had been later used. I obviously and correctly immediately reported them - as I said, there has to be flexibility. However, I do have a problem if there is a whole set of vandalising edits, and one warning is issued with <b>no clear indication that all edits are covered by the warning, or which edits are covered</b>. In some cases, there is also no clear indication of the level of warning that has been issued (this has happened a few times in my experiece) This latter situation could be easily corrected by a parenthetical comment in the warning itself, such as "(level 4, immediate)", but does rely on the correct warning templates being used, which also does not always happen. A further issue is, of course, where no warning is ever issued, and I have seen this happen far too frequently recently. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch"><span style="border:1px solid DarkGreen;padding:1px;"><font style="color:White;background:DarkGreen" size="0">&#160;DDStretch&#160;</font></span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../d/d/s/User_talk%7EDdstretch_65ba.html" title="User talk:Ddstretch"><font color="DarkGreen" size="0">(talk)</font></a> 14:06, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know the issue at hand isn't really the specific James116 case, but you'll notice I put the warning under the heading "More vandalism to multiple articles". This was meant to bring attention to the user's edits between the previous warning and mine, which were all blatant vandalism (or almost all as I didn't check every one). I don't believe it's efficient or that beneficial to detail any further than that, it's all in the edit history. If you want to see what level a warning is, check out the source code, it will say &lt;!-- {{uw-vandalism4}} --&gt; or similar. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESpuriousQ_b285.html" title="User talk:SpuriousQ">talk</a>) 02:59, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to say that few users including myself have put a lot of time to research and edit this site with NPOV references, so it's unfair that the site has been practically hacked in such manner. <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">User:Aivazovsky</a> has done the same thing at <a href="../../../q/a/z/Qazakh.html" title="Qazakh">Qazakh</a> page, where he simply is not able to come to consensus at <a href="../../../q/a/z/Talk%7EQazakh_3faa.html" title="Talk:Qazakh">Talk:Qazakh</a> and did not provide a single reference to support his point. Please, advise what to do as the edit at <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_Days_c6fc.html" title="March Days">March Days</a> looks nothing other than vandalization of that site.

<dd>I would like to support Atabek on this. I have to mention that this is not the only example of Armenian users completely undoing referenced edits by Azerbaijani users. They did the same on <a href="../../../p/a/y/Paytakaran.html" title="Paytakaran">Paytakaran</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/k/Nakhichevan.html" title="Nakhichevan">Nakhichevan</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_Albania_1fac.html" title="Caucasian Albania">Caucasian Albania</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Nagorno-Karabakh_f14f.html" title="History of Nagorno-Karabakh">History of Nagorno-Karabakh</a> and other articles. Check the history of those articles and you'll see that it is the same pattern of completely undoing all the edits without prior discussion on talk. I think that this cannot go on like this, and something needs to be done to stop it. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 11:58, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I discussed my reason for doing this on the edit history page. I believe that it was unfair that this article (a sensitive topic between Armenians and Azeris) was expanded without the consent of Armenian editors. I don't mind expanding the article, but I believe that we need to put objectivity first. I don't mind working with Azeri users on this.</dd>

<dd>Not all users. Whenever the matter is brought up at this board, consensus seems to be that established users can remove whatever they want from their talk pages, while anonymous vandals don't get to remove warnings. Especially not an anonymous vandal blocked for six months (!) and with such a warning and block message collection as this on their page. I think it's appropriate to use semiprotection here. If the user has any interest in having an editable page, they can either register an account and wait four days, or stop with the massive vandalism, whichever suits. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:33, 19 February 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>No... I don't think so. That's not nice, but not quite a PA either (your arguments are not you). And if the latest was four days ago, it's in any case a bit late to post a complaint about it. Also you've misread the block log. Booshakla has been blocked <i>once</i> for incivility and personal attacks, not twice. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> who blocked him/her had second thoughts and <i>reduced</i> the original 48-hour block to 24 hours, that's what you saw as two blocks. Moreover, Booshakla's very first block, by <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a>, was also apparently made in error, and soon undone. This means that what may look at first glance like a hefty block log actually consists of <i>one</i> block. Not much of a "checkered history". So, altogether, no. On another note, could you please avoid using the deprecated {{vandal}} template for a case like this? {{userlinks|Booshakla}} will give the same output, and is preferable. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:31, 19 February 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Not sure what this person's problem is. He keeps blanking legitimate and accurate information from an image caption (the text is not POV at all, it just mentions that China is shown to the North of North Korea on a map). He was about to break 3RR, so I VERY politely warned him on his talk page. His response was to blank the warning with the edit summary (fo). I'm sure you can guess that that stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arigato1&amp;diff=108690643&amp;oldid=108689401" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arigato1&amp;diff=108690643&amp;oldid=108689401" rel="nofollow">[72]</a>.

<p>WIll an admin please stop this continued harassment by Ted Frank? He is using both my and my husband's real name on WIkipedia, from information he got from one website which I do not frequent. I did not even know my or my spouse's name was there as "guest editors". I have told him that I do not want him to use my name here or anywhere else. I have also asked him to stop harassing me.

<p>Ted calls me "biased" but he not only slanted the article on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Baron_3a48.html" title="Fred Baron">Fred Baron</a> but even linked to an entirely separate article solely on the controversy re this attorney, that he has written presumably to advertise his tort reform agenda.

<p>What I do know is that his harassment of me must stop. He also has used my husband's real name. We are both private on the internet, with the one single exception he found on a website I do not frequent. I did not even know our name was there. He has linked this in several places which I deleted. We did not provide bios as "guest editors" which he well knows. I have asked repeatedly that he stop and don't know what else to do.

<dd>Fine. So what exactly can be done about continued abuse, when Ted will not stop? ANd just exactly why would you now not support a ban - because I threatened to take action if he continued his invasion of my privacy and harassment? What kind of logic is that, pray tell? I do not have time to defend myself against someone who is clearly intent on smearing and harassing me, because he does not like my views. I do NOT actively blog on political sites -- he does. And evidently, he wishes to continue his propaganda here. Evidently, he now thinks he will be supported in invading not only my privacy but also that of my husbands by linking to a website neither of us frequent. We did not even know our name was there as guest contributors. Ted has continuously mischaracterized my statements, positions and has tried in every way possible to smear me. I am surprised he has not hired a private investigator in some perverted attempt to dig up dirt. So WIkipedia does not tolerate legal threats, but will tolerate this? Good grief. One does not have to look far to see what this editor is doing.Jance 01:45, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These accusations are false. All of the instances that Jance complains of happened <i>before</i> she asked me to stop using her name. I stopped using Jance's real name. I never used her husband's real name, other than to link to the webpage the two of them set up where they advertise themselves as "civil justice Wikipedia editors" after Jance falsely claimed that she never used her real name and falsely accused me of stalking her. (I would link to it again to prove that Jance is misstating the facts, except Jance apparently considers refutations of false accusations to be further harassment.) I knew of that webpage and the real name before I knew of the username, and didn't know that the username was anonymous. (I learned of the webpage, because someone pointed it out to me when I mentioned to them that I was surprised how one-sided and biased civil-justice-related Wikipedia pages were: the fact that an anti-tort-reform website has two editors who advertise themselves as "civil justice Wikipedia editors" who don't reveal their COI explains why.)</dd>
<dd>This is a flat lie. He linked on his talkpage, on Sarah's talkpage, on my talkpage, links to both m y husband's and my name.Jance 01:45, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because I have agreed to stop using Jance's real name, the only reason for this AN/I is an attempt to preempt my complaint about harassment from Jance, which I have documented on the dormant <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Jance_978e.html#Outside_view_by_TedFrank" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Jance">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Jance#Outside_view_by_TedFrank</a> (though that needs updating with the last 16 hours of harassment). Jance has been systematically reverting my NPOV edits, and has been systematically deleting any pro-reform statements from civil justice articles. NPOV requires both points of view to be expressed, not just Jance's. In articles like <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_Action_Fairness_Act_of_2005_f01b.html" title="Class Action Fairness Act of 2005">Class Action Fairness Act of 2005</a>, Jance has reverted edits where I simply corrected statements of federal jurisdiction and replaced a strawman pro- argument with the actual argument used by supporters of the bill. I recognize that I have a conflict of interest, and have done my best to be NPOV, even <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Baron_%26_Budd_Script_Memo_controversy_712c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Baron &amp; Budd Script Memo controversy">AfD'ing an article I created</a> as a compromise when Jance complained about undue weight for a notable event in another page. I welcome administrator intervention, because this is not the first time Jance has vociferously violated <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and attacked others she disagrees with.</dd>

<p>This is what Sarah wrote, and yes, he linked to both my and my husband's name, that we didn't even know was on the internet. He continued to link to this and brought up every and anything he could to smear me. Here is what Sarah said:<br />
Yes, we all know that Jance is Jgwlaw. Please stop baiting and harassing her. If you don't, you will be the one who gets blocked. And I'm serious about that. Harassment campaigns are not tolerated on Wikipedia. I removed your report from the noticeboard because those matters were dealt with a long time ago. No admin is going to block or sanction Jance for matters a long time in the past and for which she has already been blocked or faced RfC over. If you have a problem with her, follow Wikipedia's dispute resolution but trying to contaminate the process by conducting a campaign against her is not on. Sarah 14:46, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I disagree with your assessment of your own behaviour. And I don't see what me thanking Jance for giving me a barnstar has to do with anything. Just because I try to be nice to people when they are nice to me, and just because someone gives me a picture to put on my page doesn't mean that I can't see straight anymore...I certified and endorsed the RFC against her for petes sake. As I've told you, if you have an editing dispute with her, use dispute resolution, request mediation, 3 opinion, whatever, but don't campaign against, harass and abuse people because you will be blocked. If you think your edits are being reverted without explanation, calmly discuss it on the article's talk page. What I saw of your discussions was you flinging around personal abuse and accusations. Also, please read over the actual policies and guidelines, such as WP:Undue weight because trying to weight an article is unacceptable. You need to deal with the present instead of trying to punish Jance for the past and using it as an excuse for your own rotten behaviour. 16:51, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>MOREOVER:<br />
He is using Wikipedia to promote HIS agenda, in Overlawyered <a href="http://www.overlawyered.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.overlawyered.com/" rel="nofollow">[94]</a> where he actively posts, and Point of law <a href="http://www.pointoflaw.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pointoflaw.com/" rel="nofollow">[95]</a>. So now he hopes that by getting me off WIkipedia, he will abe able to promote his hateful tirades against lawyers and tort law.

<p>I'm not involved here, but... I think that if we allow this user to claim that identifying one account (User:Jance) with another (we'll refer to it here as "the account in question"), violates the privacy policy, in order to prevent it from being made clear that there is a past pattern of POV or whatever (which <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> is alleging), that's a very dangerous precedent to set. Edit patterns are one way to identify sockpuppets (indeed the PRIMARY way, checkuser is a last resort), and if the claim that one user is a sockpuppet of another is quashed on this, frankly ludicrous, basis, that opens the floodgates. Basically there can be NO accusations of sockpuppetry if a blocked user waits long enough for checkuser data to expire, and ironically all one has to do to _prevent_ one's past actions from being considered is to _admit_ to them. There is no presumption of privacy in a username. If you don't want your current account identified with the name of the account in question, get that account's username changed so we can refer to the account without saying that name. Log in to the account in question and go to <a href="../../../c/h/u/WP%7ECHU_759d.html" title="WP:CHU">WP:CHU</a>. Otherwise this whole exercise is nothing more than a smokescreen to allow you to continue making whatever contentious edits you're making and silence anyone bringing up your past edit history. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandom832_2ea5.html" title="User:Random832">Random832</a>(<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">t</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Random832_9c40.html" title="Special:Contributions/Random832">c</a>) 03:24, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I personally think protecting users personal information is more important than catching sockpuppets.

<dd>1. My objection was Ted's linking to a website with my and my husband's <i>real</i> name. He posted links, on WIkipedia, in more than one location, to a single website that had my husband and my <i>full legal names.</i> I cannot stress more forecefully that this is not only a violation of not only my privacy, but also the privacy of my husband. I can also not stress more forcefully that this exposes us to very real danger in the *real* world, because of what I do for a living, and cases in which I am currently involved.</dd>
<dd>2. I did <i>not</i> object to mentioning my former user accounts, jgwlaw and mollybloom. What I objected to was the use of my real first name on WIkipedia - which I have NEVER used here, and to the links to a website with our full real names. NOT user accounts.</dd>
<dd>3. I further objected to Ted's attempts to dredge up every controversy I have ever been involved in, no matter how old, as an excuse for HIS bad behavior, in attempting to disparage me and have me 'banned' for no reason whatsoever, except that he does not like my politics and because he would prefer creating and maintaining rants - the very agenda that he espouses in two different, highly political and inflammatory blogs.</dd>
<dd>4. I have never been a sockpuppet. Many admins know my former user account names. The mollybloom I created to avoid using my initials, for the purpose of protecting my privacy and safety. Ted placed links on WIkipedia in numerous places, to our <i>real</i> names. NOT usernames, or even initials. Real names. He also used my real first name here, while providing a link to the ONE website which had our real names as "guest editors".</dd>
<dd>5. Ted does not like my politics. I do not like his. I have in the past edited articles that were nothing short of rants on tort reform. For example, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_malpractice.html" title="Medical malpractice">medical malpractice</a> at one time was nothing but a tirade on lawsuits, and had virtually nothing of substance about medical malpractice. I corrected the section on the elements of med mal claim (which was incorrect.) I also corrected a section on expert witness, providing a description of the federal rules. Feel free to take a look. Feel free to take a look at many of my edits, w hich range in subject matter, many of which have nothing to do with tort reform. I also edited <a href="../../../a/s/b/Asbestos_and_the_law.html" title="Asbestos and the law">asbestos and the law</a>. My father died of asbestos cancer - mesothelioma - so I have a personal interest in this subject. That article was also at one time only a rant on tort reform. I welcome review of my edits on that and on <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesothelioma.html" title="Mesothelioma">mesothelioma</a>. I turned <a href="../../../a/s/b/Asbestos_and_the_law.html" title="Asbestos and the law">asbestos and the law</a> into a legitimate article. I added sections on the law, and the regulations in other countries. None of this was there before. I also added a section on the problem of clogging the courts with cases of people who were filing claims without being ill. I also added the American Bar Association explanation of this problem, and possible solutions. There was actually a legitimate legal reason for people making claims to preserve right if they later became ill. Mesothelioma, for exmaple, has a 20-40 year latency period. My father, a non-smoker and scientist, died 40 years after his exposure. The need to preserve rights poses a problem, however, when so many claims are filed for people who may never become ill. The ABA proposed a solution, to not start the SOL until a person became ill. So I again welcome review of my edits. Do these look like sockpuppetry? POV? I suppose if it is not a rant on tort reform, it is POV, in Ted's opinion. It is not, in mine. He has placed POV tags on all such articles.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>So now Ted is attempting to disparage me in any way possible, including exposing my husband and my identity, falesly accusing me of sockpuppetry, and making vague accusations about my "POV". Many months ago, admin whom I still can't stand, accused me of being a sockpuppet of my husband. That was untrue then and is untrue now. My husband has quit editing WIkipedia altogether, as a result. THat is a damn shame because he is very knowledgable on history, as well as law. And he is a good writer. But that is another issue. IF you all go to Sarah, for example, or any of those admins, they will tell you the story, of when I was first on Wikipedia. Every single one of them know what happened, and know that there was no sockpuppetry. Ted's attempt to raise that dead (and flatly untrue) issue now is a strawman. Ted's only purpose in raising all this again is to smear me. If that is tolerable, then I'd really like to know. As to the "highly inflammable" political site on which he claims we "advertised" -- go check it out. You will see that there are not more than one or two posts. We didn't even know our names were listed there, until Ted linked it today. I don't even know the moderator's email anymore - I can't find it. I need to, to have our names removed. Ted, on the other hand, is an active blogger on highly inflammable "tort reform" sites of Overlawyered and Point of Law. He argues that these are reliable resources, and is angry that I objected. So he has attempted to not only discredit me, but also expose our identities. He was well aware at that time that I have NEVER posted my real name on WIkipedia. EVER. THis was no oversight. He is also well aware that we did not "advertise" on the single webiste on which he found our names. Now he continues to harass and complain about me for what purpose? What exactly does he want?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>I can tell you what he wants, and I suspect any of you can, as well. THere is no other earthly reason for his continued and ridiculous accusations. I am truly disgusted.

<p>Please GO LOOK AT <a href="../../../a/s/b/Asbestos_and_the_law.html" title="Asbestos and the law">asbestos and the law</a>. This is one of hte articles that Ted placed a POV tag on, and presumably wants me banned for editing. He doesn't like it now because it is not a complete rant on lawsuits. That seems to be his only interest in life. I urge you all to go back and looked at what this article was like before I started editing it. If my edits and similar edits are worthy of a ban and a "POV" tag, then I really don't want anything to do with Wikipedia. This has spun out of control because TED has decided to get rid of anyone who disagrees with him. GO LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THIS ARTICLE.Jance 05:08, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is there something that can be done with the repeated-over-and-over-and-over comments in this ANI by Jance that say nothing new, but force me to waste time defending myself? She's trying to bury legitimate questioning of her violations of Wikipedia policy, evasion of discipline through identity-changes, and threats of litigation. There is no problem here: she can blog all she wants under her real name about her Wikipedia editing, and I have agreed not to link to it here now that I know that I was mistaken in thinking that she wasn't anonymous. I learned of her identity only because someone outside of Wikipedia in the real world told me about her own blog posting about her Wikipedia editing, which is why I made the mistake. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 05:51, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been trying to clean up and find references for comedy-related articles, a number of which I have noticed are for non-notable groups or are being used for self-promotion. <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpyMagician_6630.html" title="User:SpyMagician">SpyMagician</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/y/User_talk%7ESpyMagician_c3e4.html" title="User talk:SpyMagician">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SpyMagician_5683.html" title="Special:Contributions/SpyMagician">contribs</a>) is arguing that these articles don't need references, or that non-notable groups are important to someone and therefore are appropriate subjects for articles, and is removing or changing all references tags I am putting on these articles wholesale. I hope this is the right place to seek help; it's not really content dispute, as much a disagreement on the goals of Wikipedia and need for verifiability. Am I doing something wrong? If I am, please tell me. Thanks. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruth_in_Comedy_96ba.html" title="User:Truth in Comedy">Future Fun Jumper (TIC)</a> 08:35, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruth_in_Comedy_96ba.html" title="User:Truth in Comedy">Future Fun Jumper (TIC)</a>, you have greatly simplified the issue and completely ignore the way you have gone about edits that caused the contention with me and many others as well. You are simply dropping into many comedy related threads and demanding a level of citation that simply cannot be provided in many examples. And in many of the articles you have flagged, references do exist as external links which would simply mean a quick amount of editting and rewriting to conform to Wiki style is what is needed. The most baffling aspect of what I have seen in your edits, is the concept of WIki style as a way of resolving this issue seems to be something you are consciously avoiding. It seems that <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruth_in_Comedy_96ba.html" title="User:Truth in Comedy">Future Fun Jumper (TIC)</a>, is donning the hat of an editor just to chastize and berate others and not much else. A quick review of his edits shows a strong disregard towards any other approaches to improving articles. My apologies to other Wiki admins if posting in here is inappropriate, but I'd like to think the role of a Wiki editor is to do more than siimply tag articles for deletion while dismissing the work of contributors who have helped the articles grow.<a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpyMagician_6630.html" title="User:SpyMagician">SpyMagician</a> 08:49, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I apologize if I have oversimplified this. I do not want to present admins with a giant block of text to wade through. I am tagging these articles as I work to find references for them, in the hopes that others might be able to work on it with me. If there is a more preferable to way to go about doing things, I would appreciate opinions from editors not involved in this disagreement. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruth_in_Comedy_96ba.html" title="User:Truth in Comedy">Future Fun Jumper (TIC)</a> 09:03, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">Dispute resolution</a> is a couple doors down, and I think would be more helpful here then an AN/I thread. If it's just between you two, you can seek a <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">third opinion</a>, else you might want to look at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">requests for comment</a> or mediation. It's also generally helpful to provide specific diffs with the behavior you find disagreeable-rather then just saying "X is doing this all over the place!", say "X has repeated this many times (diff), (diff), (diff), (diff)." You two may know the nature of this debate, and where it's happened, but no one else looking at it necessarily does! <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 09:08, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
