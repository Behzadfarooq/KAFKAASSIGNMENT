<p>A few weeks back, Encyclopedist blew up at <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">User:John Reid</a>, and launched a major sock-puppetting attack on John. When the attack was traced back to Encyclopedist and the underlying IP was blocked, Encyclopedist staged a showy exit from the project. Except he has never fully left, continuing to request unblocking of the IP <a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.32.158.193.html" title="User talk:65.32.158.193">itself</a>. This request has been denied several times.</p>
<p>Now, on that IP talk page, he says that he was the "Clyde vandal" (not familiar with that vandal myself), that he's about to gain access to a large number of different computers from which to edit, and about to launch some new, major vandal attacks against John Reid, <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">User:Mackensen</a>, and the project in general.</p>
<p>No idea how credible the threat is, but this guy has definitely displayed some finesse in his previous attacks on John. Mostly wanted to toss this up here to get a few more eyes on alert if he does begin his threatened assault tomorrow. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 18:32, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He was indeed the Clyde vandal (see User:Essjay/Checkuser/Cases/CIyde); I knew at the time there was a connection through university IPs, but because he was considered an upstanding Wikipedian, I decided that it was another student at the university. It is entirely possible that he's graduated now, but if not, a phone call to the University's ITS department, and perhaps to the Dean's office, will clear it up immediately, permanently, and to the satisfaction of all involved. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 02:54, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's important that those that wish to remain anonymous do so by not reveiling their real name, their place of work, where they hang out, etc. I would be cautious about telling people to not post personal information by ensuring the wording doesn't freak people out and cause them to not contribute.

<dd>I think we can do a few things, or Wikimedia could, to help prevent one type of stalking (threats to work). We should probably get the Foundation to have a couple of letters on hand that explain to employers that the named person is a volunteer and might well be harrassed for working for the good of mankind. That would help in <i>that</i> part of things (and it can be written in a neutral manner that doesn't take a position on a particular argument). Additionally, though, we need to be able to generate multiple calls to authorities to indicate the severity of a personal stalking. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:18, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think what postdlf is trying to get at here is that he thinks it's acceptable to just flollok about the place reverting peoples edits because they contain something that he doesn't like. If you dont like it, remove the offending statement - don't revert the entire edit, which i may have worked on for some time to get rid of pov and OR material. eg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Passion_Pop&amp;diff=55105035&amp;oldid=55097387" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Passion_Pop&amp;diff=55105035&amp;oldid=55097387" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, why did he have to de-wikify the links too? In my opinion, postdlf is just a warmonger who cares more about noticeboards like this and pinning people up on them than he does about the integrity of the encyclopedia, and i said as much on his talk page. Yes, if you remove the entire edit i do take it as a personal vendetta and the only verdict is vengeance, a vendetta held as a votive - not in vain - for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETHE_KING_2419.html" title="User:THE KING">THE KING</a> 17:57, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Tony has unilaterally closed the deletion review of the Satanism userbox with the comment <i>Closing this because such a template would obviously bring Wikipedia into disrepute.)</i>.

<p>In my opinion this is an inappropriate use of admin powers and/or clerk powers; there are legitimate devout Satanists out there, and rejecting the presense of a userbox for them absent a policy which prevents all religious userboxes in template space is religious bigotry against a minority, tiny and kooky as it may be. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 20:10, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alienus, I concur that we should get rid of <i>all</i> such userboxes under proposed T2. However, the failure to delete any one such template can always be used to prevent deletion of another. Conversely, the deletion of any one can be cited as a precedent to delete another. You can be assured of my support in deleting <i>any</i> userbox falling under T2, regardless of ideology. Nevertheless, I think you'd agree that <i>if</i> we must be discriminatory, this isn't a bad one to see off - Satanism is particularly controversial as religions go, and identification with it will give Wikipedia a bad reputation in a way that the major religions will not.Timothy Usher 20:31, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This would be much easier if every single deletion was not followed by this kind of messy rigmarole at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>…we could simply wipe the lot but you can imagine the storm of protest which would ensue. To be quite frank, it strains the limits of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> to believe that absolutely everybody who says "why not just delete the lot" would actually support such a move if it occurred, and it is mostly anticipation of the backlash which keeps the mop in the bucket.

<dd>I'm confident that this is best for Wikipedia. I don't think the goal of producing a high quality encyclopedia can be served by encouraging, though the provision of templates saying "I'm a satanist" and the like, the use of Wikipedia's website for social networking and coordination of work between adherents of satanism. It could only bring the whole enterprise into disrepute to permit such abuse. Therefore it's inappropriate to hold a DRV-style debate where traditionally the item is restored if a certain proportion of editors vote to restore it. We cannot make such a decision on the basis of votes. Perhaps a discussion on the talk page of the template might be appropriate, though I think it would require a very strong case to be made for this particular template. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 20:20, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The flaw here is that you are unilaterally deciding for a small, generally despised, and yet legitimate religion, <i>while simultaneously not intervening to delete other more popular religious userboxes</i>.</dd>
<dd>Whether religious userboxes should uniformly be removed or not is a completely differnet question than whether removing simply the tiny helpless minority is a policy of discrimination that Wikipedia should put up with.</dd>
<dd>If you want them to go, then apply that to all of them. I agree with the wider argument (not enough to actively initiate such a move, but in principle). Applying it to fringe religions one at a time but not the big ones is a grossly abusive manner of solving the problem, however.</dd>
<dd>Either initiate a blanket removal of all such userboxes, or leave the little ones alone. In between is using your personal judgement as to the validity of particular religions to substitute for Wikipedia policy consensus, and it's not good WP policy for us to let you do that. The judgement that Satanism as a template brings disrepute, but Christianity or Islam or Buddhism don't, is obviously flawed and must be overturned. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 20:26, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have <i>got</i> to be kidding. Say it's unfair, fine, but don't pretend you can't see the difference. Even if a Satanist yourself, surely you will acknowledge that your religion (rightly or wrongly) has a poor reputation among the general public.Timothy Usher 20:31, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not a Satanist, no. And Satanism is far from the only religion to have a poor reputation among elements of the general public, or of the general public as a whole. Anti-Islamic sentiment was rather high on Sept 12, 2001, for example, but that would have been a grossly illegitimate reason to nuke a Muslim userbox that day.</dd>
<dd>The logic that Tony is using generally (that we shouldn't have such userboxes as a class) is fine. The specific logic, that because a majority of people don't like one particular religion we can nuke its userbox, is clearly flawed. Unpopularity is as a general rule not a valid reason to delete wikipedia-Anything. In attacking Satanism's popularity to defend Tony, you completely miss the point.</dd>

<dd>Guess what? It doesn't matter if something has a good or bad reputation.

Secondly, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (#1.9 in case you're not familiar with that page). Your position only comes down to what <i>you</i> think of the topic.

<p><b>Fully support</b> tony sidaway. wikipedia does not need such template.

<dd>I just want to say that this AN/I is not supposed to be a vote on the template itself or its worth, but is a comment regarding the unilateral decision to skip such a vote. In this, I think Georgewilliamherbert is correct in saying there's no particular reason why process couldn't have been allowed to continue as it was already doing before Tony stepped in and decided it was pointless. I see no real reason to skip it except Tony saying that in his mind it is clear. That's great, Tony, but looking at the voting record makes it clear that it isn't an "obvious" answer, and the mixed response here makes it clear that there is some reason to discuss it. Rather than having a discussion-about-a-discussion, the original should just be restored and people with opinions about it should go there to discuss the merits or problems with the template. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 20:49, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm not opposed to deleting all the religion userboxes, since Jimbo discourages their use. However, to say that we can't get rid of satanism because we have Christianity is not logical. It's most unlikely that "this user is a Christian" could harm the reputation of Wikipedia to the same extent as "this user is a satanist". Let us recall that while Jimbo seems to discourage all "this user is" boxes, and therefore can be said to disapprove of the "straight", "gay", "lesbian", "bisexual" ones, the only one where he actually intervened (forcefully) was the one that said "this user is a pedophile". It seems silly to claim that a controversial userbox does no more harm to the reputation of the project than an uncontroversial one. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 21:06, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pedophilia is, for good reason, illegal. Satanism is, for equally good reason, not. The idea that a Satanism userbox could somehow "harm the reputation of Wikipedia" is silly.

<dd>What truly harms the reputation of Wikipedia is the <i>accurate</i> perception that it is a haven for bigotry.

<dd>I understand Musical Linguist's point, and it's clear that Satanism is less "reputable" than Christianity (in the circles we care about), but that's not my point. I'm not making the "silly" claim of Ann's last sentence above. I am claiming that it's not our place to even enter the arena of saying "this belief is reputable, this other one isn't." Once you decide that about one belief, you have to start deciding it about others, at at some point, you find yourself making completely indefensible decisions.

<p>Tony Sidaway's reasoning is flawed. If he thinks all religion boxes should be deleted, he should say so in his reasoning, rather than singling out Satanism. Otherwise, if he wanted to delete Satanism boxes but not other religions, that'd be highly inappropriate. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 01:43, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tony action was fine, and the deletions should be even more widespread as several editors on both sides of the issue have said here. Then all that energy that is being expending defending things that have nothing at all to do with building an encyclopedia can be used to...well, build an encyclopedia! <a href="../../../r/x/_/User%7ERx_StrangeLove_2537.html" title="User:Rx StrangeLove">Rx StrangeLove</a> 02:08, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I support Tony's action, though I think his comment was out of line and insulting. I'd like to see all userboxes eliminated except those specifically of value to encyclopedia building. Problem is defining that subset; right now, mine say I'm a native English speaker, a marginal German speaker, and a musician; each of these says what I <i>do</i>, not what I <i>believe</i>. I think that's where the distinction lies; but there are nasty fuzzies there. (User Catholic might be bad. User Catholicism scholar might be OK.

<p><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaellovesnyc_7f8b.html" title="User:Michaellovesnyc">User:Michaellovesnyc</a> has been making repeated edits that push his point of view on <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail-order_bride.html" title="Mail-order bride">Mail-order bride</a>. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.45.47.102.html" title="User:24.45.47.102">User:24.45.47.102</a> is also obviously him (they both edit mail-order bride almost exclusively and Michael responds on the anon user's talk page). Michael's changes have been discussed on his talk page and elsewhere, and he seems unable to accept that most of his edits are violations of Wikipedia policy. After I warned him on about the inappropriateness of his edits on <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaellovesnyc_bae7.html" title="User talk:Michaellovesnyc">his talk page</a> and drew his attention to a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-05-24_Mail-order_bride_27fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-05-24 Mail-order bride">mediator's opinion</a> Michael made a new series of edits, including restoring the disputed material, falsely claiming "the mediator is on my side". His latest preferred version of the article is worse than ever, with vast amounts of OR and POV material, including blaming "feminist groups who distort the truth" for a law and bringing up unsourced stories "which the media will not report". He hasn't discussed any of these most recent changes on the article talk page, but has referred to me as a "know-it-all" and "cyber thug" who is trying to "intimidate" him and others. I reverted the page and mentioned it again on his talk page but I suspect he will keep reverting to his favorite version. Perhaps I should have brought this to Requests for mediation instead, but I think this is a matter of multiple blatant violations of policy, not just an unpopular point of view that would need mediation between two sides. Editors (especially <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaiwen1_85fe.html" title="User:Kaiwen1">Gavin</a>) have been trying to reason with Michael for months (he has also been warned about vandalism before, but removed the warnings from his talk page).

<dd>I happen to agree with Michael's (ostensible) point-of-view, but I think his repeated insertions are rather disruptive; in any event, he seems not to appreciate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. In order that the community might express their views apropos of his conduct, and in order, perhaps, that he might be edified as to how properly to edit with respect to <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail-order_bride.html" title="Mail-order bride">Mail-order bride</a> and surrounding issues, in order that his sometimes valuable contributions might be used, you might do well to open a user-conduct <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">RfC</a>. In situations such as this, it is always advisable, IMHO, to seek community participation and evaluation; a consensus will likely develop for or against Michael's edits, and he (or those who think him to be editing wrongly) might better understand how best to edit. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:51, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mediators from the Mediation Cabal have agreed that he's disruptive, but other than that consensus has been difficult to achieve, since only about 3 users have paid any attention to this article in the long-term (him and two who oppose him). He's certainly been informed of how his edits and conduct violate Wikipedia policy, but he seems to view these warnings as threats. I will be pursuing RfC.

<dd>Absolutely nothing constructive coming from that account, but I still have to think that he's just doing what he thinks is best.

<p>Secondly, one of my comments was incivil towards Pantherarosa who had repeatedly made personal attacks against me. Wikipedia's policies go for all users regardless of circumstances, so an incivil warning should stay on my talk page. However, because I had made one incivil comment toward the other user, InShaneee refused to block Pantherarosa. Not only is this a double standard, but I was not even the one who had the brunt of Pantherarosa's attacks. As another user said on InShanne's talk page: <i>Obviously you aren't interested to even consider that your action isen't the proper conduct of an experienced administrator.</i> I agree with this completely, and to add on that InShaneee is refusing to punish Pantherarosa to make a point to me, even though I wasn't even the person Pantherarosa was originally attacking.

<dd>Administrator, <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">User:InShaneee</a> exhibited a double standard when blocking me. He blocked me and stated on my Talk Page, "You have been blocked for 24 hours for disruption. If a user comes here, to an encyclopedia, asking for information, it shouldn't be difficult to point him to such info". However, I spelled out for him expilicity how the answers I gave, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AScientology&amp;diff=53436018&amp;oldid=53210255" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AScientology&amp;diff=53436018&amp;oldid=53210255" rel="nofollow">difference</a>, were w links that are sometimes in and sometimes out of the article, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> but are the most direct possible answers to the user's specific question. I also spelled out to him why the link answering, "when did the present Church of Scientology start?" is not present in the article today. InShaneee came up with the term, "linkspamming" to describe his blocking me for that answer. Then, in discussion on my talk page, <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">User:InShaneee</a> he made me a promise.

<dd>Inshaneee is quite right in saying that calling someone a troll is a personal attack even if they are trolling. Just like calling an obese person "fat" is a personal attack. Just like calling someone with cerebral palsy a "spastic" is a personal attack. Just like telling an ugly person they're ugly is a personal attack. Just like calling someone with low intelligence "dumb" is a personal attack. I could go on but I think you get the message. The accuracy or otherwise of a personal attack does not make it any less a personal attack. In fact, usually the accurate personal attacks are the most hurtful. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 05:38, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Snottygobble on this. There is an additional argument here about not feeding trolls; calling a troll a troll is an indication to them that they have provoked an emotional response, and as such is an incitement to troll some more. Better just to leave the default messages. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 13:59, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was not going to engage in this, partly because I qualified InShaneee warning against me, Eupator and Paul Cyr as a lack of experience from this administrators part, but to my surprise having seen him/her sign a disput which I don't ever remember having seen him/her even being engaged in or involved in or having even edited those articles or their talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FFadix&amp;diff=54091641&amp;oldid=50756937" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FFadix&amp;diff=54091641&amp;oldid=50756937" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, I had to conclude that this was a retaliation to my remark about him/her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53970525" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53970525" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Paul_Cyr&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54079543" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Paul_Cyr&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54079543" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. Administrators should not act like this, retaliating against a user like this reflect immaturity. Also, I am troubled that some veterans find it nothing wrong about InShaneee block against Eupator. While in practice there is nothing wrong in blocking someone for not respecting a guideline or policy, that the principal alleged victim here of Eupator remark was InShaneee, and to the measure that he/she took the decision to block him, I believe, InShaneee made this something personal and obviously reflect unexperience and somehow a lack of judgement. Also, that Lutherian is a troll, I will repeat this and should never be blocked for this. A checkusers has reflected that he is indeed a troll, he has done nothing in Wikipedia other then trolling and slandering members. Insteed of provoquing veterans of Wikipedia by giving warnings because those veterans have retaliated against a troll, he/she should work to prevent such things to happen. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:32, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Calling someone a troll is no different than calling someone a vandal - the characterization should only be made when <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> is no longer reasonable.

<dd>I agree, though I think in most cases there are far better alternatives to using such terms. If a troll needs to be dealt with, he should certainly be dealt with, but I just don't see how saying "You're a troll" solves anything in most cases. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 21:28, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>True. When it comes to warning others, though, "Watch out - he's a troll" is easier than "A high percentage of his edits exhibit trolling, and this trolling is further reflected in his edit summaries and talk page remarks." Nevertheless, I think that "You're a troll" would violate <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> rather than <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a><sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">Talk</a></sup> 22:45, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This discussion has been extensive about how to address a user, specifically the use of the term "troll", "vandal", characterization of individual editors, etc. Those were not the issues which brought this discussion into existence. InShaneee's (viewed by some editors) inappropriate blocking, inappropriate administrator behaviour was what brought this "good lad's" actions into discussion. Not the words he used, but the actions he took. To revolve around the words used denies the central issue which was the actions he took and the basis he took those actions on. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 06:12, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This infra user “Zos”, has harassed and beleaguered all my comments to the talk area discussion and has taken it upon himself to frequently misrepresent out of context every posting I have made. I want to place my own compliant about this unscrupulous user, can someone send me details please.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The reason for this: “Zos”, is in cahoots with user “JMAX555”, that has instigated this most recent disputation due to performing defamatory and libellous edits on the Golden Dawn article. To which I have rightfully contested and made a stand against.</p>
<p>I reiterate that this user “Zos”, wants me to be removed from the board as I am the only person rivalling his crusade to deform the present, and rightfully protected article, in to “JMAX555” libellous version. The motives of both these wikipedia users is that they’re both part of the same order, that has a vested interest in propagating anti HOGD/A+O, propaganda and distorting the facts.</p>
<p>I have submitted an array of evidence such as public domain court affidavits from the original source with comprehensive explanations on why the present un tampered version of the article is the correct, verifiable, and most neutral. Please see the discussion page for the Golden Dawn article in question, where I have fully validated all of my comments comprehensively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this user “Zos” has in an unprincipled manner made an advertisement on the discussion page to announce and invite people to join in, to attempt to kick me off the discussion forum for the Golden Dawn article. The reason being “Zos” and “JMAX555” have no answers to my postings and are simply seeking now in a last attempt at trying to silence me. Solely so that they can carry onto try and approve a defamatory version of the article</p>
<p>I have adhered with recitude to Wikipedia's protocols fully throughout.</p>

<dd>Dear J Kelly:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well to make a first step: If JMAX555 would agree not to make unannounced, clearly libellous and defamatory changes to the HOGD/A+O article entry, then I would be happy. Furthermore, I wouldn’t instigate any editing war if this were to be agreed. But JMAX555 has changed the HOGD/A+O article entry in a defamatory tone, when he is no part of that organisation and a leader of the opposition that is currently in litigation. This is why I have protested. If he stops and leaves the HOGD/A+O entry alone, as it has nothing to do with him, other than change it in an biased unprincipled manner; then that would be a start for me.</p>

<p>You'll have to wait for my offer, as I will have to find the relevant page, or method in which to submit it, and furthermore, I‘m not on the Internet, permanently, twenty-four hours a day either. I‘ll submit the compromise in due course, very shortly, when I know where and who to make it to. I do not feel this is unreasonable, so there’s no value in being disingenuous towards me taking time to make my submition of the compromise. I can assure the mediator that I will definitely be producing this compromise very shortly.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I feel, all messages should be suspended to the GD article talk page, and no more past disputation pages should be pasted to the present disputation, as it will only confuse matters. The mediator will need time to go through the information on this page, it is only now fair to the mediator to leave further pointless disputing and actually put all efforts into compromise and sorting this out with the mediator directly. I will find out exactly who and where to serve my "first step" as you put it.</p>

<p>This user is going through and mass-prodding/AFDing articles for having no inbound wikilinks or (in his opinion) for having been tagged for cleanup for too long. It's highly disruptive, and the vast majority of these pages seem to be useful and perfectly viable pages that (big surprise) just need to be cleaned up and expanded. The whole mess feels like a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation, and I'm mentioning it here in the hope that someone with more authority than me can call time out and figure out a better course of action. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 17:15, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A glance at his contributions show that his 'mass-prodding' seems to be mainly articles by Edbon3000, who periodically creates dozens of articles at a time about the Filipino film industry which have no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> whatsoever and have frequently been deleted. He has never deigned to communicate with editors despite entreaties on his talk page. The one article I remember him creating that was actually on a notable and verifiable person, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogelio_De_La_Rosa_b82d.html" title="Rogelio De La Rosa">Rogelio De La Rosa</a>, was actually inaccurate from start to finish and had to be completely rewritten (by me, in fact).

<dd>Nominating Edbon's articles for deletion is not only not <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> but probably the best course of action.

<p>So far he hasn't added back any categories that were previously deleted. He's separating out the characters on the show by position (guard, prisoner, and visitor) rather than by gang.

<dd>and two) you're not telling people something they don't already know, if you'll take a quick look at his RFA for instance, you'll see that most of the support was based on the fact that he is incredibly and openly partasain, as well as openly hostile, heck, half the support votes were from people who have been long since banned for open trolling, so if you think something's actually changed since then to errode that kind of support, you're quite mistaken--64.12.116.65 11:37, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I certainly wouldn't deadmin him as he is a capable and I am sure well-intentioned editor. Some of his work on the national Parks articles is worthwhile.

<p>I also find his reply to Hyperbole above ('Eventually the response (after incessant badgering about the same old tired nonsense)..."You must be an idiot!" ') deeply disturbing.

<dd>Agree entirely. (As he has done many times before) MONGO is clearly doing a very good job in ensuring that this article is well referenced and includes neutral facts.

<dd>And I disagree entirely, except with your last point. There is no call for abuse; I have never treated this user with anything other than courtesy, in spite of being called (just above) a "POV pusher of nonsense" and a "time wasting troll", among other things. In spite of all these deeply inappropriate behaviours, Mongo, I do still believe you are acting in good faith.

<li>Many of the 9/11 articles are under siege by people promoting conspiracy theories who have little regard for the standards that the Wikipedia should maintain. There's been months of edit-warring over the insertion that Larry Silverstein conspired with government and non-government entities to destroy 7 World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 by a controlled-demolition. How many times does one have to delete that before one calls the inserter an <i>time wasting troll</i>?

<dd>Right, the POV pushing on that page (and others) is relentless. Mongo has been tireless resisting attempts by a very small handful of editors to sidestep editorial rules.

<p>This is a waste of time. This user just seems to be angry at Mongo responsibly using his admin powers to stop his continous violations of NPOV and refusal to accept the community's consensus. Should Mongo be more careful about his tone, yes, but is he doing what any other responsible admin would do, clearly yes. This is, in my opinion, a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.

<dd>I am a proud member of wikipedia. What makes me proudest about it however, is that all major points of view are taken into account. Thats why we can say that we work towards NPOV. I don't want to have to stop saying that. This is not a threat, just something for you to think about. Also, considering the obviously sensitive nature of this request, i propose that we put it to a vote, since i think we can all agree that it's something that the admins would have a bias against.

<dd>(after edit conflict) I think The King is correct to suggest that someone may oppose recreation of this article in view of the ill regard in which they hold the website (I imagine, though, that they <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">act in good faith</a>, believing our having an article apropos of WR to be deleterious vis-à-vis encyclopedic purposes), but, irrespective of motivation, those opposing de-salting and recreation are altogether correct with respect to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> (scilicet, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>); the site has an Alexa rank of 71,164 (though the rank appears to be increasing, and surely I'd be amenable to our reopening the discussion should the site reach, say, 30,000) and is not otherwise notable (mentions under <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_Wikipedia_565c.html" title="Criticisms of Wikipedia">Criticisms of Wikipedia</a>, about the encyclopedic nature of which I'm not certain, would be fine, I suppose). As encyclopedists, we must be disinterested, and we oughtn't to permit our affiliation with Wikipedia to affect our editing: for the same reasons that an article about Phil Sandifer should be (and likely will be) deleted, viz., that, were we not eminently familiar with the subject in view of our association with Wikipedia, we'd think the subject non-notable, so too oughtn't we to have a Wikipedia Review article. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:53, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have a point about reverting anytime, I was just trying to prevent irrational reactions that would make things worse, when they come back and see their pages blanked. As for <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakedonas_6918.html" title="User:Makedonas">User:Makedonas</a>, his page used to be much milder, and I am sure he'll get in-line. People (ha! especially hot-blooded Greeks and Slavomacedonians) tend to over-react when they consider they've been victimised by what they interpret as use of excessive force.

<dd>I'm not sure how that would help to be honest. I mean, giving them four more days, or six more days is not going to help if they don't come online.

<dd>One word- bull crap. This VANDAL not only has blanked out legitimate AND SOURCED additions to the Wii article, he has repeatedly attacked me, harassed me, on my talk page (which I, in my legitimate capacity, have removed, as all his contributions to it have been harassing personal attacks and vandalism), and he's brought in meatpuppets to the talk page in order to "agree" with him. He's put comments down there such as "You are only here to attack the Wii!", called my legitimate and sourced additions "vandalism", blanked out sections of the page (which IS vandalism), and now he comes here to waste your time. Anyone who's checked my edit history knows that POV is quite important to me- I've never "attacked" neither the Wii, nor the PS3 or whatever. I recommend THAT user recieve a block- I don't deserve the treatment that him and his meatpuppets have given me, given the fact that I've spent a significant amount of time improving numerous Nintendo related articles with the attempt to keep out POV. --<a href="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/8/85/Tinyducksig.jpg/20px-Tinyducksig.jpg" alt="" width="20" height="17" longdesc="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETinyducksig.jpg_d58b.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom127_c0b1.html" title="User:Doom127">Daniel Davis</a> 01:19, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This only further proves that something is strange about this user's behavior. Other users agreed with me on their own, I in no way rallied them or am faking a consensus as he has implied. This user cannot accept that several users <i>besides</i> me disagreed with his basis for adding certain content. Check <b>my</b> contributions and you will see I have never intentionally vandalized an article, so calling me a vandal for the umpteenth time is in fact a violation of policy as I understand it. Please note per his talk page history that I originally left one comment about the reason for removing the <b>one</b> section he re-added and did not add warnings until after he removed my comment. He has once again removed those legitimate warnings from his talk page. And the wording of his comments has made it appear he wants to add a criticism section to the <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a> page for the sole reason of doing so, not to enhance its quality. Check <a href="../../../w/i/i/Talk%7EWii_f1e1.html" title="Talk:Wii">Talk:Wii</a>, I am not the only user who thinks so. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDannybu2001_d297.html" title="User:Dannybu2001">Danny</a> 01:47, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

His talk, which is an attack page on his opponents, a Black Book-type list compiled by him, isn't moderated, he persisted with addressing his opponents by their ethnicities (misapplying those too), calling them vandals, propagandists and whatever.</p>
<p>However, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexPU_adf9.html#To_my_friends_and_enemies" title="User talk:AlexPU">what he posted at his talk</a> <i>following the very last block</i> is just unspeakable. He trippled the level of his attacks and spiced them with homophobic (<i>"You, smelly faggot"</i>), ethnic (<i>"gypsy"</i>) and sexual (<i>"whore"</i>) slurs. While there is no indication that any of his opponents actually belong to any of these groups, I am calling this behavior to the admin attention.</p>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind is to lock his talk page as well so that he would have no chance to assault anyone anywhere at wiki-space but this may be counterproductive as it may prevent others from talking to him and would prevent him to censor his previos attacks and the black book should he come to senses. Warning him seems useless but something needs done. Perhaps doubling the block for the post-block activity so that he sees that his actions would have further consequences? I leave it up to the community.</p>
<p>I don't see why we need to waste the ArbCom's time for such an obvious case. ArbCom is busy enough. I don't see any sense of an RfC since, again, this is plain enough, got sufficient exposure for many people to comment already and they commented. There seems to be a need for an action rather than talk. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 17:51, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

The history of the dispute is spelled out on the Talk page, as well as (unfortunately) my own User page, where Haizum has left several profane messages (now deleted but part of the history). I have asked him to stay off my User page but without success. On the Talk page, Haizum is now attributing a quote to me which is false and defamatory.</p>
<p>I have made <i>thousands</i> of edits on Wikipedia and have never encountered a user like this. I'm afraid Haizum has exhausted my patience. What can be done? Please help. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandover_7608.html" title="User:Sandover">Sandover</a> 20:51, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Furthermore, the protection is not supposed to be an endorsement of a particular version, SO WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE DISPUTED TAG?</p>
<p>This is unacceptable, and you can bet I will make sure it is known that you endorsed a version, contrary to policy.</p>
<p>Also, oh wise admin, the dispute tag was there for a part of the section that Sandover isn't even invloved in.</p>
Shape up, it looks like you're on your way to arbitration.<big>”</big></div>
<p>It was followed just a few minutes later by this email:</p>
<div style="margin:1em 5% 0.5em;position:relative;">
<p><big style="position:absolute;left:-1ex;">“</big> Oh great, you're from the UK. So you've the protected Laura Ingraham page THE WAY YOU SEE FIT, and now I suppose you're going to try to get involved in the content even though she has no meaning in the UK.</p>

<p>2."Admins must not protect pages they are actively engaged in editing, except in the case of simple vandalism."</p>
<p>3."If a page is protected because of an edit war, please do not ask for it to be protected in some other version than it currently is. A protection is not an endorsement of the current version. Instead, go to the talk page and attempt to resolve the dispute."</p>
<p>1. You protected a page because of a Dispute tag. 99% of the disputed section was left unchanged, yet you claim I was warring...for ADDING material.</p>
<p>2. You edited the page the way you wanted to see it before you protected it. I will make sure this is burned into your record.</p>
<p>3. You made no attempt to resolve the dispute. You protected the page in its POV form after DELIBERATELY removing the Dispute tag.</p>

And didn't post such messages after being warned, this admin simply didn't consider this, I dont know whether he/she should've considered this. But I feel this is very unfair, though my account was unblocked still one of my IP is blocked. <a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMyst%C3%ACc_07bb.html" title="User:Mystìc"><span style="color:white;background:#008">&#160;<span style="background:#009">«<span style="background:#00a">₪<span style="background:#00b">M<span style="background:#00c">ÿ<span style="background:#00e">š</span>†</span>í</span>c</span>₪</span>»&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMyst%C3%ACc_4c6e.html" title="User talk:Mystìc"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 20:04, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
