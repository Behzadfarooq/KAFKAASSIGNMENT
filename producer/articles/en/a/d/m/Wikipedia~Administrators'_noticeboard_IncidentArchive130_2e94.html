<p>Hi, this user is moving pages with diacritics to versions without them only because there was no redirect from the unaccented version (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ram%C5%ABnas_%C5%A0i%C5%A1kauskas&amp;diff=66229375&amp;oldid=62554791" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ram%C5%ABnas_%C5%A0i%C5%A1kauskas&amp;diff=66229375&amp;oldid=62554791" rel="nofollow">e.g.</a>). He refuses to make simple redirects because it does not teach the involved editors to make redirects. Three users protested his actions, but he is still insisting on his own way. See <a href="../../../g/e/n/User_talk%7EGene_Nygaard_2939.html#Ram.C5.ABnas_.C5.A0i.C5.A1kauskas" title="User talk:Gene Nygaard">related talk section</a>. I have no time or will to babysit him and revert the moves. Please do something about it. Thank you. <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenata3_94d8.html" title="User:Renata3">Renata</a> 17:34, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mr. Nygaard seems to be on the edge (or beyond) of WP:POINT, but well-intentioned. Perhaps if a few admins weighed in we could channel his desire to help more effectively. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 01:00, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have restored this comment to the noticeboard as this editor has continued moving pages despite <b>eight</b> editors asking him to stop or reverting his edits - a clear action against consensus.</dd>

<dd>Just one example: <a href="../../../r/%C3%A9/t/R%C3%A9ts%C3%A1g.html" title="Rétság">Rétság</a> was moved to <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retsag.html" title="Retsag">Retsag</a> today.

<dd>Gene claims on his talk page that he moves the pages (rather than creating the necessary redirect) to make a point to the original page creator that they should have created a diacriticless redirect earlier.

<dl>
<dd>The issue of non-English-alphabet names needs to have a clear policy -- something to be decided from above. I have made it my rule so far to create articles with the native name, creating redirects for all the Anglicized versions. I agree that Gene's policy of anglicizing article names (without that being a clear WP policy) does more harm than good -- <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalthrow_26cd.html" title="User:Palthrow">Palthrow</a> 18:44, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't see a big issue, I thought we have guidelines (see the RAN incident) that we name the article with the most common English spelling, e.g. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_von_Neumann_321b.html" title="John von Neumann">John von Neumann</a> instead of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neumann_J%C3%A1nos_c9a8.html" title="Neumann János">Neumann János</a>. But in the cases where the name isn't commonly used in English, we use the native spelling. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 19:24, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, according to the very valid points you are making--no determination has yet been made as to the proper English Wikipedia title in the articles I am moving. Therefore, no one has any real grounds for complaint against my moves. The unaccented form has not yet been considered by anyone. If you disagree with my choice as to the particular title, you can discuss it on that articles talk page. Or, you can even revert me--but at least we don't end up with the totally unacceptable position which prevailed before. If you do revert me, the redirect will remain. That means that someone who sees some word or name of a person or place in an English language newspaper or magazine story will now at least have a reasonable chance to find the Wikipedia article on the subject, if one exists. That wasn't the case before.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, in many cases it really doesn't matter all that much which of the various spellings and forms appears in the article title, as long as you can find the article by slapping on the squigglies after I have moved it to the English form, or whatever. What is totally unacceptable is not to have a search for the English alphabet version work. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 02:26, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A couple of other things to consider:
<ol>
<li>After my moves, all links from forms with accents still work and still get you to the proper article.</li>
<li>After my moves, entering the accented form into the "Go" box still works.</li>
<li>After my moves, many former redlinks are now blue, and take you to the correct article.</li>
<li>After my moves, entering the English alphabet form in the "Go" box works as well, something that wasn't true before.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Actually, there are almost no places where you will even notice that the article has been moved, when it comes to finding information in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, many of these articles are accompanied by another problem--not being indexed properly in the categories. It isn't a one-to-one correspondence; some of those missing any connection the the English alphabet form have already been indexed properly (and in most cases, appear as they should in the same place in the list whether the accents are included in the article title or not), and some with the article title in an unaccented version have improper use of diacritics in the indexing sort keys. But quite often the two problems go hand in hand. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 02:40, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One of the major problems with that is that you miss out on the knowledge of those people who know when a letter is often transliterated as two letters rather than one (dj, dz, aa, ou, etc.), and can thus also create redirects from the other spellings as well. If their attention isn't called to the problem, because we only made an invisible semi-fix to one particular article, then that is missed. One of the problems, of course, is that a single character can be transliterated differently in different languages, so there is not any one size fits all solution, even if I were to bother even trying to learn all those silly rules for each of the thousands of possible characters. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 12:57, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ten people have told you to stop.</p>
<ul>
<li>A redirect does not move a page to a name inconsistent with all the other related articles in its category, unlike your moves.</li>
<li>A redirect does not need <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> and an admin to undo, unlike some of your moves.</li>
<li>A redirect does not require a team of editors to waste their time reverting your contributions needlessly, unlike your moves.</li>
<li>A redirect does not move the page does not move the page to an arbitrary transliteration like your moves do - <i>you even admit you don't fully understand transliteration schemes above</i>.</li>
<li>A redirect does not cause multiple double redirects which you don't bothered to fix, unlike your moves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tu put it short: I do not agree with Gene for the simple reason that if nobody makes a redirect we have a wrong article title and the reader does not know that (he cannot know whether the title is an alternative name, the correct spelling, the wrong spelling etc.). Therefore I am strictly against any such titles and I have seen no rule saying that we should have wrong article titles. <a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuro_42ae.html" title="User:Juro">Juro</a> 02:25, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They are most definitely not "wrong" article titles. You might argue that one is better than the other for the one slot we have available for the actual title, but redirects mean that we can find it under any of the "correct" possibilities--as long as they exist, of course. The problem is, these redirects often do not exist. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 21:48, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, Gene, that is exactly what we are arguing. You seem to be saying that it doesn't matter <i>at all</i> where the article is, as long as all appropriate redirects point to it. Your aim of making sure all possible redirects exist - which, I stress again, is an aim I agree with 100% - is one that can be achieved <i>without moving these articles</i> from their established titles. I ask you one last time, <b>please stop</b> these disruptive and pointless moves. — <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a><a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford">++</a> 08:39, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me highlight the problems as clearly as possible. Looking at <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Turkey_c0e5.html" title="Category:Towns in Turkey">Category:Towns in Turkey</a>, it is clear that to find or refer to any Turkish town, I should use the name with diacritcs, as this is the form that has been used by the editors of all these 74 pages. Except this isn't true any more; <a href="../../../g/%C3%BC/z/G%C3%BCzel%C3%A7aml%C4%B1.html" title="Güzelçamlı">Güzelçamlı</a> and <a href="../../../%C3%A7/a/t/%C3%87atalsu.html" title="Çatalsu">Çatalsu</a> weren't after your spree last night.</p>
<p>Is there any encyclopaedic reason for this, or perhaps a reason stemming from principal usage? No. It's completely arbitrary, and purely down to the stubborness of one editor who freely admits he doesn't fully understand the principles of transliteration in these languages. An editor, in fact, who doesn't sort out the dozens of double redirects he creates to these pages by moving them, but who justifies himself by complaining about double redirects. One who says the article title hasn't been considered, but does not take into account the considerations of the article creator, all subsequent editors, and the consideration given to the naming within the group of articles as a whole.</p>
<p>Gene, looking through your contribs you're not even implementing the current conventions correctly:</p>
<ul>
<li>we don't move articles to the "English name" <i>just</i> because one exists (see <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takuu.html" title="Takuu">Takuu</a>) - we move it there if that "English name" <i>is the predominant usage</i>. Hence <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> but not <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marseilles.html" title="Marseilles">Marseilles</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saragossa.html" title="Saragossa">Saragossa</a>.</li>
<li>we don't strip people of diacritics <i>just</i> because they are American; you do so if they are American <i>and</i> their name is predominantly used without them: my esteemed friend Mr Müller didn't have to relinquish his umlaut to obtain an American passport, and neither did his children who were born there, and their <i>u'</i>s remain adorned to this day.</li>
<li>we don't move articles if they index peculiarly - we fix the indexing with the tag. If editor education is your main aim, as claimed, why revert 30-odd edits by <a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonius_Mundus_ec96.html" title="User:Ionius Mundus">User:Ionius Mundus</a> last night for this reason and not even bother to discuss it with him on his talk page?</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no current canon yet on whether we use a restricted character set for titles. If you want to change naming conventions, change it at the policy level through the proper channels and not through isolated, inconsistent, incomplete and disruptive page moves. At least at the moment we have consistency within related article groups. It is not worth losing this when we can achieve largely the same result a less disruptive fashion. Fix the index tags like you normally do, create the diacriticless redir, fix the double redirects and if you really want, leave a note on the article creator's talk to politely remind them to create the redir themselves in future. Make a template to do so if you wish.</p>
<p>You have made ~100 such edits. All have been reverted. This usually shows you're doing something people think you shouldn't.</p>
<p>Doing so even when repeatedly requested not to by numerous editors, administrators, and a member of ArbCom is disrupting the encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquilina_e23d.html" title="User:Aquilina">Aquilina</a> 12:00, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had this Gene appear out of nowhere like a bear with a sore head making threats to revert moves made to Polynesian mythology articles because the macronised vowels in those names upset the categorization which it seems in his book is more important than accuracy. He said that if he had to do it he would do it the easy way, ie, revert the moves. Why could he not have approached me civilly and pointed out the deficiencies in my use of category sort codes (of which I knew nothing) nicely? OK, I learned, but he made me angry for no good reason. Then he shifted <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takuu.html" title="Takuu">Takuu</a>, (an article about an atoll in Papua New Guinea I was heavily involved in writing) to Mortlock Islands because apparently 'if there is an English name we should use it.' That was uncalled for and annoying because 'Mortlock Islands' is little used in this part of the world to refer to Takuu, and because there is actually another group of islands called 'Mortlock Islands' in the Federated States of Micronesia. It was like he looked up my contributions and decided to mess with Takuu just because I added diacritics to some article names. I feel annoyed because I have done a lot of work to begin cleaning up a huge mess in the Polynesian articles, and I get treated like a vandal by this rude Gene. Editing to make a point is not kosher is it? Another thing that he may not be aware of, is that English comes in many flavours, and in the New Zealand flavour, accepted spelling of Māori words often INCLUDES THE DIACRITICS. Coincidentally (or not), at the same time as Gene was threatening the reverts, an anonymous person with the IP 66.97.252.168 added sort codes on two categories on the Māori Wikipedia <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 12:26, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That doesn't change the indexing, even if it is "often" though certainly not universal in New Zealand it still is indexed with a rather than according to Unicode numbers. Even in <a href="../../../../mi/n/g/%C4%81/Category%7ENg%C4%81_t%C4%81one_o_Aotearoa_1998.html" class="extiw" title="mi:Category:Ngā_tāone_o_Aotearoa">mi:Category:Ngā tāone o Aotearoa</a> you should be fixing the indexing so that ā doesn't come after "b", let alone after "z" as it usually does now--but that doesn't mean I'll bother getting a user name there, even if I do help out a bit. That also includes indexing of categories in their supercategories. I'll give you a little more time before following up on your moves here on English Wikipedia and fixing any you might have missed. After you finish that, maybe you'd be interested in fixing those such as the <a href="../../../n/g/a/Ngai_Tai_6ab1.html" title="Ngai Tai">Ngai Tai</a> mentioned above which remains a redlink as of this posting, even though more than two days without any of the supposedly concerned people following this thread taking the hint. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 13:59, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Does your "esteemed friend Mr Müller" have a Wikipedia article in need of attention? Where will I find him in the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Security_Death_Index_e1ae.html" title="Social Security Death Index">Social Security Death Index</a> when he dies? Have you actually seen any of his children's report cards from school? What does his driver's license say? What does the court docket say if he is stopped for speeding or arrested for something else, or the newspaper in its report of that? In some of such cases, usage with accents can probably be established; but in most cases, all that justifies is a redirect from the accented form. The burden is on those trying to establish that fact, especially with regard to the article name rather than just a redirect, whereas I was obviously dealing with cases where it had never been considered since there wasn't even a redirect or disambiguation page link. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 14:48, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This editor seems to be working against consensus, although he may have some folk in support of the naming question, the consensus seems clear that he should <i>not</i> be doing what he is doing the way he is doing it. Arguing the points of what is right or wrong about naming is <i>out of place</i> on this, the Administrator's Notice board, and ought to be taken elsewhere.</p>
<p>The only relevant question here is, are the actions of this editor disrupting the encyclopedia, and if so, what should be done about it? The answers seem clear to me, they are disruptive, and if he will not agree to stop doing them until consensus is clear, and then agree to abide by consensus whether he agrees or not (these are our norms, after all), he should be blocked. Gene Nygaard, Bobblewik, SPUI... these seem of a class... acting in good faith and with good intentions, up to a point, but unwilling to abide by consensus, and insistent on editing to enforce their view in the face of strong opposition. That's just not collegial. Therefore I think a block is in order here. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 15:53, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have temporarily blocked Bobblewik because he has returned to rapid en-masse date delinking of articles, just 8 minutes after his last one month block expired. He is also doing other less controversial MoS style edits, but the date delinking ones are accompanied by the less than descriptive edit summary of "<i>links</i>". I bring this here for review. Bobblewik has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Bobblewik" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Bobblewik" rel="nofollow">repeatedly blocked</a> for continual delinking of dates.

From past discussion here, on his talk page and his block history, he is well aware that these edits are extremely controversial and disruptive. I think this is an editor who is clearly not prepared to stop these disruptive edits and is on the brink of expending the patience of the community completely. I think it is time to consider a community imposed ban.

<dd>Certainly a lot of people object to Bobblewik's year delinking, and a lot of other people support it. The MOS says "There is less agreement about links to years. Some editors believe that links to years are generally useful to establish context for the article. Others believe that links to years are rarely useful to the reader and reduce the readability of the text". At one stage there was a suggestion that one should not edit articles specifically to remove date links. It looks to be that today Bobblewik has been finding articles with units to tidy up and then delinking years when he saw them too. This obviously has not placated the opponents! Personally I support delinking but I wish BW wouldn't do it because it gets some people so upset. Can't his tremendous number of valuable edits allow room for a bit of leeway? <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThincat_aebc.html" title="User:Thincat">Thincat</a> 14:38, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This discussion needs to be held here for maximum community exposure. This is a recurring pattern of editing from Bobblewik. You make reference to "restrictions imposed on him", but from what I see, that was some informal comment by some editors regarding the speed of his edits (and whether or not he is running an unauthorised bot), not some officially community sanctioned imposition. Those comments also made reference to the "<a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobblewik_Archive_2006Jul_8129.html#Possible_unblock" title="User talk:Bobblewik/Archive/2006Jul">necessity of leaving more descriptive edit summaries or talk page messages on your delinkings (with reasonings on why you removed a particular link) and throttl[ing] the number of such edits down to something below 6 in a minute</a>". Editing speed has certainly been reduced, but the use of descriptive edit summaries and talk page summaries have clearly not been improved.</dd>

<dd>The problem is that even at his newly reduced editing speed there is clearly no scope for full consideration of the relevance of any date links to the context of the article he edits; THAT is where I believe the majority of opposition to these edits has stemmed from. I agree that many articles are overly date linked, but context is everything and many date links can be considered relevant. Bobblewik's latest bout of editing just removed all linked dates when encountered, at a speed that clearly would not allow sufficient examination of the context in which each date was linked. There is wide disagreement on this issue between editors and no clear consensus that these edits are acceptable. Bobblewik has been asked by numerous people, including Jimbo apparently, to stop this. After expiry of each and every block what happens? Boblewik returns and starts delinking dates, and I repeat en-masse because that's what is happening. Articles edited today with a non preference linked date were changed at at around 2 per minute initially. All linked dates were changed - blam, onto the next one - that is en-masse date delinking without consideration of the context in relation to the article.</dd>

<p>Thanks for undoing the block. The problem is that square brackets are used for two independent functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Hyperlinks</li>
<li>2. Date preference</li>
</ul>
<p>Many editors say that they thought that *all* date components must be within square brackets. It is clear that much of the excessive linking is by well-meaning editors that misunderstood the issue and/or just followed others.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the implementation mechanism is so complicated that we get things like [[November 12th]], [[November 15|15 Nov]] which prevent the preference mechanism working. In some cases, we get plausible errors that make the text difficult to read with preferences. For example, even experienced editors believe that [[November 12]]-[[November 15|15]] look fine, but it actually parses to the unacceptable form: <i>12 November-15</i>. These could be solved on their own (a few editors, including myself have solved many) but they are merely symptoms of the problem.</p>
<p>Even if I never delinked another date, the desire to resolve this problem will not disappear. Around 70 to 80 % of editors that voted in a limited poll thought that action should be taken. There are many editors willing to take action. The question is, what? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a></p>

<dd>Bobblewik, thanks, but this is nothing to do with your speed of edits. I acknowledged that you have reduced them in line with other editor's concerns. With regards to en masse (my apologies for introducing a non existent hyphen) please consult your dictionary, thesaurus or other online resources for the meaning. En masse - all together, in one group or body, as one, as a whole ... etc. That is what you have been doing with your repeatedly contested edits. <b>Every</b> individually linked date or century link has been delinked by your edits, en masse, without reference to the relevance in relation to the context of the article. The speed issue relates only to your capability to properly assess the relevance of each link. Please continue discussion of this in the relevant forums but, until there is consensus for your date linking edits, please stop.

I am sure I am not alone in considering him a disruptive element, and it would be best for the Wikipedia project if he were blocked from editing it. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallimak_5f83.html" title="User:Mallimak">Mallimak</a> 00:26, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The pair of you should stop spamming people all over the place if you expect to earn any sympathy for your respective plights. People won't take you seriously while your approach is akin to stuffing pizza leaflets through their letterboxes. This page is not for dispute resolution, and doling out a block is rarely used to resolve a dispute, and irritating you is not nearly serious enough to earn an idefinite block (nor, likely, any block at all). You need to use <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> properly. If you've tried RfC, which I expect you haven't seeing as my talk page didn't get spammed about one, then try one. If that fails, try Arbitration. Also, try being nice to one another and tolerating each other's foibles. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 01:08, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p><i>" ... this is just abuse of the project space (to go with earlier abuse of the article space, the category space, and template space by the same user). The description of an edit that adds "The Orkney archipelago is a council area of Scotland." as "vandalism", and reverting it with summary "Mais oui! Why are you interfering here? Can t you just bugger off?" basically sums up the problem with Mallimak's behaviour: a determination to have his "own" content in some niche of wikipedia, regardless of encyclopaedic value, and independent of other editors' input. If this keeps up, <b>an RFC would be indicated</b>."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And fifthly: life is just too short. Frankly, I am "sick to the back teeth" of him, and would strongly prefer for Admins to deal with him, rather than me having to monitor his growing <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> campaign.

<p>I don't wish to be drawn into the specific complaint raised by <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallimak_5f83.html" title="User:Mallimak">Mallimak</a>. However, <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> has also falsely accused me of sockpuppetry and now routinely reverts my edits simply because they are my edits, without any discussion or attempt to reach consensus. He is the only user against whom I have encountered these problems.</p>
<p>I have no view about the efficacy of formal steps against <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a>. He clearly makes a wide range of contributions, many of which are valued by others. He has a rather transparent agenda, namely to promote Scotland and other Celtic areas at the expense of balance, objectivity or context. I would suggests that an editor whom he trusts and respects encourage him to adopt a more collaborative, less confrontational approach and to discuss directly his objections and observations wih other contributors. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENormalmouth_757b.html" title="User:Normalmouth">Normalmouth</a> 06:09, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"... falsely accused..."</i> - There is no proof of whether my allegation of sockpuppetry is "false" or true because CheckUser refuses to expose a Users IP address except in "extreme" circumstances, but the evidence clearly points to Normalmouth logging-out and using his IP address to vote in a Requested move discussion. And I am very sorry to say that Normalmouth has an extremely "transparent agenda": to do all he can to stain the reputation of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plaid_Cymru_07ea.html" title="Plaid Cymru">Plaid Cymru</a>. No other Wikipedia article on a UK political party is as one-sidedly negative as the PC article, and a large measure of the responsibility for that lies at the doorstep to Normalmouth.</dd>

<li><b>Note to admins</b>: The above discussion is very revealing. <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">User:Mais oui!</a> would appear to have a tactic of indulging in edit wars and constantly attacking the contributions of users who don't agree with his POV, and of accusing them of sockpuppetry in order to undermine their credibility, obviously with the aim of getting them to give up contributing to Wikipedia. I wonder how many good contributors Wikipedia has lost as a result of Mais oui!'s tactics?

However, <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> certainly makes a number of valuable and constructive contributions, when he puts aside his own POV... I'm not as familiar with <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallimak_5f83.html" title="User:Mallimak">Mallimak</a>, although his repeated spamming of this page over what appears to be a content dispute is not impressive.

<dd>I would agree that Mais_oui does indulge in edit warring, and attacking the contributions of other users. After I had nominated a Scottish template for deletion in favour of the British one- he responded by reverting all my recent edits with the comments- "rv English Nationalist" (see for example- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Princess_Alexandra%2C_Duchess_of_Fife&amp;diff=60512127&amp;oldid=60469114" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Princess_Alexandra%2C_Duchess_of_Fife&amp;diff=60512127&amp;oldid=60469114" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>). Also any attempts to engage with the user and avoid edit wars is usually met with personal abuse- eg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAstrotrain&amp;diff=44635059&amp;oldid=43443236" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAstrotrain&amp;diff=44635059&amp;oldid=43443236" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 13:49, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He is difficult, he is aggressive, and he is a POV-pusher. By the same token, he does make very valuable contributions. I'm not taking sides in this particular issue, because it seems to me that neither are angels. But in general, I think many problems could be solved here simply by more communication and less unilateral action. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 14:09, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

I was away from the computer for a while and Wikipedia has automatically logged me off, so my IP address is given.

Travb B has, however, even during the AfD, hounded me with baseless accusations and implied I behave like a vandal. He streeses I should not be deleting sections that I believe are not appropriate because I don't <i>add</i> anything. This is contrary to policy, I should not be required to add to an article in order to delete inappropraite sections.

<dd>&gt; The other edit did not accuse User:Kalsermar of anything<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America&amp;diff=70133388&amp;oldid=70133270" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America&amp;diff=70133388&amp;oldid=70133270" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, and in this edit I accidently deleted a large section which User:Kalsermar has deleted himself. In trying to restore User:Kalsermar deletions, I made a mistake, which was quickly changed by another user.</dd>
<dd>&gt; I find it ironic that User:Kalsermar is pointing out my accidental deletion "note edit summary" when he has deleted a ratio of 3:1,857 words, and started the AfD without ever contributing a single word to the article. My accidental mistake in no way lessens User:Kalsermar guilt or innocent, they are mutually exclusive actions, under <a href="../../../t/u/_/Tu_quoque.html" title="Tu quoque">Tu quoque</a> logic. If this "is not the content dispute" as User:Kalsermar states, why would he bring up my accidental deletions stating: "note edit summary"? User:Kalsermar can't have it both ways: it is either a content dispute or it is not.</dd>
<dd>&gt; User:Kalsermar wants this not to be a content dispute because what led me to say those things, is because the "content dispute" involves User:Kalsermar's behavior, with a ratio of 3:1,857 word deletions, paints him in a bad light. This argument is about a content dispute, and began because of a content dispute. I don't understand how User:Kalsermar is able to seperate the two, especially when he himself mentions my accidental deletion: "note edit summary".</dd>

If I add a million <b>referenced</b> words which met <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and the other rules, and you come along and delete all of them, this is not contibuting to the article.

You on the other hand continually do so against anyone who does not conform to your POV. I struck out the vandalism comment and I apologize for assuming bad faith in your behavioural pattern.

<dd>&gt;It goes both ways <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">User:Kalsermar</a> it is obvious your 3 words and your 1,857 words deleted is not any signifigant contribution. If you can't see this, then we will have to let others decide this in arbitration. Since you are too stubborn to respect the decision of the AfD, which was no consensus, which by default means keep, and you continue to delete large sections, I will be forced to start a RfC, followed by arbitration. The entire two months this is going on, the article will be protected. All of those words you want to delete will stay on wikipedia. Then, the arbitors will punish any large deletion of referenced material by booting you, for one day up to a month. So: you have a choice. Stop deleting content that does not match you POV, try to reach a consensus on the talk page, or the page remains protected for months, and then you get booted when you start deleting large portions of referenced, verifiable material. I already know the conclusion to this, I have seen the same behavior a million times before. I wish you would surprise me but there appears to be no comprimising with you.

<li>My tentative investigation of this matter (as a neutral third-party at the suggestion of Kalsermar) suggests that -- as one might expect -- some of the content-removal by Kalsermar was clearly justified, and some was questionable. The correct course here is for neither editor to alter the article at this point without seeking talk-page consensus, a measure enforced for the moment by protection. It is important to note that, as Kalsermar says, content-removal is oftentimes a positive contribution to an article, deleting bias and increasing focus.

<p>The "altering" is simply removing the tag, as I do not believe the incident was correctly tagged. The 3RR was not correctly dealt with as anyone can see from actually looking at the reverts in question. There are 5 reverts in a 24 hour period! How can that not be a violation? There is no rule that a random admin's decision is binding, and anyway I will just relist if it is deleted. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuterium_a36a.html" title="User:Deuterium">Deuterium</a> 03:00, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The 3RR states that one can make no more than three reversions on the same article in a 24 hour period, so your 5 reversions clearly constitutes a violation.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 05:26, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm having trouble understanding this. All I see from the diffs is what Netscott claims, that Deuterium is changing the admin decisions on WP/3RR because he, who filed the reports, thinks the decisions ought to have gone his way. It makes me blink in disbelief... especially when William MC states that <i>both</i> users are being "silly", and blocks them both. How is Netscott silly for reverting this absurd vandalism, or isn't it absurd vandalism, have I totally missed some vital point? I do have faith in William MC's experience and judgement, I'm more than willing to be convinced, but, what is it I'm not seeing?

<p>Light current has already had a block review declined, but he's asking the two admins currently involved <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">User:Lar</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrini_e6be.html" title="User:Drini">User:Drini</a> to make sure they're acting on the correct info.

<dd>As another independant observer, based on his explanation there does seem to be a possibility that he was re-blocked on a misunderstanding. I would urge an admin to take a fresh look at this, perhaps <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrini_e6be.html" title="User:Drini">User:Drini</a> could confirm whether s/he intended to unblock as <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">User:Light current</a> suggests. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 05:25, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the crux of Drini's block was a belief that Light current made an attack page that an EnthusiastFRANCE sock made. While Light current's behaviour has been less than spectacular on his talk page (particularly with respect to his discourse with Pschemp) I don't think it warrants a month's block. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)">धर्म</a></small> 05:40, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, i concur. I think (hope) Light current will see the, uh, light and realise that the way forward is an apology to Pschemp, a better understanding of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and then he can get back to his excellent work on engineering related articles.

<p>I tecnincally am the last admin to block... I happened to see the block by Drini, and it looked like (due to an error calculating timespans on my part) like Drini was trying to extend. So I unblocked and reblocked. It turns out I goofed, it was a new block not an extension so my action was unneeded. Allegations have been made that Drini lifted or meant to lift, which I think are incorrect. I've left a note on Drini's talk page stating that I am fine with whatever Drini does, leave it, reduce, lift... I gotta say that I see a LOT of nastiness and intransigence in this user's behaviour though. At a time when a month long block of Giano is being seriously mooted for one funny suggestion to a known troublemaker who really needs a community banning, I don't see a month in this case as disproportionate... but I'm not at all wedded to this block, and, particularly, defer to Drini. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 12:07, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Short version: Drini made the original block. Please speak with him about it. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 17:16, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He's "apologised" 4 times now (under his definition) but hasn't yet actually admitted fault. We can't force people to apologise but my metric for how closely to watch a user includes whether they apologised sincerely or not, a sincere apology tends to be a sign of reduced risk of further problems. I wish Drini would weigh in. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 10:53, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I still wish Drini would weigh in. But all in all this user is now showing more understanding (see <a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELight_current_53e6.html#Is_this_party_over.3F_Is_it_time_to_call_it_a_day.3F" title="User talk:Light current">this</a>) so I've taken it upon myself to reduce the block to 3 hours from now, menaing that the user will have been blocked for about 3 days. That now feels right to me. Drini or anyone else is welcome to comment on my actions. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:45, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find myself in a slow motion edit war.</p>
<p>Whilst reading <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobby_Nobbs_7277.html" title="Nobby Nobbs">Nobby Nobbs</a>, I came upon a link to <a href="../../../k/l/e/Kleptomania.html" title="Kleptomania">Kleptomania</a>. I was vaguly disturbed to find an article that smelled funny, rambling on about Monomania; I googled, found that Kleptomania was listed in the DSM, and checked the history.</p>
<p>And found that the current version was the work of one editor, User:Tobias Müller, who wrote the only modern paper cited as a source.</p>
<p>I reverted; and have since had to revert again.</p>
<p>And I'm wondering:</p>
<p>What should I do now?</p>

<dd>First of all, I noticed you haven't tried communicating with Tobias. No wonder why you two are in an edit war, both the article's talk page and his user talk page are empty. Start a dialogue with him and try resolve your differences civilly. There's no real point raising a complaint here unless he continues to ignore you.

<dd>I tried moving the <a href="../../../a/g/i/Aginar.html" title="Aginar">Aginar</a> page back, but it failed because he created a page with the same title as the one it had moved from. I think what needs to happen is that a bunch of articles need to be deleted (the redirects and so on) so that the pages can be moved back to their original locations for starters.

<p>Over the last few days there has been some contestation between myself and several users regarding the use of a logo from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_209c.html" title="The Legend of Zelda series">the Legend of Zelda series</a> of games. In particular the image that is at the middle of this is <a href="../../../t/r/i/Image%7ETriforce.svg_11c4.html" title="Image:Triforce.svg">Image:Triforce.svg</a>. A very close likeness of this image is featured prominently at <a href="http://www.zelda.com/universe/" class="external free" title="http://www.zelda.com/universe/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zelda.com/universe/</a>, and is in fact the avatar <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> uses for that website. My stance is that <a href="../../../t/r/i/Image%7ETriforce.svg_11c4.html" title="Image:Triforce.svg">Image:Triforce.svg</a> is a copyrighted work, and I've changed the tagging it from {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPd-self_7b74.html" title="Template:Pd-self">pd-self</a>}} to {{<a href="../../../l/o/g/Template%7ELogo_3c38.html" title="Template:Logo">logo</a>}} (though perhaps {{<a href="../../../g/a/m/Template%7EGame-icon_c4fd.html" title="Template:Game-icon">game-icon</a>}} is more appropriate). The counter response to this is that the image is a <a href="../../../s/i/e/Sierpinski_triangle.html" title="Sierpinski triangle">Sierpinski triangle</a> and is inherently uncopyrightable as a result, plus being user created. My counter-response has been that the image being a mathematical construct does not change the fact that it is a copyrighted work. The <a href="../../../m/i/t/Image%7EMitsubishi_logo.png_4cb3.html" title="Image:Mitsubishi logo.png">logo for Mitsubishi</a> is also a mathematical construct (simply <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallelogram.html" title="Parallelogram">parallelograms</a> arranged around a focal point). A quick summary of these respective positions may be found at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia_talk%7ECopyright_problems_c09f.html#Image:Triforce.svg" title="Wikipedia talk:Copyright problems">Wikipedia_talk:Copyright_problems#Image:Triforce.svg</a>.</p>
<p>As of now, the point remains in dispute. Recently, a used replaced the image with a yellow triangle, which from my chair is perfectly acceptable (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_Zelda&amp;diff=70114517&amp;oldid=69999121" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_Zelda&amp;diff=70114517&amp;oldid=69999121" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>). A day later, this was replaced by using the same triangle image three times, creating essentially the same image as <a href="../../../t/r/i/Image%7ETriforce.svg_11c4.html" title="Image:Triforce.svg">Image:Triforce.svg</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_Zelda&amp;diff=70251210&amp;oldid=70114517" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_Zelda&amp;diff=70251210&amp;oldid=70114517" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>). I reverted this change since it did create an essentially identical image <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_Zelda&amp;diff=70304994&amp;oldid=70251210" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_Zelda&amp;diff=70304994&amp;oldid=70251210" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. Shortly thereafter, the original <a href="../../../t/r/i/Image%7ETriforce.svg_11c4.html" title="Image:Triforce.svg">Image:Triforce.svg</a> was placed back on the template <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_Zelda&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=70304994" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_Zelda&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=70304994" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. I've reverted this change as well, returning to the single triangle version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_Zelda&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=70330328" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_Zelda&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=70330328" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>.</p>
<p>This dispute has gone on for four days now, and I've reverted/replaced five times over those days vs. three other users who have been reverting me. The dispute has also involved {{<a href="../../../z/e/l/Template%7EZeldaproj_7114.html" title="Template:Zeldaproj">Zeldaproj</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../z/e/l/Template%7EZelda-stub_82d4.html" title="Template:Zelda-stub">Zelda-stub</a>}} though with less reversion in their histories. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37">User:BigNate37</a> who put in place the single triangle (a good move I thought) also made a good suggestion my talk page to "call in a second opinion" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Durin#Template:User_Zelda" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Durin#Template:User_Zelda" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. Since <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia_talk%7ECopyright_problems_c09f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Copyright problems">Wikipedia_talk:Copyright_problems</a> didn't produce any dialogue, I'm bringing it here.</p>
<p>For the record, I think it's blatantly apparent this is a copyrighted image both by nature of the presence of it on Nintendo's website and by the fact that several users are quite interested in having some version of it on the various templates. If the image were not tightly related to Zelda, there would not be such interest. The image is tightly related because Nintendo markets it as such. They have a vested interest in protecting the use of such logos. The single yellow triangle is an acceptable, free-use alternative.</p>
<p>Lastly, I think the core of the dispute and its value is questionable; the argument is over using a copyrighted image (potentially or otherwise) on templates that do not contribute content to the main article namespace. The stub marker for example is not compromised by the lack of the logo; it would be served just as well by a single triangle. I do not see the value in potentially violating Nintendo's copyright in order to support a (subjectively) prettier version of three templates. I would much rather see the people who think this image is usable contact Nintendo regarding its specific stance regarding this image; this is the right path to take, not presume it isn't copyrighted.</p>
<p>If consensus is otherwise to my stance, I'll quite happily concede the point. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 01:34, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

IP isn't my daily grind, but -- FWIW -- Nintendo has probably <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trademarked.html" title="Trademarked">trademarked</a> the triangle as a mark of the Zelda game. The company couldn't copyright a construct discovered in 1915, and Mitsubishi hasn't copyrighted theirs either. As a trademark, use of the symbol is permitted to any party not competing with Nintendo. Trademarking does not remove a mark from the public domain, and only restricts its use within the limited industry or trade to the party trademarking. In short, the triangle is usable, unless we start "Wikipedia:The Video Game".&#160;:) <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 01:55, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I seem to recall a story that that arangement of trangles, was printed on various goods in Japan before the existance of the video game. This needs to be looked into. If it is true, the symbol may be inelligible for copyright. (Of course, without a reference, this is only a theory!) Though, as stated, its relation and use in video games may be trademarked by the Nintendo company. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 02:55, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I took a look at Nintendo's trademarks on the USPTO site. They have 287 active registered trademarks, including the word "Triforce" for a huge range of uses. They've trademarked several pictures of Mario, several variants of their "circle within a circle" logo; their cube of the letter N, and the outline of each of their controllers. They've trademarked a long list of Pokemon names, plus "Gotta catch em all!". But they don't seem to have trademarked that triangle symbol. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 06:17, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm, I don't see a huge overrun of socks. Every sock and point violation looks like they've been caught and noted as such for the bureaucrat to ignore.

<p>There is a nasty edit war at <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a>. I've been a bit lax, hoping that with a bit of patience, advice and warnings it would resolve itself, but I'm now think some blocks are required to give some credibility to our policies. I'm probably too much involved myself to mete out blocks, so I'd like to request short blocks to what I see as the main problem users:</p>

Furthermore, he blindly reverts the article every day, without any regard of what has changed, and thus wipes out any improvements.

<p>Of course, I'd also appreciate help from anybody with experience in handling disputes. Specifically, I'm wondering about temporarily protecting the page. My only concern is that one of the parties is asking for page protection (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=66557911&amp;oldid=66547219" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=66557911&amp;oldid=66547219" rel="nofollow">diff</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=67728068&amp;oldid=67616073" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=67728068&amp;oldid=67616073" rel="nofollow">diff</a>) — guess they've never heard about <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="extiw" title="m:The_Wrong_Version">m:The Wrong Version</a> — and I don't want them to think that their edit warring got them what they wanted. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 13:58, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that edit wars should stop, but you need to realize that [Osli73] is primary to blame for edit wars, blind reverts, and full blown vandalism of Srebrenica Massacre article. I would be more than glad to stop reverting the article to a more civilized versions, but please bear in mind that <a href="../../../o/s/l/User%7EOsli73_41ba.html" title="User:Osli73">Osli73</a> (<a href="../../../o/s/l/User_talk%7EOsli73_ee0e.html" title="User talk:Osli73">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Osli73_23af.html" title="Special:Contributions/Osli73">contribs</a>) needs to stop first, because he is leading a war with at least 10 other editors who refuse to accept his vandalism. In other words, [Osli73] is vandalizing article, he deletes facts such as the fact that 8,106 Bosniaks died in the massacre (well documented, with names, JMBR numbers, names of parents, etc). In my opinion, and in the opinion of at least 10 other editors, Osli73 needs to be banned from ever editing Srebrenica massacre article. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 00:00, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not an admin, but I will go through from the beginning and see if there's anything problematic and, if so, remove it. The user doesn't seem to have top edit on anything, so I'll have to manually revert anything that's in violation of policy, if anything. UPDATE: I'm removing most of the politicalfriendster links, with a few exceptions where the spamminess is outweighed by usefulness. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 16:05, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<p><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMargana_b7b1.html" title="User:Margana">Margana</a>'s edit-warring at <a href="../../../p/s/e/Psephos.html" title="Psephos">Psephos</a> has been going on for so long it is practically a geological process. There has been a brief respite during which he abstained out of fear of being blocked by me, but as soon as I undertook not to block him again (having become too involved) he returned to the article to edit war some more.</p>
<p>For months he has edit-warred and disrupted this article out of his insistence on including his personal POV version of an assertion that the subject of the article is politically biased, using Cuba as an example. With a resolution finally at hand, he has today suddenly decided to use Laos instead, taking us back three months to have the whole argument all over again. I am so frustrated and angry about this blatant trolling.</p>

<dd>Margana is blatantly trying to bait Adam Carr with his edits to this article, and in his incessant edit warring is driving just about every regular Australian editor up the wall. The only reason the article looks reasonable at the moment is because Margana hasn't done his round of reverts for today. I really think this is about time for a community ban - Margana has no useful edits, and wasting enormous amounts of good users' time on this. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 06:05, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You looked through all of my 664 edits and determined that all of them were useless? Quite a feat! I should explain to the gallery that Rebecca (who happens to live in the same city as Adam Carr) is the one who wrote that <a href="../../../p/s/e/Psephos.html" title="Psephos">Psephos</a> article, about Adam Carr's website, on Adam Carr's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebecca/Archive18&amp;diff=51638751&amp;oldid=51453230" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebecca/Archive18&amp;diff=51638751&amp;oldid=51453230" rel="nofollow">request</a>, and with unverifiable information privately <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebecca/Archive18&amp;diff=51659308&amp;oldid=51658697" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rebecca/Archive18&amp;diff=51659308&amp;oldid=51658697" rel="nofollow">supplied</a> by Adam Carr. She has since on numerous occasions not only reverted without explanation, but also abused rollback to do that. Snottygobble, another Australian with a long history of edit-warring in conjunction with Adam Carr and Rebecca, then violated both protection policy and (twice) blocking policy after he had been involved in the edit war, and just now pledged to stop this, after I engaged an advocate. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMargana_b7b1.html" title="User:Margana">Margana</a> 21:24, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a>, I think you'd be prudent to keep out of it now. From a brief review, this looks like a user who is confrontational and "difficult" but good at Wikilawyering (though I have no idea who is correct about the underlying content dispute, and I don't want to know). It's better if some completely uninvolved admins watch the page and see what happens. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a>, have you tried any dispute resolution processes? You should know that it sometimes does more harm than good for admins to try to get involved and conciliate (the term I use for mediation backed by threats) disputes unless there is blatantly abusive conduct. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 08:16, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This editor has been a pain in the butt at <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> in the past, insisting that wikitruth was a reliable source and that info on there should be included in the article. That was resolved by a strawpoll, when it became clear that he was alone in this. This editor games the system systematically, using exactly three reverts per day, even at one time selfreverting after noticing that he had done the fourth within 24 hours <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psephos&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64042076" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psephos&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64042076" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> and doing it immediatly after the 24 hour period was over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psephos&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64042076" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psephos&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=64042076" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>.

As this user is active in a narrow range of articles, only a limited number of editors has encountered him, but the amount of edit warring and gaming is staggering. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 13:07, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a blatant lie that I insisted that "wikitruth was a reliable source" - I didn't use wikitruth as a source for facts, I <i>quoted</i> it, and of course every website is a reliable source as to what it itself says. As to those reverts, all it shows is that I scrupulously respect the 3RR. Somewhere on my talk page I have already explained the absurdity of the whole "gaming" concept (it's like a cop saying "the speed limit is 50 here - you're consistently driving 49, I'm fining you for gaming the system"). Also, a <i>strawpoll</i>, by its very nature, can not possibly "resolve" anything. If anything, a proper <i>vote</i> might resolve something, but then, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a democracy. Arguments count, not dittos. I should also note that after KimvdLinde was involved in an edit war with me on <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a>, she started stalking me and opposing me wherever she could - she would never otherwise have been interested in <a href="../../../p/s/e/Psephos.html" title="Psephos">Psephos</a>, but seeing me there, she reverted against me. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMargana_b7b1.html" title="User:Margana">Margana</a> 21:34, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your analogy demonstrates to me that you do not understand 3RR, which is to encourage people to resolve their differences on talk pages and build consensus, rather than attempt to get/keep certain content on a page by reverting. Maybe if you discussed things more and tried to compromise/reason with other editors you would have fewer problems? <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 21:55, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know what the ideal is, but talking and consensus-building requires that both sides are willing to do that, and acting in good faith. I suggest you take a look at the relevant talk pages. I am the one who discussed more than anyone else. Now on the other hand, try to find the name Rebecca on <a href="../../../p/s/e/Talk%7EPsephos_3395.html" title="Talk:Psephos">Talk:Psephos</a>... <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMargana_b7b1.html" title="User:Margana">Margana</a> 22:03, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you want to convince people to be sympathetic to you, directing them to that talk page is <b>not</b> a good idea. You are obviously engaged in a pattern of tendentious editing, trying to edit war against a broad consensus (which is not, I hasten to add, synonymous with unanimity). I doubt you will convince people that Cuba or Laos have free elections. You need to realize that you are not going to be able to "win" every "battle" on a wiki, accept it and move on. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 22:21, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your comment about me not convincing people "that Cuba or Laos have free elections" shows that you do not <i>remotely</i> understand what this dispute is about, and are shooting from the hip based on what can only be a superficial skimming of the talk page. Nor is there a broad consensus, as I have explained repeatedly. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMargana_b7b1.html" title="User:Margana">Margana</a> 23:08, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It sure <i>looks</i> like one against all and that one being quite recalcitrant. It also looks like there has been enough time passed that this go to mediation. If that fails (and it probably will), ArbCom. Because this user has been selectively warring or insisting, depending upon your point of view, it isn't really a "community" worn out, so I agree that a community ban isn't appropriate. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:50, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>After a day or so, edits started coming in from 71.124.36.224 contributions here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=71.124.36.224" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=71.124.36.224" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>], again in the "chi01.dsl-w.verizon.net" pool to the same <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masutatsu_Oyama_1486.html" title="Masutatsu Oyama">Masutatsu Oyama</a> article. They continued edits on a few articles frequented by Taeguk Warrior, including one created by him here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortal_Admiral_Yi_Sun-shin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70152858" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortal_Admiral_Yi_Sun-shin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70152858" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>]. Here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yi_Sun-sin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70122600" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yi_Sun-sin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70122600" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>], his edit summary refers to me specifically (saying that since he added a free picture it must make me angry (I had cleaned up the article significantly and tagged some unfree images he uploaded).</p>
<p>At this point his week long block expired and he promptly found himself under another 1 week block for doing the same thing (removing tags, blanking his user page--unknowingly I may have fanned the flames a bit, my vandal script noticed him making the same changes I had tagged as vandalism. He reverted my warnings as well as those from administrators/others.</p>
<p>Now that he's on his second week-long block, he has started editing from 72.69.105.138 contributions here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=72.69.105.138" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=72.69.105.138" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>], again in the chi01.dsl-w.verizon.net pool. Again, he is reverting/removing bits of content from <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masutatsu_Oyama_1486.html" title="Masutatsu Oyama">Masutatsu Oyama</a>, though it's relatively minor compared to what he was doing before.</p>
<p>At first I didn't notice they were all from the same pool, but not only do they have blatantly the same edit patterns. I put it together when I realized the only time these IP's show up is when the main account is blocked, and happened to see his post on the Masuyama talk page where he seemed to indicate that he was in the same pool. There are other edits in other articles, but the Masuyama article illustrates it particularly well since there are very few editors involved with it (and I wanted to keep this as brief as possible).</p>
<p>I thought he'd cool down a bit and make some valuable contributions (he has the capability--he added to several articles with some nice pictures). It seems, though, that he might not be cooling down at all--perhaps because he just avoids the block and keeps editing. It's unfortunate because he's a relatively new user and just seems to be escalating the bad edits vs. the good ones. I had originally thought to request semi-protection for the Masuyama page, though it seems kind of unnecessary since he does seem to blank/revert less when he's blocked. Of course, I'm discouraged when my edits are undone and he's uncivil--namecalling and the like, but I'll stick around. I'd just avoid the articles he's editing, but he seems now to want to "follow me around," putting my contribution link on his user page (originally under a list of stalkers, now by itself). Sometimes he's particularly viscious, tagging good faith efforts as "vandalism" to confuse the issue. If anyone has some suggestions, I'm all ears. —<font face="Verdana" color="#003399"><b><a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELactoseTI_f014.html" title="User:LactoseTI">LactoseTI</a></b></font><sup><small><a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELactoseTI_0ced.html" title="User talk:LactoseTI"><font color="#009933">T</font></a></small></sup> 06:23, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think Mr. Lefty was right to bring it up. A backlog of 50 can be a backlog of 100 in no time, given how much garbage shows up and how well our volunteers tag the worst of it and how too few admins are doing new pages patrol at any time to deal with the influx.

It seems almost if this user has a great parinoia, which is leading to his/her track record of jumping to conclusions and accusing people in deletion votes of bad behaviour in order to attempt to skew the vote in favour of his position. This user represents some of the worst of Wikipedia, acting as if it was a clique and he/she is the arbiter of who can join. It also should be noted that this user desires to be an administrator, something which if it was to occur would most likely cause more harm than good.

<dd>I found it and see it's been deleted. I can read the article but I can't view diffs once it's deleted, so I can't tell what the particular edit was (and if it was perhaps defamatory, please don't repeat it here). I can see in general that it had to do with using Usenet as a source. That would depend whether it was negative material, whether it was written by the subject, and so on. Generally, we don't use Usenet as a source (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, but that wouldn't necessarily allow you to revert under BLP. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:37, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the response SlimVirgin. The article was deleted then recreated, so the diff's are unavailable. I'm assuming this was done to prevent legal problems, as now there's no evidence remaining. Note that the new version that was "recreated" was drastically cleaned up and then protected. Generally, and others agree on this including a comment from Fred Bauder about one of the editors, the page was being composed and used as an attack page by a couple of users. One of the users was the one who reported my "violation" of 3RR. I did wave the white flag, but was ignored. Blocked without discussion from the admin, and then a notice I'd been blocked an hour later. Instead I got a note from the admin saying that BPL "isn't a get out of jail free card". If William Connolly would have said something to me first, at least I would have had a chance to understand what I was doing wrong because I thought I was helping Wikipedia by removing poorly sourced claims. I did make a few mistakes by removing things that were sourced and I restored those before I was blocked, but one of the users using the page as an attack page used my deletion/restoration against my instead of assuming good faith. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 08:02, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A pedantic point I know, but the deletion does not mean there is no evidence remaining, it means the evidence is restricted to admins. Otherwise you are right: the patern for <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> / <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> deletions is that the article is deleted, a stub created, and then new content may or may not be added with thorough sourcing, depending on the nature of the complaint and indeed the complainant. <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> is pretty much automatic, so it's understandable if someone missed the BLP flag. Did you add {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} to your Talk page? I'm guessing it would have been sorted quite quickly, and you clearly understand why this BLP a particular problem and people tend to err on the side of caution.

<p>Lately, <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">User:Dionyseus</a> has been removing information from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Inquirer_aea9.html" title="The Inquirer">The Inquirer</a> that is necessary to make the article NPOV <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Inquirer&amp;diff=70503690&amp;oldid=70500064" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Inquirer&amp;diff=70503690&amp;oldid=70500064" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> and keeps removing it after his changes have been reverted. This kind of disruptive POV-pushing is unacceptable.</p>
<p>He has a long history of adding malicious defamation to the article (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Inquirer&amp;diff=62967070&amp;oldid=62964249" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Inquirer&amp;diff=62967070&amp;oldid=62964249" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> among others) and of trying to paint <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Inquirer_aea9.html" title="The Inquirer">The Inquirer</a> in the most negative light possible. In the past, he once re-added unsourced information that was removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Inquirer&amp;diff=67136943&amp;oldid=67035557" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Inquirer&amp;diff=67136943&amp;oldid=67035557" rel="nofollow">[67]</a> and made defamatory false accusations of vandalism against the person who removed the unsourced information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amaccormack&amp;oldid=67136947" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amaccormack&amp;oldid=67136947" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>.</p>
<p>His agenda needs to stop.

<dd>That sentence was completely unencyclopedic.

Often the page would proclaim the link you just went to, but it was the same <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_forum.html" title="Internet forum">internet forum</a> in any case. The pictures changed too I think. Pretty cruddy. The category link has a list of many of his spam websites.</p>
<p><b>BUT</b></p>
<p>He has a new bloody tactic. The links are now framing to actual websites. Of course, since he controls all the redirect sites, he can just change them to whatever once they've made their home on wikipedia articles</p>
<p>The latest accounts by him are as follows, and need to be blocked. This would be easier if he wasn't resorting to the subterfuge:</p>

<dd>Well, I'm at an impasse on that. See, if he's resorting to putting up framed webpages that appear to be 'good' sites, but are actually waiting to be changed to spam, its going to get really hard to track him if he starts making more websites that are superfake because his webpages are all blacklisted. Right now I'm having an easy time tracking his movements. Checkuser could be of some help, and while I'm not going to state my beliefs, I have a pretty good idea as a result of maintainence/clerking that I do on RFCU that most of his spam is outside the range of checkuser. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 08:05, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Many of my assertions about his conduct are confirmed by his subsequent wiki behavior, and I am simply inviting users to share their opinions at the ArbCom workshop. Since he has a long history with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Inquirer_aea9.html" title="The Inquirer">The Inquirer</a>, it seems relevant to the case in question.

<p>I don't know why an editor this well-regarded would be doing something like this, but the evidence is just undeniable. Michael seems to have a feud going with <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Blythe_7728.html" title="User:Billy Blythe">User:Billy Blythe</a>. Billy created an article on Mariju Bofill. Michael removed much of the article's text, claiming it was "unverifiable. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariju_Bofill&amp;diff=70361830&amp;oldid=69887111" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariju_Bofill&amp;diff=70361830&amp;oldid=69887111" rel="nofollow">[87]</a> However, the information was verifiable simply by googling "Mariju Bofill" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22mariju+bofill%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22mariju+bofill%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[88]</a>; in fact, Google provides stronger evidence for notability than the article asserted. Michael then took the gutted article to AfD, claiming he had removed only "unverifiable" information. I don't know, I don't really care, if Mariju Bofill's article should be deleted. I do care that Michael is not presenting the facts of this accurately. I won't go quite as far as the AfD comment that called this "bad faith," but something here really stinks. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivianDarkbloom_43b2.html" title="User:VivianDarkbloom">VivianDarkbloom</a> 19:26, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, but I think you're wrong. This isn't the first time I've seen this on AfD, and it's dubious behavior at best. Especially given Michael's rather odd personal borderline attack on Billy as a stalker.

<dd>It might have been appropriate to have said "not verified" (which is a fact) rather than "unverifiable" (which is a surmise). However, it is up to an editor who wishes to retain material in an article to provide verification for it. Otherwise it can be removed. I realise this is only a part of the above discussion, but you might as well get this part cleared up. Then you can deal with the rest. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 22:04, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaltrop_619d.html" title="User:Caltrop">User:Caltrop</a> blocked me for breaking the 3R rule during a dispute he was having with me at <a href="../../../t/-/4/T-4_Euthanasia_Program_6dd9.html" title="T-4 Euthanasia Program">T-4 Euthanasia Program</a>. Possibly I was in breach of 3R (I wasn't counting), but if I was, so was he. Furthermore, I had explained my reversion at the Talk page, to which he replied only with juvenile and <i>ad hominem</i> comments and made no attempt to engage with the issue. Finally I consider it most inappropriate for an admin to block an editor in a dispute to which they themselves are a party, and indeed largely initiated. I request that Caltrop be formally warned not to abuse his admin powers in this way.

<p>The overall effect of these edits is to make various controversial pro-Israel organizations appear as neutral in Wikipedia. There really isn't much doubt that these organizations are pro-Israel; even the Israeli media admit it, and appropriate cites are in the articles, although it may be necessary to go back in the article history to find them after Jayjg's deletions.</p>
<p>Jayjg (and some others) have previously removed material that makes Israel looks bad when it wasn't properly cited. I accept that. But now he's escalated to removing material that <i>is</i> properly cited. That's a serious POV issue.</p>
<p>Jayjg has previously refused communication (see deletion of message from talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJayjg&amp;diff=70279140&amp;oldid=70156949" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJayjg&amp;diff=70279140&amp;oldid=70156949" rel="nofollow">[98]</a>) and refused informal mediation.(<a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-08-03_Mosaic%7E_World_News_from_the_Middle_East_e578.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-08-03 Mosaic: World News from the Middle East">Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-08-03_Mosaic:_World_News_from_the_Middle_East</a>) Jayjg is also involved in the messy arbitration proceeding (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Israeli_apartheid_073d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Israeli apartheid">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Israeli apartheid</a>), but that's in the voting phase and voting is tending towards an amnesty, so we can't add these actions to it. So I'd like to ask for a 24-hour block on Jayjg, permission to revert the above listed changes, and formal mediation. Thanks. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 03:49, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it should be obvious to anyone who looks at these instances that they are nothing more than content disputes. I really can't see how John Nagle could think it is appropriate to block someone merely for disagreeing with him on a few articles. There is nothing that Jayjg did that is a clear violation of policy, or even an abstract violation of policy for that matter.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 04:50, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a straightforward content dispute. There are no policy violations and if John wants formal mediation, this isn't the place to request it. John, when I last checked out some of these pages, I recall you were engaged in an attempt to draw links between people and groups that struck me as original research. I don't know whether that continues, but looking briefly at some of Jay's edits, that may have been what he was resisting. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:21, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it's a content dispute, but it's here because Jayjg is an admin and involved in an ArbComm proceeding. As part of the current arbitration, we currently have the proposed remedy, with six ArbComm votes, <i>Humus sapiens, ChrisO, Kim van der Linde, SlimVirgin, and Jayjg are reminded to use mediation and other dispute resolution procedures sooner when conflicts occur.</i> (Ref: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Israeli_apartheid_Proposed_decision_7dbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Israeli apartheid/Proposed decision">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Israeli apartheid/Proposed decision</a>). I'd appreciate it if an admin who does not normally edit on Israel issues would look at this. Meanwhile, I'm trying to fix some of Jayjg's edits, dealing with his objections by using the "cited to death" style we now have to use in such articles and using cited direct quotes whenever possible. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 17:45, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Three editors have now commented, and agree that this is an inappropriate complaint, because it's a regular content dispute. If you want mediation, by all means request it.

<p>John, it seems more reasonable to block you for consistent conspiracy-mongering and violations of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a muck-racking magazine, and you are supposed to be a neutral editor, not a crusading journalist. And by the way, your distortions about my actions match your consistent distortions in articles themselves. I haven't "refused communication"; as my Talk: page makes clear, if you want to discuss article content, do it on the related article content pages. Article content discussions are not personal communications. Also, I didn't refuse mediation, I just refused it from the self-appointed "Mediation Cabal" (which, in my experience, is singularly incompetent), and suggested you approach the Mediation Committee instead. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 02:09, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah I was talking about Roman Vishinac. I wasn't asking for it to be protected, at the time I posted the original comment it <i>was</i> protected; I didn't post for action on vandalism in progress, but to suggest that maybe it was one person with multiple accounts, or that it might be vandalism happening across several pages simultaneously. Just a heads-up, I wasn't asking for any action.

<dd>This isn't really a good venue for deciding content issues. Try discussing the merits of the merges on the appropriate talk pages. This block may be a bit questionable given Philwelch's personal involvement, but you've already been unblocked. What are you hoping to accomplish?

<dd>Um, Friday... while it is true that this is not "a good venue for deciding content issues" - the comments above say virtually nothing about the content dispute (beyond that it exists) and quite alot about questionable administrator actions. Which this page IS 'a good venue for discussing'. Admins should <i>never</i> block people with whom they are involved in a content dispute.

<dd>Wow! Great idea Phil! Let's talk about it. Too bad you've BLOCKED EVERYONE who seems to have a problem with this issue today. So how are they supposed to retort?</dd>

I'm not the only one who sees what he is doing and knows that it's wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem started when Phil redirected all minor character articles from <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar_Galactica_%282004_TV_series%29_aaae.html" title="Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)">Battlestar Gallactica</a>, (those in particular <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leoben_Conoy_d753.html" title="Leoben Conoy">Leoben Conoy</a>, <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Doral_ec7e.html" title="Aaron Doral">Aaron Doral</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_12c1.html" title="Simon (Battlestar Galactica)">Simon</a> to name a few) to the default <a href="../../../c/y/l/Cylon.html" title="Cylon">Cylon</a> page without any real discussion on the matter (of course he's offering that now after the fact, how kind of him).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The so-called discussion ammounts to this: One person <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBat_c7e7.html" title="User:DrBat">DrBat</a> suggested <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattlestar_Galactica_%282004_TV_series%29_0b62.html#Merging_minor_Cylon_characters_into_Cylon_article" title="Talk:Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)">here</a> to merge the minor character articles to the <a href="../../../c/y/l/Cylon.html" title="Cylon">Cylon</a> and Phil barges in and makes the changes like he owns the place. Anyone who tried to tell him otherwise he blocks! He claims on his Cyberia's <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberia23_067e.html" title="User talk:Cyberia23">talk page</a> under "Cylon Redirects", and per <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">Being Bold</a>, that no discussion is warranted which is complete BS. He has since told Cyberia he will be unblocked if he assuers he won't make changes - again complete abuse of admin power and being unfair to Cyberia who can't even plead his case since he is blocked from editing and participating. Cyberia said a few hours ago he won't make changes, but when will Phil show mercy and unblock him? Ina few minutes, a few hours, days, or whenever Phil feels like flexing his godly power and grant pity. Cyberia will not kiss his ass and no one else should either. Phil needs to have his admin powers revoked, and maybe sit in the time out chair for a while so he knows what it's like to be ignored and unable to defend yourself.</dd>

<p>I am appalled not only by the actions of Philwelch, but also by his statements afterward, especially <i>...multiple users think that tag-teaming and simplistic readings of policy outweigh producing a good result. My actions were successful, however, in bringing other editors to the discussion table, which was really all I wanted.</i> This is completely unacceptable behavior by an administrator -- bullying people into cooperating rarely, if ever, actually works, and 3RR is frankly, fairly simplistic, as is the rules on WP:BAN. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonfairfax_8715.html" title="User:Simonfairfax">Silas Snider</a> <a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimonfairfax_90d2.html" title="User talk:Simonfairfax">(talk)</a> 03:31, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was unaware Phil had unbanned me soon after the ban because I had to apparently refresh my cashe and cookies on Mozilla to edit again. I was didn't even think of checking the blocklog, so it looked like I was banned for several hours. SkeezerPumba told me to refresh everything and now it seems to work. My mistake, but not really my fault had I not been banned in the first place. I did't wannto start crap with Phil over something trivial as Battlestar Galactica fancruft but he left me no choice until I figured out what was going on. I spent a lot of time on those articles to just see them get trashed and no valid reason given. Hopefully we can work a compromise, but thats really up to Mr. Phil here. I was pissed off, but I don't feel he should lose his admin privledges over this, but given at least a warning on his record for stomping on people until he hears him out. Just because he has a BLOCK USER button to press doesn't make him right about everything, plus his <b>"If you want to start a confrontation with me, you're going to lose, one way or another."</b> sounds like he has an attitude problem. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberia23_c7e4.html" title="User:Cyberia23">Cyberia23</a> 03:48, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I hope to accomplish is that someone will tell Inshanee she cannot go around banning people for valid conversations. Uhhh.. you are contradicting yourself as I had filed a complaint about someone calling others "jew hater." You concluded it was "calling a spade a spade." You exactly confirmed the point I made on an unrelated talkpage that "jew lover" is equally unacceptable, but would be more readily enforced as so. I didn't call anybody a "jew lover." We also most certainly ARE allowed to discuss, edit, document "racial" language in the proper context.

<p>The usefulness of WP:ANI is in inverse proportion to how much time we have to waste dealing with tireless malcontents. My own inclination to frequent the page is in inverse proportion to the boringness and the depressingness and the sinking feeling of pointlessness I experience every time yet another Sarastro777 thread turns up. Is that just me? We're being too nice here IMO. People have been banned, even permanently banned, from posting on AN and ANI before. Please comment below: may I ban Sarastro777 from ANI and AN for one month? And, I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but personally I consider this to be a question principally for admins. This is a board "for reporting and discussing incidents that require the intervention of administrators". Somebody remind me, has any issue Sarastro777 has brought here <i>ever</i> required the intervention of administrators? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:28, 20 August 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Thanks, all. I'll give it a couple more hours for any further comments and then, unless there are counterweighting protests, tell Sarastro777 that he's banned from AN and ANI for a month. "Banned" means he's not to post on AN or ANI under any excuse or from any account, and if he does, any admin can block him at discretion (I'd suggest 12—24 hours) and remove the post. But active enforcement of these things usually doesn't turn out to be neccessary.

Since archiving is a concern here, and obviously is less of a concern on WP:AN (there are already notices there that are going on a month old...), I say tack up another notice there, Bishonen, and when this discussion is archived, provide links to the archived discussion in the notice.

<p>I've just done something that trolls and policywonks worldwide have probably been waiting for with bated breath. If anyone regards it as a severe violation of policy, please undo it and repair it as you see fit. The act in question is "reclosing" the "closed by a non-admin" AfD discussion [in which I voted] for <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahbulon.html" title="Jahbulon">Jahbulon</a>. In case you can't figure it out, the crappy 2nd nom I closed was even misspelled (Jabulon vs. Jahbulon). Ugh. It's such a mess...I don't think I acted improperly, but the probsibility that people out there are going to scream "impropriety!" remains. Feedback welcome. If 3 admins feel I've acted improperly, please, a 4th, block me for 24 hours.

My last comments were "Concur" and "I second that" on ANI, which were labelled as superfluous trolling and the block was extended from Azmoc to Ackoz as well as the IP. I think it's too harsh. Maybe the arbitration would place me on probation, or block me aswell, however this long term/indef block issued by only a few overzealous admins is far too much.

<dd>Well that user whom he claimed was dead has said it was a joke and one he found rather funny. I fail to see what harm has been done to anyone involved in the encyclopedia by this incident.

<dd>Yes. Somewhere along the way of having fun and not writing the encyclopedia, PhoenixPinion seems to have fallen into our trap of trying to make it inviting and fun to actually write an encyclopedia.

I think I can shed some light on this; <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde</a> (the blocking admin) and I were in a rather extended dispute for a while. I know Phoenix in real life in a similar way that Raven is God knows him, and I fear that Cyde may have noticed Phoenix's actions and been a bit harsh due to his association with me. (Cyde blocked me for 34 hours for adding myself to a category that was on CfD after I put it through DRV because Cyde closed the previous CfD prematurely.) I don't know if that's really why Cyde did it, but he didn't respond to my inquiries about it so I pretty much let it go, as I assumed that the community would agree to unblock Phoenix. I've pretty much given up on trying to resolve things with Cyde, and as much as I hate to let it just slip by, I don't have the time to do much of anything about his actions. At any rate, that's what I believe happened, as it's unlikely that Cyde would've noticed the edit (since the first one was made weeks before he blocked Phoenix) had I not questioned him about blocking me, the premature CfD closing, etc. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 03:18, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>12 days is very close to 2 weeks, I didn't really check the specific amount of time.

<dd>But what has the <i>first</i> edit to do with anything? It is the <i>last</i> one that counts, certainly in this case, as that was the one that added the user wrongly to the category, and was thus the reason for the block. The first edit you are going on about only shows that the "joke" was already old by then, and that PhoenixPinion felt it was necessary to take it one step further for some obscure reason (and in the middle of him being involved in a CfD<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_August_6#Category:Gangster_Wikipedians" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_August_6#Category:Gangster_Wikipedians" rel="nofollow">[108]</a> about an inappropriate user category, which should have made him even more wary).

<p>MONGO suddenly blocked a user with no apparent bad edits, indefinitely, and blocked his user page. The user is User:Weevlos. His <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Weevlos" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Weevlos" rel="nofollow">contribs</a>. He apparently suspects that this user spammed admins (but there is no apparent proof of this), and that page of template information was actually on dozens of pages all over Wikipedia during MONGO's conflict with an outside website. MONGO also protected this user's talk page so that he could not request a review, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=MONGO" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=MONGO" rel="nofollow">seen here</a>. Would someone be willing to review this? This user appears to have done nothing to warrant this.

<dd>FWIW, the last edit, IMHO, was in no way libellous (at least as regards United States law), even as it may have expressed a value judgment with which some of us might disagree; this doesn't, of course, speak to the broader issue, but it is useful for us to take care that we not use <i>libel</i> too broadly, if only because, in the context of mainspace, such broad use sometimes serves unnecessarily to temper contributions... <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:10, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The evidence is at User:Weevlos/Compiling Evidence which MONGO deleted at 09:50, 18 August 2006 (UTC) with the reason "(same subpage used to email spam hndreds of admins a month ago)".

<dd>But other than that single page (I'll take your word that it existed and wasn't just a typical rfc/rfar note-taking page), what else makes for a permanent ban based on the judgement of a single admin? I looked at the last two months of contribs, and they all seemed like good reliable edits - the majority of which are in article space, aren't vandalism, look sourced, etc. Based on what I can see as a non-admin, a permanent ban of a good editor based on one user sub-page seems way overblown. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 22:21, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tony has been working with me rather civilly on a policy proposal, so I have no idea where you're going with that. As to "harassing" information on his userspace, please look at my above link--an admin had it on his user page for months, and it was on many other's pages after it was mailed by someone to a zillion people. Will an admin review how long that page has been idle before it was deleted? I'd venture that it was idle since around the time of the mass mailing. Will you please let me know what policy this user has violated, and why he cannot have his talk page unlocked so that the blocking can be reviewed? As for that last comment about Nathan in the history, I'd politely point out that in the past two weeks a lot of people have said inappropriate things about that user (I could care less why, I'm not involved), and I didn't see any mass bans over that. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 23:23, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I would encourage all of my fellow admins to ignore Rootology, he has no credibility on this issue.

<dd>Why yes, of course. Being &lt;personal attack removed&gt; is a desirable trait on Wikipedia. I have little respect for people like you who run around with the attitude "I'm right because I can ban you". No, you're still wrong. Silencing dissent doesn't suddenly make the dissenting viewpoint irrelevant, although I understand that it certainly is preferable for the cult to ignore dissent. I do have great respect for sysops like Can't Sleep, Clown Will Eat Me and <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_Alf_3f4c.html" title="User:Wiki Alf">Wiki Alf</a>, because they don't throw their weight around. Rather, they work on improving the encyclopedia, and although they do deal with vandals firmly, they also treat them with civility and respect. Respect is a concept foreign to people like you, <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde</a>, and <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a>. As long as people like you remain so full of themselves that they chuck out any semblance of respect for others, Wikipedia is doomed to failure. It seems that anyone who doesn't agree with the Elite is branded as a "troll" and eventually banned. <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Dispute resolution</a> is one of the biggest oxymorons in this encyclopedia - dispute resolution consists of banning or censuring the user whose viewpoints are unpopular with the elite.

<p>I've been exchanging email with this user (whom you may remember I originally blocked), &amp; he has admitted that he behaved badly &amp; asked to be unblocked. In his own words:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. Just to be more clear, I'll rewrite those points:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) I agree that my way of "promoting" my POV on the redundant AD issue was not correct, and against WP rules</dd>
<dd>2) I agree that my behaviour regarding the sockpuppets issue was uncorrect, and against WP rules</dd>
<dd>3) I shall not behave again as in 1 and 2, and abide to WP rules, avoiding any disruption</dd>
</dl>
<p>The whole point of blocking a user is not to punish, but to attempt to get that user to stop the troublesome behavior. Panairjdde has convinced me that he will stop being disruptive, so I'm unblocking his account. Further -- &amp; not least importantly -- he has been blocked from Wikipedia for far longer than his original misdeed -- being disruptive -- called for.</p>
<p><i>Note</i>: He has indicated to me that his original username was marred by a typo when he created it, so he may use another account (Panarjedde) instead. I have also unblocked that account for that reason.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about my act, please contact me offline. Until this recent event, he has always seemed to me a constructive member of the project.

<p>Hello, would anyone be willing to review <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70544615" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70544615" rel="nofollow">this</a>? I have twice removed this personal attack, and MONGO has twice now put it back in place, despite my repeatedly asking him to either proove this or simply leave me alone and stop saying it. Often when I post now on various sections in the Wikipedia namespace he appears, and begins saying things like this. To me this is a personal attack, as I am not Wikistalking any admin, and any effort of my asking him to demonstrate this is simply met by "stop doing it". If I knew what exactly I was doing I'd be happy to stop that entailed wikistalking a given admin (which I'm not). MONGO also left a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARootology&amp;diff=70544694&amp;oldid=70396403" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARootology&amp;diff=70544694&amp;oldid=70396403" rel="nofollow">message</a> on my talk page, notifying me I will be blocked if I "alter" his comments.</p>

<p>I am reposting this here as there is no policy against reposting comments in this fashion. I feel the comments he has twice restored are a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, because he keeps doing it, but when asked to demonstrate <i>what</i> I'm doing that he considers wikistalking, he never will. Again, if another admin could review this--I really would rather be free to edit the encyclopedia without having MONGO staring over my shoulder, accusing me of shadow policy violations that apparently cannot be explained to me for some reason. Please review my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Rootology" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Rootology" rel="nofollow">contributions</a>. If I'm apparently wikistalking someone, I cannot see it. I would also appreciate some clarification from other admins if it is against policy to remove messages or content of this nature. I am basing my removal on <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Tony Sidaway and other admins I have seen routinely make use of this, to remove comments that they themselves feel are of an attacking nature, and I feel I was within my bounds to do so. I am completely perplexed by this, as I've been collegially working <b>with</b> other admins, Tony included, on a policy proposal over the past week (and Tony is one of the ones he accused me of wikistalking on the talk page of the recent Kelly Martin RfC). I am starting to feel as if it is simply retribution as I voiced support opposite to his personal wishes previously in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica_%283rd_nomination%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica_%283rd_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">an AfD</a> that he was eager to see closed off. Given the conflict of interest, I ask that MONGO not edit my comments here in any fashion so that other administrators may review them. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 06:21, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I had been speaking with him extensively on the RfC, and both our tempers (Tony's and mine) had gotten it appeared a bit frayed. I did not "stalk" anyone there, as Sam's talk page was on my watchlist from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASamuel_Blanning&amp;diff=69119835&amp;oldid=69114746" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASamuel_Blanning&amp;diff=69119835&amp;oldid=69114746" rel="nofollow">previous conversation</a> I had with him.

However, if you look through the comments and talk there (the exchange in question is now in one of the archives), on that proposal, I'd been civilly and collegially working with the <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">very admin</a> I'd been supposedly stalking, and many others. If this isn't what you're referring to I'm a bit lost, and I still don't see where or how I am wikistalking anyone which is my big concern and the basis of MONOG's attack on me. I should also point out that I'm taking MONGO's comments as an attack, as wikistalking is a bannable offense, and his unfounded allegations are to be honest troubling me.

<p>Neither of the statements that MONGO made were <i>personal attacks</i>. The statement that rootology is an ED editor is, iirc, something that rootology has stated in the past. Anyway, it's a simple factual statement, not an attack. Either it's accurate, or it's inaccurate. If you consider it to be damaging to have that information released, that's another matter, but it isn't a personal attack. As for harrassing people - that isn't a statement about who r. is, that's a statement about her/his actions. As such, it isn't a personal attack. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:33, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I never said I was anywhere on Wikipedia, I don't know where you're getting that. For the harassment and wikistalking, which is a blockable offense, I can then begin saying on various talk and wikipedia name space pages that MONGO or Guettarda is wikistalking me? Without any proof? I've asked MONGO to repeatedly demonstrate this with evidence or stop, but he has refused. Does that seem fair or right? Would I get a free pass as he has to make similar false comments? <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 16:25, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, this has happened to me to, both by MONGO and by another admin. It comes down to a matter of intent; are these threats/accusations sincere, or are they just designed to intimidate and/or insult? An editor of any sort, especially admins, the "Face" of Wikipedia, who was making a good faith effort to halt a disruptive editors behavior would provide diffs, reasoning etc. so as to show that they are right and to cut off possible trolling by said editor (who would no longer have the "he's not telling me what I'm doing wrong" excuse). Then, if that editor were being disruptive unintentionally or without really realizing it/ admitting it to themself or whatever, that editor could review what is disruptive or harassment and could <b>stop</b>. Is an editor who gives out warning but is not only negligent, but <b>unwilling</b> to demonstrate what they are talking about, acting to help stave off disruption, or are they acting to insult or browbeat someone?

We have to spend our time doing this instead of resolving the dispute or concentrating on the question behind the curtain: is this disruption or disagreement? What a ridiculous pursuit!</li>
<li>Then we get to RPA -- a "semi-policy" drafted by someone who wanted counter-arguments to disappear and who wanted accusations to go away. Oh, we'll keep garbage in an article history eternally. We'll keep vandalism in the history forever. However, the delicate flowers among our administrative ranks should be able to hide and annihilate something that is personally ill fitting? To hell with that. More to the point, we grind to a halt again while we try to consider "was that an insult bad enough to remove? should it have been just removed or archived?" What a ridiculous idea! This is what trolls do: they get sites to talk about themselves instead of whatever their function had been. They make things grind to a halt. Well, that's what these two things do.</li>
<li>If there is a question of disruption, let's bring it up. If there is a need for mediation, let's get it going. If there is a need for an RFC, then let's kick start it. Let's not navel gaze and try to fix the mercury of insults. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:12, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thank you. I don't want to appear to even hint that I'm even suggesting a hint that I support incivility. It's just that codifying in the way we sort-of have is distracting from actually patrolling and considering and <i>acting</i> on those cases where we have disruption. I have a tendency to use ink horn terms and be "eloquent." Now, I can say nasty things to someone in the most circuitous manner, and I can get them so angry that they're doing no good. No "PA?" That's the thing. We used to assess disruptiveness, not ego attacks. We should still. We also needn't have some "insult of X severity = sanction of Y duration." We're humans, and that means we're smarter than any codification because, in the end, we always have to do the interpreting. Let's talk together, act together, and work together. Anyway, just some exasperation on my part. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:52, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>People have wildly different opinions of what is and is not a 'personal attack' or 'uncivil'... but I think it is clear to everyone that what we have here is not cordial disagreement with everyone respecting their fellow editors.

<dd>There is no policy barring the removal of comments from one's user talk page. In some instances this may be considered 'hostile' if the comment is removed without response where one would be expected, or 'deceptive' if possibly removing warnings to hide evidence of past misbehaviour in an effort to continue getting away with it. However, those are generally minor issues of civility and there is certainly nothing which would justify a block for removal of comments. <i>Editing</i> of comments to change the apparent statements of another user is another matter entirely and generally prohibited except in the case of 'removing personal attacks'... though as you note even then it is a disputed practice. Looking at this particular situation I don't see any way that removal of MONGO's threat could be problematic... it clearly does not expect a response and removing it doesn't hide any 'past misdeed' on your part. Threats aren't exactly WP:CIVIL and I can't imagine anyone would seriously argue that you should be required to host them on your talk page. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 18:23, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To answer the question, have you <i>read</i> the comment? (Yes.) Then it's your talk page. This type of warning isn't really in the "warning sock puppet" or other warning designed for other people to read. It was a message directed to you and not a tag, so, if you've read it, you should be free to delete it.

<dd>Geogre, no, it doesn't matter if it is or isn't a <i>tag</i>, please please don't talk crazy! (ZOMG NPA RPA and block me for egregious implication of insanity, and block me some more for saying egregious!) There is no virtue of irremoveability in a tag. Posting a tag doesn't require or guarantee any more understanding of policy, or good judgement, or good faith, or good sense, or restraint, than posting a self-formulated warning--less, if anything. Please don't encourage the notion that it's inevitably vandalism to remove a tag, and that if you post a tag you're free to edit war to force the person to display your wonderful untouchable <i>tag</i> on their page for ever and a day. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:37, 20 August 2006 (UTC).

I really have to contest the capitalization style at another discussion since I really disagree with a lot of editors regarding about capitalization guidelines, namely when it comes to bulleting. — <i><b>Vesther</b></i> (<a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">U</a> * <a href="../../../v/e/s/User_talk%7EVesther_ca6d.html" title="User talk:Vesther">T/R</a> * <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vesther_28bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vesther">CTD</a>) 21:40, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Objection to your comment Joe, I read the comments and it appears that Sue Anne's comments were overly harsh, and considering that it's too harsh, I have no choice but to stay my course and consider that Sue Anne has either little or no faith whatsoever. — <i><b>Vesther</b></i> (<a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">U</a> * <a href="../../../v/e/s/User_talk%7EVesther_ca6d.html" title="User talk:Vesther">T/R</a> * <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vesther_28bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vesther">CTD</a>) 01:35, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm sorry, but someone has to ask: <i>So?</i> Assuming bad faith, if it were possible to know someone else's assumptions, is a noticeboard matter <i>how?</i> Content disputes are not for AN/I.

<li>Well, I suppose the assumption of bad faith is not exclusively a content issue, but Geogre is nevertheless correct; if the behavior by which Vesther is troubled persists, surely another editor will intervene, in view of which an RfC might be pursued (although, FWICT, this is really much ado about a trifle). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:03, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Vesther, I think you've misunderstood what "assume good faith" means. It means that we should assume that our fellow users are contributing with the best of intentions, even when we think their contributions are inappropriate or substandard. Sue might have judged your contributions harshly, but she hasn't assumed bad faith unless she has accused you of inappropriate <b>motives</b> for your contributions. Has Sue commented on your motives for contributing to Wikipedia? He she, for example, accused you of deliberately <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">vandalising</a> Wikipedia? Of disrupting Wikipedia to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>? Of contributing material for the purposes of enhancing your <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">income</a> or <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">reputation</a>? Has she in some other way implied that you are not here to improve the encyclopaedia? If not, then this dispute has nothing to do with good or bad faith. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 01:52, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reason why I brought it up was because of the beef she had about the way I capitalize things (see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28capital_letters%29_dab5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (capital letters)">my beef here</a>), as my ways of capitalizing is much different than others. I really disagree with the capitalization conventions for this website as of right now. That is my first beef. The second beef I have is as much as I tried to make an article "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Apprentice_4_b053.html" title="The Apprentice 4">The Apprentice 4</a>" as presentable as I can, Sue Anne hates the style of my edits. I try to be very careful and cautious about my edits so that it wouldn't go off-topic, but the fact that Sue Anne disliked my edits really made me deduce that she has no faith in me whatsoever. I hope that this answers your question. I made sure that all of my edits are within the rules, but the fact that Sue Anne detests the way I edited the page made me assume that she went way over the line, hence "editor killer" in this case. — <i><b>Vesther</b></i> (<a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">U</a> * <a href="../../../v/e/s/User_talk%7EVesther_ca6d.html" title="User talk:Vesther">T/R</a> * <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vesther_28bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vesther">CTD</a>) 02:51, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This seems to evince the same confusion of which Snotty meant, I think, to disabuse you. There is, IMHO, a difference between a user's assuming bad faith of and a user's having no faith in a contributor. Neither, of course, is particularly propitious, but whilst the former focuses on the contributor, the latter focuses on content. There surely are editors who, for various reasons, contribute in a fashion that is sometimes avolitionally disruptive—users, for example, who aren't particularly comfortable with <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>, such that they might be of great assistance with the rough translation of articles from other wikis but not with the cleaning up of grammar and syntax in those articles—and it is not unreasonable for other users to pay special attention to the edits of such editors (because the purpose is encyclopedic, this is not, to be sure, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikistalking</a>). Whether a user's edits improve the encyclopedia is one thing (here, a style/content issue for which you might want to seek a <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">WP:3O</a>), but whether he/she means to improve the encyclopedia (and is willing to collaborate rather than to be categorically contumacious) is quite another. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 06:20, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The user seems to want to use his <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a>, so I'm letting him unless anyone objects with that. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 02:08, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't really feel its a right to vanish, and I don't think that should be used in a case where you have a person lashing out with multiple personal attacks, hate and profanity. He made his bed and now he has to lie in it. Turning and going "yeah I attacked a bunch of people, but now I want to disappear so lets all forget it happened" doesn't fly with me. I'd be more inclined to buy that if he departed without incident.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 02:41, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<p><s>This user- 7 people have had disputes with him. He is reverting to his own revisions which are vandalism. He's vandalised many articles; and is removing warnings. He always seems to get away with whatever he does, and he refuses to take other points of view; and he doesn't like any users; because they all think he vandalizes which he does. Could someone please interfere? <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForestH2_888b.html" title="User:ForestH2"><font color="blue">ForestH2</font></a> <a href="../../../f/o/r/User_talk%7EForestH2_6a03.html" title="User talk:ForestH2">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ForestH2_2ee0.html" title="Special:Contributions/ForestH2">c</a> 18:50, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<p>I am aware of first hand of this user's conduct on wikipedia. He has made several controversial edits on the wikipedia talk page which upset a lot of people, and he is unwilling to compromise. Recently he has got rid of very important tons of very information from an article and no matter what I said or how much I tried to compromise, this user wasn't having any of it. Finally, I gave in and let him have his own way because disputing with someone so unreasonable for 3 or 4 months is exhausting. Apart from vandalism and lack of good ability to come to an agreement, Mike doesn't get along well with others. In fact, I have even tried to be nice in my dealings with him but he is very rude on top of everything else. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonetare_2013.html" title="User:Tonetare">Tonetare</a> 19:01, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Administrator <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">User:William M. Connolley</a> blocked me last week for following WP:BLP. I was removing poorly sourced material from a biography of a living person and was blocked for it even though WP:BLP states such removals are exempt from 3RR. I did make some mistakes, but I thought it unfair for Connolley to just block me without word from him to discuss it first. He also did not notify me of the block until an hour after the block. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 06:05, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>HR, did you declare in advance that you were reverting under the BLP provision (did you wave your white BLP flag, in other words?), and was the material negative and arguably defamatory? A link would help. This is a new policy so there are bound to be some teething troubles. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:29, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I found it and see it's been deleted. I can read the article but I can't view diffs once it's deleted, so I can't tell what the particular edit was (and if it was perhaps defamatory, please don't repeat it here). I can see in general that it had to do with using Usenet as a source. That would depend whether it was negative material, whether it was written by the subject, and so on. Generally, we don't use Usenet as a source (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, but that wouldn't necessarily allow you to revert under BLP. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:37, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the response SlimVirgin. The article was deleted then recreated, so the diff's are unavailable. I'm assuming this was done to prevent legal problems, as now there's no evidence remaining. Note that the new version that was "recreated" was drastically cleaned up and then protected. Generally, and others agree on this including a comment from Fred Bauder about one of the editors, the page was being composed and used as an attack page by a couple of users. One of the users was the one who reported my "violation" of 3RR. I did wave the white flag, but was ignored. Blocked without discussion from the admin, and then a notice I'd been blocked an hour later. Instead I got a note from the admin saying that BPL "isn't a get out of jail free card". If William Connolly would have said something to me first, at least I would have had a chance to understand what I was doing wrong because I thought I was helping Wikipedia by removing poorly sourced claims. I did make a few mistakes by removing things that were sourced and I restored those before I was blocked, but one of the users using the page as an attack page used my deletion/restoration against my instead of assuming good faith. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 08:02, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A pedantic point I know, but the deletion does not mean there is no evidence remaining, it means the evidence is restricted to admins. Otherwise you are right: the patern for <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> / <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> deletions is that the article is deleted, a stub created, and then new content may or may not be added with thorough sourcing, depending on the nature of the complaint and indeed the complainant. <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> is pretty much automatic, so it's understandable if someone missed the BLP flag. Did you add {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} to your Talk page? I'm guessing it would have been sorted quite quickly, and you clearly understand why this BLP a particular problem and people tend to err on the side of caution.

Note, that after my application of BLP, it seems Fred Bauder applied WP:OFFICE, so I don't think I should have been blocked.

<dd>I'm not sure that's true - she's not a member of the CoS. What's certainly true, though, is that the subject of the page (Ms. Schwarz herself) has had to be indefinitely blocked for repeated gross violations of other users' privacy - outing them, basically. She's now taken to posting rants on Usenet against Fred Bauder, myself and other editors, and Wikipedia in general. Actually it's quite amusing&#160;: "Wikipedia or better Wikipiggi is a destructive cult. ... Wikipedia violates my rights and can't take any critic. They deleted my Wikipedia postings. Wikipedia is a defaming anti-free speech cult, similar as STASI and the KGB. It is anti-American and anti-constitutional. Even Congress is fed up with them. Wikipedia is above the U.S. Constitution and laws."

<p>Some nitwits keep creating Ballyclainmarinygwymystradffoldnewrycloghernewtownkennedy, an obviously nonsensical hoax. The thing to do is surely to delete it and protect it from re-creation. Perhaps my brain isn't firing on all cylinders this evening, but I can't see a way to do it. I know there's a template for use here, but can't find it and can't think of a non-article where I've seen it, so can't steal it. Therefore as a short-term remedy I protected this stupid article and simply blanked it: no explanatory template, no nothing. Could some more experienced admin tell me what I should do, or of course do it for me?

<p>All his other contributions (that I've looked at) have actually appeared to be beneficial to Wikipedia though and he's reverted vandalism on other articles quite a few times, which confuses me. There are several warnings on his talk page and he doesn't appear to have listened to them. This is the first time someone's irritated me enough to report them, so I'm not sure how long I'd recommend he be blocked for, I'll leave that to the admins. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 11:46, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

As I understand it, there is a longstanding semi-formal agreement that in articles dealing with things outside of the English-speaking world, we don't particularly favor U.S. or Commonwealth style on dates; instead, we wikify and let the software format it to the users' preferences.

<dd>I think Jmabel to be, on the whole, correct (the issue ought, IMHO, for unwikified dates, to be treated as is AE/BE by the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#National_varieties_of_English" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">MoS</a>, which treatment <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a> seems to suggest), but if I'm not crazy almost all of the dates over which edit-warring has occurred here are wikified, such that, for registered users (who necessarily, IIRC, make a date preference election), that which displays will not be affected; aren't most of these edits purposeless? <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:15, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is a non–issue, I'm afraid. Go to your "<i>my preferences</i>" and change your dating format preference from "<i>No preference</i>" (or "<i>15 January 2000</i>") to "<i>January 15, 2000</i>", and <i><b>all dates</b></i> that he "<i>re-formatted</i>" will appear as you have selected. His changing of these dates is pointless as any one user can select preference for one of these methods over the other. That's why this preference selection was created. — <sup>`</sup><a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyInSane_3df2.html" title="User:CrazyInSane"><i>C</i><small>RAZY</small></a><a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazyInSane_e382.html" title="User talk:CrazyInSane">`(<small>lN</small>)`<i>S</i><small>ANE</small></a><sup>` <i><a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyInSane_disclaimer_a367.html" title="User:CrazyInSane/disclaimer">[discl.]</a></i></sup> 05:19, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It <i>would</i> be a non-issue <i>if and only if</i> people like SuperJumbo didn't unilaterally change dates to match their personal preference. The "preference selection" was designed to prevent such changes by rendering them pointless. No one thought anyone would be so silly as to go on a jihad to convert dates to his "preferred preference" just in order to have non-logged in users see them, but obviously we didn't reckon on how bellicose people can be in insisting you adopt their whims as default. But that is the argument he offered when I objected to him converting all articles relating to Monaco to day-month-year. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 06:00, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand why it matters. It might be pointless for him to do this, but why would anyone go to the trouble of reverting it? He has wikified so that it will appear as per whatever preference users have adopted. If people don't have accounts or haven't logged in, I don't think they'll suffer greatly if the date appears the way he prefers in the articles he's edited. Or am I missing something here? <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 07:05, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're missing the fact that it's fundamentally disrespectful to insist on having one's own way in what is supposed to be a cooperative or at least collegial editing environment. When you change "color" to "colour" or "haemophilia" to "hemophilia", it annoys people because you are insisting "their" way is wrong and your way is right. It's the same with dates. If it doesn't, or shouldn't, matter, then it shouldn't be changed. You should have the decency to leave <i>de minimus</i> matters alone, and respect other's choices, rather than privileging your own. If you don't, you encourage edit wars, ill-feeling, and distract from the business of writing an encyclopedia. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 07:23, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand all that, I guess. I still don't understand why it matters <b>so much</b>, given what the outcome actually is for users of the encyclopedia. If someone changed the way I had the dates (but wikified them properly) I would smile at their relatively harmless idiosyncracy rather than thinking this was terribly important or needed to be dealt with by admins. It seems that any disruption is <i>de minimus</i>. Oh well, maybe another admin will take a greater interest in it. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 08:11, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>SuperJimbo wikified the dates so that date preferences are enabled. Tazmaniac's blind reversion de-wikified the dates.

<p>This issue erupted in a major edit war some time ago. We agreed on a simple solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set preferences to choose whether one wanted to read International Dating dd/mm/yyyy or American Dating mm/dd/yyyy.</li>
</ul>
<p>However as one has to have a WP account to set preferences, it was also agreed to apply another two simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a country uses either ID or AD predominantly, articles should be written in it.</li>
<li>Where they don't, go by the initial choice made by the initial editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>That was placed in the MoS through the giving of some examples of countries that use ID. The list in the MoS was <b>never</b> intended to be the only countries. If it was then users of ID would never have agreed to the compromise. It was always intended to be an example.</p>
<p>So when anyone of us edits and American article we <i>always</i> use American Dating (in fact for many international editors of WP it is probably the only time in their lives when they ever write dates in the month/day format as most of the planet use day/month, hence its name, <i>International</i> Dating). I have got into edit wars on American pages stopping users from replacing American Dating on American pages with International Dating.</p>
<p>The same is also true. All SuperJumbo has been doing is applying that rule. He has not been blanket changing dates. He has been</p>
<ul>
<li>ensuring that dates on British topics all follow ID rather than, as is the case a lot of the time, being a mishmash of both;</li>
<li>fixing other articles so that all the date structures are the same, whether ID or AD;</li>
<li>ensuring that date usage on WP reflects national usage in the country being written about. Many of the articles he has been working on lately have been French ones. France does not use American Dating, and it is as offensive for French people to have their articles written in American Dating (and spelling) as it is for Americans to have their articles written in International Dating and International English.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde</a>, as usual, bungled in to the process with his usual sledgehammer approach and blanket reverted SuperJumbo's corrections, insisting that</p>
<ul>
<li>a British topic like <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom_3b8e.html" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">Edward VIII of the United Kingdom</a> be a mishmash of International and American Dating, with sometimes both formats used in the one sentence</li>
<li>an Irish topic like <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bono_%28U2%29_2408.html" title="Bono (U2)">Bono</a> be in American Dating even though Ireland does not use American Dating and Irish users on WP get extremely pissed off when Americans on WP <i>keep</i> converting articles to follow American Dating.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than accuse Cyde of vandalism for forcing messes onto articles all over the place, perhaps the most charitable thing that could be said was that, as he does sometimes, he screwed up. International Dating users are however at this stage getting a bit fed up with some (and it is only a small number) of American users consistently trying to force a format of dating on country articles where that country never uses AD. ID users have been more than willing to ensure that countries that use AD have AD in them, and to revert any changes from AD. It would be nice if AD users showed the same willingness to accept that, as was the agreement that stopped the last major edit war on dating, some countries use ID, some AD and the articles on topics from each country should reflect usage.</p>
<p>The reality is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>the US uses AD.</li>
<li>Most of the Commonwealth of Nations uses ID.</li>
<li>Most of Europe uses ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know what various countries in South America and Africa use.</p>
<p>Maybe we should simply compile a list of countries and set down explicitly what dating should be used for each. We could establish a project on dates. That might be the solution. But in the meantime, SuperJumbo is perfectly correct to adjust European topics to ID, American topics to AD, and where a mishmash occurs in articles to fix it. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 00:41, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The MoS guideline as it stands quite clearly refers to the English-speaking world. Elsewhere, either should be acceptable, just as articles may be in U.S. or Commonwealth English. Although countries outside the English-speaking world each have their own date preferences, we do not normally apply those. To follow that logic, we would have to give dates in Hungarian-related articles in the form 2006-8-20.</li>

<dd>The behaviour I'm seeing here by SuperJumbo is simply unacceptable. Now he's revert-warring over dates on dozens of articles using a JavaScript tool. Regardless of whether or not his date format changing is acceptable, what he's doing now clearly isn't. I would suggest someone do something to reign him in here, as <i>my</i> hands are tied in this issue. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 19:48, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All he is doing is applying standard dates to the relevant articles. In doing that he is my full support and the full support of many others. The fact that Jmabel refers to something he calls <i>Commonwealth English</i> when we are actually dealing with international dating, is indicative of the nonsensical nature of the attacks being made on SuperJumbo. He is simply applying what we all do, and all will continue to do, applying International Dating to topics in areas where it is relevant, and applying American Dating to topics where it is relevant. I have fought edit wars to stop ID users from changing articles on American topics to ID dating and International English. American users deserve the respect of users in terms of their choice of language. I and others will continue to do similarly with ID articles out of respect for people in other countries who use ID and IE and who take offence when American language, spelling and dating is forced onto topics about countries that never ever use AD and AE. Superjumbo has asked opinions and consulted. Those who are attacking him rarely have. Cyde, bizarrely, reverted the correct usage of ID and IE on an article about an British king, imposing American dating onto the article. And he sought to force an article about an Irish rock band to keep American dating. It was ridiculous. If his hands are tied on the issue, it is about time. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 20:16, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the above comments. At every stage I have sought to inform myself on what is a surprisingly complex subject, one with a long history and an outcome that represents a triumph of consensus and co-operation in both the technical and editorial sides of the project. I have sought consultation and availed myself of the relevant authorities in the MoS.</dd>
<dd>I am rather disappointed with the behaviour of Cyde, who reverted a swag of my careful changes and then when I pointed out the relevant guidelines I was following, declined to undo his reverts, meaning that I had to do so. Calling this "edit warring" is a little rich. I would have thought that at the very least he would have been pleased to undo his changes to articles on British royalty, which had the effect of inserting a mish-mash of date formats, many of them unlinked, many of them in American Dating format. At one point he even removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASuperJumbo&amp;diff=70419710&amp;oldid=70376703" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASuperJumbo&amp;diff=70419710&amp;oldid=70376703" rel="nofollow">my comments to a third party</a> on my own talk page. However, I imagine that Cyde is a busy person, and was merely working with best speed to correct what he thought were errors.</dd>
<dd>I have been rigorously correcting date formats as appropriate, as may be seen from my contributions. Some American articles were using International Dating, and I have corrected them, though I must say that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Earl_Sheffield&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70866904" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Earl_Sheffield&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70866904" rel="nofollow">such examples</a> are few. It is far more common to find articles on subjects from countries that use International Dating that have American Dating applied. For every incorrectly formated date in an article on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Nixon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70561903" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Nixon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70561903" rel="nofollow">U.S. president</a>, I will find dozens in articles on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anne_of_Great_Britain&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70868372" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anne_of_Great_Britain&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70868372" rel="nofollow">British kings and queens</a>.

<li>The original usage is a British peculiarity, not American</li>
<li>The change has no effect on what the reader sees <i>even if preferences are not set</i>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. Wikilinked [[21 April]] [[1958]] in two more appearances where it wasn't linked (and didn't have a comma in the middle).</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Again, there wasn't any "American" usage as implied by his edit summary.</li>
<li>If you take the time to check, these were probably linked at one time and unlinked as unnecessary duplicates by someone who didn't understand the date preferences purpose.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. changed "18th June 2006," to "[[18 June]] [[2006]], and similarly for 23rd June 2006</p>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Once again, it was a British usage peculiarity he was internationalizing, not American usage.</li>

<p>So why the gratuitous nastiness and America-bashing in the edit summary? <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 02:27, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do beg your pardon! When I get to the edit summary part of the edit, I have a little drop down box with various previous summaries in them. I just pick the easiest one out of the list, and I do recall thinking for one of them, hmmmm, was there anything American about that last lot? But I didn't think anybody would care too much or go reading too much into it. My apologies!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My understanding, and I'm willing to stand corrected on this, is that the comma in the middle of dates is a distinctly American thing, and thus inappropriate for International Dating. I've taken several approaches to commas in wikidates previously, and my understanding is that they are superfluous. If an editor has date prefs set to AD, then the comma is inserted regardless of whether it appears in the source. Contrarywise, if prefs are set to ID, then the comma is suppressed if it appears in the text. OTOH, if a reader has no date prefs set, then the comma is only displayed if the original date is in American format, regardless of whether there is a comma in the source or not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Removing commas from wikidates is therefore a saving in space. Only one character per date, to be sure, but the nitpicker in me rejoices at the elimination of redundancy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for being an ass, this happens from time to time, but not deliberately so! If there was any nastiness or "America-bashing", then it was inferred, rather than implied, and I once again welcome the opportunity to express my admiration and respect for this great nation, the first of the modern democracies. --03:22, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We shouldn't rely on an undocumented bug/feature that could be changed in the future, just to save a single character. There is another problem of date links not working properly with the commas if you use things like [[February 30]], [[1712 in music|1712]] (<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_30.html" title="February 30">February 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/1/1712_in_music.html" title="1712 in music">1712</a>), but that's a another bug related to the silliness of using wikilinks to effect these preferences in the first place. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 15:22, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Removing the comma is correct. International dating does not use a comma. American dating <i>sometimes</i> does. Wikipedia policy is not to use it.</li>
<li>It is Wikipedia policy to remove <i>th</i> and to wikilist dates. He removed the <i>th</i> and wikilinked a date. Given that one of the benefits of doing that is to allow Americans who have set their preferences to see the date in American dating, rather than in International Dating, if they chose.</li>
</ul>
<p>There, as in all the other points, SuperJumbo is acting strictly in accordance with the MoS. I echo Snottygobble's words. "Jumbo's edits precisely follow the MOS. Apparently this date warring issue has got everyone so touchy that we've started attacking people who are part of the solution not the problem.

<p>I referred to "Commonwealth English" because we are working in English. For what it's worth, SuperJumbo is changing the dates to the same form I would tend to favor, and I was not one of the parties in the resulting date warring. I still say that using popups on things like this is an unnecessary provocation. But if others don't agree, so be it. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 03:07, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>Based on that conclusion (closed by <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a>), and the close relationship between these different rulings, I have taken some unusual actions, which I want to make others aware of for review and comment.</p>
<ol>
<li>I closed the ongoing CFD on Category:Articles needing sources, and as it was now entirely redundant to the restored category, I deleted it after moving the references back to the restored category.</li>
<li>I restored <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArticles_with_unsourced_statements_220b.html" title="Category:Articles with unsourced statements">Category:Articles with unsourced statements</a>. Though this category is not specifically discussed in the DRV, the arguments and context are extremely similar. I believe the existence of this deletion largely escaped notice because most uses of it were converted to Articles lacking sources at the time of its deletion.</li>
</ol>
<p>If people object to the second undeletion, we can run that through DRV also, but I am confident the result would be the same.</p>
<p>More generally, I think we have a problem if CFD can, through the course of active discussion involving dozens of participants, repeatedly reach a conclusion that can be unanimously overturned by dozens of other participants at DRV. At least one of these groups must be out of touch with the views of the larger community, and that in itself is a substantial problem, in my opinion. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 18:11, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, I'll raise my hand to speak for some of the DRV group: our objection, repeated in many voices, was that the deletion left a large tear in scores of articles and that any xfD lacked a solution to the damage caused by the deletion. Inasmuch as this was an admonitory category and not a content category, we (most of us) felt that there could be no deletion without, simultaneously, a solution that would substitute for its old function. There were other factors, as well, mainly related to the fact that the compulsion to delete was based on a false premise, but I'll let server folks talk about that. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:23, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seconded. As the admin who closed the first CFD above, you'll note that I disagreed with the consensus but considering that all of these categories spawn from changes in {fact} it seemed reasonable to assume that if we were going to put into place some metacategorization (by month? with a toc?) then the category itself was likely to be nuked in the process anyhow (and others added to {fact}, requiring little human intervention). I don't think CFD itself is the problem, but that it is somewhat the redheaded stepchild of *FD so discussions there aren't given enough eyes. Barring that, I'd be up for making a guideline to closing admins on CFD to bring maintenance category deletion notices to ANI or VP or something. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 21:20, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I really don't like the sound of that. There is already an inherent bias towards keeping things that are most useful to editors rather than the vastly greater number of readers, and this sounds like it would make it worse. It is people who visit <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_7d72.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion">Wikipedia:Categories for discussion</a> who are most engaged with the management of the category system, which is an issue in its own right, and I don't think our rights should be taken away. We have a page called "Categories for discussion", so the question is are we going to be allowed to make decisions on categories at that page or not? If not, why not? There are an increasing number of comments on the page which simply scorn the process rather than engaging with the merits of the category, and it is becoming demoralising.</dd>
<dd>I am seriously concerned that the whole system is biased towards retention of marginal categories because it usually only takes the creator and a few other people to prevent deletion, and the people who (over)value a category are the ones who are most likely to notice that it is up for discussion. A bad example of this was the retention of the "entertainers by age of death categories"; there was an overwhelming consensus to delete after 7 days, but the debate wasn't closed promptly and after 9 days a bunch of meat puppets showed up and voted "keep" in the space of a few hours. It increasingly seems to me that over time the category system is likely to get steadily worse, because even if only 10% of bad categories are kept, that means that more and more bad categories will accumulate over time and eventually the category clutter on high profile articles will become so bad that they might as well not have categories at all. The way to tackle this is to keep as much control of the category system as possible in the hands of people who care about the category system as a whole and vote on that basis, rather than as partisans for or against specific categories, and that means the people who take the trouble to visit "Categories for discussion" regularly. Thus I deprecate anything that downgrades the decision making status of "Categories for discussion. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicheley_7210.html" title="User:Chicheley">Chicheley</a> 23:07, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had thought that the standard way of doing things was that pages or categories associated with a process, policy, proposal etc. should not be deleted without first abandoning or changing the things that depend on them. In other words, *FD is not where we decide how to do things on Wikipedia; *FD doesn't get to decide policy (process, proposal, ...) by deleting them or the things they depend upon.</dd>

<p>This conversation brings to light a very serious problem with the workings of Wikipedia. Decisions are supposed to be made by discussion, but there is little consensus about what that means in practice. To some it means that there is a straw poll, everyone gives their opinion, and if the requisite percentage is met, there is consensus. That is the current practice, but I think this understanding of the meaning of "discussion" is wrong. Discussion has to be a much bigger process, and the wisdom of administrators has to play a bigger role. Jimmy Wales, in his numerous talks (they are linked to <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">his article</a>), gives an AFD example where everyone says "delete" until the very end of the discussion at which point someone explains clearly why something should be kept, and it is. This notion of discussion is slipping away. If we have policies, an admin should be able to weigh the arguments made during a discussion in light of what the policies are and then make an informed decision. This is more like being a judge than a election official. If a discussion clearly points out a problem with a policy, the closing admin should close it by saying "no consensus, refer the issue for discussion at the relevant policy page".</p>
<p>Our system of creating policy is moving towards becoming totally descriptive. Having descriptive policies instead of proscriptive ones are valuable when things are evolving. If you don't know the best way to do something, or if people have differing ideas about how to do things, let them work out solutions, and see which work and which get adopted by the wider community. Then we can create descriptive policies about what evolves. Once we have policies, we should apply them, or discuss changing them. What we shouldn't do is vote case by case with a random set of voters.</p>
<p>I'd like to propose that anyone closing a discussion try to weigh the arguments against policy. If the popular "vote" is clearly against policy, the admin could state an "initial decision" explaining their rationale, and leave the discussion up for a while to allow conversation to continue. In this way the admin would be behaving more like a facilitator. Once closed, the voters could start a discussion about changing policy on the appropriate page. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 08:43, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just reading through this thread, and I think this last point is an excellent one. Closing admins should see themselves as judges, not election officials. And referring things for "further discussion" should definitely be done more often. I remember a CfD where no consensus could be reached, but a group went off to discuss things for a week or so, and then came back to CfD with the result of the discussion, which was then accepted after a period of time waiting for regular CfDers to comment. Worked like a dream. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 23:52, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm concerned greatly about an annoymous user (last IP was 88.105.73.18) who seems to be on a crusade on the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entropia_Universe_3a35.html" title="Entropia Universe">Entropia Universe</a> arcitle. They have a very swift tendancy to edit *any* negativity in the arcitle out, often under the guise of 'Removing Vandalism'.</p>
<p>They have even targetted the talk page too (Clean Up, Removal of unnecessary negative ranting and Vandalism, Removal of Spam Advertising, Restoration of Balance and removal of troll comments.)</p>
<p>They never use an account, and from the user contributions on the user page the Entropia Universe article is the only place they seem to edit.</p>
<p>I don't want to turn this into an all out edit war - but this person is really trying my wick and I don't know where to turn. They have as of yet left no comments on the talk page of said article.</p>
<p>erm... help!</p>

<dd>Disputes about article tone are pretty common, and this one doesn't seem to require (or allow for) administrative intervention at this time. I agree that some statistics-removals have been agressive, but the solution is to talk about—try taking WAS up on his suggestion at the talk page. I'll also add the article to my watchlist to get a better feel for the situation if it continues. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 03:23, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good grief. How long have you guys been putting up with those talkpage deletions? Without going into the more difficult questions of article text removal and article tone, the removal of other people's comments from the <b>talk</b> page is not a difficult question at all. Doing that is a serious policy violation, period. I have posted a sharply worded warning on the user's own talkpage. If it happens again, please a) revert, and b) let me or another admin know as soon as possible. I've watchlisted the page, but watching isn't infallible, so do give somebody a shout if this abusive practice continues. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 04:58, 20 August 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>For what it's worth: I had contacted Pablo-flores because he works on Latin American topics, but not on Chilean topics (which is the main place I found myself in conflict with Mike). You can read <a href="../../../p/a/b/User_talk%7EPablo-flores_ff76.html#Mike18xx" title="User talk:Pablo-flores">our exchange on his user talk page</a>: it should be clear I was not "tattling", I was asking advice for advice on how to proceed, because I was finding myself in conflict with this user. My comments there begin</p>
<blockquote>

He's clearly sincere, and I don't doubt that he intends to help create an encyclopedia, and sometime makes good edits (especially in terms of removing undercited material) but he is really abrasive, and he often justifies his actions with claims about Marxism that appear (at least to me) bizarre. At the moment, this is mostly intended as a "heads-up". If a "request for comment" really was what its name suggests, I'd start one, but in practice it seems to be more like bringing a suit, which is not what I intend to do.</p>

<p>If this is "tattling" I cannot imagine what would constitute an acceptable way for one person to consult another about the conduct of a third. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:58, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just say "Thank you for your input," and keep doing what you're doing. You're doing good work. One of the things that you discover when you become an admin is that no matter what you do, there is someone, somewhere, who is unhappy with it. You're undertaking an admin-like task without admin powers, which is doubly thankless. Jeff's entitled to his opinion that your closing WP:SNOW AfDs early is inappropriate, but that position isn't supported by common practice. That's my $0.02, anyway. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 02:11, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was going to say something like what Nandesuka said with the minor note that the speedy policies are controversial enough as is. There isn't much need to make things worse by speedy closing stuff which isn't within policy unless you have a very clear case (like in the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Norris_Facts_d641.html" title="Chuck Norris Facts">Chuck Norris Facts</a> article. However, speedy keeping out of policy is not as potentially disruptive as speedy deleting outside policy. Also, Jeff's behavior while annoying is not intrinsically bad- he is noting when a new admin makes out of policy speedy keeps. My recommendation to Synergetic would be to ignore Jeff if he continues but keep in mind what the actual policy is and make sure if you are invoking <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> to note it in your closing comment.

<dd>To side-step the issue of the early closes for a moment, there's nothing wrong with "wikistalking" in my opinon. The <i>inventor</i> of wikis has said that the "contributions" link and the ability to keep track of each other is a crucial ingrediant. I have a wiki-stalking box on my pseudo-user page that links direct to people's contributions. As to the early closes, I'll <i>mostly</i> echo Nandesuka, with a few small notes, as the ones I looked at were all acceptable, but I wouldn't have closed them.
<ul>
<li>Were you finding that there weren't that many that had run five days that were obvious closes? The reason that I ask is that closing early doesn't do <i>that</i> much to decrease admin load. An argument could be made that since the more obsessive among us will double-check your work, it <i>increases</i> it.</li>
<li>It's a good idea if something is to be closed early that you note in the close <i>explicitly</i> that you've done so, and even perhaps link to the "closing early" section in the guide to deletion. <b>Don't link SNOW</b> as it means nothing and there are other places to link that are not controversial.</li>

<dd>Wow, now dishonesty, too. I logged my opinion on the Chuck Norris AfD on the 18th, three days ago. I keep the AfDs I'm involved with watchlisted, thus, I see when they're closed. I saw you closed it early. Done deal. My other complaint <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SynergeticMaggot/Archive_2#AfD_closing" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SynergeticMaggot/Archive_2#AfD_closing" rel="nofollow">[137]</a> was when I went through an AfD page about two days after it was posted, and noted all your speedy closes. Guess what? I normally read the AfD page every day. Even if I *was* "stalking" you, read <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> sometime: "This does not include checking up on an editor to fix errors or violations of Wikipedia policy, nor does it mean reading a user's contribution log; those logs are public for good reason." You've grossly flaunted policy numerous times, and I have a legitimate reason to check up on your future closes as a result. It would be nice if some admins would instead step in and ask SM to cease with the closings until he learns basic deletion policy instead of coming to my talk page and getting on my case for trying to fix a problem. 9 improper, out of process speedy closes in the last 3 days. I'll fix the problem every time. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 02:37, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(<b>Edit conflict</b>)Oh with that one I wasnt invoking SNOW. I check the last log on the main AfD page once a new log hits. Whats odd is that the AfD in quesiton is in fact in August 16th's log, yet time stamped as nom'ed on the 17th. If you wish to check, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_August_16#Chuck_Norris_Facts" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_August_16#Chuck_Norris_Facts" rel="nofollow">here</a> is the log. Its at the very bottom. Thus making it approx. its fifth day on AfD, with 12 keeps (not counting this users keep:User:64.91.92.57), and no deletes. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 02:32, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whoa! Now I wish I had powered through the edit conflict when I first saw this instead of backing out. Everyone please get the hackles down. Jeff's point of view and Maggot's are far from each other on a continuum, but they're both licit. Essentially, if something runs after a unanimous delete, it's not really going to hurt anything, so, if someone is asking that the thing go full term, there's nothing really bad about it. It's not really an AN/I issue. I agree with Aaron here. If Jeff is seeming too much of a finger wagger, then Maggot is probably seeming too much of a tattler, so let's relax. Both are legitimate folks with legitimate points of view, and both are trying to do what is best for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:48, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Speedy anything bugs me, unless it's an article that fits one of the already defined categories of "speedy delete." There is no CSK, just CSD. <i>Festina lente,</i> as the man said. Speedy keep, of all things, should be very, very rare, and only when dealing with WP:POINT violations and vandalism (nominating <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Jung_ba49.html" title="Carl Jung">Carl Jung</a> for deletion, e.g., because your favorite guru's article got deleted). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:54, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As an aside, it would be nice if we <i>could</i> speedy keep things like this. Unfortunately, any attempts to cut that down are consistently shot down, so it tells me that people are indeed interested in the process as long as it suits them.

<dd>Oh, come on! It's an honest difference of philosophy, so calling folks hypocritical isn't really helping, you know? It's true that most people put the burden of proof on the article and some on the people who believe that an article should be deleted, but the status quo always has an inherent virtue of working. Speedy keeping is often "stop talking," just as "speedy delete" is, and that's why neither should be used except in very narrowly defined circumstances. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:05, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My two cents as an observer: <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">Badlydrawnjeff</a> has moved from stalking to harassment. He's been told by SM that SM does not agree with his opinion and has stated his intention to continue to bring it up on SM's talk page anyway. BDJ should just drop it, or if he thinks the article should be deleted, relist it. Nagging someone on their talk page is extremely rude when it clear that neither one's arguments have or will change the other's mind. —<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> 14:00, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Girls not allowed to edit Wikipedia?" What a weirdo. Most of his edits have these bizarre or disgusting edit summaries. He edits very sporadically though; I think it would take a community block of at least 2 weeks to a month for any message to be received (though that may very well be a lost cause.) A month-long block seems harsh but for someone who contributes relatively infrequently but this requires a creative solution. We shouldn't have to put up with this kind of misogyny.

The most critical thing, as you and your antagonists have shown us over the course of countless months, is that without a standard -- even an arbitrarily-chosen one -- you or they will continue to drive all of us insane.

It is time to end the battle over naming US state highways in either a consistent way across fifty states or <b>else</b> however they are most usually refered to within each state. so to finally bring this to a conclusive end, I urge everyone to think about it enough to make a choice and then vote in the matter prior to aug. 31 so we can bring this weird tempest in a teapot to a close. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 05:01, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. Many people, noobs and veterans alike, make links, change links, and bold text corresponding to the article title rather than the actual name. Sometimes this is done because of a misunderstanding (willful or otherwise) of our practices, but often it's because people don't know the name offhand. If you are writing an article about a town in Maryland and want to write about <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland_Route_3_116c.html" title="Maryland Route 3">Maryland Route 3</a>, what do you write in the text? Would saying "Maryland Route 3 runs through Foo" be redundant? Would saying "Route 3 runs through Foo" be improper? How do you know if "Maryland Route 3" is bolded because it's the common name or because someone felt the Maryland should be there because it's in the title? You'll probably end up saying "Maryland Route 3", which in this case is correct. ("Route 3" is also correct here, by the way.) But in other states, the opposite is true. "The town of Foo, Florida is at the intersection of Florida State Road 50 and Florida State Road 19" is horribly redundant. Or even worse - the suggested form "Michigan State Trunk Highway 1 runs through Bar, Michigan", when no one, local or otherwise, calls it anything but M-1. But people write like this all the time, because the article is located there, and they either don't know better, are lazy, or think they have to write the whole title when linking. (<a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Route_1_81e1.html" title="U.S. Route 1">"Florida State Road A1A runs next to the Atlantic Ocean, roughly parallel to US 1 for much of its path through Florida."</a>; <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Route_90_a019.html" title="U.S. Route 90">"As of 2004, the highway's eastern terminus is in Jacksonville Beach, Florida at an intersection with Florida State Road A1A three blocks from the Atlantic Ocean."</a>; <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Talbot_Island_State_Park_ab4d.html" title="Little Talbot Island State Park">Little Talbot Island State Park is a Florida State Park located on Little Talbot Island, 17 miles northeast of Jacksonville on Florida State Road A1A."</a> (<a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_State_Park_d540.html" title="Florida State Park">Florida State Park</a> may be redundant here too); <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_Military_Academy_68d5.html" title="Michigan Military Academy">"The John C.

<dd>Agreed. This isn't the ideal solution by any means. But after 6 months of no movement on either side to come to a consensus I think it's the only logical and acceptable thing to do. One side will have to be forced to accept the other position and finally drop it.

Petaholmes in particular insists this usage is fair use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Australia&amp;diff=70960417&amp;oldid=70958610" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Australia&amp;diff=70960417&amp;oldid=70958610" rel="nofollow">[139]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Australia&amp;diff=70961142&amp;oldid=70960988" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Australia&amp;diff=70961142&amp;oldid=70960988" rel="nofollow">[140]</a> and is not problematic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Durin&amp;diff=70962206&amp;oldid=70961497" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Durin&amp;diff=70962206&amp;oldid=70961497" rel="nofollow">[141]</a>. I have explained to Petaholmes that this is not a permitted use, and pointed him to where he can go to get a fair use exception (though such exceptions are exceedingly rare).</p>
<p>I have noted both to Cyberjunkie and Petaholmes that this template, while 'broken' by the removal of the image, is actually broken in its use of the image. It should be re-written to avoid the use of the image, or {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_country_60b1.html" title="Template:Infobox country">Infobox country</a>}} should be used instead. In the meantime, the image should be removed from the template. It is not arguable to say, in essence, "We violated your copyright because our template did not look right without it, and we wanted it to look right until we developed an alternative". Petaholmes is currently arguing that I am bizarrely targeting this infobox and that the image should remain until we develop an alternative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Australia&amp;diff=70962042&amp;oldid=70961630" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Australia&amp;diff=70962042&amp;oldid=70961630" rel="nofollow">[142]</a>.</p>
<p>As it stands now, the image is still on the template in violation of our policies. Failing an exception being granted for this case (which as noted above is unlikely), it needs to be removed from the template, regardless of whether the template looks nice without it or not. I would appreciate it if a previously uninvolved admin would please remove the image again, and leave a warning to the effect of fair use violations being improper to anyone who attempts to revert the removal again. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 14:29, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I note that this isn't the only template that you have attempted to destroy in your endless quest against coat of arms images appearing in templates. In many cases, coats of arms images are in the public domian, and can't be copyrighted- so there is no problem in using them in templates. I would say this is true of the Australia arms. Can't you find something more productive to do, or at the least work round your identified issue instead of mindlessly deleting valid content? <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 14:54, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>All contributions to Wikipedia done with good intent and within our policies are welcome here. I'm sorry you feel that this is "mindless", an "endless quest", unproductive and having identified issues. If the images in question which you feel are in the public domain are in fact so, then by all means please go and fix the tagging of those images to reflect that with proper sourcing to confirm the status, rather than assaulting me for properly removing images under our fair use policies. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 15:17, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The copyright status of the image is a rather interesting question.

<li>It is an interesting question, and one that we should satisfactorily resolve so that all coats of arms images of all countries can be properly tagged with whatever comes of the research into this legal area. We've done our homework on country flags. We need to do the same on country coats of arms, rather than make a presumption (as some have done) that they are in the public domain. Until we know they are in the public domain for a fact, we need to treat the tags as authentic unless we have some verifiable, sound reason for re-tagging them under a free license tag. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 15:17, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Agreed about the tagging. Aren't Coats of Arms defined by the proper <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraldic.html" title="Heraldic">heraldic</a> description ("Sable, 3 mice courant, argent; crest, a domestic cat couched as to spring, proper; motto: As my Whimsy takes me") and the concrete rendering is up to the artist? So there are a number of questions here:
<ol>
<li>Is any given description under copyright? If not, we can have someone rerender the description to get a free image.</li>
<li>If yes, is the actual rendering a derived work under copyright (I'd argue no...)? If not, we can again have someone rerender it.</li>
<li>Is the actual rendering a creative act and hence protected? (It might depend on how formulaic the rendering is)</li>
<li>Are there any renderings for a given coat of arms that are public domain? For most jurisdictions and most coats of arms this is probably true, as they are fairly old. But things like <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_Copyright_1d49.html" title="Crown Copyright">Crown Copyright</a> might interfere.</li>

<dd>Try that, Improv, and you will generate the mother of all edit wars with users from every country they are used, and people working on every article they are used, reverting their removal en masse. You are talking about triggering off a Wikipedia-wide war on the issue. Merely touching one sparked this row here. Can you imagine the results if you try to take the coat of arms from the UK template, the French template, the Irish template, the American template, etc etc. It would be an exceedingly silly thing to do. Get the guys in the foundation to get legal advice on their status and if they are legal put a note to that effect in our rules. Frankly the Australian row right now would be like a kiddie's tea party compared to the backlash that would occur all over Wikipedia if it was attempted, unilaterally, to remove coats of arms from boxes. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 16:55, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not all coat of arms designs are in the public domain. Any rendition of such a design is a <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivative_work.html" title="Derivative work">derivative work</a>, and cannot be released under the kind of free licensing that we want. We must therefore claim <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> on the rendition. In those cases in which the description is "in the public domain" (very loosely speaking here), we need to make our own renditions, as we don't claim <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> on things that we can potentially create on our own. The fact that there are other requirements upon the usage of coats of arms in various different jurisdictions that have nothing to do with copyright is something that we seem to have so far been comfortable ignoring. A further complication is that there are coats of arms in which there is only one "official" rendition and we cannot create our own and maintain accuracy. We can't ask <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrad_Patrick_1861.html" title="User:Brad Patrick">User:Brad Patrick</a> to make some sort of blanket declaration on whether coats of arms are "okay" or "not okay", because each individual coat of arms is going to require a minimal level of research.

<li>I also agree with comments of others above; even if it does touch off a war, it's not a reason to not do the right thing. Ascertaining what the right thing to do is a case by case basis that needs some level of research to achieve.</li>
<li>Also, echo what <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">User:Jkelly</a> said. Various jurisdictions have restrictions on how images can be used. Whether they have a legal leg to stand on doesn't, in my opinion, seem to be the central point we need to consider. The use of such images, if done clearly under a reasonable fair use claim, gives us an affirmative defense and response to those entities who voice concern to us about violating their usage restrictions. Use on userpages and other non-main namespace areas brings no value to the project and exposes us to complaints that would leave us with less of a reasonable response to those entities. If the images are in fact under a free-license, let's tag them as such and move on. If not, let's be conservative. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 17:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The arms is in the Public Domain copyright wise. The arms, according to the Australian Government, was created in 1921 due to a Royal Warrant. Since this was a government work, it will be 50 uears since creation before it can become public domain. So 1921 + 50 = 1971. It has been over 30 years since the copyright has expired. So it is safe to replace the arms photo drawn by Vector-Images. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 01:49, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If this <i>particular</i> graphical representation of the arms is from 1921, then I agree. But, understand that the coat of arms is a description. Graphical representations of it can be made by anyone, anytime. It is important to know what the source of the image to properly understand what the dating on it is. Even if the coat of arms is updated in 1921, I could create a graphic from that description today, and claim some rights to the image. That's why having the source is important, so we can verify the status. Without it, we are presuming the image is from 1921 which could be a false presumption. In this particular case, we have capitulated our decision about the copyright decision to vector-images.com, which has made mistakes before. I think this is improper, and have noted this elsewhere. I plan on doing some more general research into this in the future. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 12:37, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Of course, it'd be nice to have third-party refs in addition, so I also don't seem a problem with "citation needed" tags. However, I think the OP was referring to actions further back in the history involving multiple placements of tags and prodding the article, which seems a bit extreme to me. —<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> 13:46, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you have missed the crux of my complaint. First there was the drive-by tagging, which added tags that took up half the page. ONE of these tags complained about citations. None of them included any comment on the talk page. I asked Mattisse to clarify, and removed the tags (while improving the article with a number of minors, including new refs). When I returned, the page had a PROD on it. In the talk page was a completely different set of complaints, none of which addressed the original four tags. It snowballed from there, with comments left on other users pages about how I "refused" to add references, even though they were already there in the first place. And now the article is sprinkled with CITEs on seemingly random points, again, with no explaination of what he/she wants a cite for (for instance, that first one in AppleSearch, what exactly is the cite being asked for?).</dd>
<dd>This particular article doesn't even really bother me, and Mattisse has apparently lost all interest in it (and apparently the wiki in general, although that claim has been made before as well). The real issue here is that when I investigated his/her other edits, the VAST MAJORITY are PROD tags, the vast majority of those with no comment on the talk page. Many of those, including dozens yesterday, have no basis other than Mattisse found them by following What Links Here from a page. He/she PRODed Wolfe for instance, even <b>I</b> know this guy from the physics world.</dd>
<dd>The pattern is clear: first a whack of tags is added to an article with no explaination whatsoever. When an editor removes these and asks for clarification, Mattisse immediately hits the article with a PROD. When the user removes that, Mattisse complains on other people's pages that the author is being uncooperative, and then smacks the article with CITEs.</dd>
<dd>This behaviour is disruptive and counterproductive.</dd>
<dd>By the way, how is it you feel that TidBits is an "Apple-produced document". And what's wrong with referencing Apple-produced products about an Apple product? <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaury_Markowitz_e29a.html" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury</a> 13:45, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In response to your question on my talk page, I have attempted to clarify some of my remarks about self-published sources on your talk page. As for the initial tags, most of them seem fairly reasonable. The article didn't have in-line citations or clearly reputable third-party sources, and some passages (such as "Sadly when AppleSearch was released, Rosebud did not ship with it. Of course the utility of a newspaper engine given only local text files to search from is likely limited, but with the coming of the web the product would have had some utility. Even modern news aggregators generally don't offer the display quality or ease of use of Rosebud, which dates to around 1991.") were written in an un-encyclopedic tone. She proposed that it be deleted after you removed these tags without addressing the underlying issues (which have since been largely addressed), and while a Prod may have been a bit extreme, she was within her rights to do so if she felt that the article was unsalvagable. As for TidBITS, I do not consider it a reliable source because the section in question was not published in a print medium, but rather an e-mail newsletter. It might be a partial qualifier given the authorship of the newsletter, but it's a debatable point. The source in the trade publication appears to be derived from an Apple press release, making it equally debatable, and the Czech website is pretty clearly unreliable. The good news is that there probably ARE better sources out there for this article, given the abundance of third-party publications about Apple and the Mac; they just need to be found and included. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 15:10, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You got an orange bar which you clicked on to find a message about vandalism, I guess. That was probably left there to discourage an earlier user of your IP adress (internet providers move them around their customers regularly). You can disregard it. A block doesn't prevent you from reading articles, only from editing them. (PS.

<dd>This is probably due to your using either AOL or an AOL-owned Internet service provider. They "roll" their Internet protocol (IP) addresses frequently during a given online session. Given the numbers of people on AOL, some of them are bound to be vandals. When they get warned or even blocked, the block will be for a short time (due to the quick rolling of IP addresses) and then you'll be assigned their old IP address and seem to see yourself blocked or warned. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:09, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In this case the IP was Sympatico in Canada and it has no talk page active. I'm not sure how Brian got the orange message bar unless he actually tried to edit. In this case, it was probably an autoblock caused by a blocked user previously using that IP address. ISPs sometimes change their addressing, or a user can forcibly assign themselves a new address, meaning the old address gets assigned to someone else. You can avoid these messages by registering for a user name, even if you don't plan to edit. If you continue to read wikipedia without logging in, you may continue to occasionally get these warning messages left for the previous users of the IP address you happen to be assigned. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 01:26, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to hear from Jayjg. There might be a good reason for the blocks (assuming that those ranges have been indefinitely blocked). However, it is difficult to think of any reason for blocking an IP indefinitely unless it is an open proxy. Blocking a range for months is much more difficult to justify, in my opinion, let alone indefinitely. I think one of those blocks might cover one of my relative's IP addresses (they do not edit Wikipedia). I'd have to check, though. If it doesn't cover it, it is pretty close. It might be a good idea to post an explanation to the Administrators' Noticeboard when doing something like that, since people are likely to wonder what is going on when they notice it.&#160;:-) -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 12:17, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was a while ago, now, but as I recall Zephram Stark was busy creating all sorts of sockpuppets (at least 125 at last count), and the range blocks were slowing him down. As you no doubt noticed, the longer blocks were all from early April; as you no doubt also noticed, after that I started using shorter blocks. The ranges themselves were small (256 IPs), and typically checked to make sure only Zeprham was using them. The first two on the list, for example, were from a small company that Zephram often posted from. I've unblocked them all now (well, all but the ones that were already unblocked) - thanks for bringing this to my attention, and feel free to approach me individually in the future, as noted in SV's comment. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:25, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This user, who is not any level of Wiki member higher than a first day account creator, has left repeated threats on my user talk page accusing me of vandalism, bad grammar, and conducting original research. He has also threatened to have me banned from using my own talk page (sic). Basically the issues are over some bodybuilding and bodybuilding supplement articles (<a href="../../../c/r/e/Creatine.html" title="Creatine">Creatine</a> and Designer Whey Protein). I edited some articles and immediately before even discussing them on the article's discussion page he gave me warnings that I was a vandal (Is immediately calling someone a vandal a civil way to discuss changes?). I reverted the edits with some compromises, gave my reasons and he gave me ominous "Final Warnings" he appears to have created the articles or considers them his pet project. Anyone who edits them is a vandal. Basically his childish hostility is ridiculous. If he had discussed the changes with me it could have been a civil and productive exchange. I am open to compromise. Instead he immediately becomes hostile and threatens people with his imagined powers and then attempts to intimidate them. I am not concerned with who is right or wrong as to just getting this back to a civil and nonthreatening tone. If he had used that manner of conversing from the outset this whole exchange could have been avoided instead he assumes that the cause of all edits of <i>his</i> articles is vandalism and destruction of the articles. The amazing thing is the changes are picayune and harmless. How anyone could get so worked up about them is beyond me. One brand of protein is or isn't a top-seller one creatine formula is the only product shown to do such and such in studies. The way he responds with immediate threats and accusations is overboard and assumes motives I am alien to.<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 12:12, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just read through the Creatine talk page and it appears he also threatened to have another user banned (sic). I do not see him on the list of administrators. It appears he likes to intimidate editors with false claims citing his imaginery powers. This is not a productive way to discuss articles although if people believe it it ensure your changes are the accepted ones. Personally I have used Wikipedia since college and only recently started editing. I have seen very few actual administrators threaten to ban people and use intimidation on people so freely.

<p>You have to look through the history of my talk page and the edit histories of the two articles. Also the discussion pages of the two articles. There isn't much there that's the point. I don't see enough to warrant calling me a vandal and leaving me warnings on my userpage threatening to have me banned from various activities.<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 12:42, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>After looking at the pages in question, I don't think Yankees76 has acted unreasonably. He's removed unsourced statements from articles, discussed changes on talk pages, and applied standard boilerplate warnings to a user's talk page. Unless I'm missing something ghastly (in which case, as LtPowers said, diffs would be helpful), this seems like exactly the sort of content dispute that doesn't belong here. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 13:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you. I don't beleive I was acting unreasonable at all. The 'threats' are simply first-level warnings, and reminders only (boilerplate warnings). I've not created any of the pages in question (as claimed above), and I fully understand that no ownership of articles is granted to any editor. I've given no vandalism warnings to the user above either - only reminders about POV, providing an edit summary, and about removing legitimate warnings from his/her talk page (and a friendly reminder to check spelling). I've simply done the job of a Wikipedia editor in removing unsourced content, opinion, and edits that are of a non-neutral point of view or contain corporate bias. The language in the boilerplate warnings is beyond my control, and if the user takes offense to the wording, that's not my fault. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYankees76_f29c.html" title="User:Yankees76">Yankees76</a> 14:10, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zmanm407 also has a problem with fair use images on his user page; I've removed fair-use images twice, warning him each time, and I'm about to do so a third time. They're different images each time, so he seems to understand that the images I removed aren't appropriate, but fails to extrapolate that to future images he wants to put up. Orphanbot is also a regular visitor to his talk page.</p>
<p>So, assuming that it's inappropriate to move one's user page without a corresponding changed username, could I have an administrator move his user page back to <a href="../../../z/m/a/User%7EZmanm407_f1d4.html" title="User:Zmanm407">User:Zmanm407</a> (I can't move over the redirect myself)? Also, maybe this administrator could talk to him about his fair-use image usage?

<p>Hello. Is the person who previously edited under the name of KDRGibby still banned from wikipedia? I have noticed that this same person has made a return under the name of CosmopolitanCapitalist. He is easy to identify because he has the exact same tendentious editing style, dogmatism, intellectual laziness, and horrendous spelling that KDRGibby had; and of course, he's editing the same pages (participatory economics, classical liberalism, etc.), forcing the same lame arguments. Are you aware of this? And if you are, could you please update me on his status at wikipedia? Thanks! BernardL 16:51, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
