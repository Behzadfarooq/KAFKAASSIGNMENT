<p><i><b>Note:</b> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Primetime" class="extiw" title="wikt:User:Primetime">wikt:User:Primetime</a> came here as <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> after being blocked indefinitely from Wiktionary for persistent and flagrant copyright violations and sockpuppetry. He continued his antics here and was eventually banned by Jimbo Wales, but he still lurks through the use of sockpuppets and open proxies. For more details see <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELong_term_abuse_Primetime_39fa.html" title="Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Primetime">Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Primetime</a>.</i></p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Primetime" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:User:Primetime">Wiktionary:User:Primetime</a> (apparently corresponding to <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">User:Primetime</a> here) was indefinitely blocked this year on the English Wiktionary for <b>massive, systemic copyright violations.</b> His primary sources were <i>Webster's third new international dictionary, unabridged</i>, by Merriam-Webster, Inc. and <i>The Oxford Dictionary of English (2nd edition revised)</i> (using either the on-line edition or a CD-ROM version - the specific version remains unclear for a portion of his entries.)</p>
<p>The main Wiktionary discussion can be found here: <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:_Beer_parlour_archive/January-March_06#Primetime" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wiktionary:_Beer_parlour_archive/January-March_06">wikt:Wiktionary: Beer parlour archive/January-March_06#Primetime</a>. In his own defense, he relied on bizarre personal attacks, personal threats and repetitious flagrant lies (perhaps in the hope that repeating a certain lie over and over again would make it somehow become truth.)</p>
<p>For over a month now, he has used <b>many</b> sockpuppets on the English Wiktionary, confirmed by checkuser(!) request on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_CheckUser_information" class="extiw" title="meta:Requests_for_CheckUser_information">meta:</a>. <small>Only the most recent batch of sockpuppets is listed on the meta page.</small> He has become <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Main_Page">our</a> single most assiduous vandal, recently prompting an automated <b>block of some 6,000+ IP addresses</b> used by the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29.html" title="Tor (anonymity network)">Tor anonymity network</a>.</p>
<p>His signature vandalism patterns alternate between massive rudimentary copyright violations, and bombarding Wiktionary with massive quantites of unattested vulgar terminology.</p>
<p>His copyright-vandalism today on the English Wiktionary (via a new sockpuppet that he created some time ago, in preparation) was first traced to the Wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../j/_/_/J.html" title="J">J</a>, where has been steadily, incrementally adding content. It is apparent to me, that he is using a 'bot to upload material here on Wikipedia just as he used to on Wiktionary, as several tell-tale signs are in each of his entries. It is my personal theory that he is using 'bot technology to split apart his edits, so that no single edit triggers a VandalBot "copyright" warning on the anti-vandalism channels.</p>
<p>I hereby request assistance from <i><b>all</b></i> Wikipedia sysops in chasing down this prolific individual's copyright violations (here on Wikipedia, as well as on Wiktionary - as many entries on Wiktionary still have not been cleaned adequately.) I am somewhat unfamiliar with Wikipedia policies regarding copyright violation. But I cannot imagine that such systemic, wholesale copying is condoned here.</p>

<dd>Here is a bit of advice to anyone who reads this: check carefully everything Connel MacKenzie says. He has been known to exaggerate greatly at times. This is a very complex, personal dispute between him and I. Unfortunately, I do not possess the knowledge to use "bots". (And, what does this have to do with Wikipedia?) I don't know what you mean by "vandalism," either. I've had some <i>content</i> disputes with you. I admit I moved some material I wrote here to <i>Wiktionary,</i> all of which you apparently deleted on sight. The autoblocker blocked my IP for a short time, so I was able to get a new user name (something suggested to me by Tawker in a public discussion). I created about 5 vulgar entries on <i>Wiktionary</i> which Connel MacKenzie deleted on sight (even though <i>Wiktionary</i> is not censored--supposedly--and they all had citations). So, that's hardly the "massive quantites" you're describing. Really, this is not relevant to Wikipedia at all. The reason I remain blocked is very complex but can be boiled down to three factors: (1) personal attacks, (2) evading my block, and (3) alleged copyright violation. Now, Connel MacKenzie is going through everything I ever created on Wiktionary (I made about <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Primetime&amp;dbname=enwiktionary_p&amp;machread=1" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Primetime&amp;dbname=enwiktionary_p&amp;machread=1" rel="nofollow">1172 edits</a>) and reverting or deleting it on the unproven assumption that it's all copyvio material. Connel MacKenzie is a very bitter person. He's had more disputes on Wiktionary than any other user. Now he's the person who banned all of those accounts and he's the only one still complaining about me. The fact he is even bringing up such a matter here shows even greater malice on his part, in my opinion. If he were editing on Wikipedia, he would have been banned a while ago. However, there's no real formal dispute resolution process on Wiktionary, so he can just continue acting the way he does and no one can do anything about it.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 10:24, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find this dispute worrisome because it may have affected Wikpedia administration. I recently nominated "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">List of ethnic slurs</a>" for AfD, due chiefly for its apparent violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> [<i>not a slang dictionary</i>]. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> argued eloquently, effectively, and somewhat duplicitously (as I've said to him) against its transwikification to Wiktionary. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> had said that Wiktionary editors were intolerant, and would not accept the material. This report describes additional aspects to the matter. I don't know if the claim by Connel MacKenzie has merit or not, but Wiktionary is a sister project and we should work in a coordinated fashion. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 11:01, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please note that Primetime's indefinite block on Wiktionary was approved after a decision made by the community. It was not even issued by Connel MacKenzie <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3APrimetime" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3APrimetime" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Now Connel is indeed a very active contributor and sysop on Wiktionary, probably among our best (if there's such a thing as "the best" on a wiki), who's not afraid of discussion, some arguments in which he is a party indeed evolving into what one might arguably call a "dispute". That is, however, of no relevance here, and has more to do with the argumentative nature of the English Wiktionary. Primetime, though, has never conformed to the rules that apply to Wiktionary, and he and his host of sockpuppets have been banned from Wiktionary <b>by the community</b>, for the reasons given above by Connel. The majority of his former contributions have either been deleted (by a variety of sysops, not just Connel), or rephrased in order to eliminate the copyright violations originally entered by Primetime. New admissions from his part, once they have been identified as being Primetime's, are being deleted on sight (by a variety of sysops, not just Connel or me) due to his long-standing tradition of <b>proven</b> copyright violations. <a href="../../../v/i/l/User%7EVildricianus_d2b0.html" title="User:Vildricianus">Vildricianus</a> 18:56, 8 May 2006 (UTC) (Wiktionary sysop).</dd>

<dd>First, there was a discussion where the editors participating came upon agreement that my most-recent creations, created on three nights in March and January would be deleted. (See <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:_Beer_parlour_archive/January-March_06#Primetime" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wiktionary:_Beer_parlour_archive/January-March_06">wikt:Wiktionary: Beer parlour archive/January-March_06#Primetime</a>). Further, my most-recent contributions were already trying to be deleted or had already been deleted when some discovered that they were from me. Others no one ever found out were from me were deleted as well. Further, those didn't look anything like the single-phrase definitions they were complaining about for copyvios. When Connel MacKenzie did a checkuser on some accounts, he immediately deleted the remainder. He never did a checkuser on the accounts he blocked last night, though. Here's an explanation of why they were already trying to delete them:
<p>Some editors have interpreted Wiktionary's <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/criteria_for_inclusion" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:criteria_for_inclusion">criteria for inclusion</a> as meaning that a single reliable source is enough to prove a word's usage. Others, however, say that only three quotations will suffice, despite the fact that the page states that "Usage in a well-known work" qualifies as proof. These same editors claim that other dictionaries do not count. To many Wikipedia users accustomed to citing disputed assertions with a single source, having to give three sources is upsetting and unwelcoming. Many entries have been deleted because they had only one or two sources.</p>
<p>Knowing the anarchic atmosphere of Wiktionary and the propensity of certain administrators to use these unusually-high standards to delete offensive terms, I created six entries with three quotes per sense and with full source information for each quote. (See <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/WT:RFD#nigger_baby" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:WT:RFD">Wiktionary:WT:RFD#nigger_baby</a>.) Then a user named Jonathan Webley nominated each of them for deletion saying "I can't find these terms anywhere else". Shortly afterward, Connel MacKenzie chimed in saying "This series of anonymous submissions seems intentionally disruptive, and pointlessly inflammatory. <b>Delete all.</b> These are certainly no more than the sum of their parts (each submission) with a clear intent to enter as many forms as can be dredged up, and to bypass the comparatively neutral, explanatory entry at <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>." Then, another administrator deleted them and protected the pages. His assertion that they were the sum of their parts is an example of an exaggeration by MacKenzie as "Blue-eyed grass (genus <i>Sisyrinchium</i>), especially California blue-eyed grass, S. bellum" was not the sum of the phrase "nigger baby". Another example is this: <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/WT:RFV#shit_stabber" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:WT:RFV">wiktionary:WT:RFV#shit_stabber</a>. I had three quotes and a dictionary reference for that one. Here's another one: <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/WT:RFV#give_me_fin_on_the_soul_side" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:WT:RFV">Wiktionary:WT:RFV#give me fin on the soul side</a>. Editors there have a tendency to delete terms they don't like on sight (See <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Free+State+border%21" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Free+State+border%21" rel="nofollow">this entry</a> that had a reference to a slang dictionary, but was deleted anyway the first time. When I recreated it, he nominated it for verification, then deleted it again when he found out it was from me.) As for "give me fin on the soul side" I had two quotes and a dictionary citation. They deleted it anyway, but I had it saved on my hard drive, so I recreated it. Then, they said two quotes and a dictionary references weren't enough, so I added more, for <b>3 quotes</b> and <b>5 citations.</b> Connel still wanted to delete it anyway, which shows his deceptive and bitter nature.</p>
<p>As everyone can tell, Vildicranius is good friends with Connel MacKenzie--even though Vildicranius is pretty new. However, Connel MacKenzie has been known to harass other users. On the Beer Parlour (their equivalent of the Village Pump) he had at least three discussion threads raised against him by Ncik: <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Beer_parlour_archive/January-March_06#A_further_complaint.2C_unrelated_to_the_one_above.2C_against_Connel" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:Beer_parlour_archive/January-March_06">wrap link</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Beer_parlour_archive/January-March_06#Complaint_against_Connel" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:Beer_parlour_archive/January-March_06">wrap link2</a> even though I had been there only since November. He went after Ncik, who he chased away apparently, Eclecticology, then me. I'm sure there were others, though.</p>
<p>In conlcusion, I'm a financial donor to Wikimedia, so if I believed that something would harm our wikis, I wouldn't do it. On Wikipedia, I fight vandalism (I have over 830 pages on my watchlist) and try to be civil. I've worked countless hours, and have <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Primetime&amp;dbname=enwiki_p&amp;machread=1" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Primetime&amp;dbname=enwiki_p&amp;machread=1" rel="nofollow">3759 edits</a> on Wikipedia under this user name as well as 366 under others. I tend to use <b>Show preview</b> and focus on articles, so the tally doesn't tell much, either. However, on Wiktionary, it's harder to get along. Many Wikipedia policies, such as the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_Revert_Rule_04de.html" title="Wikipedia:Three Revert Rule">Three Revert Rule</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">No Personal Attacks</a> are not policies on Wiktionary. To some users from Wikipedia, this makes the site seem like it is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anarchic" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:anarchic">anarchic</a>, and makes many administrator decisions seem arbitrary, as well. Everyone knows each other, so you either become good friends or <i>really bad</i> enemies.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 20:06, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

My guess is Britannica, but I have a friend who owns a copy, so I"ve asked him to check. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 20:41, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds good. You can also search the introductions for each entry for free online. As you can see here: &lt;http://www.britannica.com/search?query=John+Abbey&amp;ct=&gt;, there is no entry. As for formatting, I hate Wikipedia formatting because it is not in keeping with style recommendations of writers. For example, above, I did not give the link as <a href="http://www.britannica.com/search?query=John+Abbey&amp;ct=" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/search?query=John+Abbey&amp;ct=" rel="nofollow">this</a> because I think it looks unintuitive and doesn't tell the reader where they're going.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 20:47, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is another debate, but I tend to follow styling guidelines of style manuals like <i>Merriam-Webster's Manual for Writer's and Editors</i> as well as Random-House's style guide. I also imitate for experimentation purposes several innovations, like enlarging the headword a point or two. I have had several disagreements and have explained myself in detail on why I don't always follow Wikipedia guidelines.

Although his death on the battlefield in World War I put an abrupt end to an all-too-brief six-year period of intensive literary productivity, Sorge, who was only twenty-four years old at the time of his death, achieved recognition as one of Germany's foremost religious playwrights and poets, one whose poetic mission was inspired by his fervent quest for God and by an ecstatic mystical faith. Sorge's protagonists are either projections of his own self into a dramatic character who combines the role of the writer as leader and healer with that of the prophet and seeker of God's truth, or personal interpretations of key figures in the history of Christianity such as King David, Saint Francis of Assisi, and Martin Luther.

There is never a good reason to make legal threats and no amount of positive contribution off-sets that, especially when coupled with the fact that they continue to make personal attacks against users who disagree with them. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 01:14, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure I have any right posting here, as I'm not an admin, but I thought I'd point out that CK9^5 does have an unfortunate history of ignoring consensus -- the long list of musical artists on his page was fallout from a somewhat nasty debate on <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classic_rock.html" title="Classic rock">classic rock</a> over who should be considered to be on a list of classic rock artists, and whether such a list was even necessary in the first place (the list was ultimately removed as unnecessary, and would probably be removed again as hopelessly POV if it was ever added back in); his general attitude through the entire incident was that those who disagreed with his classifications (which stretched the definition of "classic rock" into utter meaninglessness, in my opinion) should just leave the article alone. CK9^5's labyrinth of counterfactual subpages (which IMHO is more appropriate for GeoCities than Wikipedia, but I didn't make the rules) is evidence of someone unwilling to concede to consensus under any circumstances. I don't think CK9^5 is a malicious user, but he is definitely unwilling to accept differences of opinion.

<p>I'd like to speak, as someone CK#9999 has repeatedly accused of all sorts of wrongdoing, as well as the subject of the frivilous RFC above.</p>
<p>CK makes good edits, and I feel that, with the proper mentoring from an experienced user, can get past the paranoia and obnoxiousness. I also feel that punitive measures would be counterproductive (and I would certainly be the wrong one to be implementing them).</p>
<p>Failing that, I oppose, for the reasons above, any punitive measure that isn't in specific response to a specific issue (a particular revert war, a particular spurious accusation, etc.) Let's not turn AN into a Quickpoll-style witch burning. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 01:24, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This isn't kindergarten. We expect to a certain degree that people behave maturely and act like adults. While I'm all for letting someone make a mistake or two and improve upon it, the pattern of behaviour I see here isn't one of someone who's interested in bettering themselves and participating in a meaningful way in a community. Someone who acts inappropriately or makes mistakes and is genuinely interested in growing with the community and contributingly positively will seek that out when it becomes apparent that they're not going about things the right way. They've shown a clear disregard for the community and those in it. They seem more interested in slandering people and making threats to push their opinion than realize there is probably a better way to go about it. Does that mean we cut people off on the first mistake they make? no. Do we coddle someone endlessly on the hopes they turn around? No. I've been in communities where they've tried to do that with trouble makers and it turns into a gong show. I say give them a week or two to cool their heels, make it very clear their continued behaviour won't be tolerated and put them on probation when they return. If they can behave properly, so be it, but ensure its very clear whats expected of them if they're to continue as such here, but letting them get away with the behaviour they've exhibited unpunished is ridiculous. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 02:50, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I feel I must add something recently stated by this user that is most troubling. Visit <a href="../../../a/m/n/User_talk%7EAmnewsboy_2866.html" title="User talk:Amnewsboy">User talk:Amnewsboy</a> in the AETN section. Mr. Kat has basically stated that if something he makes up makes sense to him, it is "not speculation."</p>
<p>First of all, this throws into question every single "Callsign meaning" on every local TV station page (and really, they should be deleted, because the only ones that are clearly true are... well, obvious, like WTWO referring to channel 2)... but mainly, this is a dangerous position for a WikiEditor to take - just because something makes sense to him, it should be taken as fact?

<p>"Third rate-liar" is a personal attack and any editor (admin or not) would be in the right to place an NPA warning on the talk page of the issuant. <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolywarrior_ee67.html" title="User:Holywarrior">User:Holywarrior</a>'s user page is also inappropriate in my opinion by listing diffs with spurious added commentary by him (e.g. "CVU deletion trial" as opposed to an MfD that failed) and ("Admin who tried to bully me"). The entire commentary above is suggestive of trolling.

<p>There's a bigger problem here: The editors behind RJII were being <b>paid</b> to engage in POV-pushing on wikipedia 24/7, and they managed to slip by the checks and balances currently in place. They have fooled the wikipedia community for a year and a half. By any measure, this is a collossal blunder on our part.

<dd>Not as bad as you think, the account of the users in question would probably not have lasted much longer. Furthermore, anything too egregious is likely to just get diluted in the normal process of editing. Besides, how many articles of the million or so we have can they really have hoped to have "fixed up". Honestly, a more interesting statistic would be how long before their contribution is effectively reduced to nil. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 22:40, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I should say that I have to be <b>sure</b> that it's a hoax before I consider it vandalism. When a kiddie writes an article saying that "Bobby won the Grand Prix at Monaco in 2007 and thats real good for a ten yearold," I put it into the same category as a vandal. Indeed, the clever hoaxes are harder, but they also demonstrate more of a desire to deceive and are, therefore, worse. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:16, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd agree with the above. If an article is entirely one obvious hoax, it can be speedied as silly vandalism; and if a user constantly adds hoaxes, then they can be reported, warned, and (if necessary) blocked as a vandal. And if you're ever having trouble figuring out what to do with an article that obviously should be deleted, remember {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}; it's quick and easy, and five days of just sitting there generally isn't going to do too much damage. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 00:30, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Administrator(s): I, like you, am an editor; I create articles and make edits. But, many, I am sure many other people out there, are tired, frustrated and angry with the behavior of many Administrators. I am certain that it is appallingly easy to revert and article, that someone has undoubtedly spent allot of time and effort writing. I have, in the past spent hours, researching, planning, writing, checking and revising an addition to an article only to have the whole lot deleted forever three minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>I know that deletion of material is essential in a free-to-edit encyclopedia, but if you see an article that someone has anonymously devoted their time to writing, why could you not revise it, change it or give a reason for you action? They deserve one.</p>
<p>I know all Administrators are not all Drunk-With-Power-Trigger-Happy-Nazis, many of you do an excellent job and you know who you are.</p>
<p>In closing: Create, don’t Destroy. Make a distinction between “what is right, and what is easy”. Be enriched and enrich others with the knowledge of other people.</p>

<p>Similar to the complaint <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#User:CrnaGora" title="WP:AN">above</a>, I have another thing to report. User CrnaGora is constantly harrasing me and attacking me personally. He has called me many offensive words in Serbian and English, like "kurva" which means "whore" (<a href="http://www.krstarica.com/recnik/srpsko-engleski/index.php?u=kurva" class="external text" title="http://www.krstarica.com/recnik/srpsko-engleski/index.php?u=kurva" rel="nofollow">proof</a>), "you damn Serb", "budala" which is something like "numskull" (<a href="http://www.krstarica.com/recnik/srpsko-engleski/index.php?u=budala" class="external text" title="http://www.krstarica.com/recnik/srpsko-engleski/index.php?u=budala" rel="nofollow">proof</a>), "I spit on you", "Are you that stupid...", and the list goes on. I have politely asked him to stop contacting me, because I do not want conflict with him, I just want to be left alone, but he keeps leaving me messages, personal attacks and provocations. He even admitted that he has "anger issues on Wikipedia". All of the quotes can be found on my and his talk pages. He has been warned before, several times, I leave it to you, the admins, to decide what to do with him. --<a href="../../../g/r/b/Image%7EGrbSrbije.PNG_69d8.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/ea/GrbSrbije.PNG/26px-GrbSrbije.PNG" alt="" width="26" height="31" longdesc="../../../g/r/b/Image%7EGrbSrbije.PNG_69d8.html" /></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>serbiana</b></font></a> <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia"><b>-</b></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>talk</b></font></a> 01:57, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

What I do know however is that Boris blocked him on the Serbian Wikipedia <a href="http://sr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%BD%D0%BE:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA:Crna_Gora" class="external autonumber" title="http://sr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%BD%D0%BE:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA:Crna_Gora" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, under the same pretext as here, and as far as I know, such a thing would be viewed as an unacceptable abuse of admin privileges at enwiki.

<dd>This has little to do with Serbian Wikipedia. I blocked him for persistent personal attacks there, and here he continued the personal attacks. Since the rules of sr wiki don't allow personal attacks (and I'm hoping there are such rules on en wiki as well), he was blocked. Here, he continued making personal attacks, by calling me stupid, a numskull and confirming that he spits on me, and not just Serbs. I didn't think there would be a need to provide diffs since the entire conversation can be found on my talk page, as well as his (which I noted above). Now, he HAS personally attacked people before, there was a similar complaint a few days ago, and a little warning block wouldn't hurt, it would give him the time to calm down, after all, he did admit to having "anger issues on Wikipedia". --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>serbiana</b></font></a> <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia"><b>-</b></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>talk</b></font></a> 00:09, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Blocking is fine, but telling people to fuck off is uncalled-for, and a violation of NPA. It's unnecessarily confrontational, and if you're an admin you should really know better. When you've got The Button, you need to set a good example because all the new users are going to take their cues from you. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 13:28, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I won't comment on the block, as it's probably deserved, more in civility. Most importantly, calling someone a troll is now the most common form of trolling.

<dd>Once again, a perfectly good report of admin action by Tony Sidaway turns into a Tony-bashing session. For the record, I support the ban. Prometheuspan has made less than 40 main article edits, almost all on his first day of editing. Since then he has done nothing but troll in article talk, user talk, and wikipedia talk spaces. It is my belief that the account is a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalking_horse.html" title="Stalking horse">stalking horse</a> for someone else; certainly this account, whoever is operating it, has no useful contributions and a net negative effect. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 12:27, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As you may notice Thatcher, not many people here are "bashing" Tony's ban, but instead are commenting on how "fuck off" and "this user is stupid" is grossely inappropriate. For the record, if it was any other user, they would have gotten a block, and you can't deny that. How can you possibly defend one's use of "fuck off". If he can do that without a block, you can expect many other users to use this as an example of being able to get away with attacking someone. <a href="../../../c/h/c/User%7EChcknwnm_ed3c.html" title="User:Chcknwnm"><b>Ch</b></a><a href="../../../c/h/c/User%7EChcknwnm_Esperanza_5bfc.html" title="User:Chcknwnm/Esperanza"><font color="green">u</font></a><a href="../../../c/h/c/User_talk%7EChcknwnm_2217.html" title="User talk:Chcknwnm"><b>ck</b></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chcknwnm_387f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chcknwnm">(contrib)</a></sup> 16:57, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To which AMIB has stated that he won't do anything admin-like because he's involved in the situation. To me that doesn't count as admin-input. I'm also looking and I don't see a comment from Radiokirk up there. I also don't see any comments by Radiokirk on their talk page, nor any comment on the RFC from radiokirk either. and if you knwo where this archived comment is, maybe you can link to it. I find no mention in the last two archives, and if its that old, we need new input on the new issues that have occured. The fact of the matter is since a legal threat and a torrent of personal attacks, the only admin to stop by has said "I'm involved in it and can't do anything with it"--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:21, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

It's so easy to get confused when there are quite a few. As far a AMIB, he <i>did</i> say more than that: he said he felt this user could be salvaged, and someone else said "this isn't kindergarten".

<dd>I said it wasn't kindergarten, which this isn't. I was making a point that when users behave poorly beyond a certain point and show no indication of actually changing their ways, there is no point in coddling them because it damages the community. I didn't feel AMIB was making any kind of admin decision with that statement because he'd already indicated he wasn't going to do so, I felt he was only giving his opinion on a possible course of action. The fact of the matter is the user made legal threats, and personally attacked several users and we haven't heard boo from an admin who can actually do something here. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 22:25, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He accused 9 people of being sock puppets on the Pokemon AFD and went so far as to put sock puppet tags on two of their user pages. The legal threat has only been sitting for a month because no one has bothered to address it. And if you bothered: <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECoolKatt_number_99999_307b.html#Sockpuppetry" title="User talk:CoolKatt number 99999">User_talk:CoolKatt_number_99999#Sockpuppetry</a> You would see after he made that apology, I went to his page and reached out to him explaining what would be seen as a turn around in this case. He's not done that, he's apologized to no one else that I've seen, and he went and tossed an AFD link on his RFC, which again indicates that he's not interested in being reached out to. I was only explaining to rollosmokes that I wasn't going to simply drop it because he gave a half-hearted apology. I stated there hasn't been a shred of input by admin. AMIB said hes' not assuming an admin role in this, so as I stated, his input is not from an admin. No other admin has bothered to try and deal with this. I was never uncivil to him. I had never even spoken with him until I logged on and found the sockpuppet tag on my user page. So no, his behaviour isn't appropriate he's shown no interest in changing it, and I see no reason he shouldn't be banned for his behaviour. He's responsible for his own actions, regardless of how others treated him. I put an article up for AFD and was personally attacked numerous times, called several things and hounded for asking an honest question on the article prior to putting it up for deletion. Did I lash out at anyone? no. I discussed situations like an adult. i expect no less of the other people here. If he can't do that, I see no reason to be lenient. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 23:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well its not just the half-hearted apology. Its the continued behaviour on his part after the personal attacks launched against myself and others. This is what I meant about how certain people are more trouble than worth. I've seen it in other communities, and I can see it snowballing here. Users have to want to help themselves when the community reaches out, and if they're not, there is nothing you can do. He'd have to be blind not to realize that what he's doing is not working here, but he's shown no indication he's interested in changing his behaviour and only continues the downward spiral unfettered even when reached out to. To me its not so much the initial behaviour, its the reaction to that behaviour. Did he learn from it and try to better himself? no. He just continually lashes out at everyone who disagrees with him and continues to do so. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 04:38, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

I feel I must add something recently stated by this user that is most troubling. Visit <a href="../../../a/m/n/User_talk%7EAmnewsboy_2866.html" title="User talk:Amnewsboy">User talk:Amnewsboy</a> in the AETN section. Mr. Kat has basically stated that if something he makes up makes sense to him, it is "not speculation."</p>
<p>First of all, this throws into question every single "Callsign meaning" on every local TV station page (and really, they should be deleted, because the only ones that are clearly true are... well, obvious, like WTWO referring to channel 2)... but mainly, this is a dangerous position for a WikiEditor to take - just because something makes sense to him, it should be taken as fact? No. No. No. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambertman_d36c.html" title="User:Lambertman">Lambertman</a> 14:37, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And to expand on that "callsign meaning" point, Lambertman, he assumes every "W" in a callsign means "We're". (here's a prime example: User:CoolKatt number 99999/Callsigns) That is simply false and not true. If the admins could take some intervention here, it would be really nice. <a href="../../../c/f/i/User%7ECFIF_93dc.html" title="User:CFIF">CFIF</a> <a href="../../../c/f/i/User_talk%7ECFIF_fe0f.html" title="User talk:CFIF">(talk to me)</a> 15:33, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And looking at those worthless and unneeded subpages, it brings me back where he assumed a station would become <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Network_TV_a0f6.html" title="My Network TV">My Network TV</a> just because they were sister station to a Fox affiliate, which was completely false <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WBPG&amp;diff=46411117&amp;oldid=40505335" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WBPG&amp;diff=46411117&amp;oldid=40505335" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. --<a href="../../../c/f/i/User%7ECFIF_93dc.html" title="User:CFIF">CFIF</a> <a href="../../../c/f/i/User_talk%7ECFIF_fe0f.html" title="User talk:CFIF">(talk to me)</a> 15:36, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is it absolutely clear that the user is actually the designer? Even if they are, they may be nevertheless behaving responsibly.

<dd>Just to be pedantic "licenses it as fair use" is contradictory. Fair use images are images which aren't licensed for us to use. The fair use doctrine allows use without a license in certain circumstances (and our own rules restrict us a bit further). When you say "created" by the uploader, do you mean he did the physical scanning or he composed the artwork in it's original form and retains copyright to it? I would guess it not be the latter in which case he isn't the creator and so can't license it to us, so fair use is probably the best we can do anyway. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 18:38, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>wait, if I publish a CD and upload my own CD cover as a fair use image, it will be deleted, but if I have my little sister upload it, it will be kept?

<dd>There is a good chance you won't own the copyright on the CD cover anyway... But in principle yes, cd covers are a pretty odd example in that they are one of few items where there isn't an alternative but to use a fair use image. Most other images we should be using a free image if one is available, and allowing creators to not license but "allow fair use", detracts from our goal of using free images wherever possible. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 19:02, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think the right action is actually to change the tag to {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}}. If they own the copyright, by uploading they agreed to license under GFDL. This is no different from the "your contribution will be GFDL" notice for text. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 03:26, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But the user isn't claim to own the copyright, but merely to be the author of the work. It appears that the user is the author of the cover, but does not own copyright, yet is asserting that Wikipedia can make use of it under fair use provisions. That sounds reasonable to me. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 03:59, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>The artwork is for an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_%28band%29.html" title="Electronic (band)">Electronic</a> single, and the designer was <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Saville_8719.html" title="Peter Saville">Peter Saville</a> <a href="http://www.worldinmotion.net/electronic/discography/singles/1989/GettingAwayWithItSleeveTapeUK.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldinmotion.net/electronic/discography/singles/1989/GettingAwayWithItSleeveTapeUK.jpg" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, so the user is <i>not</i> the author of the cover (it's further complicated by the fact that Saville used a credited image from a photographic library, rather than original artwork). I think what we have here is a reasonably common confusion, with someone thinking that if they scan or photograph someone else's artwork, they somehow are the "author" in copyright terms of the image they have made. It's currently tagged as fair use, which is right. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 19:31, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

If I'm interpreting policy correctly, an image with a valid fair-use defense uploaded without any permission from the copyright holder will be kept; but the same image, with the same fair-use defense, uploaded by the copyright holder <i>with permission for use in Wikipedia</i> will be deleted on sight as having a non-free license. I have to say, I don't understand the reasoning behind this at all; if the goal of the policy is to ensure that Wikipedia stays as free as possible, surely it makes sense to keep images used <i>with</i> permission over those <i>without</i> permission, all else being equal? —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Wahler_7353.html" title="User:David Wahler">David Wahler</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Wahler_3570.html" title="User talk:David Wahler"><small>(talk)</small></a> 01:39, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>SuperSTO's (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperSTO_a2a6.html" title="User talk:SuperSTO">talk</a>) <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SuperSTO_511a.html" title="Special:Contributions/SuperSTO">edits</a> (see also deleted contributions), with few exceptions, have fallen into two categories:</p>
<p>A) Promoting his website Chao Universe; the article has been twice deleted - <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chao_Universe_9361.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chao Universe">once by AFD</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Chao_Universe" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Chao_Universe" rel="nofollow">a second time speedied as recreation of deleted material</a>. He has also spammed the link in a few articles.</p>
<p>B) Vandalising articles on <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skulltag.html" title="Skulltag">Skulltag</a> or creating articles on it's creator, Brad Carney. Often this is just simple vandalism. Other times, it is the insertion of claims regarding users of skulltag being "hacked" (see edits to skulltag from May 28 and prior). Admins should see the contents of some of his deleted articles for more. This user has claimed that they are trying to warn people about the danger of skulltag, and should be allowed to make those claims under free speech. The user has been asked numerous times to provide a source. Thus far, the only source this user has provided was the name of an AIM user "Marcus101RR". A little searching I did on the Skulltag forums shows that some individual called Marcus has some sort of vendetta against skulltag. Granted that was about a month ago, and I forgot about the details. In fact, it was only just now when I saw the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skulltag&amp;diff=60915781&amp;oldid=60914289" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skulltag&amp;diff=60915781&amp;oldid=60914289" rel="nofollow">summary of this edit</a> that was reverting vandalism in the skulltag article (I will contact that user for more info), and re-read SuperSTO's message regarding the AIM user that I even payed attention to the Marcus in the name. This confirms to my mind that this AIM user is SuperSTO himself.</p>
<p>Judging from SuperSTO's comments, it seems he believes the article on his website was deleted simply for advertising a website, and that is therefor grounds for the Skulltag article to be deleted (Talk:Skulltag), as (to paraphrase) "all articles should be treated the same" and we are very obviously "hosting/advertising Skulltag". This user has ignored the reasons I gave them for their article being deleted. Yet he has not once tried to submit it to AFD (instead he blanks the article). Today when I opened my watchlist, I checked the edit history of Skulltag to see that it had been repeatedly vandalised by three different IPs, one in particular replacing the content with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skulltag&amp;diff=60910436&amp;oldid=60408284" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skulltag&amp;diff=60910436&amp;oldid=60408284" rel="nofollow">"Advertisement Removed - Treat Members FAIRLY!"</a>, another with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skulltag&amp;diff=60922461&amp;oldid=60922130" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skulltag&amp;diff=60922461&amp;oldid=60922130" rel="nofollow">"NO ADVERTISEMENT! TREAT ALL MEMBERS FAIR! OR DON\"T HOST SKULLTAG!"</a>. It is my belief that SuperSTO/Marcus (especially in light of this <a href="http://www.skulltag.com/forum/impse.php?t=4222&amp;highlight=marcus" class="external text" title="http://www.skulltag.com/forum/impse.php?t=4222&amp;highlight=marcus" rel="nofollow">Skulltag forum topic</a>) recruited some others to attack the page. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.92.160.125_1876.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.92.160.125">One IP</a> has previously attacked the page, and I believe it to be SuperSTO, as the first attack by this IP user was a few days ago, and they have previously added an external link to Chao Universe to other pages.</p>
<p>It is my suggestion that SuperSTO and the IP he uses (can someone checkuser it to be sure?) be blocked for a period deemed warranted.--<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrat_53ce.html" title="User:Drat">Drat</a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/r/a/User_talk%7EDrat_c90f.html" title="User talk:Drat">Talk</a>)</small> 05:17, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, let me say that there should not be any doubt that SuperSTO is Marcus, and that I believe that one of the random IPs, 24.92.160.125 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.92.160.125.html" title="User talk:24.92.160.125">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.92.160.125_1876.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.92.160.125">contribs</a>), is also him. Some incidents I observed to believe this are:</dd>

<li>A quick look at SuperSTO's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=SuperSTO" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=SuperSTO" rel="nofollow">contributions page</a> shows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Sandbox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50300109" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Sandbox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50300109" rel="nofollow">an edit</a> to the Sandbox that describes a Marcus Koller founding Chao Universe, the page which was deleted. In the Skulltag thread Drat linked to about Marcus, the website URL <a href="http://h1.ripway.com/ChaoUniverse2/index.html" class="external free" title="http://h1.ripway.com/ChaoUniverse2/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://h1.ripway.com/ChaoUniverse2/index.html</a> is linked, which appears to have been terminated (this link was also posted by SuperSTO <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skulltag&amp;diff=60264048&amp;oldid=60056165" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skulltag&amp;diff=60264048&amp;oldid=60056165" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As for 24.92.160.125, the IP edited the <a href="../../../z/d/o/ZDoom_ff69.html" title="ZDoom">ZDoom</a> page to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ZDoom&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60910810" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ZDoom&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60910810" rel="nofollow">add a link</a> which was <a href="http://forum.zdoom.org/potato.php?p=223512#223512" class="external text" title="http://forum.zdoom.org/potato.php?p=223512#223512" rel="nofollow">also posted</a> by a user named Marcus on the ZDoom Forums. It was actually the second one he had added - the first was removed from the forum thread due to being potentially illegal. The exact same IP also demonstrated <a href="http://doom.wikia.com/index.php?title=Brad_%22Carnevil%22_Carney&amp;diff=20643&amp;oldid=19987" class="external text" title="http://doom.wikia.com/index.php?title=Brad_%22Carnevil%22_Carney&amp;diff=20643&amp;oldid=19987" rel="nofollow">a edit</a> at the Doom Wiki on an article about the creator of the port. It is similar to that of SuperSTO's behavior and occurred more than two months ago.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Truthfully, I do not have any evidence that either the anon I reverted or the other two IP's that vandalized the article were actually Marcus. If not, there is a good chance they were forum members recruited by him, as Drat suggested (especially after seeing <a href="http://z7.invisionfree.com/Chao_Universe/index.php?showtopic=165" class="external text" title="http://z7.invisionfree.com/Chao_Universe/index.php?showtopic=165" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> on his forum).</dd>

<dd>As Drat, I feel that SuperSTO should be blocked as it appears he has simply come here to spam his website and deface Skulltag, not to help out the encyclopedia in any way. <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomRem_acbf.html" title="User:DomRem"><font color="red">Dom</font><font color="#FF9900">Rem</font></a> | <small><a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDomRem_0186.html" title="User talk:DomRem">Yeah?</a></small> 06:37, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I seem to be running into an increasing amount of IP blocks that extend beyond 31 hours...and these are cases where there is 0 evidence that the IP is static, i.e. that it's the same user as before. Most IPs are NOT static, which means that if you block them for longer than 31 hours (sometimes less), you are going to cause collateral damage. So please be more careful folks. <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_IPs_56d5.html" title="User:Woohookitty/IPs">Here</a> is a short writeup I did on the difference between the 3 types of IPs.

<dd>I'm not sure we should assume IPs are dynamic unless proven otherwise. With the obvious exception of AOL, most IPs are at least semi-static. I have an ostensively dynamic IP address here with Shaw but it changes less than once a year. The majority of providers in Canada work the same way. Is this not the case elsewhere?

<p><a href="../../../b/k/e/User%7EBkell_6f8f.html" title="User:Bkell">Bkell</a> has recently taken it upon himself to tag a large portion of <a href="../../../f/o/t/Category%7EFOTW_images_1348.html" title="Category:FOTW images">Category:FOTW images</a> for speedy deletion under CSD:I3. Most of these can probably qualify under fair use (at the very least), and many of them are probably {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-flag_ce83.html" title="Template:PD-flag">PD-flag</a>}} or uncopyrightable as faithful reproductions of public domain material. However, I do not have time to deal with this right now so I am passing it off onto someone who can. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 12:23, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I tagged most of the images in the category with the template {{<a href="../../../f/o/t/Template%7EFOTWpic_2c2b.html" title="Template:FOTWpic">FOTWpic</a>}}, however the systematic deletion of this scale should be stopped or slowed down for now. I tagged some of those images too in that category with a redundant type tag, so some will be on their way for speedy deletion and some will have to sit on the servers for a while before we will sort this out. And as an editor and member of FOTW, I am partially responsible for this, so I encourage Bkell and others to talk to me.</dd>
<dd>As for the PD-flag template, that template has been redirected into a general fair use template for flags by me. Some flags are PD by law, such as national flags, but some others have copyrights to them. Some nations, like Germany and the US, attach a "creativity" element for copyrights while some nations, like the UK, might have tougher standards. This is a debate that is currently going on right now, but most of the flags in that category will be replaced by me or others under a free license, so I hopefully believe this issue could become moot once we get the SVG flags drawn. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 01:17, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since I am not confident with copyright law I thought I would queation this here. The image used in <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereign_Hill_8dcd.html" title="Sovereign Hill">Sovereign Hill</a> is tagged as promotional material (which it is - I found the source). The tag states that a copyrighted image such as this may be used to illustrate the product in question when a free alternitive is not availiable.

I feel like I am hounding this user - I have recently pulled them up a number of times for blanking pages, inserting links to their own page into articles where they did little to illustrate the subject matter and because I nominated an article created by them for deletion. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:43, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps not so much "qualified" as "coherent enough", especially in rendering an informed opinion about license incompatibility, lost editing histories, the morality of plagiarism, yada yada, things which I'm still a bit unclear on.

<dd>Creative Commons is a group of licenses some of which are not "free", such as the non commercial ones and we certainly could not copy one that does not allow derivative works as an article. Copying an article in that is a "sharealike" would also have problems. The best we could do would be have the article as whatever license the sharealike one was, and have all changes to is licensed under the GFDL. Mixing licenses is not really worth the hassle though. The only CC license that is remotely compatible is cc-by, and that is only one way (cc-by -&gt; gfdl), and only upon making a derivative work (we cannot distrubute the original as gfdl).

<p>Hi everyone. Today <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">User:SPUI</a> was blocked based on claims that he had created a user page subpage that some users claim crashes their browsers (seems he can't keep out of trouble). The page contents had already been removed. The initial block was indefinite, but was then modified by <s>another</s> the same admin to one week. It'd be helpful if some of you could review this blocking, or move this comment to an appropriate forum to get some wider discussion around the action. Thanks. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 20:16, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seems to be a blocking made under the terms of SPUI's probation. The page in question doesn't exactly crash browsers, but it was obviously created for the purpose of provocation, and SPUI has experimented (albeit in userspace) with transcluding it. SPUI can be blocked for up to one week for provocative edits, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SPUI&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60625902" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SPUI&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60625902" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SPUI&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60625902</a> this and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SPUI/jajaja&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60625250" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SPUI/jajaja&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60625250" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SPUI/jajaja&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60625250</a> this (beware of potentially odd browser behavior in both of those) are certainly provocative. Thus it's the blocking admin's call, and I decline to tread on his toes on that score where an Arbitration Committee-imposed limitation on editing is involved. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 23:06, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>So I get warned for one piece of vandalism, and I was pretty annoyed, so I responded with the words "fuck off". (This in retrospect was a bad idea, my apologies).</p>
<p>However, I then get this "test 4" vandalism warning for my "personal attack". I found this strange as I had read the policy at <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a> after been linked to it, and it says clearly under the <b>"What vandalism is not"</b> section that "Harassing or Making Personal Attacks" are not vandalism. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:VAND#What_vandalism_is_not" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:VAND#What_vandalism_is_not" rel="nofollow">[31]</a></p>
<p>Once again, I was pretty irritated. So I made my points on the issue. KungFu decided it would be appropriate to censor me though by "protecting" my talk page and not explaining how getting angry and insulting people is vandalism, despite it saying otherwise in your policy.</p>
<p>His talk page is also protected and the only place I could find to get some rationale seems to be here (I hope).</p>
<p>My apologies for my personal attack, but how can people possibly learn if you have administrators and webmasters going around warning people for breaking the wrong policies, then seemingly ignoring the points raised and censoring them instead? 172.212.30.51</p>

<p>I am not sure what should be done about this category. Its painfully backlogged, and its usefulness is limited, not to mention that it can be very tedious to do. I've made script to speed up the process, but that still is not enough; either this category sits there or a large number of admins work on it. Maybe it can just be a page to show images also available on commons, rather than a page of things that <i>have to be moved/deleted</i>.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 21:45, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know what you mean by "just a page...", but I wouldn't worry about the backlog. It is a very low-priority admin job. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 21:59, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What I meant was, treating it as a category that sorts images by availability on Commons and no more, rather than a huge pending admin task.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 22:06, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What's so bad about the backlog tag? Sure, it is quite low priority, but someone has to do it, whatever priority it is.

<dd>OK, keep working at a bit each day. Dmcdevit really did alot of work the other day (and that was before i finished the script). At <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_Specialadmin_monobook.js_d536.html" title="User:Voice of All/Specialadmin/monobook.js">User:Voice of All/Specialadmin/monobook.js</a>, you can find the script (at the end) that speeds it up (or just copy the whole thing). I'd appretiate any help anyone can offer. I already have to run WP:PP by myself, and RfPP had 30 some request after I left it alone for half a day, and I'd also like to get to more article writing and do some other things in real life as well, so I won't be able to do too much here. The script requires a slight altering of broswer security settings though, eplained at the top of the script.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 00:34, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm helping out there from time to time. Your tool seems like a good idea, but it isn't working here. At least, nothing different shows up when I look at the category. I did the browser security change in firefox. I don't know much about JS, so I don't have a clue what could be wrong. (Or rather, what I might've done wrong.) --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 00:56, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Any user can put the NPA warning on a talk page, it would be be wise to do that, to show that you've made effort to let the user know that he/she has violated policy.

<dd>Perhaps an administrator could correct the move to <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_2006.html" title="June 2006">June 2006</a> by deleting the current June 2006 page and replacing it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Current_events&amp;oldid=61463502" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Current_events&amp;oldid=61463502" rel="nofollow">this version</a> of the old <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> article.
