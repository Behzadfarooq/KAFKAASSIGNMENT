<p>I have already stated that I don't like the common practice when people are blocked / sent to a "cooling-off" period for non-extreme incivility, dubious personal attacks or minor disruptions. These should be treated by ignoring, walking away, calmly discussing and not by blocking. The policies clearly state, that an editor should only be blocked for personal attacks in <b>extreme cases</b>, and that blocks are not <b>punitive but preventive</b>. I don't know form what Zoe wanted to prevent me by issuing the last block, probably from commenting his/her mocking of what I did on wikipedia. Anyway, what we actually have here are policies, that say one thing (block only preventive, in extreme cases) and then we have the admin consensus, that it is OK to block for minor PA/disruption and any argumentation in the sense of "this shouldn't be done according to the policies" is defaced as "wikilawyering". The reason for only blocking in <b>extreme cases</b> is clear, admins shouldn't offend editors who might have a lot of work on wikipedia behind them and get involved in a heated debate by blocking them right away. It is only <i>laziness</i> that the admins block so often. Azmoc 20:49, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>What part of the "No solicitation" at the top of my talk page was unclear? Talk page spammers should expect to rough it.

<dd>It's <i>not</i> a "nice" message. You're telling people they're wasting their time here, and they should go volunteer somewhere else, and you were spamming it all over the place.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I opposed your proposal to delete the article and start all over again because I think we could just as easily go off the rails with a new article as with the current one and I would rather work with the existing article.</p>
<p>However, I am interested in hearing what you had in mind for a new start from scratch. I am not satisfied with the current article and I am looking for ideas on how to improve it. I am very much open to ideas which involve a major re-organization of the outline as I don't think small fixes will have much impact.</p>

Zscout370's comment on irc after manually entering a few dozen (hundred?) reverts (out of 800) was something like "my arm is falling off". Sounds like exhaustion of community patience to me.

<li>I think indef might be a little harsh, but this is definitely meriting of a month or six - and that's <a href="../../../i/f/f/Iff.html" title="Iff">iff</a> he agrees never to make mass pagemoves again.

<li>Certainly. Besides, I didn't say *I* would unblock him, only that I would support it if somebody else did it, with that caveat.

<p>From what I understand, this editor has been around for a fair while, and has generally been a positive – if sometimes prickly – contributor. Obviously his chosen method of handing this issue (posting a request at <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Requests_for_Assistance_Requests_6f9c.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance/Requests">Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance/Requests</a> with a six-hour deadline before he continued the moves) was a poor one, and an obvious violation of <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a>. I have to ask, is this editor involved in (or has he been involved in) any other major conflicts (RfCs, Arbitrations, etc.)?</p>
<p>Looking at his block log, he had some significant copyright issues earlier; I don't like to see that, but then the problem seems to have stopped after a block was issued. <i>If</i> there aren't any other issues with this editor, might I suggest trimming the block to a week so he has time to cool down, and allowing him to return on a <i>very</i> short leash? <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 13:35, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur with TenOfAllTrades. Mr. Norton's goal appears to have been making sure the full-name articles existed, moreso than making sure each article was always listed under the full name. Of course, he <i>should</i> have re-moved the articles BACK to the consensus name, leaving a redirect at the full name (or, better yet, should have implemented the redirects directly instead of via pagemoves), and of course, he should have stopped immediately once warned. However, I think the principle of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> still applies. His intent appears benign even if his methods were not. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 13:48, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> would have applied had he not been warned previously by multiple users to stop. Blatently persisting in such a manner created a LOT of extra work, and was extremely disruptive. I'm not sure so sure <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> still applies once someone KNOWS that their actions are being judged unacceptable and continues anyway. - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriona_934d.html" title="User:Triona">Stephanie Daugherty (Triona)</a> - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETriona_5b3e.html" title="User talk:Triona">Talk</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Comment</a> - 14:13, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I agree that his intent was benign, just he wasn't talking with anyone. &lt;scratches head&gt;. Tricky one to solve. Would someone care to discuss per email with him? <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 14:08, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>His intent was benign in the sense of "benign dictator" at best. We have this <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> document cautioning against "owning" articles, but this guy seems to think he owns the whole encyclopedia and the other Wikimedia projects as well (did you see that thing on Commons)? His approach about the page moves was "show me the written policy against it or I'm going to start again at 6 in the blinking morning", which is completely incompatible with the idea of a collaborative project. Fixing his moves burned almost a whole evening for at least 3 different editors. There is no way he should be allowed back without showing evidence of serious attitude adjustment. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 14:41, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd suggest ignoring silly kids who say things like that. Until someone's house actually gets blown up over a Wikipedia dispute, I don't consider this any kind of realistic or worrisome threat.

<dd>Established precedent on Wikipedia is that a death threat results in a guarranteed indef block. Sadly, because in this case it would mean an indef block of AOL we can't do this because of their bollixed proxy setup. I suggest keeping an eye out on this person, &amp; if they continue in this vein we may have to consider some extreme measure, which will make the suits at AOL notice &amp; start being more responsive. (I have one idea, but it would require a buy-in from our AOL-using Wikipedians -- &amp; even then it might not work.

<p>I had been the recipient of I believed personal attack, however on intitially posting this to <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> it became apparent the the issues involved also centre on my wikipedian and personal abilities as a doctor to contribute to <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder.html" title="Temporomandibular joint disorder">Temporomandibular joint disorder</a>. As there were therefore both incivility and content disputes, <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> suggested full topic be raised here at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>. I see between the suggestion to transfer over by <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">User:Paul Cyr</a> and my having the chance to submit here, a block occured and then unblocked out of wikiprocess rather than assessment of user actions/behaviour/attitude. Also note that having tried to follow <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> guidance of first posting a personal-attack warning template to the user's talk-page, the user then accused me on my talk page of vandalising their talk page. Given that events listed below now predate the temporary block discussed above - I will understand if my submission now might be superfluous...</p>
<p>See <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder.html" title="Temporomandibular joint disorder">Temporomandibular joint disorder</a> <i>history</i> &amp; <i>discussion</i>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPat8722_2e76.html" title="User talk:Pat8722">User talk:Pat8722</a> and my <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">User talk:Davidruben</a>.</p>
<p>It is difficult to separate out the personal attack from lesser incivility &amp; belittling, suggestions that only those with professional specialist training in a field can contribute to an article (and that any other approach at classifying symptoms into groups indicates lack of knowledge), whether the numbers of cases presenting to a GP counts as a significant experience of the condition or not, and finally revert-protecting a list of synmptoms. What really irked was that the commonest symptom other than pain at the jaw joint itself (i.e. earche in half of patients) was repeatedly removed in the list's revert-protection as not being cited (a citation needed tag would have been more appropriate as anyone with experience of the condition should have known this was valid information even if needing a reference to be provided for the benefit of other readers), yet rare and obscur symptoms kept because listed in Pat8722 own provided citation.</p>

<li>In reply, I am now accused of vandalising his/her talk page and using words in a context I have not.

As a minor example Pat8722 wished to peserve separate list entries for upper backpain from lower back pain. Whilst as undiagnosed symptoms upper &amp; lower back pains may have different causes, in context of this jaw-joint disorder neither are being caused by local causes (eg kidneys for lower back pain) and are thus are referred backpain at varying points. Having provided a source that discusses the mechanism of these non-local (atypical) pains, and <a href="../../../d/o/z/User%7EDozenist_62e6.html" title="User:Dozenist">User:Dozenist</a> recent significant expansion/rewrite to the article's description as to the mechanism of 3 groups of symptoms <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temporomandibular_joint_disorder&amp;diff=65469958&amp;oldid=65463097" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temporomandibular_joint_disorder&amp;diff=65469958&amp;oldid=65463097" rel="nofollow">here</a>, Pat8722 reinserts their simplist list (a revertion to its deletion) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temporomandibular_joint_disorder&amp;diff=65475628&amp;oldid=65469958" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temporomandibular_joint_disorder&amp;diff=65475628&amp;oldid=65469958" rel="nofollow">here</a>, critises the other editor for the manner of adding additional information and accuses me of vandalism to their talk page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I've had enough of this attack and repeated assertion of having deleted material when I have not (just joined up items in a list into a sentance), had my own addition of earache deleted for being unsourced (a citation-needed tag would have been sufficient, but given upto 2/3 patients with TMJD complain of earache, anyone with knowledge of the field should have been aware of this - info reinserted with refs).</li>

I've probabluy learnt something clinically in having to research citations for this artice, but just because a symptom can occur (and thus is new to me), does not make it common or therefore necessarily that clinicaly important, and by extension that important to stress in wikipedia. So whilst many of the listed symptoms are ones I had not previously encountered in clinical practice and the single source of a book without online access whilst perfectly valid as a citation source is nonetheless hard for a non-specialist to seek confirmation (one source whilst verifying that some might include a symptom within a particular disease, fails prove that consensus of specialist opinion, or more importantly give any indication as to whether it is a frequent or rare specific symptom). TMJD is presented to GPs and Dentists (source provided in discussions) and to suggest that lack of awareness of a symptom amounts to lacking any knowledge in field is a personal attack. Having now done some more thorough <a href="../../../p/u/b/PubMed_05d8.html" title="PubMed">PubMed</a> searching, I update my knoweldge that referred pain to the ear is even more common than my own clinical experience suggested (I would have guessed at about a third, but values from studies is between 40-60%) and have learnt that backaches (something not seen in presentation in my limited 20years of experience) also occurs and for similar referred-pain reasons as to the ear.</p>
<p>However this has not been about editors pointing out further sources of information to discuss whether any given symptom is common or rare (who knows maybe GPs generally or myself in particular have been overlooking a symptom), but rather it is more the antagonistic attitude to myself and other editors ijnvolved with this article that lead to a previous &amp; ongoing <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Pat8722_e462.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Pat8722">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Pat8722</a>.</p>
<p><b>The content/revert dispute</b> I really do not see trying to join similar muscular pains at sites other than over the jaw joint itself. ie from this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stiffness in the neck and shoulders <sup id="_ref-TMJsydrome-Richard_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TMJsydrome-Richard" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
<li>Upper backache <sup id="_ref-TMJsydrome-Richard_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TMJsydrome-Richard" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
<li>Lower backache <sup id="_ref-TMJsydrome-Richard_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TMJsydrome-Richard" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stiffness in the neck and shoulders, upper or lower backache.<sup id="_ref-TMJsydrome-Richard_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TMJsydrome-Richard" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Is with repect to 'backache' symptom a case of deleting and obscurring <i>"You deleted it.

<p>I've nuked Wikipedia:Requests for comment/MONGO (second RfC) and the talk page.

Virtually all my posts on this whole mess have been along the lines of disproving what I felt were incorrect statements, or revealing relevant information based on incontrovertible evidence that was being left by everyone all over Wikipedia. That's it. You also posted in the RfC and AfD comments like "such and such is a meatpuppet" or "such and such is a sockpuppet" to discredit others. When pressed by multiple editors to justify and prove your comments, you replied that you refuse to do so as it would "reveal IP information", which if it's not in WP edit history you as a non-admin should have *NO* access to based on Wikipedia rules. You really should disclose if you do have access to such information. When asked to then remove your inflammatory and unproven accusations, you simply refused. I'll note that any connections of evidence and behavior I pointed out were backed up with diffs, or common patterns of posting by others, which were in plain sight. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 18:28, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps the problem is that too many people with additional buttons are taking too much unilateral action on this whole case, end to end, above and beyond what they should have. Half the contentiousness and vitriol that has been (needlessly) generated with this whole ED thing from the beginning was because of people doing things as is they 1.) are in charge of the WP project; 2.) no regard for process--knowing full damn well that they're only going to incense people by not doing it right or by the book; 3). perhaps it's time for additional community (editor) level oversight of admin actions. Any project like this were anyone is above reproach will in the end fail as the project sways more and more in the horrid direction of cronyism. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 15:37, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"I would ask you not to embark on any editing of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-Semitism_dc04.html" title="New anti-Semitism">New anti-Semitism</a> that is likely to be contentious.

<p>User:Hillman has created a set of "dig" pages to track users. Purporting to be "personal notes" for an essay, they record edits by IP addresses and user accounts and group them under presumed real-life identities, with WHOIS and other information. These are not vandals, but users deemed by Hillman to have made "bad" edits. Each page notes that some of the information "may be sensitive and therefore should not be widely publicized if this can be avoided," and yet they reside on one of the highest-traffic sites on the Web, and show up in Google searches. I've contacted Hillman, but she won't discuss the matter on-wiki. Do these pages contravene the <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html#Posting_personal_details" title="WP:BLOCK">"Posting personal details"</a> section of the blocking policy?

Anyway, anyone interested in wiki-abuse issues keeps notes like that. At least with Hillman, you know what s/he is writing down about you (if anything).

Since the furore arrived before I could finish my essay, I am considering a <i>volte face</i> and may nominate these pages myself for RfC or even MfD. Please give me a chance to consider how to to that since I think the Sarfatti and Haisch pages have legitimate uses in addition to background for my essay. Your cooperation is appreciated! ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 22:02, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some of the tracked users are POV-pushers or vandals, but others seem to be good-faith contributors whose connection to "alternative" theories put them under Hillman's radar. They range from notable public figures like <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Haisch_589e.html" title="Bernard Haisch">Bernard Haisch</a> (who mentions his conflict with Hillman in a recent <i>LA Times</i> op-ed) to pseudonymous editors about whose real-life identities Hillman speculates at length. The <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html#Posting_personal_details" title="WP:BLOCK">"Posting personal details"</a> section of the blocking policy states that "Users who post what they believe are the personal details of other users without their consent may be blocked for any length of time," and publicizing presumed real-life names and places of residence would seem to contravene it. (If the policy carries implicit exceptions, those need to be made explicit.) I appreciate that Hillman's goal is to formulate a policy on when "digging" is and is not appropriate, but it is obviously premature to make the digging public <i>before</i> the policy has been formulated. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Smith_0e3f.html" title="User:Tim Smith">Tim Smith</a> 23:09, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let me just say I am also very concerned about this. I appreciate Hillman's efforts to help develop a digging policy; however she is one of the (if not <i>the</i>) top diggers, and I believe much of what he has done and is doing in that regard is beyond the pale. This is not a new issue - a few months ago there was a major controversy about that (from Hillman's talk page: User_talk:Hillman/Archive9). I think a reasonable summary of that is that most of those who looked into and understood what Hillman was doing were against it.</dd>
<dd>Out of the many problems with what Hillman is doing, let me just point out a few: (1) there is usually no "probable cause" - a lot of the people targetted have not actually done anything in violation of WP policy or anything disruptive or otherwise wrong, they have merely given Hillman some vague reason to be concerned that they might (2) the data presented is extremely circumstantial, and its interpretation error-prone, often no better than a wild guess and (3) it violates explicit WP policies. <a href="../../../o/b/s/User%7EObsidianOrder_2f88.html" title="User:ObsidianOrder">ObsidianOrder</a> 19:24, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have been targeted by Hillman and have not violated Wikipedia policy. I did link to a bookseller to provide a reference, but this was done to support the citation. It was removed and I did not object. For this infraction, I now have a Hillman Dig page where my edits are tracked and conjecture regarding my personal identity is posted in violation of WP. I can see the need to have some way of monitoring repeat vandals, but this type of monitoring can so easily become abusive (as it already has). <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 00:58, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, I'm posting here because I'm not really sure where else to turn for help. I fully expect my account (Andy emigré) to be blocked by User:Pschemp for making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ANo_Chinese_allowed&amp;diff=66121761&amp;oldid=65141089" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ANo_Chinese_allowed&amp;diff=66121761&amp;oldid=65141089" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, if only because it raises questions about the appropriateness of his/her blocks, the one on myself included. I realize Wikipedia suffers considerably from trolls and vandals, but really--Pschemp's blocks on myself and this "No Chinese allowed" guy seem not to be aimed at reducing vandalism, but rather at silencing criticism of his/her own behavior.</p>
<p>So, could someone (1) keep an eye on the page "<a href="../../../n/o/_/User%7ENo_Chinese_allowed_96f3.html" title="User:No Chinese allowed">User:No_Chinese_allowed</a>" to make sure Pschemp doesn't erase my comment, and (2) make sure he/she doesn't block me in retribution for whistleblowing, if such behavior is indeed inappropriate according to whatever relevant rules may exist? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>One more thing I wanted to ask. Am I correct to infer that there's no oversight to curb this sort of administrative abuse? Or was Pschemp justified, after all, in deleting my comments and blocking my account? If the latter, my apologies for wasting your time; if the former, I'm left wondering how Wikipedia can keep potential editors, such as myself and those others in my department I mention in the forcibly redacted comment, interested instead of disillusioned and bitter at the forceful rejection of our contributions. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_emigr%C3%A9_c0d7.html" title="User:Andy emigré">Andy emigré</a> 08:23, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">username policy</a> is mainly in place to avoid a couple of things:
<ul>
<li>Obviously trollish accounts - "WIKIPEDIA IS GHEY" and the like.</li>
<li>Impostor accounts of varying sneakinesses - say, "Jimbo WaIes". (Note that the middle letter of the last name is an uppercase i, not a lowercase L.)</li>
<li>Untypable usernames - like "小", I'm afraid, as well as long random strings of characters. There's a standing policy on this wiki against "untypable" usernames, as they're extremely difficult to tell apart.</li>

<p>Well, when Pschemp blocked me (on my now inaccessible "Anonymous Andy" account) it seemed to be in direct retribution for criticizing his behavior towards the "No Chinese allowed" guy; my experiences stemmed from someone at my university had managed to get the entire department blocked under the guideline to which you refer.</p>
<p>The policy of blocking users <b>without explanation</b> and no apparent means of getting unblocked (I don't remember seeing a procedure on the block page, at least as of a few months ago when Wikipedia had my department's subnet blocked--the reason for which, again, I had to turn to offline sources to discover) is a huge turnoff to potential contributors. I just hope you understand that. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_emigr%C3%A9_c0d7.html" title="User:Andy emigré">Andy emigré</a> 09:07, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If by "potential contributors" he means "people who will start calling people d1ckheads" at the drop of a hat, then we can probably live without them. IIRC the "unpronounceable" chinese name that was blocked a few months ago was reported here as being either an insult when translated or the chinese characters were not resolving properly and causing problems. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 13:14, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No, that's not what I mean by "potential contributors." Now that's a little unfair; I don't think I'm being unreasonable here. Surely it's not difficult to understand that getting blocked without warning (what triggered my block was an attempt to rewrite a comment to REMOVE a personal attack on Pschemp), with no easy recourse (how can you talk to an admin when you've been blocked from editing?), and apparently for reasons of self-interest alone, doesn't endear people to your project. I'm not a "vandal" or "troll," if that's what you're implying. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_emigr%C3%A9_c0d7.html" title="User:Andy emigré">Andy emigré</a> 17:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Andy, this looks like you have been blocked in the past because of usernames that were against the username policy. So no admin abuse there. Then, instead of reading the username policy, realising that those are just the rules of the game here, you respond bitter and frustrated, and show that frustration by leaving comments about 'abusive admins'. Also, the text you see when you try to edit when you're blocked, is pretty clear in what to do when you are blocked: <a href="../../../b/l/o/MediaWiki%7EBlockedtext_22db.html" title="MediaWiki:Blockedtext">MediaWiki:Blockedtext</a>. Anyway, please drop the issue, don't take it this personally, create a username that stays witin policy and start editing! If you disagree with the username policy, please go to the talk page of the policy page and start a discussion there, perhaps you can convince the community to change the policy, who knows? --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">Joanne</a><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoanneB_dae6.html" title="User talk:JoanneB">B</a> 14:01, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Wait a sec, *I* have never been blocked for usernames against policy... when did this become about me?&#160;:-P Look, perhaps you're misunderstanding my complaint?

<dd>Hello, I noticed that you were responsible for blocking the robot User:Bot-maru, and thought you might be able to help with a more recent situation with its user, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">User:Marudubshinki</a>. He has been running bots through his regular user account, and recieves frequent complaints about its errors. His response to these complaints is in general quite callous, and he continues to make automated edits with this user account.</dd>
<dd>My first complaint can be seen at <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_Archive_49_2dfb.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki/Archive 49">User talk:Marudubshinki/Archive 49</a> under "Your - the the + the bot". Current complaints can be seen at <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">User talk:Marudubshinki</a> under: "Please stop fixing my double redirect", "Removing whitespace ...", "Robot removing selflinks", "Bot removing self-links is causing grief", "External link bot".</dd>
<dd>Is there anything you can do about this, as an admin? - <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainwarrior_5180.html" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> 06:28, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer is, I've been aware of the problem for quite some time, but I'm not sure what to do. Marudubshinski runs an unauthorized bot out of his own account, to do minor tasks, and fairly regularly annoys people. It is undoubtedly against bot policy, a fact he's aware of but has basically shrugged off; he also routinely shrugs off complaints, by which I mean that he fixes problems but seems quite unconcerned that his bot is breaking pages. I tried emailing a member of the bot authorization group, but that never came to anything I'm aware of... So what should we do? -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 16:02, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Block him indefinitely and only lift the block once you get a promise that he will go through the proper channels for bot authorization and <i>never</i> run it under his own account. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 16:05, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I support this action. It's a simple thing for him to get himself unblocked. Maru has been brazenly violating policy, and continually illustrating why that policy exists in the process; as an admin, he should be setting the opposite example. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 02:35, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He was previously blocked indefinitely for running unauthorised bots on the 13th, but unblocked himself the same day claiming the bots were shut down, and has since started the bots up again. To my mind this is a most grievous abuse of admin privileges. I've left a message on his talk page suggesting that he is under intense scrutiny at the moment and is not likely to get away with doing so again. I recommend keeping an eye on his block log until the matter is settled. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 02:39, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In that case the block message <i>did</i> say he could unblock himself when the bot was shut down, but the clear implication that unauthorized bots are not allowed was clearly ignored. Sadly support the block. Question, however, since there are a lot of bot-blocks, and User:Bot-maru was indef blocked and never fixed (or rather, moved to the main account), what happens if he promises to get approval, gets himself unblocked, and then runs the bot <i>again</i>? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 02:44, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, that was on the 6th. He was blocked indefinitely by AmiDaniel on the 13th, with the summary "Please request approval before running your bot." AmiDaniel also left a message on his talk page explicitly instructing him "Please email me or add {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} to have the block removed--do not unblock yourself." Maru unblocked himself and continued running his bot without requesting bot approval. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 02:50, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is a pretty strong community consensus against running a bot as an admin, and it's trivial to get a new bot account, the bot policy is pretty clear that this block is supported, although I hope it will not be a reason for Maru to leave over. As for the <i>bot</i> actions themselves, they appear fairly harmless, but inefficient (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Palestinian_National_Covenant&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Palestinian_National_Covenant&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a> multiple edits were made in succession, where they could have been made at once. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 02:56, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm confused about the history re the 15th, and I'll review it again shortly. However I'd just like to say in response to Thatcher's question the following... Maru has never lied, he's just ignored policy. If he unblocks himself or promises to stop and then doesn't, I have a rather clear idea what to do, but I think that discussion is premature. Also to Xaosflux, I'd like to mention that there have been more serious issues like editing peoples' talk page comments and breaking links. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 03:00, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'd also like to note that Snottygobble's statement above is 100% correct, even though at least two of us were confused.

<dd>It looks like he unblocked himself on the 13th and starting running the bot again on the 16th.

<p>More troubling than the fact that he is running a bot under his admin account is that he is running a bot that *uses his admin privs.* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Marudubshinki&amp;page=" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Marudubshinki&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">The delete log</a> is pretty clear that he's running an adminbot:</p>

<p>This is greatly concerning, as the use of bots with admin privs is opposed very strongly on en.wiki (with the possible exception of Curps, though his is not without it's critics, and may or may not still be running) and by the Foundation (an adminbot on another wiki was desysopped by Anthere not too long ago). Given that he's been warned numerous times not to run a bot under his admin account, has refused to comply, has added features which utilize his admin status without approval, and has unblocked himself in order to re-start the bot, I'm inclined to request a desysopping. If he unblocks himself, or if he is unblocked and resumes using the bot to execute administrator privs, I will request he be emergency desysopped and the matter referred to Arbitration, as per the precedent for emergency desysopping. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 04:44, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is very disturbing. Maru is a valuable member of the community, but unblocking oneself, running unauthorized bots, and running bots with sysop privileges need to be stopped, now.

<p>For libel purposes, Jacobs is a "public figure". He's been on major TV talk shows, has written op-ed articles in the New York Times, and runs advocacy organizations. So there's no real libel risk here under US law.</p>

<p>The material concerns a defamation lawsuit in which Jacobs is involved, as a defendant. Jacobs has been involved in efforts to stop the building of a large mosque in Boston, and this has resulted in lawsuits. There's substantial press coverage in the mainstream media of this, along with websites from both (maybe three) sides, and a blog with a timeline.

<p>Mantanmoreland is attempting to whitewash and cover up the fact that he was found to be using a sockpuppet and posting under multiple identifies on Wikipedia. I was advised a couple days ago to let this matter now lie and I agreed to do so, but user Mantanmoreland is now trying to remove evidence and important information about this incident.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mantanmoreland/Archive3" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mantanmoreland/Archive3" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> I suspect that in fact he has been using several identifies: Lastexit for sure and I suspect also "Doright." He was warned by an administrator about this and the administrator the indicated that he was definitely using a sockpuppet. He is now trying to cover this up by removing text from his archived talk page. I believe this is inappropriate. Would somebody here please advise Mantanmoreland to stop deleting text concerning this incident from his talk page archives? Thanks. Ptmccain 21:24, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Accusations of "edit warring" are easily made and anyone reviewing edit history on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> pages will realize that Mantanmoreland and SlimVirgin are every bit as much part of the problem there as anyone else. In fact, I notice that SlimVirgin is herself now before the Arbcomm for similar behaviors even toward fellow admin. So, I think can dispense with the tactic of trying to divert attention from the issue here. Trying to divert attention from this complaint is not helpful. Mantanmoreland is attempting to whitewash a most serious breach of Wiki policy and is telling only half the truth. I did not not try to restore most of what he deleted from a banned user. I did however restore a very important part of the user's violation of Wiki policy. Here is what Mantanmoreland is trying to remove from public view in his archives:</dd>

<dd>Let's have the facts clear. What I restored was not a "taunting comment" -- I have no way to know that was its intention, nor do I care really. The reason I put it back in was because it was a very important part of the record here, a very important question that made it possible for Fred Bauer to make his follow-on remark indicating that Mantanmoreland has been using a sockpuppet. I would be happy to leave only Fred's comment on the open archive page instead. I offer that as a solution. Let's just keep Fred's remark on Mantanmoreland's archive page. That would be fine with me. Removing it is wrong. I've been told by both admins and users that it is wrong to remove admin warnings and comments on my talk pages. Were they wrong? Ptmccain 22:19, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That way I would be forced to avoid the temptation to participate in Wikipedia and have to deal with the likes of "SlimVirgin" aka Danny Wool, and Mantanmoreland/Doright/Nextexit and the other assorted troubled persons who inhabit Wikipedia 24/7 hiding behind their anonymity, working out their psychic disorders in various and sundry fashion here, not to mention participating in a project that ultimately is fatally flawed due its encouragment to people who know nothing about a given subject to participate in. No "encyclopedia" operates in such a fundamentally intellectually dishonest and unreliable way. So, please...go ahead, make my millennium. And I will thank you for it. I assure you it will be of no concern to me. I thank you kindly for the suggestion Danny. And it will be fun to watch the history page here to see how quickly Danny and playmates permanently delete this remark from the Wiki record. Ptmccain 00:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>In two short sentences Handface has provided 3 references.</i> Irrelevant, since the issue isn't whether she said it, but whether it's applicable to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>; i.e., whether Ann Coulter is specially qualified to diagnose Bill Clinton or whether her latest ravings have some direct weight on the subject of Bill Clinton.

<dd>No. It's not my POV. I don't think Bill Clinton is gay. I've said that several times now. I put it in the article because Ann Coulter said it, and Coulter and Clinton have a long and documented history (yet there is no mention of Coulter at all in the Clinton article). I haven't added the comment back, and I don't plan on it at this time. Other than Jay Leno joking about it the last couple of nights, there hasn't really been enough publicity about this statement to include it. But it's just outlandish to call this vandalism. <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHandface_86cc.html" title="User:Handface">Handface</a> 08:53, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it does seem to be a borderline POINT violation; the first one I looked at clearly says it was taken from Amazon.com, and was properly tagged with the album cover fair use template. Some are screencaps or scans that do not say who the capper was (although that does not seem to be important to the issue, as they are correctly tagged with the appropriate fair use template). I think if The JPS went through and added "screencap by The JPS, original copyright owned by Fox Broadcasting" or whatever that would be sufficient. I would suggest to MatthewFenton that mass tagging someone else's uploads gives a bad impression. On the subject of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Image%7EAlex_kelly.jpg_760f.html" title="Image:Alex kelly.jpg">Image:Alex kelly.jpg</a>, I think it's obvious that it is a promotional still, based on the style of the photograph, etc. It <i>is</i> a problem that it comes from an unofficial web site that does not seems to have any copyright notices on it. For the moment, I have tagged it {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPromotional_2e75.html" title="Template:Promotional">promotional</a>}}, although I suggest that MatthewFenton should try to find a copy or a suitable replacement on an official O.C. web site. (Fox.com seems to be down at the moment so a little leeway is appropriate, I think, as it's obviously a posed still of some kind.) <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 15:04, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(after edit conflict) Saying that sourcing it to Amazon.com is not enough without the exact url is a pointless bit of wikilawyering, as (a) the link could change any day, and (b) Amazon is not the original owner. The point of providing source info is so that ownership can be investigated if use claims are in doubt. No one would have a problem finding the record publisher in this case. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 15:04, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, i understand about the amazon part but i was under the impression that it had to be directly sourced. In regards to the mass tag i also believed i was following the correct procedure, i could of probably just told the uploader and not tagged them but i did not believe that is the right way to go.

<dd>Thanks for your response, Thatcher. "Finding something better to do" is a bit of a dangerous question to ask any wikipedian -- they'd be no-one here!! I think Matthew and myself have cooled down. I disagree that indicating who captured the screenshot is overly important: so long as the source text is mentioned. As for the Alx whoever image, 3RR was inapplicable since it was not a content dispute: I was perfectly within my rights to request a review of that image. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 15:16, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Having thought about the Alex Kelly photo some more, and looked around the net, I agree that while it could be an official Fox promo, it could also be a photo shot for some other commercial purpose, like a magazine, and would therefore be inelegible under the promo reasoning. A screencap would present no problems, or if there is a promo photo on the official site. (I've seen Mall stores that sell celeb promo stills, that might be another way to find good promo still shots.)

<ul>
<li>There's errors on both sides here.</li>
<li>The claim that these edits were retaliatory is, I think, without base. While it is blatantly obvious that User:MatthewFenton reviewed the image uploads of <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">User:The JPS</a> and went about tagging a number of these with {{<a href="../../../n/s/d/Template%7ENsd_37e6.html" title="Template:Nsd">nsd</a>}} it should not be construed as retaliation or stalking. If a user, as a result of interaction with another user, find a nest of problems they shouldn't be prohibited from fixing something they perceive as wrong. If the user (in this case MatthewFenton) continued this into a revert war over all the edits, that would be a different matter but this has not happened here except on one image that I think is rightly contested. Also, The JPS; edit summaries as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Evening_Chronicle_%28North_East_England_daily_newspaper%29_logo.gif&amp;diff=66354761&amp;oldid=66354631" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Evening_Chronicle_%28North_East_England_daily_newspaper%29_logo.gif&amp;diff=66354761&amp;oldid=66354631" rel="nofollow">this one</a> are not helpful to keeping a situation calm.</li>
<li>In this case, MatthewFenton has made an error in presuming that if a {{<a href="../../../s/c/r/Template%7EScreenshot_14ab.html" title="Template:Screenshot">screenshot</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../a/l/b/Template%7EAlbumcover_a6e6.html" title="Template:Albumcover">albumcover</a>}} tagged image does not have a source, it needs to have a source explicitly listed. This is not true. In each case of these images, the album or show from which the image has been taken was already listed, providing an opportunity for another editor to verify the source and copyright status of the image. That's what the goal of the descriptive text of images is, beyond describing the image; to provide a means to verify the image's status. In the case of album covers, the source is implied; it's from the album. Even if the image was taken from amazon.com, the original source is the album cover itself, not amazon's copy of it. Similarly for screenshots, the original source is the movie or tv-program from which the screenshot was taken. These sources, if noted (and they were), can be independently verified. Similar in this vein are logos and seals; if the copyright holder of the logo/seal is noted, the source is implied. For example, you stamped <a href="../../../s/u/n/Image%7ESunday_Sun_%28North_East_England_newspaper%29_logo.gif_9b4b.html" title="Image:Sunday Sun (North East England newspaper) logo.gif">Image:Sunday Sun (North East England newspaper) logo.gif</a> with an {{<a href="../../../n/s/d/Template%7ENsd_37e6.html" title="Template:Nsd">nsd</a>}} tag. The image description did state who the holder of the copyright is. While it would be nice to have a web source for the image, it is not required; not all sources are on the web. If we note who holds the copyright of the image, it is sufficient to verify its status. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 15:50, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>furthermore, in speech which was given by Mr. Benjamin Freedman before a military organization in Washington, D.C. in 1974, Col. Curtis B. Dall in his introduction said this:</p>
<p>Introduction by Col. Curtis B. Dall:</p>
<p>"Briefly, I will add a word or two about my old friend, Ben Freedman, I consider it an honor. I was initially introduced to him as a sort of, well you meet a fellow, but I'm not so sure about him -he may be a sort of a Trojan Horse. Well, I said, let me make up my own mind. In the years that have followed, I make up my own mind I spent many happy evenings with him and his wife, Rose, who is not with us anymore. When Ben was over twenty-five -and, as I say, he comes from a very distinguished Jewish family in New York. When Ben moved over into the areas of Christianity with Rose, it took a great deal of courage. "Guts," is the name in the Marine Corps, for what it took. Ben has been ostracized by many of his friends for believing that this Country had objectives and ideals that did not appear in the minds of some of our alien citizens.</p>
<p>So, it is with great respect and honor, I say, this gentleman is a world scholar in the areas which he will touch upon. It is my great pleasure, as a member of this fine military organization, to present the honorable Benjamin Freedman, of New York."</p>
<p>Furthermore Dr Robert John Authored a book entitled "The Palestine Diary Volume 2, 3rd Edition: British"</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1419635700/104-4429684-5110303?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1419635700/104-4429684-5110303?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">amazon link</a></p>
<p>Robert John credits Benjamin H Freedman in the acknowledgements section of his historical document entitled</p>
<p>"Behind the Balfour Declaration: Britain's Great War Pledge To Lord Rothschild"</p>
<p>"To Benjamin H. Freedman, who committed himself to finding and telling the facts about Zionism and Communism. and encouraged others to do the some. The son of one of the founders of the American Jewish Committee, which for many years was anti-Zionist, Ben Freedman founded the League for Peace with Justice in Palestine in 1946. He gave me copies of materials on the Balfour Declaration which I might never have found on my own and encouraged my own research."</p>

<p>also Benjamin Freedman is credited with a book of his own on amazon entitled "facts are facts"</p>
<p>Book Description A facsimile reporduction reprinted and typeset to meet the many requests for a copy of the letter addressed to Dr David Goldstein,LL.D. of Boston, Massachusetts, by its author, Benjamin H. Freedman describing the history of the Khazarian Jews. The historic facts revealed here for the first time provide incontestible evidence that their continued suppression will prove inimical to the security of the nation, the peace of the world, the welfare of humanity, and the progress of civilization. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This editor seems to be interested <i>only</i> in pushing an anti-Israel/anti-Zionist point of view (see contribs). It was he or she that wrote the original <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_H._Freedman_bc1a.html" title="Benjamin H. Freedman">Benjamin H. Freedman</a> article, which contained the immortal quote, "He broke with organized Jewry after the Judeo-Communist victory of 1945." The image of Freedman he or she uploaded is from a fringe "bible study" site that condemns Jews as Satanic and pushes <i><a href="../../../p/r/o/Protocols_of_the_Learned_Elders_of_Zion_6d00.html" title="Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion">Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</a></i> as an authentic, factual document. So basically, regardless of the existence or non-existence of Freedman, this stinks of a way to inject some Wikipedia credibility into a particularly cranky form of Christian anti-Semitism. If Freedman's notability outside anti-Semite circles could be established and an NPOV article writen about him, it could be OK. But the current article is not such an article and this is not the author to write it. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 17:08, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In any case, this is a repost of previously-deleted material, and I'm going to delete <s>and protect</s> it as such (and protect it if you re-create it again). You can bring it up in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a> if you'd like, but <b>only</b> if you can keep your complaint short and concise. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 17:17, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Hmmm... not sure if it qualifies as "re-creation of deleted content" because the deleted version was a stub, while this is expanded, but the AfD's consensus to delete looked at how notable this author is, and he's not. I'm deleting it anyway.

<p>I guess I was a little too hasty in deleting this. The new article is expanded from the previous stub that was AfDed and deleted.

<dd>My take on the original AFD discussion was that the first article was deleted not because there was a notability dispute, but because there were copyvio concerns, a lack of reliable sources, and the subject was perceived to be a hoax of some sort. If new editors are able to present sources to the contrary, give them a chance and see what happens. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_7058.html" title="User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">Can't sleep, clown will eat me</a> 18:56, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I should love to have an uninvolved party examine the AfD on Leigh High School (Friday, July 28). The passions are running very high.

<dd>I closed it no consensus. I think we should do that as a matter of course for every article with the S word in the title to save pain; it is against some people's religion to allow a school to be deleted or merged. I have long since given up any attempt to compromise with the schools inclusionists, they will not accept any solution other than their preferred one - I seem to recall being told that keep all schools <i>was</i> the compromise... Tempting though it might be to <a href="../../../r/o/u/WP%7EROUGE_ace2.html" title="WP:ROUGE">rouge</a> things up a bit, at least they do a fair job of neutralising the really crap articles. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 20:41, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I hate to say it almost, for fear of dragging the muck to AN/I, but I've seen two where someone I opposed on RFA had voted to keep <i>after it had been demonstrated as a hoax.</i> I'm not joking. That person said that he didn't need to read the article. Most, since then, have been much more cautious. I don't feel that I can support any RFA on any person who believes in an "automatic" vote on anything, myself, but I am definitely cranky. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:33, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Doesn't surprise me.

<p>I'm one of those that won't accept any unofficial official policy, like "anyone making a personal attack is automatically blocked" or "we have successfully bused voters to the point where things are paralyzed, and therefore we have made policy," so I think that every article should be considered individually. I'm as tempted to rouge as the next, but I was really looking for some input on the possibility that, saying that I did not wish to argue with the feeble (and I was referring to a bit far below, actually, where someone wanted to get in a fight over my saying that the super rich get things), I had attacked some particular person's character. I didn't think so, obviously, as I'm not generally an insulter, but I figured I'd be as good as my scolding and call for outsiders to take a look. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:09, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Geogre, I couldn't agree more. It frustrates the hell out of me that the majority of Keep votes on these articles are purely on religious grounds. It is a travesty of policy, consensus and guidelines that schools, <i>alone out of all subjects</i> are judged worthy of inclusion regardless of any objective measure of significance. I thank the good Lord that we don't have a McDonalds branch inclusionist cult (is that a <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">bean</a> I see there?). I have no idea what to do about these disruptive individuals and their vacuous directory entries, but they exist and we have to live with it. My preferred solution is to set up a sister project, but that (along with every other solution that is not "keep all schools, they are inherently notable") is unacceptable to the schools inclusionists. I went to a genuinely notable school, over a thousand years old, the only school in the English-speaking world to have educated a pope. It has a short article which cites reliable sources for facts <i>other than its mere existence</i>. That would seem to me to be the bare minimum for an encyclopaedia: non-trivial mentions in reliable sources which attest to more than the mere existence of the place. But I have absolutely no idea how to achieve this, and duking it out at AfD is not going to help. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 21:28, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For my part, the only form of actual militancy I'll take is, per above, to not agree to anyone's RFA if they believe that there are sacred topics that trump accomplished articles.

<p>I am the editor who has suggested that saying "I'm not interested in playing games with the feeble" in the course of an AfD discussion is a personal attack. It seems clear to me that it is an uncivil personal attack to name-call other editors "feeble", even if in a "generalized way". If it isn't, thats fine, but I just want it clear so I will be able to use the exact same phrase in future discussions without being accused of making a personal attack.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:31, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

It's fascinating to me to look at the heated, venemous tone of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Leigh_High_School&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66392906" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Leigh_High_School&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66392906" rel="nofollow">the post by Nicodemus75</a> that Geogre was responding to when he made his purported "PA". Note that Geogre, when accused of "heaping condescencion" and bragging about his own contributions, somehow didn't find it productive to start slapping PA warnings on Nicodemus75's page. (Sorry about failing to hit the right tone of sweetness and light here, Geogre.) —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 03:52, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for at least looking at the discussion in question. Unfortunately it sort of fails to answer (at least to me) whether or not the phrase "I'm not interested in playing games with the feeble" is a personal attack or not. I can concede to whatever characterization you wish (i.e that my comments were "venemous" or what have you) and apologize for them. I just want to know if admins at wikipedia consider it acceptable behavior to state "I'm not interested in playing games with the feeble" in the midst of a discussion. If a statement such as that is not a personal attack, I'm sure you won't have any objection to my using the phrase in future discussion.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 04:02, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Do you have something to apologize for, then? If so, maybe you should have started there instead of by escalating the situation with these PA warnings. As far as your specific question goes, any future uses of the phrase "I'm not interested in playing games with the feeble" will need to be evaluated within the context they occur; there is no universal answer I believe. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 04:27, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Bunchofgrapes, the reason I haven't been answering here, or much of anywhere, is that this stuff becomes a virtual Tarbaby rather quickly. However, for the curious, there are three sentences in succession that are necessary. All may see it for him or herself in the diff above, but it's this: 1) I don't want to argue with the feeble, 2) Still, it is worth arguing this point: attacking nominators is horrible, 3) Trying to badger people is antithetical to Wikipedia. I.e. I was saying that I don't want to argue with anyone, and especially not people with feeble reasoning, but I will argue <i>in this AfD</i> because I have seen <i>general SchoolWatch voters</i> accusing all who disagree with them of villainy. We have long ago established that Nicodemus75 didn't get that point. My question was merely whether anyone else understood me, or if I had failed to communicate myself clearly, or if I had failed and made an insult to Nicodemus75. I know my intent, and I figure most people know that I'm not the insulting sort, but I suppose that's not the issue (which is why I so vociferously remind people that NPA is not quite policy). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:19, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I could see Nicodemus75's point that it appeared you were calling him feeble.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>: Maakhter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:India&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66410969" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:India&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66410969" rel="nofollow">added a comment</a>, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=India&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66411206" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=India&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66411206" rel="nofollow">POV-section</a> tag regarding a map. I looked into the map, and didn't see any problem with the map as mentioned in the comment. So, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=India&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66411206" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=India&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66411206" rel="nofollow">removed the tag</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AIndia&amp;diff=66412989&amp;oldid=66410969" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AIndia&amp;diff=66412989&amp;oldid=66410969" rel="nofollow">replied</a> in the talk page about the mismatch of the allegation and the map's actual content.</li>

I reviwed the talk page comment, and since the specific NPOV issue is not specified in the comment, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66431563" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66431563" rel="nofollow">removed</a> the merge tag and the disputed tag. I also explained in the talk page and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66431634" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66431634" rel="nofollow">requested</a> the user to be specific rather than generic, when commenting on POV allegations. Next I added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66431746" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66431746" rel="nofollow">a reference</a> to a line that might have been questioned by Maakher. Other than this, I don't see any "rude" or "Reactionary" behavior, or claiming something as "my personal property"</li>
</ul>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Maakhter" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Maakhter" rel="nofollow">Maakhter's contributions</a>, it seems that Maakhter has suddenly found a whole lot POV issues in a lot of articles, and copy-pasted the same argument without being clear. He hasn't discussed any thing further in the talk page despite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMaakhter&amp;diff=66436047&amp;oldid=65891067" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMaakhter&amp;diff=66436047&amp;oldid=65891067" rel="nofollow">my request</a> to specify the POV issues. He also went right away to file an RFM claiming that this issue has been submitted and the "dispute" has been attempted to be solved via AN/I and RFC, while in reality, his attempts for filing RFM <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66434627" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66434627" rel="nofollow">preceeded</a> these events.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have asked and will ask the user once again to discuss the issue in the talk page of the relevant article, before claiming that there is a "dispute" that needs "mediation/arbitration/rfc" etc. The diffs are all above, and I haven't intereacted in any other article recently with this user, which my <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ragib_2dc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ragib">contribution</a> log will show.

<p>You are right (Isopropyl ) my many edits have been reverted by pro-Indian editors. I request that these articles should be balanced and put a point of view which represents the views of all parties concerned. Furthermore, these articles must be based on facts rather than personal opinions or references to unsubstantiated allegations.</p>
<p>The article I want it be merged with is Indo-Pakistani Wars. It does exist.</p>
<p>Maakhter 01:10, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Has any Pakistani been charged for genocide? What about the current relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh? The relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh are very friendly. If someone accuses Pakistan for genocide then why Bangladesh is so friendly with Pakistan, while no one has charged any Pakistani for genocide.</p>
<p>Has Bangladesh given up its allegation of genocide against Pakistan? If not then, why they are so friendly with Pakistan? Why Bangladesh does not want to chase its allegations of genocide against Pakistan?</p>
<p>Do you mean that United Nations and everyone else in the world kept quite at this alleged genocide? Who gave you the figure of three million people dieing in the conflict?</p>
<p>Therefore, its not just Pakistani who are denying it, the rest of the world by not asking for investigations, actually supported the Pakistani point of view. The allegations were not worth a formal investigation.</p>
<p>The reason is that there was no genocide. It is Indian propaganda.</p>

<p>As you may know, earlier this year, a minor scandal arose out of the adware company Zango having created an article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zango_Messenger&amp;oldid=14840188" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zango_Messenger&amp;oldid=14840188" rel="nofollow">Zango Messenger</a> in this format.

Eventually the anonymous user seemed to give up.</p>
<p>I have discovered that Zango has been editing Wikipedia more recently, with edits as soon as April, May, and July. These edits manipulate Zango related articles, or else edit articles related to computer games and video in order to linkspam the Zango website. Here is a list of all IP addresses known to be used by Zango, with the Wikipedia contributions list linked first and the Reverse DNS results linked second.

<p>The most recent edits by these IP addresses took place today, July 28. In the edit summary, it claims the edit was made for "Fact checking and bias redirection." See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zango_Messenger&amp;diff=66439772&amp;oldid=66229947" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zango_Messenger&amp;diff=66439772&amp;oldid=66229947" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> The same IP address that made this edit also wrote on the article's discussion page,</p>
<p>"29 June 2006, reworked the corporate advertising copy for accuracy. I hope you don't mind me having a little fun with these shills. If you object to my copy, please exchange it for your own, so long as it is not advertising and/or misinformation in Zango's favour. Thank you and good night. [Anonymous]"</p>
<p>Two things are clear from this. First, the user admits engaing in corporate advertising. Second, the user thinks he is anonymous, and thus must not be aware of IP addresses. Zango has allegedly engaged in tactics similar to this on the website MySpace, paying users with many "friends" an amount of money to put a video on their user profile that asks Zango to be installed when viewed. When questioned, Zango replied that this was an "accident." For this incident, from a company with 150 to 250 employees, according to the Wikipedia information, I would expect management to be able to reign in employees enough to be able to know what they are doing with their computers.</p>
<p>Though the IP addresses have reverted vandalism or made spelling corrections in about six of their total edits, I do not think this outweighs harm the addresses have made elsewhere. I am seeking a permanent ban on these users pending administrator intervention, especially those the reverse DNS reports reveal to be owned by Zango. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Bush_238d.html" title="User:Daniel Bush">Daniel Bush</a> 00:39, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nevermind about the radioshack 207.236.93.0/24 one. It seems that he was reading an old revision by the Zango IP addresses and edited it while looking at it, resulting in it being reverted to the old version. He had edited it to comment that it will make your computer run like a Commodore 64.

There is no mention of any such thing in the article on Jefferson himself, and the claim seems dubious to me. A few sources have been provided, but nothing that escapes, in my opinion, the policy on original research. I would appreciate it if somebody stopped by and explained the policy to Lingeron. She appears not to trust anybody who disagrees with her, claiming that we are Communists bent on destroying Wikipedia and subverting America. No joke. Anyways, she seems determined to have this in there, and we've got an edit war brewing, so any help would be great (on a side note, she has also been making some highly POV edits, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=64954393&amp;oldid=64953772" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=64954393&amp;oldid=64953772" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and could probably use an explanation of that policy, as well.

<dd>No, you're right, Aaron, I won't listen to you. I tend not to listen to editors who have no tolerance for edits that don't coincide with their POV pushing agenda. Honestly, Aaron, your need to dominate all articles pertaining to anarchism, and even to destroy the <i>one</i> that has featured status, is revolting. I would appreciate it if someone would look here at <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> and see the work what AaronS and Blahblahblah are doing to destroy this article. The only policy that AaronS seems to have heard of is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and yet, sadly, he has no actual grasp of it. Also, there are several other editors who agree with my edits. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELingeron_802e.html" title="User:Lingeron"><font color="#003366" face="Verdana">Sha</font></a><font color="#006666" face="Veranda">nnon</font><sup><a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELingeron_ee69.html" title="User talk:Lingeron"><font color="#3906A2">duck talk</font></a></sup> 03:53, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>The Ungovernable Force, when I study I like to study the actual history and the events that happened rather than rely on another researcher's point of view. I like to just get the facts and then draw my own conclusions. It's like reading a newspaper. One can read a right or left leaning paper, where some of the facts are left out, and come to right or left leaning conclusions.

<dd>All the attacks come from the same B-type sub-net 83.5.*.* . The attacker is an obvious sockpuppet of an established user. All the contributions of the anonyms is just some reverts of Ghirlandajo's edits (mostly picked up from some stale edit war) and more or less abusive complains on Ghirlandajo. Some users suspect that the anonym is a sockpuppet of <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">User:Molobo</a> circumventing his one-year block, but on this stage I am almost sure that it is not the case.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am tring to get to the bottom of this, but as a first step I indeed semi-protected a few articles. The anonym's puppetmuster is an established user and can edit semiprotected articles if he wish <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 13:15, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course attacks and stalking are newspeak for editing and increased scrutiny after the incidents I have posted above, providing the rationale for my actions (<a href="../../../s/o/r/Sortavala.html" title="Sortavala">Sortavala</a> being the first case, where he used deliberately inflammatory language "reunited with Russia"). Notice the stress put on the word "attack" as to discredit me. I am hopeful the actions of the above mentioned pair will be brought to the attention of a much wider audience, especially Alex's protectorate over Ghirla's unhindered slander.

<dd>While I agree with Alex that we are seeing sockpuppetry here, and with the disclaimer I have not reviewed all edits of those anons, those that I have does not look like attacks. Yes, they are revert warring, but that requires two to tango, and I'd suggest protecting the articles and let Ghirla and the anon solve their differences on talk, unless there are anon edits that are clearly vandalism, I see no reason as far as content goes to penalize contributions of anons over that of registered editors. That said, on the first sign that the anon main goal is indeed not content creation but some kind of trolling, vandalism or harassment, I would fully support semi-protection and/or ban.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus"><font style="color:#006400;background:#7CFC00;">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</font></a><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 14:47, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alex, did you have a good look at the contributions of the last mentioned IP? One of them was on Telex' talk page. It was (later?) signed NikoSilver. As I was on that page a little bit later, I actually told Ghirla and Irpen on their talk pages NOT to worry about this IP because it was Nikos who forgot to log in. Now I am starting to wonder: of course, there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY Nikos could be this stalker, so, there <b>could</b> be something "funny" going on here. Unfortunately, I cannot reconstruct what happened, because Telex archived that part of his talk page.

<dd>Piotrus, if there is someone who is habitually crossing the border, it's sort of a community service to get the roots of the problem exposed. I know that mounting an RFAR is painful and time consuming, but, especially if one party refuses to mediate, it's the only way to separate the issues and get a more lasting solution. N.b. I have no opinion whatever on the merits of the case and have had no poor dealings with any of the editors in question.

<p>I am afraid Elonka have to learn to read English language here. There was no <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_slur.html" title="Ethnic slur">ethnic slur</a> (although there was a mild personal attack) directed to poles. This misunderstanding is particulatly noticeable from her remark at Ghirla's talk page: <i>I find this particular comment that you made about Poles being a type of "Holes", offensive</i>. The phrase in question is a quoted pun: "If people from Poland are called Poles, why aren't people from Holland called Holes?", and if it is offensive to anybody, they would be "people from Holland", not from Poland. I think <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">User:Friday</a> is overreacted here and kicked the hornet's nest indeed. As for 'rant against "the Poles"' it refers to indeed mildly unetical unilateral action of admin <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">user:Balcer</a>, who, being a participant of a certain discussion, unilaterally reverted the decision of another admin. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 22:08, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Balcer is not an admin. Perhaps you would like to double-check your other facts, too. And or the record, I find this 'mild personal attack' a highly offensive one.

<dd>I obviously second mikka's opinion. This is completely ridiculous. For instance, a few months ago, a user that will remain anonymous said "if he speaks Russian, drinks vodka and sings Katyusha - he's a Russian". However, he never got blocked for that, while I think we're talking about the same level of mild offense.</dd>
<dd>This whole story remains me of one alledged historical episode. Someone asked Churchill: "Why is there no anti-semitism in Great Britain?". And Churchill answered: "because we don't think Jews are cleverer than us", or something in that tune. A balanced and normal person does not care about such kind of petty remarks. IMHO, jumping on the gun because of such remarks only reveals one's hypersensitivity and insatisfaction, and not much else...&#160;:(</dd>

<p>whoa, could somebody review this block? Ghirlandajo said nothing like "Poles are holes", kindly look at the diffs in context. This appears to be a typical case of nationalist editors ganging up until one feels compelled to shake them and ask <i>what</i> is it with your precious nationality. Taken out of context, such exasperation can be too easily dennounced as "ethnic slurs". Nationalism (the bad kind, as opposed to sane mild patriotism) is evil and has no place on Wikipedia. I recognize Ghirlandajo himself sometimes shows nationalist inclinations, so I leave it to a completely uninvolved party to review this. A comment of "the Poles [the Polish nationalist editors on Wikipedia] treat other Wikipedians as holes", while not necessarily inspired as a pun, cannot be taken as a block reason without looking at some context. thanks, <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 22:16, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ghirla objects to what he alleges is a "morbid Polonization of Wikipedia". He does not as much as object to a "moderate Polonization". I see no ethnic slur here, the question is rather whether there was indeed "morbid" nationalist edits on the part of Polish editors, or if Ghirla is exaggerating. To establish this, context is needed. Either way, I see no ethnic slur. I know Wikipedia gets a lot of nationalist crap, and sometimes the perpetrators come here calling "discrimination" if people object. This appears to be such a classic case.

<p>As I said before, if anyone thinks I made a mistake <i>please</i> adjust the block as you see fit - that includes removing it altogether. I thought the gratuitous grouping together of editors by nationality was sufficent grounds for a block given the recent warnings and other history here, but I could easily be wrong. I'll admit I have a strong personal bias against prejudice and racism, and that's what I thought I saw here. I don't intend to let editors blame problems on this or that ethnicity or nationality. It creates a poisonous atmosphere. I'm not at all suggestion that either side is right or without blame- I merely reacted to the diff I gave in the block notice. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 23:38, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ditto! I don't have any personal argument with Ghirlandajo, yet I get offended as a Pole. What is really sad in this case, is that the behaviour repeats continuously, causing additional problems, like showing other editors that this way of addressing Poles is perfectly acceptable in Wiki and worth following as arguments in discussing articles. I also find it disturbing that such respectable editors like Mikka and others defend Ghirlandajo in this case, because it only encourages him in his misbehaviour, and assures him that he can be above Wiki policies.--<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> | <a href="../../../s/y/l/User_talk%7ESylwiaS_f9ed.html" title="User talk:SylwiaS">talk</a> 00:52, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am afraid Sylvia you are in a yet another confusion about cause and effect, deed and punishment. Imagine a child running here and there making mischiefs, big and small. Parents toleare hiw up to a cetain point of losing patience, and when this boy spills a tea on the table he gets spanked and deprived of computer games for a week for "bad behavior". The boy is genuinely bewildered: to be grounded for a week for a spilt tea!!!! Here is exactly the same case: Ghirla was blocked for spilt tea. I don't know and don't care how long and heavily he offended Poles before, but at this very moment the block is a typical knee-jerk reaction. If Poles want to block Ghirla, let them sweat a bit and collect a solid evidence. But if someone wants to modify Ghirla's behavior, a genuine peacekeeper must be involved. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 03:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So you are saying that Ghirla should be blocked for something else? Feel free to do so, I will not object. Linked RfC had more then enough evidence, plus all the recent evidence from the past few days, all nicely linked above. That's not solid enough? As for genuine peacekeeper, as Ghirla doesn't call for mediators and habitually removes criticism from his talk, as was suggested here, RfArb is the only option, but I think evidence is 'solid' enough that it is not needed.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 04:50, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that the tea is a problem here. The problem rather is that I don't have to imagine a child, in this case I simply see a child, and I think it's high time to grown up! Really what's so difficult with stating arguments like: <i>not according to this source...</i> instead of blaming everything on the opponents' nationality? I don't think that Poles want to block Ghirla, rather they/we are looking for the best way to put this madness to an end. Perhaps you're right that it's not a good way to modify his behaviour, but would you consider mediating with him? I tried and as you can see without success.

<dd>I already said that somewhere (PLWNB?) that I hate to see Ghirlandajo return to his bad old ways. Following the previous RfC and the ArbCom decision, it seemed that the things have gotten a tad better. Some minor accusations of conspiracy here and there, some personal remarks from time to time, but not in large numbers, as it used to be before. However, if his campaign aimed at offending Poles is to continue, I believe the matter should be solved - and the faster the better.</dd>
<dd>It's not up to me to judge whether the current block is legitimate or not. I'm the person offended and I should not be the judge in my own case. However, I must underline that racist remarks, based solely on someone's nationality, are not what Wikipedia wants. If Ghirla wanted to call me personally a fanatic - it's his choice. But calling my mom, my neighbour, Adam Mickiewicz and Marie Curie fanatics just because Ghirlandajo did not know how to stick to civil behaviour is definitely a step too far. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 06:16, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Halibutt, please, don't put things in other people mouth. You know exactly what Ghirla meant and what he didn't mean. When you made your own "Russian/Vodka/Katyusha" or "Russian steal watches from Poles" remarks, I knew exactly what to make out of it and what it was not. The matter did not end up with a sneaky report at the boards that may lead to blocks. So, we don't need you bringing up Adam Mickiewicz, Marie Curie and especially your mom. You know perfectly all right that those were not in the remarks in the first place. So, please move your unwarranted indignation out of this case.</p>
<p>There were no blockable offences here as there weren't in your case. The block needs reviewed and lifted. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 06:32, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry Irpen, but I can't agree with you. Any generalizations based on someone's race or nationality are harmful, and especially so when presented as an argument in a discussion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66187166" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66187166" rel="nofollow">Here</a> Ghirlandajo disagreed with Balcer's interpretation of a proper WP:RM procedure. But his argument was not that WP:RM does this or that, but that <i>The Poles treat other wikipedians as holes (as usual).</i>. First of all this is slander. A clear-cut case of inciting bad emotions towards one particular group and generalizing one's own beliefs into a remark on the entire nation. I'm a wikipedian yet my mom (who is much more of a Pole than me, BTW) does not treat me like hole. Nor do I treat Ghirlandajo like hole - neither accidentally nor as a general rule. So his remark is not only offensive (as evidenced by numerous declarations above) and wrong, but also misleading and apparently consciously and deliberately aimed at spreading bad word of a particular group. As such, this single case is a clear-cut violation of etiquette and civility. As such, this is a perfect example of a blockable offence.</dd>
<dd>Having said that, I also admit that perhaps this particular case is not as grave as countless others. However, Ghirlandajo's long and colourful history of offending other Wikipedians (RfC, ArbCom) makes him quite vulnerable, as it is somehow less likely people would assume his good will in such borderline cases, when he's proven on numerous occasions to be uncivil in even more obvious situations. The benefit of a doubt works well only up to a certain point, and I'm afraid Ghirla has crossed it a long time ago.</dd>
<dd>Oh, and I must say I'm glad you still remember one of the best jokes I ever read. I mean my comment explaining what a stereotypical Russian is to the westerners, then taken out of context and presented as an alleged proof of uncivil behaviour by no other person but... Ghirlandajo. During my past RfA I even proposed him to report me somewhere for others to check whether I crossed the lines, but he decided to ignore that... <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 06:51, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's getting really too far, dear friends. First of all, as it was exposed above, <b>there was no ethnic slur</b>. We have a deceiving complaint and, unfortunately, an immediate block instead of the investigation. Second, grouping of editors by nationality is a sad practice, that frequently happens, but throwing blocks for that is a new development. I am not sure how far this will go even though, I was never an opponent per se of the practice of the blocks issued by admins' personal judgement. I can provide plenty of examples of other users, grouping colleagues by the nationality, and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Portal_talk%7EPoland_Poland-related_Wikipedia_notice_board_Archive_6_32ab.html#History_repeats_itself" title="Portal talk:Poland/Poland-related Wikipedia notice board/Archive 6">Piotrus have done that as well</a>. <a href="../../../u/k/r/User%7EUkrained_0b14.html" title="User:Ukrained">User:Ukrained</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexPU_ea69.html" title="User:AlexPU">user:AlexPU</a> habitually call their opponents by nationality <i>all the time</i>. I suggest you check their edit summaries and/or talk page entries, recent or from months ago is up to you. They are there anytime. There were no blocks and no one even asked for blocks.</p>
<p>What we see here is a sad practice of certain users who try to "win" through having their opponents blocked by any possible means. Sadly, this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;oldid=55185746#Adding_tag_4_times_within_24h" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;oldid=55185746#Adding_tag_4_times_within_24h" rel="nofollow">not the first time Piotrus is doing that</a>. Even more sad is that some buy into this and issue blocks without proper investigation. There has recently been an <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive52_daf7.html#Hasty_Blocking_by_Some_Administrators" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive52">extensive post by myself at WP:AN</a>, now available in the archive <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive52_daf7.html#Hasty_Blocking_by_Some_Administrators" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive52">here</a>. Many people provided further input to it and commented that it was "a good read". I suggest those who find this issue worth of attention but unfamiliar with that past discussion check the link to the archives. In an interesting coincidence, soon after that I was blocked myself at the trolls provocation (see <a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html#Your_policy_on_edit-warring" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">this</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/p/User_talk%7EIrpen_8b93.html#Edit_warring_2" title="User talk:Irpen">this</a> for details).</p>
<p>I would ask <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> and/or some uninvolved admin to give the issue a full review and <i>then</i> they will hopefully see that the block here is simply a mistake, at least. If they agree that the block is unwarranted, I respectfully request the block reversed <i>with an unblocking summary</i> that would clearly state the error in the initial block. What is written in the block logs matters sometimes too. TIA, --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 02:00, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that there was no ethnic <i>slur</i>- I don't believe I ever said there was. However, complaints directed at a particular ethnic group are <i>still inappropriate here</i>. To me, if someone uses the word "nigger" <i>or</i> says something like "The blacks are causing trouble here" these are in the same ballpark and either remark is undesirable and unhelpful to the project. Also, I have to say, I don't believe this was a knee-jerk block on my part. I took some time- but, I admit, perrhaps it was only 10 minutes- to look things over. I saw a history of civility problems, and, what to me looked like a solid indicator of a current, ongoing problem. If someone has a problem with the behavior of a particular editor, or even a group of editors, it's ok to name them and criticize their edits. But remarks aimed at an ethnic group can serve no useful purpose, and do much harm. I appreciate any and all feedback, but so far I still stand by my block. The minute I personally thought it was a mistake, I'd undo it myself. I continue to invite any other admin to change the block if they feel it's appropriate. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 02:56, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Grouping editors by nationality is of course no basis for a criticism, and certainly not a block. But calling such a group with demeaning names (fanatics, etc.) is, and this is what Ghirla is guilty of. I am not currently involved with any content dispute with user Ghirlandajo, and so Irpen suggestion that I try to gain something by this block is a sad example of bad faith on the part of an otherwise reasonable contributor (and please note it was not me who reported this issue here, but another user who felt offendend, and if I count correctly there are at least four users so far who stated here they are offended by Ghirla, all of them in good standing). The link to archived discussions Irpen provides is interesting, but you seem to miss some key points: not all editors offences are equal, and Ghirla deserved his block, while other editors we talked about didn't. Lumping them together weakens your argument. That said, I ask that reviewing admins make sure that carefuly review the situation, especially the evidence of many repeated offences provided of Ghirlandajo provided at the talk of this thread, and the way Ghirlandajo attempted to defend himself (in essence telling all administrators to f... off, as referenced above). If this defence convinces you that the block is unwarranted, and Ghirlandajo should not be discouraged from breaking WP:CIV and related policies, so be it - but it will send a sad message throught community, one saying that we don't care about WP:CIV and it is impossible to do anything to users habitually breaking this policy.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 03:26, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whatever you say, immediate and harsh blocks are warranted only upon clear and heavy offense. Punishment for cumulative violation must follow the way of formal complaint, with reasonable deliberation. I hate to teach admins rules, but the normal way of non-acute case is to start with warning on the user page and with a request for an apology (and unoffensively, by the way). I've seen Elonka started this way, but unfortunately she did this in a confused fashion: Ghirla didn't call Poles holes, so no wonder he ignored Elonka's comment. 03:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree, but is a fact that the name in the Wikicorner of Culture/History/Ethnography/Geography it is a convenient shorthand to describe people writing about a particular country using the name of the main ethnos living there. We do not have a way to measure the pigmentation of somebody skin or a shape of his nose or even place of the residence using the name of wikipedian's account. In that sense "Russians" include me (self-described Australian Jew), Irpen (Ukrainian) or e.g. Pan Gerwazy (Belgian with a limited knowledge of Russian), and does not include e.g. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">User:Oleg Alexandrov</a>, who is interested in mathematics, not Russia. The same is with the "Poles", as far as I can tell from the self-descriptions, some people referred in Wikipedia as Poles do not live in Poland, some are not ethnic Poles and there are some who can not read Polish. Still they are sometimes described as Poles since they share interest to Poland and some sort of a polonocentric point of view. I share the feeling that it is counter-productive to divide editors by any (supposedly warring) groups but in situations of achieving some balanced view such divisions are sometimes inevitable. E.g. 48 hours that Ghirlandajo would not work on wiki means quite a lot to me or other "Russians" since we will probably miss a couple DYK-quality articles and a number of stubs plus a lot of smaller wiki-related activities. Quite possible it looks in a different light for e.g. Piotrus.</dd>

<dd>I would rather not see any ethical jokes on wiki, since someones light inoffensive joke for is a grave national insult for a somebody else and I wish to say sorry to all (been they Poles or Dutch) who feel offended. But I do not see sufficient venom it, nor did I remember any other ethnic joke or slur from Ghirlandajo. I might see the grounds for a short block to send a message but IMHO 48 h for the first offence of this kind to an extremely productive editor is very excessive. I am partial here, so I would not shorten the block myself, but I ask uninvolved admins to review it. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 03:43, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you have a link to a policy that sais that blocks can't be done for cumulative offences? I thought that happened often, with escalating blocks for cumulative 3RR violations and such. I am not sure how much cumulative offences of Ghirla weighted on Friday's judgement, but there is enough immediate offences (linked above) to warrant his block for it. And yes, Alex, Ghirla block looks different to me: it means I am not likely to be called a 'Polack', 'nationalist', 'rogue' or offended in other way by Ghirla for that period, and neither is any other Polish editor. That said, I agree that blocking of Ghirla is not perfect solution, but you have to weight his contribution against those of editors he scarred/offended off wiki, and those forced to discuss here instead of writing content (like me). The perfect solution is Ghirla behaves in a civil way and he is not blocked ever again. Barring that, we have two solutions: either we let him violate <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> in exchange for his contributions, in effect saying that if a user is active enough he can violate Wiki policies that he doesn't like, or we block him for violations of WP:CIV until he learns to behave. If you prefer the first solution, please don't hesitate to sumbit WP:CIV for AfD, as it will mean we don't really need such a toothless do-gooder policy. --<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 05:01, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I second the review demand. All Piotrus proved here is his inability to withstand even the slightest amount of criticism. As I said earlier in this thread, any normal and balanced person should not be affected by such comments.</dd>
<dd>If someone makes such a kind of comment to me (be it on Wikipedia or IRL), well I'll just shrug and walk away. If you jump on the gun for every kind of such a remark, you're either:
<dl>
<dd>a) A fanatic nationalist thinking your nation is perfect.</dd>
<dd>b) A person with a blessed ego that takes everything on his personal account because of an oversized pride feeling.</dd>
<dd>c) Someone deliberately attempting to block a user.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I let you choose the answer which you think is right, but in any case, running around yelling "OMG! My nationality and my pride were insulted, OMG!" is a quite poor way of reacting.</dd>
<dd>Finally, you will notice that Piotrus always unblocked his favorite <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">disruption specialist</a> without even bothering with a block review.</dd>
<dd>Based on all this, I request a review. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 11:48, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, let's decompose the post above, as well as the previous one by Piotrus to expose the issue properly:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"I am not currently involved with any content dispute with user Ghirlandajo"</i> cannot be taken seriously. The dispute between you and few others with similar POV and Ghirla is perpetual and never ending. And even right now there are edit disputes.</li>
<li>Of course you <i>"gain something"</i> from this block, despite you deny it, as for incredible editors like Ghirla blocks are especially humiliating and disrespectful. Such blocks often resulted in them leaving the project altogether in disgust while trolls happily return or reincarnate through socks. Don't tell me that you won't be happy to see Ghirla gone. You wrote yourself some time ago, and I thoroughly agree with that statement of yours, that you main problem with Ghirla is his edits, not other stuff. So, its not his remarks, but the edit disputes that is your primary consern, and I must say, I agree with you. I've seen worse from some here and can't care less until the POV-pushing goes into the articles.</li>
<li>Your claim that it was <i>"not you"</i>, who reported is here is a <b>total hypocricy</b>. It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AElonka&amp;diff=65991160&amp;oldid=65946590" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AElonka&amp;diff=65991160&amp;oldid=65946590" rel="nofollow">you who wrote Elonka</a>, asking her to take action, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=65991160" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=65991160" rel="nofollow">specifically pointing her to WP:ANI</a> to make sure the action above is taken. And now you claim <i>it was not you</i>? At least next time you use off-Wiki space for behind the scenes dealings.</li>
<li>The rest is your desperate attempt to make sure this blocks stays. This is not new either. You are trying to have him blocked all the time (including a false 3RR report you once submitted) and your input to the discussion above seems to be

<li>Well, yes, I am perpetually being attacked by Ghirla, so by this reasoning, yes, I am in diapute with him, but I don't recall we have edited the same article in in the past week or even a month in any content dispute (reverts and such) manner.</li>
<li>Yes, one of the main problems with Ghirla is his tendency to engage in revert wars (which already resulted in him being banned for short time some time ago, December, I believe). But his extremly uncivil behaviour causing other editors to leave this project is another major concern. And yes, I don't deny that I and many others would gain from him stopping his relentless assault on WP:CIV, although we would all prefer this is achieved through him learning civility, not leaving the project.</li>
<li>Get your facts straight. It was not me who reported it here, but Elonka (although I support her actions, no doubt about it). And it was her first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APiotrus&amp;diff=65992025&amp;oldid=65894853" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APiotrus&amp;diff=65992025&amp;oldid=65894853" rel="nofollow">who suggested ANI</a> as the place to report it. So please apologize for 'total hypocrisy'.</li>
<li>Yes, Irpen, I fully support this block and I have long tried to make community take notice of his behaviour, thank you for pointing that out, willing editors can easily use those links to follow back to yet other specific offensive comments by Ghirla that caused me to comment on them.</li>
<li>I find it saddening that some editors feel Ghirla should be given the right to break WP:CIV, but hopefully statements by others - like Friday, Balcer, Sylwia, Halibutt and others - show that many in the community don't approve of his behaviour.</li>
<li>Mikka, wrong facts. My post does not refer to the comment Ghirla later stroke out (a commendable refactoring on his part), but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=66187545&amp;oldid=66187166" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=66187545&amp;oldid=66187166" rel="nofollow">to a similar if even more offending comment he made immediatly afterwards</a>. This shows that he does not really understand - or wants to understand - what Elonka asked him to do. To use your 'little boy' metaphor: a boy scolded for calling a person 'moron' sais: 'I am sorry I called you a fanatic, you fanatic.' I am afraid this does not show good faith on the part of the boy, nor Ghirla. And yours and Irpen's toleration of his abusive behaviour is not helping.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 06:49, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I will note that I have no idea why my name is at hte top of that list. I even prefaced my comment by saying I was expressing no opinion on the block. I don't have a problem with an admin enforcing civility, only in the complainants coming here and dragging this along in many places, including my talk page before, when, as the top of this page makes clear, such is not dispute resolution (note "Please take such disputes to mediation, requests for comment, or <i>requests for arbitration</i> rather than here."). I have yet to be satisfied with any response to my suggestion. ArbCom is not just for clear cases or complicated cases, mostly, it offers calm for tough cases that are tense and can find no consensus.

<li>Piotrus, no current content dispute? How about WP:RM discussions to start with?</li>
<li>I also had problems with a good friend of yours breaking various policies on myself. Not only I did not attempt to get him blocked through biased announcements at WP:ANI, I did not try to inflame the conflicts by posting announcements at RU:Portal where those would find lots of interested readers. You, OTOH, as Alex pointed out, always inflame matters by posting your "indignation" at PL boards</li>
<li>Yes, report was submitted by Elonka, but only after you first pointed her attention to the matter and specifically recommended this board. And then you disclaim the authorship of this matter assigning it to Elonka. I called it a hypocrisy then and I called it so for what I saw and still see it.</li>
<li>Yes, you supported the block of a invaluable contributor, and, as I pointed out, you see nothing wrong in attempting to see your opponents blocked. Links are above</li>
<li>I do not approve Ghirla's remark. I just see the block one sided, harmful and unfair.</li>
<li>There is no toleration and support for the unfortunate statements Ghirla occasionally made. There is simply a strong opposition that anything here amounts to a block.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a highly controversial and harmful block. <i>All I am requesting is a review</i> and not another set of accusations by the party which achieved its goal of blocking and (I hope not) expelling the content dispute opponent. This block is unwarranted and should reversed. Two Russian admins said so, but did not interfere for ethical reasons (something Piotrus should learn to do as well).</p>
<p>I request the matter reviewed by an uninvolved admin who would <i>read this discussion</i>, click on the links and makes a judgement. This will take time, but taking on admin duties was a serious commitment and the preventing the harm of loosing or even unnecessarily aggravating an invaluable editor is worth of the admin's time. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 09:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Setting aside that even Ghirla himself couldn't recall any interaction with me, care to provide a link to the article we had content dispute in? Reverted each others edits, etc.? Barring that, a talk page where we engaged in a meaningful discussion? All in the past week or two, preferably (I am not denying that occasionaly, last time I think over a month ago, I do encounter Ghirla in article or talk pages and sometimes we disagree).</li>
<li>So what relevance does it have to this case that you did not bring some matter here?</li>
<li>I am not denying, as I wrote above, that I asked several users on various occasions to look into Ghirla's behaviour. I am not the only one to do so, and I don't consider myself an initator of the discussion on ANI, it's as simple as that. Of course I joined it, but that's is not justifying your acussations of hypocrisy.</li>
<li>If my opponents deserve a block, I see nothing wrong in taking the matters to a proper place (like AN) and asking neutral admins to review the case. And I don't consider Ghirla an invaluable contributor: his contributions can be counted and valued, and while indeed they are immense, there are not 'invaluable'. Just a minor point of NPOV&#160;:)</li>
<li>I am glad you don't approve of his remark. Nonetheless I still see his two year harassment of editors (Poles and others) as one sided, harmful and unfair, and current block as part of the remedy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This block is only controversial if one thinks that breaking WP:CIV is not enough for a warrant block. To this day, however, Wikipedia community has not given WP:CIV any lesser value then to its other policies, and it has not given editors immunity if they are very active. Feel free to suggest changes in relevant policies, if you want to give Ghirla immunity from breaking WP:CIV.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 15:24, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think you've got to do quite a bit of mental gymnastics to make this out as an "ethnic slur". If anything, it was a slur against Dutch people, although I doubt many Dutch would be offended by it. If Ghirla is occassionally abrasive towards certain users, it's because they've been after his head for ages. Piotrus and Halibutt have been targeting Ghirla for quite some time. The origin of it all is frustration over PolCab, the perceived "Polish cabal", where highly nationalistic Polish editors use their notice board to congregate and use collective effort to POV push and win revert wars. Ghirla being Wikipedia's main Russian history contributor became a victim. Ghirla is ordinarily a nice guy, and a quite exceptional contributor to wikipedia. At the very least, wiki admins should exercise some caution before blocking a top class user like Ghirla. I'll admit that Elonka, who reported it, is not one of Ghirla's traditional enemies. And I agree with her that some action should be taken by an admin, but this should be to discuss grievances and rebuild mutual respect, rather than exercising a ban which Ghirla will (perhaps rightly) perceive as a personal victory by Halibutt and Piotrus' one-upmanship. <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 12:55, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Piotrus, that page was a sham opened by you. If I was going to waste my time patricipating in a mediation page, it certainly wouldn't be in one like that. As to Polcab itself, I know you don't want anyone mentioning its existence, but sometimes it just comes up. Sorry if Polcab makes me rude sometimes, and yeah, I do share Ghirla's frustration sometimes. But almost everyone who had encountered Polcab has a similar reaction. I hope to be a changed man in future, and to keep my cool despite the provocation of you, Halibutt and other members of Polcab. Sorry that you still bear hard fellings Pete, I hope things will be better in future. As for this, isn't it better to concentrate here on the particular allegations against Ghirla, rather than assaulting the characters of everyone who appears to be defending him?

<dd>And this is how Calgacus tries to discredit my comments, while incriminating an innocent user, probably thinking he can kill two birds with his mighty stone. Your smug attitutute is eerily reminiscent of Ghirlandajo's- it wouldnt be you who is his puppet, or just some evil twin? Besides, youre not doing him any good, as accusing critics of Ghirlandajo's practices as being fanatics, trolls, nationalists and socks doesnt serve his case. Anyway, the evidence is there, straight from the "horse's mouth". Regards. 83.5.247.158 15:38, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your violent verbal campaign against others in your defence of Ghirlandajo's incivility isnt helping his case. Ghirlandajo just needs to change his antics- it's in his own good that he smarten up. That's my answer to your OT insinuations. 83.5.247.158 16:34, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Molobo, I don't think it's fair to characterize my defence of Ghirla as a "violent verbal campaign", do you? I know you don't really. Anyways, I've said my bit. All I'm doing now is responding to character assassinations. And that's not why I'm on wiki. <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 17:00, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To the rest- youre kind of missing the point... while the comment alone mightnt have warranted a block, it was the proverbial drop in the bucket to Ghirlandajo's abuse spree. Repeat offenders receive less tolerance, that's just the way it is. Maybe this will teach him to show more respect for his fellow contributors? 83.5.247.158 16:48, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find it really funny. People keep pointing out how bad Molobo’s English is and that it’s one of the reasons for which his edits spoil articles, and in the same time they accuse other editors of being Molobo. I’ll say only this, Molobo and this anon user could be one person only if Molobo took a speedy (and a very successful) English course.--<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> | <a href="../../../s/y/l/User_talk%7ESylwiaS_f9ed.html" title="User talk:SylwiaS">talk</a> 17:03, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, I would like to point out this is a second block Ghirla has gotten for incivlity, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Ghirlandajo" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Ghirlandajo" rel="nofollow">first one being from July 7, 2006 by Circeus for 'incivility in edit summaries'</a>. Nonetheless I am not going to oppose Mikka unblock, even through he is not a neutral admin here: the block has lasted for 24h, which is a reasonable progression from the last 3h block, and there is a chance Ghirla will be more careful now. If he will not, then I expect community to implement further, longer blocks, and/or start an RfArb. Still, let's hope Ghirla has learned his lesson, will respect <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> and we will never have to revisit this case.

<p>SlimVirgin deleted evidence I was offering to support my complaint and to respond to accusations. You may review this history to see how this happened.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[74]</a>. I made my complaint and then when challenged, I offered further evidence and since it is difficult to read the history given the fact that it has been deleted without clear edit summary, I posted the salient passages that I restored. Slim then came along and "ruled" it to be "trolling" and deleted my post. That doesn't seem appropriate, does it? How may Wiki users make complaints if admins come along and simply revert and remove comments from their complaints? It is appropriate for administrators to remove evidence offered by users to back up their complaints on this notice board? Thanks.Ptmccain 22:05, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd appreciate others looking into comments left recently on my talk page from <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_Wilson_MSP_356d.html" title="User:Allan Wilson MSP">User:Allan Wilson MSP</a> and relating to the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Wilson_%28Scottish_politician%29_903f.html" title="Allan Wilson (Scottish politician)">Allan Wilson (Scottish politician)</a> article. These recent messages start at <a href="../../../w/a/n/User_talk%7EWangi_dad5.html#Party_Political_Smearing" title="User talk:Wangi">User talk:Wangi#Party Political Smearing</a> and for three sections below - I have not responding to any of them.</p>
<p>Previous discussion with this user (on 22 July) is at <a href="../../../w/a/n/User_talk%7EWangi_dad5.html#Recent_edits_to_Allan_Wilson_.28MSP.29_.2F_Allan_Wilson_.28Scottish_politician.29" title="User talk:Wangi">User talk:Wangi#Recent edits to Allan Wilson (MSP) / Allan Wilson (Scottish politician)</a>, and edits related to this can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060724220834&amp;limit=100&amp;target=Wangi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060724220834&amp;limit=100&amp;target=Wangi" rel="nofollow">here</a>. All edits were cleanups and a move of the article to a more common disambiguation. Discussion at the time was well mannered and ended in consensus.</p>
<p>In short i'm confused by the user's speel (attack even) toward me... He seems to have taken insult by me removing non-encylopedic trivia (the line <i>He is married and has two sons. Outside politics he was a keen footballer and a well known member of the Ayrshire football fraternity</i>) and disambiguating the article using common "(Scottish politician)" rather than "(MSP)" - I only done this single article because, well you know that's all I had time to do. and as for sock puppets, well I never knew or said a thing...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Edit: I also seem to have redirected the user's page to the article - at the time I thought it was a duplicate article (missed the "User:" at the front). <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">User:Commander Keane</a> deleted the redirect. /<a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangi_79ab.html" title="User:Wangi">wangi</a> 15:02, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We have to guard against cases where someone uses the name of a famous person as their username, and then deliberately does prejudicial things in the hope of besmirching the reputatation of that person. That's a danger particularly in the case of politicians, where such abuse could be followed up by a report to a newspaper. This account hasn't done anything like that yet, but <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a> is clear, where it says "Names of well-known living or recently deceased people" aren't acceptable usernames. Consequently I've indefinately blocked this account (and if, as your post above suggests, they've created several other accounts then those should be blocked too). I've left a (hopefully polite) message on the account's talk page, asking them to email the OTRS list from their official (presumably GSI.gov.uk) email address - with that confirmation I guess the OTRS volunteers will feel able to confirm he's editing with Allan Wilson's permission and he can be unblocked. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 20:31, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks Finlay, the suggestion above regarding the other accounts was from the user... Rather surprising because i'd not noticed nor said a peep. The language and tone of the posts today are very different from those on the 22nd - I really do think it's two different people. On the whole I'm just taken aback by the whole bad faith of it all, especially when I took time to explain things originally and all my edits were in good faith and well explained...

<dd>For now at least, I really wouldn't bother to respond to it. If he turns out to be the real deal, fair enough, but if not then engaging him in discussions is only feeding his trolling. If you see other accounts with variations on this name, or those of other Scottish politicians (both of which this account claimed were impending) they should be blocked for the same reason. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 23:09, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_in_the_Closet_%28South_Park_episode%29#Satire" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_in_the_Closet_%28South_Park_episode%29#Satire" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_in_the_Closet_%28South_Park_episode%29#Satire</a> (see history)</p>
<p>There is a contribution that I feel is valid and is public knowledge. South Park has an episode about Scientology (episode 912) This episode lampoons Scientology and some celebrities go into the closet (and stay there) Frank Zappa has a song that Lampoons Scientology (A TOKEN OF MY EXTREME, from album JOES GARAGE, 1979) This song also pokes fun at Scientology and going 'into the closet' as well.</p>
<p>Both are Satires Both are about Scientology Both use the words "in the closet" Both use sexual innuendo T here are no other satirical works of any form or fashion that deal with both Scientology and Closets.</p>
<p>This makes them uniquely similar. Any speculation toward any direction has been edited out due to Antaeus Feldspar's tenacious attack of this contribution of mine</p>
<p>user: Antaeus Feldspar said to me...</p>
<p>"First of all, no evidence has been presented that it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Even if it is -- what is it, besides trivia? Does it give us a reason to look at the episode differently? Not really. Secondly, please acquaint yourself with the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three-revert rule</a>. You haven't broken it yet, but I want to be sure that you have received adequate notice. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:20, 28 July 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>Antaeus Feldspar, I am sure, is trying to uphold the quality of the community, but in this correspondence, he admits that at best my contribution to the entry is "trivia." This is why I placed it in the "trivia" section. He seems to speak for everyone when he says "does it give US a reason..." I am not offering opinions here, I am offering facts that bridge two parodies of a similar vein.</p>
<p>He has personally reverted this entry three times, then issued a warning to ME.</p>
<p>If it is simply a matter of how I am choosing my words, please let me know. All the information I have put into this is factual, and I took every step to revise to Antaeus Feldspar's specifications but I need your help now because I am afraid we are dealing with a "pissing contest" now.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Here is the line from the article that I edited... first I put it in trivia, I kept budging... Feldspar wouldnt let up. He finally deleted it with a warning:</p>
<p>Frank Zappa's song A TOKEN OF MY EXTREME is another satirical work that contains both a parody of Scientology and going into the closet.</p>

<li>N.b. The three revert rule does not apply to vandalism reversions. If your edits are against the consensus established on the talk page of the article, and if they're clearly so, you may ask others to take a look to see, but it is quite likely, given AF's long history of careful administrative work and uncontroversial judgment, that he believed that your editing had crossed the line from adding to the article to insisting upon having your way, and so the three revert rule would not necessarily be in force. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:26, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is an ordinary content dispute. I am not happy, of course, that 68.174.124.232 decided to make his response to this dispute over content the filing of a report to AN/I that, when all the sound and fury is stripped away, amounts to 'He won't let me get my way! He said the factoid I wanted to include wasn't suitable for Wikipedia! He quoted all sorts of policies at me to explain why! Make him take it <b>back</b>!'</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Though I am sure the factoid in question seems very significant to 68.174.124.232, let me restate it in a way that I think expresses all the significance to be found in it:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of all the previous works, in a variety of media, that satirized or criticized Scientology before <i>South Park</i> took their turn with "Trapped in the Closet", at least one of them also used the phrase "in the closet".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's really it. I should note that 68.174.124.232 <i>now</i> claims that the Frank Zappa song in question is the <b>only</b> previous work satirizing Scientology that has ever used the phrase "in the closet", but he has given no indication of who performed the exhaustive survey of past literature that would allow such a comprehensive statement. It is my strong feeling that if we are to present this factoid as having some sort of significance (and I would argue that the way it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trapped_in_the_Closet_%28South_Park_episode%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66324928" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trapped_in_the_Closet_%28South_Park_episode%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66324928" rel="nofollow">originally inserted in the article</a> attempted to assert just such significance) that we need a reliable source to assert that it has such significance. Since 68.174.124.232 thinks that it's enough for it to be an "interesting co-incidence" (such co-incidences being "what comprise all science") <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=66419821&amp;oldid=66197046" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=66419821&amp;oldid=66197046" rel="nofollow">[76]</a> and did not seem to be taking any other view seriously, I felt that it might be appropriate to warn him about the three-revert rule early. Some might criticize this, but I confess I have never understood why it is considered by some better to let people know about this rule only when and after they have broken it. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:25, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Continuing to revert well past 3RR still doesn't solve anything. The correct course of action would've been to get administrator attention to block the IP address or sprotect the page, not just continuing to allow the disruption by repeatedly reverting. Still, blocks are preventative, not punitive, and I don't think Ryulong is of danger to Wikipedia, especially seeing as how he is a vandal fighter, so ... I wouldn't reblock, but I hope he understands that there are better ways to deal with POV-pushers. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 03:50, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've got to say that it's not 3RR violation, if you're reverting vandalism, so the block ends up punishing the virtuous with the vicious, here.

<p>I reviewed the situation. The IP in question made edits identical to banned user <a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaR_GnitS_5982.html" title="User:YaR GnitS">User:YaR GnitS</a>, and identical to the entire article Gay ICP which was recently deleted (and also made by <a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaR_GnitS_5982.html" title="User:YaR GnitS">User:YaR GnitS</a>). The last edit of Gay ICP contained 4 references, none of which dealt with the issues raised, and, as such, I view the edits as being unsubstantiated. There has been discussion on <a href="../../../i/n/s/Talk%7EInsane_Clown_Posse_656d.html" title="Talk:Insane Clown Posse">Talk:Insane Clown Posse</a> about the removed passage since 14 July 2006, include commentary that it was likely vandalism.

<dd>Judgement call but I'd go with no. Merely suggesting that someone else seek legal advice about a matter doesn't seem a threat to me. Just my opinion.

<p>I have just spent several hours cleaning up really sneaky vandalism by User:24.181.67.89, who along with User:24.181.70.227 is pretty obviously a sock of permanently-blocked User:Woodylogan. All of them have the same edit pattern: making dozens of minor changes to articles on children's movies and the actors in them. Every single edit is to introduce misinformation such as changing the release year of movies, and listing actors from a sequel as actors in an original film when they weren't (and vice versa). The IP ending in 227 is just coming off an eight-day block. The one ending in 89 is on a 24 hour block.

<dd>The reason for deletion of the defamatory material from the talk page is that <i>the author of that material himself</i>, in a sworn affidavit with the Supreme Court of Queensland, referred to these articles as "articles that furthered the goal of defaming", and that where "based on no factual evidence" and contained implications that were "absolutely false and unfounded". On that basis the material was removed as being in violation of the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> policy that states:
<dl>
<dd>"Articles about living persons require a degree of sensitivity and must adhere strictly to Wikipedia's content policies.

<dd>I disagree, the retraction was never published by the reliable sources that published the negative information so the reliable sources are as valid as they ever were.

<p>As said above, that article did not appear in "reliable source<b>s</b>", but on an independed Sunday magazine (an "insert" as it is called). The magazine did not retract anything, because it did not need to. The article is not of the magazine, but of the author. And the author has clearly addressed that it was defamatory, in a sworn affidavit. As the defamatory comments relate to the personal life of the subject of this article, applying <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is required.

<dd>the policy is intended to avoid unfactual slander presented as fact. It doesn't prevent us from saying a living person has critics. As long as each instance of criticism is attributed to a source, I see no problem with WP:BLP. Whether a given criticism has sufficient notability is of course a content dispute: try <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">WP:PR</a>. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 22:29, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Perhaps administrative action is required here. Are you expressing your intent to engage in pointless edit warring?</i> When the editor removing the content believes (rightly or wrongly – sometimes in spite of reliable sources) that s/he is exempt from 3RR, it is hard to imagine how edit wars will not be the result. This policy is already being misinterpreted in other articles to cleanse criticism that is well sourced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Biographies_of_living_persons#Misinterpretation_of_BLP" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Biographies_of_living_persons#Misinterpretation_of_BLP" rel="nofollow">[83]</a>. As the policy becomes more widely known and potential for misinterpretation and/or abuse of the policy grows, a forum where one can appeal these situations – beyond the normal content dispute – may eventually be needed. The policy may embolden (by the exemption from 3RR) those who want to cleanse criticism to believe they are exempt from normal mediation and good faith negotiation and discussion. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 23:37, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Secondly, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_legal_threats_370c.html#Copyright_and_slander" title="Wikipedia:No legal threats">Wikipedia:No legal threats#Copyright and slander</a> allows for a response to perceived defamation. Also, I never made a threat that I would do something; rather I was pointing out the seriousness of his accusations and how, as I worte in my edit summaries, he had "crossed a line" from mere trolling to something more egregious. Thankfully, in <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_SkipSmith_d910.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/SkipSmith">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/SkipSmith</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">user:SkipSmith</a> clarified that I had nothing to do with the harrasment, whereupon I promptly removed the {{<a href="../../../d/e/f/Template%7EDefwarn_5734.html" title="Template:Defwarn">defwarn</a>}} as can be seen here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASkipSmith&amp;diff=65813822&amp;oldid=65797242" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASkipSmith&amp;diff=65813822&amp;oldid=65797242" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASkipSmith&amp;diff=65813822&amp;oldid=65797242</a> Lastly, the person which he claims has harraased him does not have a wiki account to my knowledge, as can be seen from this diff: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Actuarial_Outpost&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53950210" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Actuarial_Outpost&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53950210" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Actuarial_Outpost&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53950210</a> and no one argues that Glenn was the only webmaster at that time.

<dd><b>(2)</b> The accusation by investigators that my case was filed in bad faith violates a wikipedia norm: <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith</a> --- I actually compiled a plausible case if anyone bothered to read it.

All were blocked, including one of my work IP addresses where I was not logged in but clearly identified myself (in other words, clearly not a sock puppet). It is true that other accounts only edited Actuarial Outpost once or twice --- I believe the off-wiki harassment I documented above accounts for this.</dd>

<li>I'm sorry, but, oh, I don't believe a word of that. That is not off-wiki harassment. That does not put you in any danger whatsoever.</li>
<li><i>"That is grounds for a libel and slander suit."</i> — I do not feel that this is a legal threat; of course, this is my interpretation. I believe you are over exaggerating the phrase.</li>

<dd>Hello. Let me address your questions in order.
<dl>
<dd><b>(1)</b> My first point addresses your assumption that my sock puppet accusation was in bad faith, and was in retaliation for Avraham's sock puppet accusation. The times the cases were filed and that statement by Avraham show that his case was actually the retaliatory case.</dd>
<dd><b>(2)</b> It is simply untrue that I provide no evidence of my accusation, as anyone who bothers to read the accusation will see. At the minimum, I provided at least as much information as Avraham did in his case against me.</dd>
<dd><b>(3)</b> My third point is not related to the off-wiki harassment, but is rather related to the sock puppet case against me --- I have already stated above it is a user other than Avraham that is engaged in the off-wiki harassment. This point was pointing out another flaw in the sock puppet case against me. I mentioned the off-wiki harassment as the reason why some users edited just once and then never returned.</dd>
<dd><b>(4)</b> On the legal threats, I was actually going to let this slide until <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">User:WAvegetarian</a> was troubled by it. Perhaps we are both exaggerating the phrase, but with two people concerned by it might be worth discussing.</dd>
<dd><b>(5)</b> See my original concern with off-wiki harassment at the top of this section. <b>Someone is taking user IP addresses from wikipedia and using them to harass people at work.</b> Did you actually read and investigate my concerns here, or did you just jump in to belittle me and defend Avraham?
<dl>
<dd>Based on the tone of the response to my legitimate concerns here, I suspect <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_bc04.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima">User:Kilo-Lima</a> is not impartial in this matter. Incidentally, <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_bc04.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima">User:Kilo-Lima</a> is also the one who accused me of acting in bad faith with my sock puppet case against Avraham, and endorsed Avraham's case against me without investigating. I believe we need someone impartial to investigate my concerns. Thank you. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 20:45, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(2) Suspected sock puppet cases require diffs in order for an administrator to view and determine. You have not done so. Yes, and I agree now, that you <i>have</i> added evidence, but this is only in the form of quotes. It would be easier to add a <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diff.html" title="Diff">diff</a>. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_bc04.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima"><font color="#007FFF">Iola</font></a><b><a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_Esperanza_2625.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima/Esperanza"><font color="#50C878">k</font></a></b><a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_bc04.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima"><font color="#007FFF">ana</font></a>|<sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKilo-Lima_aad1.html" title="User talk:Kilo-Lima"><font color="orange">T</font></a></sup> 11:23, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi again. I think I know the point of confusion now. Since I'm fairly new to wikipedia, I didn't know the procedure to ask for a sock puppet investigation, so all I did first was put a sockpuppet warning on <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">User:Avraham</a>'s talk page without formally filing a case. Someone (you?) deleted it for having no evidence. Thus, I went back and read the actual rules for filing sockpuppet suspicions, and filed it formally with evidence as you now see. Could it be that you confused my earlier abortive attempt to file the case with the actual case I filed above, leading to your suspicions of bad faith? There was nothing in the instructions I read about using diffs, but I certaintly could have --- thanks for the tip in case I ever need to file a case in the future. However, I think this sock puppet case has already done more harm than good to the discussion on Actuarial Outpost, so I doubt I'll pursue it further.</dd>
<dd>However, one thing I do want to pursue is doing something about the off-wiki harassment by <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.7.136.166.html" title="User:64.7.136.166">64.7.136.166</a>. Is there any recourse to prevent this user from looking up IP addresses on wikipedia and faxing threats to people at work? Thanks. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 06:24, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You are either using deceptive methods to hide and destroy another users talk page or you are using deceptive methods to hide and destroy your own talk page. Either way, I recommend blocking both accounts (at least 48 hours so we can talk about this) and reverting the moves; also post this at Ste4k's RFAR. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 02:37, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The arbitration committee looks at all sides when user conduct is before arbitration. Ste4k would not be the first person who brought a case only to find herself at the wrong end of the hammer.

<li>Your overwriting the Talk page with other content was a deliberate attempt to hide Ste4k's Talk page. You could be blocked for disruption just as easily as he could be.

<dd>No need for CheckUser. CheckUser requests that we handle obvious socks without bothering them; this is an obvious Thewolfstar sock. The account pretends to be a new user, using the "clever trick", typical of Thewolfstar socks, of "ignorantly" asking how to sign talkpage entries. Yet it made a beeline for RFA, a sure sign of an experienced user, and generally knows its way around. It displays the same very unusual political interests profile as Thewolfstar, the identical unique aggressiveness, the same disintererest in article editing and the same ranting on talkpages. Also some telltale turns of phrase. And have people noticed the Bishonen angle? It knows and hates me (who originally blocked Thewolfstar indefinitely), and obviously followed my contributions to <a href="../../../m/s/t/User_talk%7EMSTCrow_0461.html" title="User talk:MSTCrow">User talk:MSTCrow</a>, a good place to rant. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:54, 29 July 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd><i>(bias disclosure:PRO-USERBOXES)</i> There have been a series of out-of-the-ordinary processes going on with userboxes for quite sometime, from deletions, salting, speedy this-is and speedy that-is. Thousands of userpages have been altered via the use of <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_GUS_UBX_to_b556.html" title="Template:User GUS UBX to">Template:User GUS UBX to</a> replacing userboxes that people have moved to userspace, then replacing the hard redirect with that soft redirect. I recently created a category to clean this up at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_GUS_userboxes_a233.html" title="Category:Wikipedia GUS userboxes">Category:Wikipedia GUS userboxes</a>. A small team of editors have been updating pages that have the GUX UBX to template, to the redirect. More discussion on this can be found at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category_talk%7EWikipedia_GUS_userboxes_c985.html" title="Category talk:Wikipedia GUS userboxes">Category talk:Wikipedia GUS userboxes</a>. Once the replacements have been completed, many of the original templates (the soft redirects with no edit history other than the soft redirect replacing the hard redirect after the move) have been getting speedy deleted. When deleting these, I've been utilizing <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G6" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G6</a> as "<b>Userbox since migrated to userspace under [[WP:GUS]] which now has no incomming links, and is a cross namespace redirect or a redirect to a deleted page. ([[WP:CSD#G6]] - housekeeping deletion)</b>". There are currently 102 templates left in this category. Some of them will not be workable under this housekeeping task (see the category talk re ist-&gt;ism template redirects). — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 13:51, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../g/u/s/WP%7EGUS_633c.html" title="WP:GUS">WP:GUS</a> is a loose alliance of editors and admins from various factions of the Great Userbox War. {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_GUS_UBX_to_b556.html" title="Template:User GUS UBX to">User GUS UBX to</a>}} is a tool to manage migrating userboxes from templatespace to userspace. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_GUS_userboxes_a233.html" title="Category:Wikipedia GUS userboxes">Category:Wikipedia GUS userboxes</a> was created because many editors/admins ignored the soft redirect's recommended usage: "As part of the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Wikipedia%7EGerman_userbox_solution_eb66.html" title="Wikipedia:German userbox solution">German userbox solution</a> to <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_3753.html" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes">userboxes</a> in template space, use this template on a REDIRECT page after <i>all</i> of the pages on "What links here" have been linked to the new "User:" page." Some admins (we all know who you are&#160;;-) just ignore process completely and delete more-or-less empty redirects, others, like Xaosflux, try to create a reasonable process where nothing much exists. A CSD like "Rx - Empty redirect." should work too. <a href="../../../r/f/r/User%7ERfrisbie_fdd2.html" title="User:Rfrisbie">Rfrisbie</a><sup><a href="../../../r/f/r/User_talk%7ERfrisbie_975e.html" title="User talk:Rfrisbie">talk</a></sup> 14:45, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A similar process has been going on with userbox list pages in the Wikipedia namespace, often without tagging the pages as CSD. I've attempted to dialogue with the responsible admins about these deletions not meeting the <i>noncontroversial</i> test of G6, but, once I make my point, I usually get silence. I think any CSD application about the userbox issue is frought with peril. The consensus in the community is not settled, and for that reason, deletion efforts that don't fit with crystal clarity into one of the CSD should be put up for deletion. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 15:19, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As mentioned above, and if the deletions AFTER REPLACEMENT have not seemed to garnish any complaints about the loss of the page, just the process used, if we are running the process just for the sake of the process, it may be time to (suspenseful music plays) <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">not follow the process</a>. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 16:21, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To this point, the only indication I've seen of any controversy is this noticeboard post. It does seem like CSD R2 would also be a criteria. Xaosflux is implementing a reasonable way for POV userboxes to be migrated following the discussion of <a href="../../../g/u/s/WP%7EGUS_633c.html" title="WP:GUS">WP:GUS</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="teal"><b>α</b></font><font color="black"><i><b>Chimp</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="DarkSlateBlue">laudare</font></b></a></sup> 16:38, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be no last hurrah for userboxes. Everything is proceeding as it should, and a few non-admins urging a strict adherence to process aren't going to follow it. I'd never thought I'd see Xaosflux say "Fuck process", but there it is. Given that, I'd say this issue is pretty much over. I'm fulfilling my responsibility to delete T1 userboxes just as everyone else is fulfilling theirs to redirect inclusions from Template: to userspace. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 16:51, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It appears this was prompted by the template pages that I tagged last night.

<dd>Taking that page as an example, I count ten pages with incoming links. One is the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_userboxes_ebff.html" title="Wikipedia:List of userboxes">list of userboxes</a>, which is so out of date (and huge) that I don't find updating it to be worthwhile. One is from <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> and I don't think that it should be changed. One is a complaint about the userbox being used as vandalism. Two are links where the box was used as a random example. And five are messages or notes relating to the bypassing and deletion of the page. I suppose they could be redirected, but I don't personally find that to be a worthwhile excercise. —<b><a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiraLuka_a2e1.html" title="User:MiraLuka"><font color="purple">Mi</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMiraLuka_ed02.html" title="User talk:MiraLuka"><font color="blue">ra</font></a></b> 00:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The discussion on <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_Shorthair_d90e.html" title="Talk:British Shorthair">Talk:British Shorthair</a> has degraded into a flame war with various people coming in from anonymous IPs to directly launch personal attacks against those who oppose the inclusion of internet meme content into a breed description.

I would seriously like an administrator to step into this issue and take appropriate action. --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETargetter_27f5.html" title="User:Targetter">Targetter</a> 05:05, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here is a quick reply. 74.136.222.198 was a vandal and also comited various personal attacks with his talk page. I reverted him and warned him with both sets of warns inorder to attempt to stop him from continuing. He was blocked for his actions. Also he was reverted by several others as well. Sorry about this and not sure how it happened. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 07:18, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have fully admitted I did some wrong things Aeon, however I did not launch personal attacks with my talk page. You embarked on a campaign of harassment, knowing I was already angry, in an attempt to make me angrier for your own amusement. You abused your authority to harass me, and removed my ability to protest your harassment by constantly reverting my comments and incorrectly labeling them as vandalism. While I may have also been wrong yesterday in some of my actions, it does not excuse your behavior. <a href="../../../7/4/2E/User%7E74.136.222.198.html" title="User:74.136.222.198">74.136.222.198</a> 07:21, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I must say I have had problems with Aeon recently. The issues stems from a failed mediation case, where Aeon was the advocate for <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsert-Belltower_b83a.html" title="User:Insert-Belltower">User:Insert-Belltower</a>. Apparently, Aeon's conduct in the case was questionable, and another user, <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">User:UCRGrad</a> felt that he needed to put this, in great detail, all over other user's talk pages. I blocked UCRGrad for 24 hours, later reducing this to six, because I deemed UCRGrad's posting of his 'concerns' to be disruptive and inappropriate. I asked Aeon to alert me to any more questionable postings from UCRGrad, because I believed Aeon to be the wronged party. When Aeon later presented me with a message from UCRGrad on Insert-Belltower's talk page, which was nearly identical to the types of messages I blocked UCRGrad for in the first place, I blocked again, this time for one week. However, just this evening, Insert-Belltower posted on my talk page informing me that the message UCRGrad had left on Insert-Belltower's talk page was invited, and Aeon's reporting of the message as evidence of further abuse was inappropriate. I immediately unblocked UCRGrad. However, I warned all three that I am tired of this dispute, especially of Aeon's misleading comments. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">RyanG</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">rbil10</a><small><a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanGerbil10_836d.html" title="User talk:RyanGerbil10">(The people rejoice!)</a></small> 07:30, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please note that <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006">Aeon1006</a> is not an administrator, so any "abuse of authority" would be purely through VandalProof messages.

<dd>The above muslim user seems to be very confused, he refers to articles on hate crimes committed by Lebanese Muslims in australia against white women...i don't think he understands that sometimes muslims commit hate crimes too...he needs to look at his NPOV...this man has vanadalised several articles where race info is the determining factor in the crime or criminals mentioned...I do not think he is willing to accept that race hate crimes are not just committed by skinheads.

<dd>That would be an over-generalization. Yes, most of the victims were white and yes most of perpatrators were Lebanese. But that doesn't mean it's a hate crime. The <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_gang_rapes.html" title="Sydney gang rapes">Sydney gang rapes</a> article mentions in the intro that the set of crimes was part of a hate crime, as cites three sources. However, each source is just quoting the same newspaper columnist's opinion that it's a hate crime. See also <a href="../../../s/y/d/Talk%7ESydney_gang_rapes_4e35.html#Introduction" title="Talk:Sydney gang rapes">Talk:Sydney gang rapes#Introduction</a>. Anyway, this is starting to edge away from needing admin attention; I'll try to resolve the issue with the user on his/her talk page, but I hope an admin can keep an eye on this.

<p>A prominent UK media community is currently discussing and evaluating Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_audio_broadcasting.html" title="Digital audio broadcasting">Digital audio broadcasting</a>. It seems to have a problem with POV edits from dynamic IP addresses at the moment, and so if a few admins could watch the article, it'd be a great help. I'm sure that Wikipedia would be viewed negatively by them if the article was to be vandalised whilst it's "in the spotlight" there. <a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEsteffect_957d.html" title="User:Esteffect">Esteffect</a> 15:07, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rah_Crawford_4f3c.html" title="Rah Crawford">Rah Crawford</a> article consists primarily of text lifted wholly from the artist's website.

This is even after notifying him of the copyright problems at his talk page. I don't want to remove the text again, so as not to violate the 3RR rule.

<dd>I haven't reviewed the situation, but if you're removing a copyright violation, you're reverting vandalism and illegal content, so 3RR doesn't apply. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:39, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would add that the content appears to be simply an "exhibition list". A list of works, or exhibits, etc is generally considered "public information", not subject to copyright violation. If these exhibits or works are private, for distribution to friends, not the public, that would be a different issue. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 16:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You are either using deceptive methods to hide and destroy another users talk page or you are using deceptive methods to hide and destroy your own talk page. Either way, I recommend blocking both accounts (at least 48 hours so we can talk about this) and reverting the moves; also post this at Ste4k's RFAR. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 02:37, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The arbitration committee looks at all sides when user conduct is before arbitration. Ste4k would not be the first person who brought a case only to find herself at the wrong end of the hammer.

<li>Your overwriting the Talk page with other content was a deliberate attempt to hide Ste4k's Talk page. You could be blocked for disruption just as easily as he could be.

<li>That is simply not true! Any edits that I made were done in good faith and with NPOV. I strongly object to personal information being posted, particularly irrelevant information and links to one's supposed place of employment. It's positively Orwellian.

Four members of ArbCom have signed their agreement to the proposition "It is acceptable to make a subpage to keep notes which document another user's behavior. Care should be taken to keep a factual record which avoids personal attacks on your own part." No oppose votes or abstentions to date. In fact, Minun (a.k.a.

<dd>User:History21 is on his last legs at Wikipedia as a result of his repeated hoaxing involving the Eyre/Heller/Peters family.

<dd>Your cohort is apparently me. I reverted his changes to the first family article with the caveat that I would not remove anything that he inserted with reliable sources.

I will go over his sources shortly. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 22:56, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not on my "last legs" at all; some people have simply been attempting to put me in that position for reasons of their own that I cannot begin to fathom. Unfortunately for these people, my record contradicts their words, and such ridiculous stunts as the reversion at <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Family_of_the_United_States_a5f1.html" title="First Family of the United States">First Family of the United States</a> do not sit well with responsible contributors and administrators.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am not attempting to blacken anyone's reputation but have simply revealed some of the things that Zoe has done throughout her history, things clearly available in public records. If your editing list blackens your reputation, that is your fault and not mine. The fact that this section was even created to deal with you in the first place is a statement in itself.</p>
<p>Also, I would greatly appreciate if you would stop insinuating that I am a sockpuppet, especially given that most of the articles you've accused me of vandalizing lack any contributions in my name. Really, this is just getting silly. I expect both of you to refrain from such nonsense in the future.</p>
<p>Oh, and the vandalism of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judy_Feder_87a0.html" title="Judy Feder">Judy Feder</a> is not appreciated. There is no copyright violation; I state very clearly in the article that the official positions are "as stated on her campaign website."

It wasn't a proper speedy, and I applaud you for taking the time to make sure it fit the criteria. If you continue to do so (as I hope you do) you'll periodically get complaints; the proper response is (as you did) to explain that speedies are only for specific cases where it is completely clear that no other opinions are necessary, <i>not</i> for cases where you're pretty sure the article should go. So, good job!<br />
An additional comment, though, is that unsourced and/or excessive elements in biographies of living persons should be vigorously rooted out. This seems to have been done, in the case of this article, by simply stubifying it. In this case, that was a better approach than speedy deletion, so everything has been done correctly here. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 05:53, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

In fact, its author admitted that was why he wrote it - to show the over the top (sleazy) advertising, and evidently to also call him an ambulance chaser, who been sanctioned by his state bar, and other assorted bad things.

<dd>What about it was not a 'speedy delete'? In fact, it has been speedy deleted, finally. EVERYTHING in the article was unsourced and disparaging. That was the whole point of the article.

<dd>I am not yelling. Why are you being uncivil and accusing me of yelling? In fact, the article was deleted. And the article is not salvageable because (1) the guy is not notable and (2) the entire article was an attack on a lawyer known only in his local community. It also does not meet the WP:BIO standards. WHy anyone would defend this is totally beyond me. I am not attacking Yanksox. I am astonished at the standards that some seem to have when it comes to turning WIkipedia into a gossip rag.jawesq 02:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just a point of clarification: the alternative to speedy deletion is not leaving it alone, but AfD. The article failed WP:BIO, and its <i>function</i> was a criticism of a local figure, so it should have been on AfD, where it would fail spectacularly, but it wasn't the sort of attack page that qualifies under the speedy deletion criteria. Yanksox did the right thing by not speedy deleting: it did <b>not</b> qualify under those very tight criteria. That's not by any means to suggest that anyone thinks it's a valid article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:59, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I agree that it would fail spectacularly under an AfD. As it was at the time of SD, it did qualify, since there were no citations/references. As recreated on a user's talk page, it may not now meet SD, but it surely would still fail spectacularly under AfD. IMO. And yes, there is a <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>.</dd>

<li>Socafan reverted four times in short order, and reverted three separate admins. He has consistently engaged in tendentious editing in respect of a biography of a living individual</li>
<li>As usual, when I blocked Socafan for <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> violation, I posted the action for review at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a></li>
<li>The major result of the block was not an advantage for me (I have pretty much no history on the article other than trying to neutralise guilt-by-association and innuendo added by Socafan) but the opportunity for <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Hart_8ceb.html" title="User:Steve Hart">User:Steve Hart</a> to substantially rewrite the contended section in very much more readable and substantially more neutral terms, a net gain for the encyclopaedia, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lance_Armstrong&amp;diff=66451255&amp;oldid=66421741" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lance_Armstrong&amp;diff=66451255&amp;oldid=66421741" rel="nofollow">[117]</a></li>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>A block for 3RR is entirely uncontroversial, especially for BLP issues, and the block was reviewed by other admins and pronounced acceptable</li>
<li>At least one uninvolved admin has already proposed a community ban due to Socafan's "trolling" (see <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#User:Socafan" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#User:Socafan</a>)</li>
<li>The redirects at <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Ballester_a42f.html" title="Pierre Ballester">Pierre Ballester</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Walsh_%28sports_reporter%29_5645.html" title="David Walsh (sports reporter)">David Walsh (sports reporter)</a> reflect the fact that both articles contained substantiallly the same content, most of it word-for-word identical, discussing a book they co-authored; there were no biographical details such as dates of birth or anything else of substance, just two articles with near-identical content and identical edit wars (in respect of which, once again, Socafan is in a minority of one); this I made clear in the edit summary, I also made clear that turning them back into articles when other detail becomes available is no problem at all. In the mean time the pair both redirect to an article on the book, which containsd the duplicated content and the description of the legal cases surrounding it provided through a third opinion and previously stated identically in both articles. After, that is, Socafan had tried including his "spun" version of it.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I could go on but what's the point? His reversal of the burden of proof in editing shows, I think, that he is ursuing an agenda to spin the unproven doping allegations against Lance Armstrong in the most damaging way possible. Just look at the comments above: it's not that we should not be doing LA's PR for him, the issue has always been that we may not do the work of his detractors; the onus is <i>always</i> on the editor trying to include content to satisfy others of its neutrality, <i>especially</i> in cases of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Socafan seems to think that we (as in: every other editor on that article) must satisfy him before changing a word of what he writes. Socafan's looks a lot like a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose account</a> right now; reviewing his contribs it looks like a major part of his activity on Wikipedia is spinning allegations against living individuals. Maybe Tony Sidaway is right and a community ban is justified, but I'm not going to be the one to do that, as I said before on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>. This very recent edit from Jimbo makes the point as strongly as one could want: <b>"The responsibility for justifying controversial claims in Wikipedia, of ALL KINDS, but especially for living people's bios, rests firmly on the shoulders of the person making the claim."</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ABiographies_of_living_persons&amp;diff=66668475&amp;oldid=66650741" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ABiographies_of_living_persons&amp;diff=66668475&amp;oldid=66650741" rel="nofollow">[119]</a></dd>
<dd>The way to "deal with the conflict" is for Socafan to respect policy and guidelines and the opinions of other editors, and to recognise that in sensitive areas we must be small-c conservative. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:38, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have indefinitely blocked CrazyInSane and am coming here for communal approval (full disclosure, I had a brief encounter with the user when they were POV pushing on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">December 25</a>). I have been keeping track of the various BC-AD/BCE-CE conflicts while staying uninvolved. CrazyInsane is one of the worst POV pushers in that regard despite the prominent claim on his user page that all he cares about is NPOV. The user has been problematic from the moment they joined Wikipedia, including using sockpuppets to push their POV <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Jordain" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Jordain" rel="nofollow">[124]</a>. The user claimed to be an atheist as a repeated rhetorical device despite his status as a strongly believing Christian which he now acknowledges prominently on his user page. He does occasionally have a good edit, but these recent edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xmas&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64986250" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xmas&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64986250" rel="nofollow">[125]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xmas&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64994569" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xmas&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64994569" rel="nofollow">[126]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_Era&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66194308" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_Era&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66194308" rel="nofollow">[127]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_Era&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66253027" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_Era&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66253027" rel="nofollow">[128]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_Era&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66280862" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_Era&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66280862" rel="nofollow">[129]</a> and others have convinced me that he will not stop other POV pushing and will use/abuse/ignore policy to suit his purpose. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:28, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is ridiculous. I am an established user and have <i><b>most definitely not</b></i> made any POV-pushing edits in the past very long period, the "evidence" that "JodhuaZ" presents do not show any evidence of POV pushing. The edits in regard to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a> were to ensure that there was no uncited information presented as fact, and to put the "Christian Era" term at the same level as "Current Era"...nowhere did I make any POV-pushing efforts. As for the <a href="../../../x/m/a/Xmas.html" title="Xmas">Xmas</a> article, I thought that information was more "updated" than the previous information, and was NOT POV-pushing in the least. If some think I was, after one reversion I stopped attempting so what's the deal here? And the one's he selected as "showcasing my POV" are a few edits out of the hundreds I make <i>every day</i>. And those that JoshuaZ selected are not even recent, they're from <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_21.html" title="July 21">21 July</a>. You want recent edits?

<dd>The evidence above is self-explanatory- you have repeatedly claimed things were POV and used that as a reason to delete material even as a few days before you add in exactly the same sort of unsourced material that supports your view. I also strongly suggest that when contesting a block, not to state your intentions of avoiding of it as you did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Spring_holiday&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66717340" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Spring_holiday&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66717340" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:16, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I blocked <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewUser0001_0b59.html" title="User:NewUser0001">User:NewUser0001</a> for block evasion. CrazyInSane is probably the worst POV warrior I've ever seen on Wikipedia. See the Secularization of Christian holidays as an example of the sort of POV footholds he's been building on the 'pedia. That I've seen, there's been a definite net loss of NPOV on any article related to Christianity in the modern era that he's edited, and I don't think that blocking him would harm the project. With that said, I'm still a bit bothered by this indefblock. It seems to have come without any warning, and while he's certainly exhausted the community's patience, I think there ought be more warning before such a block is given. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 19:40, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>On the basis of my dealings with this user (at <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_holiday.html" title="Spring holiday">Spring holiday</a>) and on what has been written here, I most emphatically do not support an indefinite block, or indeed any block. I have reviewed CiS's talk page and I find no discussion that substantiates a block. The only discussion from the admin doing the blocking is to advise of the block with very limited reasoning and moreover quite some time after blocking.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACrazyInSane&amp;diff=66703270&amp;oldid=65966907" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACrazyInSane&amp;diff=66703270&amp;oldid=65966907" rel="nofollow">[142]</a> Looking at User CiS's recent contributions it is not at clear to me what triggered JoshuaZ's block. I will ask the blocking admin for more clarification. I do not approve of block evasions and thus do support the block of User:NewUser0001 in line with the policy at <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBlock_3ef4.html" title="WP:Block">WP:Block</a> accordingly.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A&#160;Y&#160;Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 21:12, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>(edit conflict)::One might think that the block evasion might be enough to understand why the block was administered. Besides, what leap in illogic would have you support a block on a sock, but not on its owner? In any case...</p>

<dd>It's more than just the CE/AD thing, and there <i>has</i> been at least some persistent revert-warring, but you've definitely gotten to the heart of this: there's been no RfC, just a number of editors who became increasingly frustrated and now aren't heartbroken to see him go.

<p>While some users seem to endorse my actions, there seems to be a significant fraction which find it premature.

<li>It is a start and certainly better than the present state of affairs. However, I would like you to review the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Blocking policy</a> and ensure that your block lines up with that. It is policy! Under disruption for example the policy states&#160;: <i>Users will normally be warned before they are blocked.</i> but more importantly <i>Blocks for disruption should only be placed when a user is in some way making it difficult for others to contribute to Wikipedia.</i> I do not see any evidence that this user makes it difficult for others to contribute. There is no way in my view that you have met the requirements for a block under "Users who exhaust the community's patience" as you have not escalated the matter appropriately and tested for community concensus. So what exactly is the rationale under the policy for the block and how do you justify a week when the policy states <i>Block duration may vary, but normally lasts 24 hours</i>?--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A&#160;Y&#160;Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 23:07, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To respond to your comments here- I would interpret prior blocks for 3RVR and edit warring as reasonable warnings about disruption. Similarly, POV pushing is inherently disruptive and takes up other editors time "making it difficult for others to contribute to Wikipedia." As for your claim that I had not tested community consensus, I most certainly did- I talked to two admins before adminstering the block and reported the block here specificly asking if there was a consensus for the block. Note my above request for community approval in the start of this thread. As for the 24 hour part, the user has been repeatedly blocked before and has stated an intention to avoid blocks. That seems to me to pretty easily merit a block longer than 24 hours. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:23, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Re: "So what exactly is the rationale under the policy for the block and how do you justify a week when the policy states <i>Block duration may vary, but normally lasts 24 hours</i>?" See the definitions of norm and mean (and probably median and mode). All "normally lasts 24 hours" means is that that is the average, or most common, period. It does not imply a period that must be adhered to, although many seem to infer that it does. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 23:45, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Definitely not concensus seeking. Reporting the block here after you have blocked is a start, but does not mitigate the excessive use of admin tools. Since you have placed no warnings to the use of 3RVR (and nor was he guilty of it this time), nor had you apparently warned him of escalated POV pushing, I don't see how you are building on warnings for disruption with an all out indefinite block, no RfC, no RfAr, no nothing to back up your judgement. As stated above, how do you go from the most recent but two month old 24 hour block to an indefinite block, or even a week long block? (I do understand the difference between mean, mode and median and I do not understand why the most common, regardless of how defined, period is not being used here.) The immediately previous block was nearly a month earlier for a 3RR violation. Unlike the other users, I believe blocking without warning is wrong and hence your blocking action in this instance is wrong. It would not have been wrong to block if you had warned the uyser and he had continued wiht his behaviour. It is a case of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html#General" title="Freedom of speech"><i>"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"</i></a>. In this case I do not endorse User:CrazyInSane's views on common era or many other topics, not even usually interested in that scope of topic actually despite my appearance at Spring holiday. I do not however see substantially disruptive behaviour from this user to warrant extended blocks and thus gagging this editor. In my view all blocked users are entitled to be warned at least once before being blocked for whatever actions are making the contemplating-a-block-admin angry.

<dd>Overused quotes from Voltaire aside, I think you misunderstand the situation a bit. First, the comment to Jayjg was because he was one of the admins I had already discussed the matter with (I discussed it with him because he had done some of the work linking sockpuppets to CrazyInSane). Second, I don't know how much attention you pay to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> but it is common practice to report a possibly controversial block here for approval - a procedure which is endorsed in the blocking policy. Third, I'm perplexed by your suggestion of the blatantvandal template here since that template is generally used for edits which are largescale unmistakable vandalism, not repeated POV pushing. Fourth, you seem to have ignored the fact that part of the week block is for his new sockpuppet and stated intent under that sock to resume sockpuppeting if his main account stayed blocked. If you still feel that I have not acted appropriately, you are welcome to file an RfC about my actions. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 00:19, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think clear warning of where behaviour is leading to is very important and indef blocking at this stage is not acceptable. However, POV pushing can be far more disruptive than overt vandalism, and editors doing it have to learn and change. It's up to us to help them, and progressively longer cooling off times turn out to be the last resort. I would have thought at this stage make it fairly short - 24 hours as a reminder, 3 days to get the message home, or a week if you're feeling that severe (don't mess with JoshuaZ). With the interval since the last block, I'd feel very uncomfortable with anything more. Let's show this editor we mean business, but give him every chance to get it right. After all, it's easy enough to slap on another block if things go pear-shaped again. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 08:02, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you believe that something has been deleted in error, and especially if you believe that the closer was improper, then use DRV, even if you're an administrator. It would also be preferred to <i>talk to the closer</i> before undeleting (that's "before," not as a fait d'accompli). I say this because of my own history in a slap fight with another admin and because the principle is pretty important.

He has already ruined the great discussion that was occurring on <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarcho-capitalism_6a94.html" title="Talk:Anarcho-capitalism">Talk:Anarcho-capitalism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Template%7EAnarchism_e86e.html" title="Template:Anarchism">Template:Anarchism</a>, just as everybody was coming close to an agreeable compromise. I do hope that someone looks into this matter. --AaronS 19:56, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess AGF requires we wait and see how this editor behaves. I have no problem with the RJII editors coming back indivdually, although on a short leash with respect with consensus, civility, POV pushing, etc. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 21:18, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't know about this discussion. I blocked the sock indefinitely and extended the RJII ban to run to this day next year. We only have this fellow's word for it that the account was shared. I'm not inclined to waste further time on this editor who has already failed to conform to restrictions placed on him by the arbitration committee and been banned. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 21:22, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I tend to think that the individual editors should be given a second chance, although I would suggest they admit it up front. The RJII persona was a pain in the ass and on a fast track to a community ban, but I'm not entirely sure its fair to pin that on each individual member. OTOH, how do we know it was a group account in the first place, and/or how do we know any particular reincarnation isn't the same group account again? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 21:27, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It might be relevant to note that RJ was banned for more than just being an account used by multiple users: "For continued violation of his previous ruling, by incivility and edit warring, RJII is banned from editing Wikipedia for one year." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Infinity0#Remedies" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Infinity0#Remedies" rel="nofollow">[158]</a> I never really took his claim to be more than one user seriously, it seems to me far more likely that it is one person claiming to be many. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 21:46, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I am unable to find a policy though, perusing the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a> hierarchy, that states that Wikipedia users can be banned simply because multiple people are using the same account name.

<dd>This is exactly the right action; RJII is under an ArbCom ban for 1 year in addition to being indefblocked for claiming to be a public account. The indefblock can be overturned at any time, but the year ban stands until the AC overturns it.
