<dd>Public domain encyclopedias have this problem a lot. The second best way to fix the problem is to NPOV the material, not revert it, and the very best is to get the editor in question to NPOV it themselves&#160;;-) - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 06:04, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Almost all of our Christianity-related articles have material from one PD RCC source or another. It's up to the person doing the editing to show some intelligence and sensitivity and add only those things that are NPOV. I think cutting and pasting whole PD encyclopedia articles into Wikipedia ought to be punished by trampling by elephants, myself, but it has long, sad precedent. <i>Material</i> from a PD encyclopedia is groovy, but it should be material, selected (and therefore <i>evaluated</i>) by the editor if it's going to be at all intelligently done. The Catholic Encyclopedia is quite scholarly and rarely gets its facts wrong, but it is not NPOV. For that matter, the 1911 Britanica is wretched when it comes to NPOV, and I frequently have to rip out every word of a 1911 article before I can write a decent article on an Augustan era topic, just because of the POV in every line of the Whig-dominated history they had. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:37, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a particular problem with the PD Catholic Encyclopedia: It's from 1913. The Church has changed so dramatically over the past 100 years (look at Vatican II alone) that most information in the CE is only useful as a historical record. Anytime the CE is used (alone) to support a "the current belief of the Church is" statement, it should be strongly doubted. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 19:48, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Obviously, pre- and post-VC2 are huge issues. The only caution to your caution I have is that the <i>New Advent</i> exists in open license in more than one form, I believe. The 1913 <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i> is PD, but I think the <i>New Advent Online</i> is at least somewhat updated and from a near-VC2 date. Ultimately, though, it comes down, in my opinion, to the editor. My rule, if I could set rules, would be 1) <i>Never paste in a whole article from anywhere, even if open source,</i> because if you don't know enough about the subject to edit it intelligently and adapt it, you probably ought to leave the blank; 2) <i>Never paste in even a sentence from a PD source unless you can verify and corroborate its statements</i> by your own contemporary reading or a second source; 3) <i>Never paste in anything that is POV unless you also paste in an explicit reference to the source of that specific statement</i> and not a general "Well, bits of this article were taken from X or Y. Then again, every time I propose a rule, someone says, "That sounds like slashdot, so it's not original and I'm voting against it." This is especially true if there is no voting involved. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:29, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Benjamin is having a case of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> here. The proposal is rather hard to take seriously; basically it states that 'wikiblowers' (intended as a pun on 'whistleblowers', although other connotations come to mind) should be able to get away with breaking policy if, in doing so, they bring a perceived problem of the wiki to the community attention. That basically means that a vandal shouldn't be blocked, since in vandalizing he brings the problem of vandalism to our attention. Not good.

<p>He has now been reverting the removal of the VFD tag (despite the linked VFD having been deleted) as well as repeatedly removing comments from katefan0. I've warned him to be careful of the 3RR and of deliberate disruption. If he continues his one-man fight in such a way then he should be blocked for a short time.

<dl>
<dd>Regarding the "consensus" at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Polish_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_Black_Book_529e.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Polish Wikipedians' notice board/Black Book">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Polish Wikipedians' notice board/Black Book</a>, the closing admin tallied the votes as "The result of the debate was 8 Userfy, 20 DELETE." While the article at that point was not deleted, asserting that there was a <i>consensus</i> to retain it is a tad disingenuous.</dd>
<dd>An uneasy peace was achieved after the article was moved to <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">User:Halibutt</a>'s User space, and no further additions were made. <i>Subsequent to</i> the VfD closure on 22 June, Jimbo commented on Halibutt's Talk page that a "black book attack page" was unhelpful, and encouraged some sort of "friendly outreach/education page" instead.</dd>
<dd>Recently, the page was revived from its dormant state and copied to <a href="../../../w/i/t/User%7EWitkacy_80e6.html" title="User:Witkacy">User:Witkacy</a>'s User space; several additional editors were added to the list there. Several editors–again including Jimbo (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Witkacy/Black_Book&amp;diff=20224927&amp;oldid=20223853" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Witkacy/Black_Book&amp;diff=20224927&amp;oldid=20223853" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>)–urged Witkacy to abandon the Black Book. The Black Book was renominated for deletion, presumably because it showed no sign of rehabilitation and remained an attack page. Further, Jimbo has now made his opinion of the page clear—information that wasn't available during the first VfD.</dd>
<dd>Renomination of articles for deletion is not forbidden by policy, though rapid renomination is often discouraged. In this case, the page was allowed an opportunity to improve and mature. More than a month passed since the closure of the first VfD, and the page's problems have not been resolved. It has come to light that Wikipedia's founder finds the page objectionable, too. Whether Witkacy likes it or not, there is no reason to speedily close or delete this VfD, and readding the speedy tag is inappropriate and disruptive. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 16:59, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I most certainly am <i>not</i> the initiator of "this new voting", <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">User:-Ril-</a> was. I can only assume that he found out about the page's existence because he got rather annoyed with the tone I took with him on a recent (utterly unrelated) VfD, and went on a little investigation of my talk page, which quickly led him to Witkacy's pet project (<i>i.e.</i>, besmirching me). As far as Witkacy's assertion that the page is ineligible for "new voting" because it's had (?) "old voting", that's preposterous: no such clause is anywhere to be found anywhere at <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> nor its related pages. There <i>is</i>, however, a clause that says that personal attacks, which this page unquestionably (despite its plaintive cries to the contrary), should be removed, even from user space, <i>by anyone</i>. The only reason I can imagine keeping this page is as evidence (although it really is but a single drop in an ocean) against Witkacy in an RfC or arfar, something several "keep" votes have used as a rationale for their votes. I believe the reason -Ril- nominated it for VfD (although you'd have to ask him to be sure) is because clearly, removing the comments from the page isn't doing any good, since Witkacy keeps putting them back. He has since copied the text from the top of the page into the VfD discussion, I can only imagine so that he can easily retrieve it in case the page is deleted. He's also copied the content to <a href="../../../w/i/t/User_talk%7EWitkacy_2572.html" title="User talk:Witkacy">User talk:Witkacy</a>. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 23:15, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>.

Actually the article didn't start as a vanity- <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">user:Tothebarricades.tk</a>, who started and did several edits to the article, is a different person (IMO). Yet it has become one, or would if the editor were given his choice. This is similar to the article on ROMATH/<a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7EROMATH_2e33.html" title="User:ROMATH">user:ROMATH</a>. The subject of it didn't want her name or other basic info printed, though she didn't mind promoting her new website. In the end if was deleted entirely which satisfied her. I've suggested the same treatment for the Munson articles to the editor. However Munson is more notable than Romath so I'm not sure a VfD would succeed. Complicating the situation is the [past] involvement of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_%28activist%29_8b88.html" title="Bill White (activist)">Bill White (activist)</a>/<a href="../../../b/a/x/User%7EBaxter2_3a44.html" title="User:Baxter2">user:Baxter2</a>/user:68.10.35.153.

<p><b>Comment</b>. Chuck Munson is a user here. Looking over the past few edits, I see Hall Monitor putting his home address and other information about him on a Chuck Munson page. Willmcw and Hall Monitor seem delighted they can harass him and post what may or may not be his home address for all to see, since they were able to obtain it he "deserves" it. Then an admin decides to ban Chuck from his attempts to remove this information - and that admin is Jayjg, what a surprise. This is simply harassment of a Wikipedia user by Hall Monitor and Willmcw. <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> 06:17, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Tricky little bastard", to be precise. Again: blocks are not punitive measures. I believe most people can be encouraged to refrain from unproductive behaviour by asking them to. If they persist despite being explained why what they're doing isn't working, a block is a technical measure to protect the wiki from their foolishness, or their deviousness. <i>Commanding</i> people to apologize, as you did on Heraclius' talk page, is an approach to problem solving that I think is more suited to kindergarten.</dd>

He has been doing the worst kind of personal attacks, including trolling, personal targeting, 3RRs, trying to make Wiki miserable, and he has been intentionally doing it for the last 2 weeks or more. He does it for revenge and to be mean. This is what it appears he is doing here. -Ril- can not be trusted on this issue, and furthermore, the only reason -Ril- has not been subject to an RfC is because one has not been written up . . . yet. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 16:01, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Calling another user a "bastard" is simply not acceptable under any circumstances. Wikipedia has a strict no-personal attack policy. Any user violating it should be denounced, by anyone who has noticed, for doing so. Do you disagree?

<dd>-Ril-, you might want to check up on your facts, you are up for two 3RRs at one time, for two entirely separate pages, two entirely separate events, by two entirely separate editors (who were not involved in the other page) -- pretty tough to do, see <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR</a>.

<dd>Noitall, you are the one who added the second 3RR, it doesn't count - because it isn't valid - it covers 12 edits over <b>2 weeks</b>, not 24 hours. There are not more than 3 reverts over any 24 hour period amongst the edits that you list, and you list one of the edits twice. And the first 3RR was by Germen, in retaliation to the 3RR against himself, and is also invalid. He hasn't specified which version was being "reverted to", infact such a version is the first "revert", making only 3 reverts + the original version, which isn't a violation either. As you will note, I have not been blocked for two allegations of 3RR violation, and am still editing, because neither is valid. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 23:44, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Anyhow, the user has relisted the RfA (apparently several times) and I am reluctant to continue to remove it without bringing up the issue. Am I within my perrogative as an admin to remove a bad-faith nomination at RfA? Should I have taken it to a b-crat instead (since RfA is their particular province)? I know admins can de-list at VfD, and I assume that this sort of thing falls under the same directive, but I want to make sure. Further, if the nomination is again de-listed and is replaced by the nominee, is a vandalism warning in order?

<dd>Of course. In fact, it is not only within the power of admins and bueraucrats, but normal users as well. Make sure you state the reason why you are removing the RFA, and make sure that it's obvious that the nomination won't do anything besides make the person who got nominated look like a total ass (i.e., if the nominated editor has 10 oppose votes to two support votes, that means that thirty-eight support votes would be needed to create an 80% majority). You also did the right thing by reporting it here as well. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_Desk_c230.html" title="User:Linuxbeak/Desk">Desk</a> 18:30, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Mockery or not, his comment also pertained directly to a dispute over whether WP:RS applied to Berlet, Horowitz, or both, and if so in what matter. It should also be noted that Jayjg participated extensively in a directly related discussion about the inclusion of the same material by Mr. Berlet on the <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roots_of_anti-Semitism_b3a4.html" title="Roots of anti-Semitism">Roots of anti-Semitism</a> article, espousing the same position there. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARoots_of_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=20298005&amp;oldid=20297610" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARoots_of_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=20298005&amp;oldid=20297610" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARoots_of_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=20298034&amp;oldid=20298005" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARoots_of_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=20298034&amp;oldid=20298005" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARoots_of_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=20293291&amp;oldid=20292080" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARoots_of_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=20293291&amp;oldid=20292080" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> Furthermore, Jayjg's action may be seen as having the purpose of preserving a controversial revision by SlimVirgin that had been removed several hours earlier pending consensus discussions on the talk page only to be reinserted two minutes prior to the protection. The purpose of Wikipedia's page protection policy is to avoid situations exactly of this nature in which an administrator with a personal interest and position in the discussion implements the page protection in a way that supports his position or the position of a friend. As such, simply removing the protection and replacing it yourself would do nothing to address the fact that Jayjg behaved inappropriately here while simultaneously giving sanction to his action. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 20:05, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's absurd: there are about 500-600 admins, and only about 300 or so semi-active and only about 100 or so active totally. There are over 500,000 articles, of which about 1/3 are of decent quality (my estimate). So this means that 100 admins need to admin about 175,000 pages, of which any could have a content dispute. Admins can express an opinion on a page and still lock it while discussion is ongoing, though it's obviously not advisable. I really can't comment much more on this instance, however, as I haven't investigated. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 02:41, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Rangerdude, the only gripe I really see here is that you are annoyed because it was Jayjg who did the page protection...not because it was protected, simply that it was Jayjg who did it. If you have a problem with him, the proper channels are open to you to create an RfC regarding him. That is not what this page is for, however. There is nothing about his actions that constitutes a violation of <i>any</i> policy, neither in letter nor in spirit. If you're unhappy with Jay's having been the one to lock the page, perhaps you should take more seriously jpgordon's proposal that he unlock it and then relock it himself. Or do you have a personal gripe against jpgordon as well? <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 08:08, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tomer - you are incorrect about this complaint being inappropriate for this noticeboard. Per its opening paragraph, which you would be well served to revisit if you intend to comment on what is or is not appropriate here, "If you want to make an <b>open informal complaint over the behaviour of an admin, you can do so here,</b> but please only do either that, or file a RFC or RFAr, but not both." IOW, editors encounting a behavior incident have two options. One is here. The other is the RfC/RfAr process. As the complaint was easily summarized, easily documented and accordingly did not merit a full drawn out RfC, I opted to place the incident notice here. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 21:23, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, dear. Are you possibly confusing ban and block??? We must again ask, what is wrong with the guy if he confuses two separate terms. <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 21:40, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Everyone knows full well what games you are playing, but for the record, the user variously known as <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Skyring</a> was banned, not blocked, for one month. A requirement in a ban is that a banned user cannot set foot on Wikipedia. They cannot change a letter, insert a full stop, nothing. Skyring, <i>as you know</i>, breached that rule. When he reappeared on Wikipedia at the end of his ban, Jimbo reimposed it, to give the ArbComm time to vote on a one year ban for his behaviour subsequent to the imposition of the original ban. Until they enforce their ban, admins have been authorised to block all Skyring attempts to edit this encyclopedia on sight. Until the expiry of the current ban and the one decided upon by ArbComm Skyring is not allowed to edit any articles on Wikipedia. Any edits are to be automatically reverted. All sockpuppets of his, <i>as well you know</i>, will be banned on sight. All <i>their</i> edits will be reverted and everytime he comes on as a sockpuppet the clock on the ban will restart again at that point. So if he is banned for a year, and uses a sockpuppet one month into the ban, the one year ban will restart and run from the time the sockpuppet sets foot on Wikipedia. If, one day before the expiry of the ban Skyring breaches its conditions and comes on to Wikipedia, the one year ban (or whatever length of time is decided on) will start <i>again</i> from that date. Issue closed. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Ireland coa.png">Image:Ireland coa.png</a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 22:29, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></p>
<p>So, if he makes good edits, you're going to revert those changes on sight? Looks like all he's been doing to you is going around cleaning up your mess. 203.54.191.226 22:48, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, Jtdirl, what makes you to imagine you are entitled to close the issue?? Poor guy. Btw,, I had the impression that the ArbCom has not yet imposed any further ban in that case. Would it be premature for YOU to decide such things? And, I am not aware, contrary to your stated belief above, that Skyring has breached that rule during his recent ban. Do you possibly have sufficient evidence, or is that allegation just one of your such? Then, I am not at all certain that Jimbo Wales has reimposed a ban. Rather, I heard that he made a week-long block. Of course, as I do not follow regularly any "New edicts from the management" lists, possibly I have missed such edict. I am sure that you Jtdirl can refer us all to read the precise wording of the reimposed "ban" you have cited. No offense to you, but I prefer to read such by myself and not to rely on your memory, as that thing is rumoredly not highly precise nor free of, how do we say it--- misrepresentations. Of course we all appreciate that you have felt yourself deeply disturbed, being the hugely advertised victim and all, but imo your behavior somehow also disrupts building an encyclopedia. I have detected some indications in your behavior that resemble <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch_hunt.html" title="Witch hunt">witch hunt</a> and also something that resembles a headless chicken running around making noises - see codeword <a href="../../../h/y/s/Hysteria.html" title="Hysteria">hysteria</a>. Remembering that you regard yourself as the victim, probably even you understand that in regular procedures, you will not be allowed to make judgements. You know, there are such concepts as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recusal.html" title="Recusal">recusal</a>. Is it commonplace to the person e.g shot at by another to be the jail-warden of the shooter when he is imprisoned? In what country? This all in your recent behavior remind many of us why it is mandatory to have the justice machinery kept impartial. <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 23:14, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>If he's making unquestionably good edits, and you're reverting them, can I go and revert to his version as a way of vouching or taking responsibility for his edit, so that it would then effectively be my edit and not his?

<p>If they are banned they <i>cannot</i> edit on Wikipedia under any circumstances and that means <i>no</i> edits whatsoever. A ban is meaningless if someone banned actually isn't banned and can edit. A ban means no participation, no editing, nothing. A user can <i>in their own name</i> add in any edits. But simply reverting to a banned user's name using the rollback button is not valid. That was how banned users like DW and many others were dealt with. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Ireland coa.png">Image:Ireland coa.png</a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 21:31, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></p>

<p>Jim, you make a rod for your own back with comments like the above. You seem to personally attack anybody who differs with you, and the truth is that a lot of your stuff needs tweaking, to be perfectly polite. Behaviour aside, you tend to cram too many concepts into the one sentence, or make silly mistakes. Nobody's denying your ability to be absolutely top notch in certain areas, but you aren't perfect in everything, and if someone comes along and copyedits your material, it's not personal hatred of you but love of Wikipedia that makes them act that way.</p>
<p>I used to patrol Recent Changes, and I'd fix a bit of vandalism here, catch a spelling error there. Little things, but I had to work pretty hard for it. Then I cast an eye over your edits, and it was like hitting the jackpot. Even if I knew nothing about the material, I'd generally find a lot of little stylistic details that needed work. Even the finest craftsman doesn't have to put the final polish on his masterpiece, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>A good point is that thing about the Irish Presidential inauguration. In the article, you said "The Irish Constitution makes it clear that a president's term of office expires on the day before the inauguration of their precedessor" and you even gave a reference. It was pretty clear that you meant to say <b>successor</b> rather than <b>predecessor</b>, and I fixed that, along with a comment saying why.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidential_Inauguration_%28Ireland%29&amp;diff=15107259&amp;oldid=15107239" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidential_Inauguration_%28Ireland%29&amp;diff=15107259&amp;oldid=15107239" rel="nofollow">[40]</a></p>
<p>Then you went and reverted it! It is instructive to go along the list of newer edits from the diff above and see the history, but the guts of it is that although you restored one of my corrections, where I changed "President of the United Kingdom" to the intended "President of the United States", it took a lot of to and fro before you accepted that you'd got the presidential term dead wrong. You knew you'd made a mistake, and your attempted correction to "The Irish Constitution makes it clear that a president's term of office expires on the day <b>after</b> the inauguration of their precedessor"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidential_Inauguration_%28Ireland%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=15131000" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidential_Inauguration_%28Ireland%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=15131000" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> was a step in the right direction, but you still reverted it when I corrected it again. OK, perhaps it was wrong of me to make an edit comment saying "Correct increasingly incorrect garbage"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidential_Inauguration_%28Ireland%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15141077" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidential_Inauguration_%28Ireland%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15141077" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> but I would hope that you can understand my frustration.</p>
<p>You weren't being stalked but polished, Jim.</p>
<p>I see a recent comment of yours about "the same ragbag of 'style crusaders' go ballistic and scream abuse"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pope_Benedict_XVI&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=20576898" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pope_Benedict_XVI&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=20576898" rel="nofollow">[43]</a></p>
<p>Just quietly, but one could make the same comment about your own behaviour, and frankly, this sort of unpleasantness, where you are at the centre of an ongoing storm of complaints and reverts, doesn't do a real lot to help foster the image of Wikipedia as a model of co-operative enterprise.</p>
<p>Sure, there are trolls and vandals and scum to be found here, but disagreeing with Jim Duffy over minor details doesn't make people evil.</p>
<p>May I ask that you calm down, accept criticism where justified, stop making so much work for the ArbComm, and give people a chance to have some faith in the system. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Pete</a> 23:42, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Even with all this, I'm not sure Freenet links are a good thing for Wikipedia given Freenet's lack of widespread acceptance; basically everything else present or linked to on Wikipedia can be read by all major browsers 'out of the package', and this is a major deviation from that. Still, absent some broader consensus against the Freenet links, I won't go around removing them myself as long as they stay within these bounds. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 23:23, 10 August 2005 (UTC)24 hours for violating the 3RR.

<p>Admin Carbonite blocked anonymous user 67.182.157.6 a few hours ago. He has come back under the anonymous IP 172.199.120.111 and has resumed his reverts and vandalism. For evidence that this is a sock puppet of his, see the RfC on his behavior here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/DotSix" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/DotSix" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> and the RfA about him here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> (See the section "DotSix".) You will see at the first of these that he frequently uses IPs in the range 172.19*.* (which are AOL IPs). Maybe it is not possible to block a whole range of IPs, but if it is, could you do so? (Assuming you find the evidence of sock-puppetry at the RfC convincing, of course.) Thanks. --Nate Ladd 06:37, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're happy to block specific AOL IP's for a short time (less than an hour, ideally) to stop a given vandal. Blocking AOL IP ranges, however, is a very bad idea, since an IP block also blocks all logged in users using it. Blocking an AOL IP range would block hundreds (possibly thousands) of legit editors who are AOL users (including admins) immediately. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 18:41, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That's correct. The only precedent I remember for shutting down an entire AOL range was during one or more of Mr. Treason's rampages, a year ago or so, during which (iirc) he programmed a vandalbot to make edits using a different AOL IP for each edit. That was a lovely time had by all. I wasn't an admin then, but I still remember it. Range blocks are really a last resort; the last time I did one I got a load of angry e-mail from legitimate users. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>They're also apparently incredibly hard to understand, as IP's don't work the way most people assume they do. (See <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Range_blocks" class="extiw" title="m:Range_blocks">M:Range blocks</a>) For the most part, I think most administrators stay away from them. It's too easy to spot the same pattern of abuse and block the new IP.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and that raises a question for me: If we block a user's IP, they reset to get a new one, and return to vandalizing, should we then unblock the old IP? Is it likely that they could get the same IP address back, where a block would be needed? My understanding is that dynamic IPs use huge IP pools, and that the IPs are randomly assigned, so once we know a user is off a given IP, wouldn't it be a good idea to unblock it to prevent problems for good users? -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 19:43, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the probability of getting your previously assigned dynamic IP back is quite remote, except in the case of small pools, but I admit I don't understand this completely. Long blocks of dynamically-assigned IPs aren't a good idea; once the vandal is blocked, he's probably not coming back on the same IP. If one of those addresses gets a long block inadvertently, it's probably smart to unblock. Regarding range blocks, here is a good netmask calculator so you don't have to do it yourself (put in the first and last IPs in the range you want to block, and it will give you what you need to put in for the range block) <a href="http://www.csc.fi/english/funet/calc/laskin2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.csc.fi/english/funet/calc/laskin2.html" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 20:30, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think mr. Morrow is exhibiting behaviour that is atypical of Wikipedia editors and most likely incompatible. He is clearly intelligent, but he seems to have real issues with emotional involvement, in particular with the subjects of articles. He also seems to judge someone's actions as indicative of character or disposition towards himself, rather than on their own merits.

We coddle too much here. Once in a while, assume bad faith, excise the bad elements, and get on with making an encyclopedia.

He's going to need something more serious, like asking his ISP to disallow connections to Wikipedia. He gives his information publicly on his original user page, nothing is hidden. E-mail (which gives his ISP), phone number, and his website has a copy of his resume, which gives his real name and address. Talking to his ISP is going to have to be where it starts, blocking his IP is never going to work.

<dd>although I haven't cheacked this past experence when dealing with anon IPs suggests that earthlink cycles through it's entire range for everyone although the IP will remain steady per session. I haven't seen any pattern suggesting that IPs are assigned per region. That is why I don't want to do a range block.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 10:24, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He did pretty much the same thing at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_Lovelace_f18d.html" title="Linda Lovelace">Linda Lovelace</a>, doing independant research and being her protector. He also wrote tons of kooky stuff on the talk page and then would erase it. Very wierd. But I must say, my impression was perfectly harmless. Actually, once he lost two votes, he disappeared from the page. I think monitoring might be needed, but I don't see the need for drastic action. He also did not do anything threatening over there. So, my assessment: wierd and kooky, but less harmful than others I have run into. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 11:32, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He's emailed me saying, <i>Hi, I came back to start over, I've been using the account for ages now and you suddenly block it forever, bit harsh! Please can you undo that, if I piss abotu then block me but I haev done a lot of good stuff so please reconsider, cheers, Mike.</i> Seems odd to ask for reinstatement by lying; "I've been using the account for ages" rings untrue, since the first edit on it was Aug. 6. I'm inclined to ignore him entirely. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 01:59, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The admin Sasquatch should be blocked for editing the protected page <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Kennedy_7459.html" title="Ted Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a> three times while protected. Instead of going with the last version, he has taken a POV position in a legitimate content dispute. I have tried to resolve the issue on his talk page first as required by the rules, and some of the communication is on my talk page. He appears well intentioned but clueless and is digging himself deeper into a hole.

<dd>Again, I have said this before on your talk page. No matter which version I revert to, some party will be angry. I simply reviewed what was written at the Talk Page and deicded that the current paragraph is heavily POVed again Ted Kennedy and needs to be taken into relevance. I simply followed the rules set out at <a href="../../../p/p/o/WP%7EPPol_0bed.html" title="WP:PPol">WP:PPol</a> saying: "Reverting to an old version of the page from a week or so before the controversy started if there is a clear point before the controversy." as the contrecery started when the so called "fatboy.cc" editor came back and added this section. This editor has had a past bias against Ted kennedy and reinserted the link. After review of the circumstances, I found that it should probably not be taken as totally good faith and was heavily POVed. Please see the Ted Kennedy for more details. If any other admins think that i acted incorectly, they are free to restore the content without any opposition from me. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch"><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold" color="#1F85FF">Sasquatch</font></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch"><span class="Unicode">讲</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch"><span class="Unicode">看</span></a> 03:39, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I do not believe that there was serious enough wrongdoing to warrant a block. The admin was trying to avoid a revert war, although he didn't have to kill the entire section(well it wasnt much anyway) and not leave any of its information.

<dd>The proffered text had some problems but was as good or better a starting point than deleting the information. Keep in mind there was NO controversy about this passage, just a knee jerk revert war. The passage did not become controversial until we started discussing it afterward. It appears that only a relevancy objection was raised during the revert war. There now appears to be a consensus that some of it will get in as relevant, although trimmed down. Taking a POV position on a protected page by an admin, makes a mockery of the "wrong version" mocking. Obviously, there really is a wrong version and a right version.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 03:55, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SV, I'm not sure I understand what you are asking. All or most of these appear to be issues. From the comments here, on your talk page, and your RfC, it would appear that most or all users (with the exception of you) have reached the following conclusions:
<ul>
<li>TBSDY's block: clearly inappropriate</li>
<li>TBSDY's unblock: might have been better for him to wait to be unblocked; however, he immediately reported his actions here for review and it is quite clear everyone else thinks the block is inappropriate and has not reblocked him</li>
<li>SV block: clear violation of the three-revert rule; a 24-hour block was appropriate. Other side should have been blocked too.</li>
<li>SV unblock: probably should not have unblocked for so clear a violation, and should have reported circumstances here for review. Definitely should not have repeatedly unblocked, especially after being blocked by <i>four different administrators</i>.</li>
<li>RfC: Not sure what you're asking here. Some 25 editors have indicated they feel you are clearly abusing administrative powers.</li>
<li>RFAr: Not sure what you are asking here.</li>
<li>3RR: both parties should have been blocked. The proper response to the one-sided blocking would be to edit your talk page, list the diffs that showed the other's repeated reverts, and ask for a block. Or, since you unblocked yourself, reporting it at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>.</li>
<li>PP: you should not have edited the page while it was under protection, especially as you were already involved in an edit war over it. TBSDY was correct to revert to the originally protected version</li>
<li>BFDL: I am not familiar with this term.</li>
<li>Due process: Is this an issue?</li>
</ul>

<dd>Youre pretty sharp, KS. Points: RFAR I applied when I felt ganged up on by CJK and TJive who felt no qualms with presenting a one-sided report of 3RR. 3RR: "Both parties should have been blocked." But they werent. Hence the block itself could be interpreted as an "abuse." How was it wrong to seek review? Everything seems a bit blown out of proportion ATP, but Im certain some good will come out of this.

<p>Steve, despite your attempts to insinuate me into some sort of conspiracy against you, in that very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Stevertigo" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Stevertigo" rel="nofollow">3RR report</a>, which I did not initiate, I warned CJK very explicitly that he was likely to face a block as well: <i>CJK is cruisin' for a bruisin' too though.</i> If you would condescend to reading CJK's own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:CJK#Arbitration_and_block" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:CJK#Arbitration_and_block" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>, you would see that I explained how the block set upon him was justified. Nevertheless, he has acted much more appropriately than you, who managed to break policy in the course of filing a specious arbitration request when you yourself were responsible for the most egregious violations of policy, not to mention generally uncivil behavior. Not only do you deserve your administrator powers taken away, but you should have been reblocked with the longer expiry date, increased with each successive attempt to evade the measure. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 06:46, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have no problems with TBSDY unblocking himself, as it was clearly a bad block. However, having the ability to unblock oneself is questionable at least. If any sysop is blocked for whatever reason, they should not still have sysop abilities granted to them, and personally feel that this should be looked into. Although, as stated above, I see no fault in TBSDY's actions, just the fault in the system which gave him the ability. Blocked sysops should be unblocked by another sysop, checkuser or beurucrat (sp) only. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Who_d857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Who"><font color="#FF0033">∞</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 07:46, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>

<p>Hello, all. Several anonymous users have vandalized the Nintendo NSider Forums page tonight.

<dd>Mikkalai, I disagree with your objection to these links. "fearing p2p for security reasons" is just FUD. Not all P2P software is insecure. This claim is especially incorrect when we're talking about Freenet, which is designed from the ground up for anonymity. Please learn more about Freenet and its goals before removing these links. Since Freenet is a not-for-profit research project, I find it unlikely that Beta m is "spamming" in favor of Freenet.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Although I think your reason for objecting is silly and detrimental to P2P projects, I still don't think we should aggressively add Freenet links into articles. Wikipedia is a general-purpose encyclopedia, and Freenet is relatively unknown to a general readership. The only reason I'm against adding these links is because they would be useless to most people. Also, this discussion doesn't belong on the administrators' noticeboard. This is a content dispute, not a case of spamming.

<dd>I see it as case of promoting of a particular service, i.e., spamming. When I see the sticker, kind of "information free of censorship," more often than not this is a kind of Hyde Park place where everyone may uncontrollably babble whatever one wants. I am not questioning their rights to do so, but have grave concerns about encyclopedicity and verifiability of such sources.

<p>I don't really care about the presence of links to Freenet, as they are useful to those who can use them. (By the way, Mikkalai, Freenet has no known security risks (although its anonymity is imperfect, it can't compromise your system), and I know of nobody who has ever gotten in legal trouble for using it, at least outside of a dictatorial country (which category does NOT include the US).) However, I noticed that one of the links added, to <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackass_%28TV_series%29_6838.html" title="Jackass (TV series)">Jackass (TV series)</a>, linked to a freesite with Jackass episodes for download.

<dd>This is in support of my point: if a person tries to avoid legal troubles and does not use questionable arrangements, like me, he cannot verify the content of the link.

<dd>I agree, if we do keep the links we should be careful about linking to sites with illegal content. To those who respond "what's the point, then?" Freenet is also a tool for free speech without fear of political reprisal or libel lawsuits. There are conceivable reasons to link to Freenet content. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 20:40, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have to say that I don't think freenet links are approprate. Wikipedia is supposed to be a useful reference source, not a place to push new things; and Freenet is most definately a "new" thing, something that lacks widespread recognition. The primary effect of placing Freenet links in these articles is therefore not to provide the user with more information, but to advertise for Freenet.</p>
<p>Additionally, remember that Wikipedia itself can get in trouble for linking to banned and illegal materials; in other words, we can't link to anything that would actually <i>require</i> Freenet anyway. Therefore there is no reason to ever place a Freenet link in a wikipedia article, except perhaps as an example in the Wikipedia entry on Freenet itself.</p>
<p>The "Freenet project" and the links that have already been placed look to me like they're more intended to spread awareness of Freenet than anything else. Some of the opinions posted above seem to support this; people acknowledge that we can't link to illegal or banned materials on Freenet anyway, making the links redundant as references, then defend their use by saying that Freenet itself is a good thing and ought to be encouraged. Well, maybe it is and maybe it isn't, but Wikipedia isn't supposed to be used for encouraging or discouraging anything. In my opinion, the Freenet links ought to be removed on those grounds. Anything we can link to under Wikipedia policy can be more easily accessed outside of Freenet. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 21:18, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If something linked to in Freenet isn't illegal or banned, then chances are it is available outside of Freenet... As a case in point, look at the link article you just linked to. Of the two Freenet links on that page, the first one was easily found from a non-freenet source (and I have replaced it); using Freenet for things that can be found more easily via HTTP serves no purpose but to advertise Freenet itself. The second was essentially a personal blog; while slightly interesting, it gave no more information than the already-numerous, far simpler HTTP links above it. Possibly if such a page on Freenet was the <i>only</i> source of information for an article then it would make sense to link to it; but in a case like this, with twelve HTTP links already in place, it was clearly unnecessary. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 21:47, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About the particular case of <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dune_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Dune (computer game)">Dune (computer game)</a>, I see no reason whatsoever for "secure" or "anonymous" links; While I don't oppose such links for touchy subjects, where information is harmless such links should be considered spam, useful or no, as they are advertising a service (free or no, it's still advertising). <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfenSilva_4751.html" title="User:WolfenSilva"><sup>w</sup>S</a>;<a href="../../../w/o/l/User_talk%7EWolfenSilva_c0e7.html" title="User talk:WolfenSilva">✉</a> 21:35, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once again we can compare issue of books to this one. If i would have placed a refference to out of print book on the same page, nobody would say "There is no reason for that since there are webpages that deal with that game".

<dd>That's hardly my point. No video game in the Dune series is controversial or subject of potential censorship, and enough information is provided from simple internet searches. You are simply advertising a service which is of no interest for the vast majority of internet users that would visit the said page. Also, if there was a book, even out of print, just the fact of it being a book based on a video game would still justify its inclusion and the lack of printed copies in the market does not mean the book can't be obtained from personal sellers (<a href="../../../s/p/i/Dune%7E_Spice_Opera_cd97.html" title="Dune: Spice Opera">Dune: Spice Opera</a>, the music CD of the first game had a short print that make it only very tough to find even in ebay, and has its own article). <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfenSilva_4751.html" title="User:WolfenSilva"><sup>w</sup>S</a>;<a href="../../../w/o/l/User_talk%7EWolfenSilva_c0e7.html" title="User talk:WolfenSilva">✉</a> 19:48, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't like these links from an aesthetic sense; many links were inserted into articles without any context whatsoever, and for 99.9% of editors, these remain unverifiable, as we refuse to install the special software to view them. Also, it adds four or five lines to an article for one link that may or may not be notable. I'm not blanket deleting these, only deleting them where notability is not established in the link; but honestly, I can't see why we should allow these. An encyclopedia is about verifiability. 100% of our readers can click an http link and read an article; a good portion can look up a book we have; very very few should be expected to install a new, possibly insecure program by people they've never heard of to verify our content. Being relevant to a topic is not the only criteria for addition to an article.</p>
<p>I find Beta's remark - about ISBNs - incorrect. No, not everyone can buy a book - but everyone can click the link and look up information on it. We have no such luxury with freenet, no intermediary like Amazon to tell us what's in that mysterious 127.0.0.1 link. I think these should be removed except where absolutely necessary - and I can think of very few cases for that. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 21:49, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm going to try to reply on this page again. Last two times i've attempted this the software wouldn't let me. First, the fact that there is not Amazon for freesites doesn't make a link unverifyable. There are books that are not on Amazon, there are even some published by independent publishing companies without websites, that does <b>not</b> make those books unverifyable. It is not <i>impossible</i> to check what's on those freesites, you just don't want to go through the trouble, and that's a very different story.</dd>
<dd>Also, i would like to make a request. It's an unofficial one. Please when you talk to people remain calm. From the beginning of the whole thing people who for some reason have some axe to grind against anything which can't be <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">googled</a> have been talking in (although not insulting) but very agressive fashion. Rather than attempting to resolve the problem one on one i was automatically began to be reverted and placed on Administrators' noticeboard, i was told to "cease and desist" without actually being told what am i to cease to do: adding more links, editing my <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBeta_m_Freenet_d385.html" title="User:Beta m/Freenet">user namespace page</a> calling for others to join in with me, you have told me on the Talk:Freenet/Ways to view a freesite#Move that the page must be moved without explaining where, and once again the tone seemed to have been chosen to get me to lose my cool. Of course if that would have happen and i would go adding porn freesite links to articles about the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> i would probably get banned and (as far as you would be conserned) problem would get solved. However, my dear friends, i'm not about to do that.

<dd>My dear fellow wikipedian, please consider these points:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>This section was called spamming and listed, <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBeta_m_993b.html" title="User:Beta m">User:Beta_m</a> as the spammer. While "not all is about [me]" this section here sort of is.</li>
<li>No resolution has been attempted before listing me and my actions on this noticeboard. The first comment on my talk page relating to this was to inform me about existance of this "incident".</li>
<li>Your comment on the talk page wasn't rude, and i have admitted that, however, it was by no way neutral (although it was better then the comment above this one). But i'll just say <a href="../../../o/m/_/Om_mani_padme_hum.html" title="Om mani padme hum">Om mani padme hum</a> and let it all go.</li>
<li>While i have conseded some edits (<a href="../../../d/u/n/Dune_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Dune (computer game)">Dune (computer game)</a> for example) not to start edit wars, i did not perceive this sort of reaction from the other side. <b>Note</b> It is very much possible that i have misinterpreted this particular point, (and in fact all of them), but this is just my <a href="../../../p/o/v/Pov.html" title="Pov">pov</a>.</li>
<li>As you can see below in the "from mikka talk page" subsection, the first thing that i have done was to attempt to release some tention ("please don't take it personally"), than i have given the reasons for my actions... and even provided a resolution process which i would think would bring everybody to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a>. Many wikipedians don't even know about this page (i didn't untill this "incident") but they do know about VfD and TfD, thus more people could actually comment on this issue. This however, is not beneficial when the consensus is not what you are looking for, but simply want to win.</li>
<li>When i've been asked to do something (which i didn't really care to do), such as write up a "How to guide for viewing of Freesites", i have done so almost immediately (falsely believing that this would (at least partially) sattisfy the &lt;sarcasm&gt;"delete them all and let the god sort them out"&lt;/sarcasm&gt; side of the argument). What did that bring me? No resolution of the conflict, just more problems.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So is this all about me? No of course it's not. But it is about the knowing more pages to report somebody to either. It is about the readers of this encyclopedia, the only one what attempts to have a <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> and always include both sides of the argument. <a href="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User:beta_m" class="external text" title="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User:beta_m" rel="nofollow">Beta_M</a> <a href="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User_talk:beta_m" class="external text" title="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User_talk:beta_m" rel="nofollow"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beta_m_affc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beta m">|<sup><b>contrib</b></sup></a> (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Beta_m_520d.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Beta m"><small>Ë-Mail</small></a>)</dd>

<dd>I don't object to the addition of freesite links that are legal and useful, but it looks like most of those you added don't satisfy both criteria. The anarchism ones (and probably many more) are available on the regular Web, and the ones offering downloads of software/music could put Wikipedia in legal jeopardy. Even if it is abandonware (as the Dune site says), it's best to avoid any infringement, don't you think? ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 23:03, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My difficulty with these links is really that it requires people to install software to view them, software that is not produced by Wikipedia. Discounting the responsibility angle, it just somehow goes against the grain to actually make it <i>more</i> difficult for people to get information if it is actually already available legally on the web, and if it is not, then the legal ramifications of providing links to non-legal content set in. I don't see how such links are more useful than any other, just because of anonymity, which in the majority of cases, is not an issue. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a>• <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 23:32, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Mikka says "I cannot determine the encyclopedicity of the links because I cannot see them, which violates the requirement of verifiability." What about links to books that occur throughout Wikipedia? I can not determine the encylopedicity of these links unless I go to the bookstore or library and ask for these books. It is a lot easier to download a p2p program and check out links. As far as security, I am more concerned about the government using the Patriot Act then running some p2p program. I'm not really sure what Mikka means by security - I wrote my own p2p program once, I know it is secure because I wrote it. I do not know what the Patriot Act is doing to my library checkouts. Mikka's arguments in this regard do not make sense.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think a total ban on Freenet links makes little sense. For example, on the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freenet.html" title="Freenet">Freenet</a> page, I don't see why a Freenet link shouldn't be posted. Or on one of the other p2p pages. Or a Freenet link to pages that for one reason or another are not on the web - maybe they're from some political group that doesn't have a web page for some reason. I mean, if I go to [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mailing_lists" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mailing_lists" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>], there is a straight NNTP link, and there are many such links around Wikipedia. I think the appropriateness of the links are determined by the individual case. I would tend to be more lenient. Mikka might be unwilling to verify something, just like I might not want to go to the library, or get an NNTP browser and whatnot, but that's his choice. <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> 19:29, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, please don't take it personally, but i have reverted your removal of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freenet.html" title="Freenet">Freenet</a> links. I've never seen any policy of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> that stated that only <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wide_Web_2386.html" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> articles can be reffenced. If your argument was that not all users have Freenet installed, than you also <b>must</b> go and remove any <a href="../../../i/s/b/ISBN_9609.html" title="ISBN">ISBN</a> refferences, since not every person has ability to buy a particular book. If you wish to create a precident, rather than removing links one at the time i would suggest placing Template:Freenet links on vote for deletion or something, so that everybody can just talk it out rather than start revert wars.</p>
<p>Also please note that all the freesites that were addes were in fact relevant to the particular toppics, and thus can be useful to a person who is doing the research about a topic, if that person just happen to have an access to a freenode.

<dd>I did not revert, just added new information which was subsequently vandalised by Ril. As you can see from each alleged revert, I did not destroy the text by Ril, but added references and new texts. I did remove non-relevant informatuin, like Ril's rants about the alleged crimes of Crusdader kings, which belong in another article.--<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGermen_dad1.html" title="User talk:Germen">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Germen_c63b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Germen">Contribs</a> <a href="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/a/ab/Nl_small.gif" alt="" width="25" height="11" longdesc="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" /></a>) 17:15, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, you will note that each of Germen's edits listed above constitutes a revert of the passage in question. There are equally 4 reverts of other passages in the time period, but in different edits, totalling 4 reverts of the entire article between them. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 17:16, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ril, you need to realize that just because someone else reverts 4 times, doesn't give you the right to revert back each of those 4 times, unless it is clear vandalism, which this was not.</dd>

<dd>BMIComp, None of those show any diffs, they all show only zero change. You must supply evidence of actual reverting, i.e. that I reverted someone's edits. Other edits, such as re-arranging, putting in text, fixing typos, etc. do not count, and you must make it clear that the text is being reverted. If you check out what was going on, you will see that the above 6 applies to different sections, not the same one. You will note that each time, Germen reverted a section 3 times (over a span of 10 or so consecutive edits), I reverted it back 3 times, warning Germen about 3RR on the 3rd. You will note that after this warning, Germen then reverted a different section 3 times (again over a span of 10 or so edits), and again I reverted it back 3 times. No-one part of the text was reverted by either of us more than 3 times. This repeated for various parts of the text until eventually, Germen actually reverted a piece of the text for its fourth time, so I listed the 3RR violation here. Note that I list 4 reverts, not 20 or so that is actually the number of times that sections were re-changed by Germen, as it is only 4 times that any single piece of the text was reverted. If 3RR applied to reverting the page in any way whatsoever, i.e. those 6 actions actually counting as 3RR violations, then I would have listed Germen's 3RR violations much earlier (i.e. instead of my edit marked "Cleanup" at mid-day-ish). <a href="../../../8/1/2E/User%7E81.156.176.160.html" title="User:81.156.176.160">81.156.176.160</a> 08:17, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Noitall, edit 12=edit 11, both are claimed by you to occur at 7:00 August 6, edit 14 is 24 hours and 12 minutes later, i.e. over 24 hours, so can't count as 3RR. And anyway, it only counts as the 3rd edit since edit 10 not the 4th as edit 11=edit 12. Indeed, since edit 10 is over 48 hours ago, I could quite legitimately make a 15th right now if necessary without breaking 3RR. I strongly suggest you read the opening sentence of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> that makes clear this applies to 24 hour periods not to 2 week periods. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 23:50, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This page only addresses a small part of -Ril-'s stalking and bad faith behavior (which counts possibly more than 100 bad faith actions, which could be construed as personal attacks since they were intentionally meant to cause trouble, disrupt and were for the purposes of revenge (of what, I do not know, other than personal dislike). In this entire time, he did not edit a single word, he only reverted. In this entire time, he did not edit or revert a single edit other than mine. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 20:55, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Noitall, 3RR applies to 24 hour periods, not reverts over several days. As you can clearly see above <b>there is not a violation of 3RR here</b> - read <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. This is a bad faith posting. You are discrediting yourself by posting this. Oh, and inaccurately claiming the times of the diffs you provide (check them) doesn't help your case either. Nor does listing the same edit twice - 11 and 12 are identical - they are the same edit. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 23:01, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This does not appear to be a 3RR violation. However, slow edit wars and gaming the 3RR are frowned upon. I would recommend that the disputants in this edit war seek mediation or some other dispute resolution, rather than continuing this pointless slow edit war. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 14:35, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a>, please be my guest. Two other editors have tried to intercede to no avail. The problem is that -Ril- does not have an edit dispute, he has targeted me. He has done so on about 40 pages so far as he trolls my edits. I keep threatening to do an RfC, but it seems like such a waste of time and effort when I would prefer to be editing. Bottom line, ignoring for the moment his personal vendetta against me, he says "POV" about 100 times without ever once stating what is POV. Jayjg suggested a change to the edit and made it and it was fine. -Ril- even reverted that thinking that I made the edit. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a>, if you want to stroll into -Ril-world, you are welcome to try.

<p>This is a cut from -Ril-'s talk page:</p>
<p>I am blocking you for 72 hours due to your 3RR violation on <i>The Bible and history.</i></p>
<p>Your fourth edit was 24 hours and <s>nineteen</s>21 minutes after your first. That's close enough for me, and here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are making sterile reverts with no discussion on the talk page and no attempt at compromise in wording.</li>
<li>You do not appear to be discussing your reverts with the other users on their talk pages or at any other location at Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Both the edit summaries and the timing of your reverts make it clear that you feel that 3 reverts a day is an entitlement, when it's not.</li>
<li>You appear to be engaging in sterile reverts on several other pages as well.</li>
<li>I note that you have already been blocked twice in the past month for 3RR violations and therefore I have blocked you for 72 hours rather than the customary 24 hours.</li>

<li>I believe this listing is misleading. There is no 5-day 13RR. And no set of 3 of his edits cited as evidence were within the same 24 hour period. It is true that Ril was revert-warring excessively, and that is bad, but it is <i>not</i> 3RR, and listing as 3RR and treating it as if it were <i>3RR</i> despite the fact it's clearly not is somewhat misleading, when the issue is problematic behavior (but not violation of this particular rule). Perhaps you want to propose a change of the 3RR policy or a new rule to include a massive number of reverts over a longer period of time? --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 16:11, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I blocked based on <s>3</s>4 reverts in 24 hours and 21 minutes, not for 13 reverts in 5 days. I believe that there is, and should be, enough elasticity in the 3RR to cover such obvious attempts to game the system. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 05:04, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All the same, I would like to know... which 4 reverts were within the same 24 hour +/- 20 minute period? I assume you mean 4, since if he performed only 3 reverts in that time period, then he would not have been in violation of 3RR. Had he waited <b>24 hours and 21 minutes</b>, it seems a clear demonstration that he had made a good effort to follow the 3RR policy. Reverts over 24 hours later are not what 3RR is about, the important thing about those reverts turning out to be so close to 24 hours apart is that he is not simply ignoring the rule, 3RR. There may indeed be gaming of the system attempted, he may merit blocking for a reason by some other name. Just like with other edit wars, doesn't Wikipedia have a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">dispute resolution</a> process which would be more appropriate? --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 06:44, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I've waited long enough. This is an admin, so I expected him to turn himself in, but he hasn't. This is a page he is an editor of and not a neutral observer. He also had the nerve to put a 3RR block himself on an anon user who was involved in the war, even though that user only has a total of two edits to his credit. Whatever this anon user deserves, it isn't a 3RR block, and certainly not from an admin who was a party to the dispute, who obviously beleives in the 3RR (not a given you know). Appended is the block log entry:</li>

<dd>Note, this text was hardly causing an emergency, it is the type of text that has been accepted on many articles. There was plenty of time for others in a possibly objecting consensus to participate, or to call a neutral admin. This was not an obvious case of vandalism, although I suspect there may have been sock puppetry, or spoofing of IPs on some, but not all the edits.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 08:25, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Blocking this editor at this point would not serve the purpose of the 3RR as the edits are nearly 24 hours old anyway and the article is currently protected. Please note that the purpose of the 3RR is as a tripwire to stop edit warring; it is not punitive. I therefore recommend against blocking him. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 14:27, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I learn something new each time an admin violates the 3RR, this time that it is not punitive, and if the rule is violated just before the article is protected, then a block is unneeded. Apparently we need the ability to block for 3RR on only one article, so that the block does not give the false impression of being punitive, and the rule should be edited to eliminate the expression of "regret" provision, since that also suggests punitiveness. This interpretationa also has the logical hole, that if friends of the blocked individual can continue an edit war and get the page protected, then they can get their friend's blocked released. How consistently is a block released BTW, once the page has been protected? Or is this a novel interpretation?--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 21:08, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Admins have discretion in applying the 3RR; they can refuse to block or block for less than 24 hours if the admin feels that a lesser block will be sufficient to meet the goal of the 3RR, which is to curtail an ongoing edit war. In this case, the edit war has been terminated by page protection, so there's no need to block. The conclusion that 3RR blocks are not punitive is a direct consequence of the fact that none of Wikipedia policy is punitive; all of our policy exists to further the end of <i>writing an encyclopedia</i>. Blocks are used when an editor's conduct are interfering with that goal, not because we wish to punish someone for breaking a rule. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 00:11, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What's overzealous? There's no 3RR violation when reverting a 3RR-evading sockpuppet account -- and the account I blocked was so obviously a sockpuppet of the fatboy anon that there was no reason to waste any time by providing rope. I'm glad, though, that the anon finally has a champion who has the guts to establish an account; hopefully, Silverback will carefully follow the history of the fatboy dispute (most of the discussion is still on <a href="../../../t/e/d/Talk%7ETed_Kennedy_2e81.html" title="Talk:Ted Kennedy">Talk:Ted Kennedy</a>) and understand that this has more to do with appropriate Wikipedia behaviour than any content of the <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Kennedy_7459.html" title="Ted Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a> article. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 19:01, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comments:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The single diffs disguise the fact that each revert is done in stages of up to eleven edits, for some reason. I've placed the article at RfC, but Germen seems disinclined to wait at the last consensus version of the page for other editors to comment (though it's true that no-one has turned up yet — outside comments would be helpful). His edits started as a simple attempt to add what he calls "Islamofascist" groups to the article, and that is clearly still his main focus. I warned him of 3RR, but he reverted again anyway.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>I was certain that I hadn't violated 3RR myself, but the history seems to show that I have; it was inadvertent, and I'd revert myself if I could, but Germen's too quick for me. Whatever happens, I'm leaving the article alone now for a day or two, as the edit-warring was getting silly, so it would be even more useful if other editors could offer an opinion at <a href="../../../s/u/p/Talk%7ESupremacism_3b49.html" title="Talk:Supremacism">Talk:Supremacism</a> as to the long list of groups that Germen insists on adding. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 17:59, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Errare humanum est. Nevertheless, you repeated refusal to constructively incorporate my additions, of which several groups are qualified supremacist groups cannot be qualified as a mistake. In contrast, I did not remove any of your additions, just I added my information. My actions cannot be classified as reverts. So we have a problem: you accuse other users of breaking the 3RR rule without proof and you break this rule yourself. I suggest you familiarize yourself with Wikipedia policy and meanwhile try to check whether your interpretatio of supremacism matches the definition in the article.--<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGermen_dad1.html" title="User talk:Germen">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Germen_c63b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Germen">Contribs</a> <a href="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/a/ab/Nl_small.gif" alt="" width="25" height="11" longdesc="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" /></a>) 18:21, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mel's statement is exactly the way Wiki is supposed to work. I too have gotten caught up in edit wars (am trying to reduce them) and it seems an acknowledgement that both parties went too far and are taking a step back.

<li>I agree that it is four reverts in 24 hours. I am more than hesitant to block Mel, as blocking him would have a far worse effect than not doing so. I therefore shall warn him, and remind him to be careful when reverting. Germen, it would help if you put times on your report. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">[[smoddy]]</a> 18:26, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I am busy adding the times here.

<li>Update: Times added. I do not report users for 3RR often, as this is IMHO no fair play so I have no routine.

</ul>

<li>The first revert is clearly unrelated to the next three. This is therefore not 3RR. Heraclius's accusations that I have violated 3RR before are also false, as the record demonstrates that I have never been blocked for 3RR violation. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 05:57, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Zeno's first revert was a revert of vandalism, from a user who wanted to delete all the content of this page and replace it with a copy/paste copyvio, from this page <a href="http://anwary-islam.com/women/pwife_maria.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://anwary-islam.com/women/pwife_maria.htm" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>. The 3rr doesn't apply to vandalism, so I don't think that it has been broken. I also note that <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeraclius_a3ac.html" title="User:Heraclius">Heraclius</a> has so far failed to explain, why he insist on adding the {{TotallyDisputed}} tag, despite Zeno's efforts on the articles talk page. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 06:25, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>User keeps deleting and changing the same passage of the "Politics" section. He technically violated 3RR yesterday already, but rather than report him I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cuba&amp;diff=20475804&amp;oldid=20475660" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cuba&amp;diff=20475804&amp;oldid=20475660" rel="nofollow">warned him</a> about doing so, and this is the answer in return. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 11:18, August 8, 2005 (UTC)
