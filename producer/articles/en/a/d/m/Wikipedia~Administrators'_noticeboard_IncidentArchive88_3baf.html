<p>After weighty consideration, I have deleted the inappropriate picture that resided at <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolicon.html" title="Lolicon">Lolicon</a>. I put my justification on the mailing list: <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-April/043119.html" class="external free" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-April/043119.html" rel="nofollow">http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-April/043119.html</a>.

<dd>The deleted image has been added to the article by an external link. It was soon removed, perhaps accidentally as editors reverted each other over the new image. If an edit war ensues and protection is done, could we protect with the external link gone? It made no sense to me that the article was protected for days with the image in the article. It was a clear copyright violation in that state, out side of fair use. This is a cabalish request, I know. But does it make sense?

<dd>I wrote the message on the mailing list first because it's good to have a single set of reasons that you can point to.

<dd>I understand that you are upset. As I have explained before, I saw that this was the only method by which the issue could be resolved. As for the mailing list, I was not using the mailing list as an appeal to a higher authority. I was mainly using it as somewhere where I could place my rationale and link to it from different places. I apologise if people think this was a mistake. My attempt was to make this as calm and as flame-less as possible. I resent a great deal being labelled a cowboy when I have put a huge amount of effort into being as conciliatory as possible. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">Sam Korn</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Korn_f7db.html" title="User talk:Sam Korn">(smoddy)</a></sup> 00:30, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do sort of agree with Aaron in that people finally seemed to be discussing things despite the cry to jimbo - and for those who would bother the last image "proposition" that Sam did (the rack of magazines) was actually already discussed in archive 3 of the talk page. I'm just hoping it doesn't ignite an even bigger edit war. Oh well, I guess if that happens I can protect again thus starting the discussion cycle over again... <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Just another star in the night</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 00:47, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, my point is that owing to the intransigence of some editors we had a clearly obscene and unsuitable picture on the site for well over a year. To suggest that progress had been made <i>because the image was a copyright infringement</i> is to completely miss the point.

<dd>If you don't want your personal information compiled by Brandt, don't release it. I don't have any info on my userpage that can be linked to me. If I get on the page, I'll probably laugh for a bit that Brandt is sad enough to put me on his list of people he dislikes, then I will get over it. This is the type of coping mechanism that you can see all the time. Somebody who feels rejected by general society puts together a "kill list", seeing this as a form of revenge.

One should never cite Wikipedia(for that matter one should never cite any encyclopedia) one should always track down the sources cited by Wikipedia and cite those. However, deliberate vandalism to make such a point is not acceptable behavior. I would send a strong note to him that 1) If the prof's students need to be to told that Wikipedia is not an academic level RS then they sbhould probably be eliminated from the genepool. 2) Explain to him that many people are putting many hours into Wikipedia and his vandalism wastes there time. If he doesn't respond to that, talk to whoever is his superior. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:04, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspect that it's vandalism of the worst sort: the subtle, hard-to-detect stuff. Blanking an article and replacing it with <i>OMG GEORGE BUSH IS TEH SUXORS!!!!!111!!</i> is easily detected by non-experts and quickly repaired. (In some cases, it's even fixed by a bot.) On the other hand, changing the date of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Arfderydd_32ea.html" title="Battle of Arfderydd">Battle of Arfderydd</a> from 573 to 575 might pass unnoticed. A reference to a community named Forest Hill might easily be changed to Forest Park.</dd>

My daughter is not precisely a child, she is at a university after all, and (being her mother's daughter) is extremely critical in evaluating information from anyone (trust me, I'm grilled about sources frequently.) And Essjay, thank you so much, I will avail myself of your effort. I am not certain whether my daughter will be interested in pursuing this herself, however, as in addition to being critical she is also careful about choosing her battles, and frankly if she weighs the benefits and possible repercussions she may determine it is not in her best interest to involve herself. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 15:35, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The capital after a colon is actually more complicated than that in American grammar. First, many Americans(even educated ones) simply don't do it at all. Second, some only capitalize when the section after the colon can stand as a sentence on its own. So "blah, blah blah: list" would not have the first item in the list capitalized. I think American MOSes differ on what is preferable in such cases, but I haven't looked at the matter in much detail in a while. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 14:45, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a content dispute - it was irresponsible to block Mike Garcia. Furthermore, in most cases Mike is correct. I have discussed this at length and researched this thoroughly, and I am confident that it is grammatically correct to use were/are in instances where the band's name is a plural noun which represents the members. For instance, "The White Stripes are..." is the correct way to start the article. <a href="../../../r/j/n/User%7ERJN_4c2b.html" title="User:RJN">User:RJN</a> continues to edit articles of bands and sports teams to insert this awkward grammar.</dd>

<p>Ugh, I'm trying not to be involved in this thing. I didn't even touch any of these latest edits. I was just warned that this user was <i>again</i> disrupting many articles by enforcing his particular views on grammar on them. Also, there was a long email conversation with this user awhile ago which basically ended with him saying, "I don't care what you say, I'm going to keep reverting." That's not an acceptable way of solving things. The closest analog would be if someone were going through articles changing American spellings to British spellings, repeatedly, and continued even after being warned. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA">Cyde&#160;Weys</font></a></b> 16:21, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If they're doing something blockable, but you're involved in the dispute, the wisest course of action is to make a request here (or on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>) asking another admin to perform the block. I think one of the few "reverts" being involved in that doesn't count as a conflict of interest for blocking purposes is clear vandalism, and Mike definitely didn't do that (I haven't looked at 158.233.1.117, so can't comment on that). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 16:56, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright, in the future, I'll leave it up to other admins. Anyway, I asked this guy to file an RFC regarding collective noun grammar and he patently refused; basically, he was sure he was right, and he was going to continue editing things to his way. I strongly warned against this course of action. And then yesterday, he continued with the reversions, maybe thinking I had somehow forgotten or lost track. Nope. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA">Cyde&#160;Weys</font></a></b> 17:05, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not saying that Mike Garcia's editing style is ideal - when there is a disagreement over his edits, he immediately assumes bad faith, accuses the other party of vandalism, and threatens to revert endlessly, no matter how small the dispute is. However, that doesn't give admins a license to block him, especially if they're on the other side of the content dispute. I think an RFC would be a good idea - not about Mike's conduct (or yours, mine, or RJN's), but about the grammar issue. I am almost positive that I am correct. Every media outlet I have checked agrees with using are/were/they/their when describing plural bands such as The White Stripes. The New York Times seems particularly authoritative: "In 2003, the White Stripes left behind the Strokes and just about everyone else when <b>they</b> released 'Elephant'" (The White Stripes Change <b>Their</b> Spots, The New York Times, May 29, 2005 Sunday, Late Edition - Final, Section 2; Column 4; Arts and Leisure Desk; MUSIC; Pg. 1, 1548 words, By KELEFA SANNEH) Rolling Stone says "The White Stripes <b>are</b> at a commercial and creative peak." <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7582742/white_on_white/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7582742/white_on_white/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> It is very hard to argue that these publications are grammatically incompetent. I am going to have very little time this weekend, so if there is an RFC I would really appreciate it if someone pasted this comment into it, or mentioned the RS/NYT cites.

<dd>Actually, assuming bad faith, accusing people of vandalism, and threatening to revert endlessly are good cause for a block. But I digress. The last time this came up with this user I told him to file exactly the kind of RfC you and I are talking about. He refused and threatened to revert endlessly. Gahhhrr. And as for your examples ... the first one is using the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singular_they.html" title="Singular they">singular they</a>, which is an altogether different grammatical issue, and the second is from Rolling Stone, hardly a paragon of grammatical virtue. I think the end result is that either way is acceptable (much like British/American spelling of words), and general consensus on how to deal with that is to leave stuff alone and <i>don't</i> go through articles changing everything to "your" way. That's exactly what Mike Garcia was doing. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA">Cyde&#160;Weys</font></a></b> 20:12, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Come on, I think you understand that I can find many more examples from reputable sources. Are you really going to attack each source I come up with? The NY Times is not using the singular "they", which is only used to refer to a person of unknown gender. It's obviously the plural "they" - otherwise the author would have written "when it released 'Elephant'", and "The White Stripes Changes Its Spots". Notice the plural verb "change their" as opposed to the singular "changes its" in the headline. Rolling Stone is a professionally-edited magazine and it's a little arrogant to say that you know better than them. Can <i>you</i> cite any American magazines or newspapers which support your usage? I don't see you providing any examples. As for your point about leaving articles in their original state, RJN was the one who went on an edit spree in the first place, in January, changing a great number of articles from "are" to "is". <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 20:53, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree; there was a sort of warning, but it gave no indication of a Wikipedia policy — it more or less said "stop doing this or I'll block you, because I think that it's disruptive" (is there a template for this warning, incidentally? With the rapidly accelerating template-creep I'm surprised that there isn't). Also, did you check to see how many of the recipients had voted in an earlier poll, and so deserved to be informed of a new poll on a revised propsal (I was one of those)?</p>

<dd>Talk page spamming is just a bad idea. The one time I think it's found acceptable is when a user is thanking people for voting on their RfA. At all other times it is highly frowned upon. Even during ArbCom elections people's talk pages weren't spammed; rather, a notice was placed in a highly visible place. If the anti-censorship WikiProject is having some kind of vote then placing a prominent note on their project page should be enough to get the attention of the users seriously involved. If there are users out there who aren't checking up on their WikiProjects even once a week, they simply aren't very involved with them, and it's probably okay if they miss a chance to vote on something. That's better than spamming up hundreds of talk pages, anyway. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA">Cyde&#160;Weys</font></a></b> 16:55, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Over at <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolicon.html" title="Lolicon">Lolicon</a> there's dispute about the best way forward regarding external links to sites containing images which are of questionable legality.

<dd>That is a good question, BorgHunter. Initially, I'd have agreed with you, since interactions with other members had been reasonably civil. However, his handling of my attempts to discuss the matter with him were not, and indeed he blanked my messages that I left him on his talk page (replying, admittedly, on my talk page; but it is nonetheless not the sign of one who is willing to improve). It was more my exasperation at trying to tell him his use of Wikipedia as a political soapbox was incorrect, and his impolite and uncooperative stance towards attempts to get him to behave, which lead me to ultimately decide there was no other choice than an outright ban. So no, at this time, I would say that the suitable avenues for reform have been well and truly exhausted. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 21:52, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid, while strongly opposing ROGNNTUDJUU's recent behaviour, I also oppose a <s>cabbalist</s> community ban on him. 150 productive mainspace edits is still 150 productive mainspace edits, and he hasn't necessarily stopped making them to wage a war for userbox campaigning. I think standard temporary blocks for personal attacks and disruption, if necessary, and seeking a ban from userbox-related editing from the ArbCom if that doesn't stop him would be preferable. If we can't find grounds for temporary blocks I can't see why a permanent one is justified. But I don't feel particularly strongly about it, and we do need a clear message that political campaigning is not acceptable. I'm just not sure it should be a swinging corpse. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 14:52, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is unclear to me why ROGNNTUDJUU has been banned. The cited behaviour, <i>persistently disruptive attitude, obsessive focus on the creation, recreation and defence of inflammatory/divisive (T1-criterion) userboxes, or copies in userspace</i>, does not seem in-and-of-itself a bannable offense.

<dd>(edit conflict) Well, I would-I don't have any userboxes on my userpage- and Cyde would become some sort of saint.

<dd>I have to concur. This seems to be using procedure to silence a vocal member of the "keep" faction of the userbox debates, not because he's violating policies but because his opinions are not shared by older members. I've yet to see specific policies that this user has violated, and nothing that it's even been implied ROGNNTUDJUU! has done warrants an indefinite block.

<p>I concur with BorgHunter's comments, as well as with those of Samuel_Blanning, StrangerInParadise, and De mortuis.... The idea of a ban on userboxes, etc., is better than nothing, but the ban was illicit in the first place (note the wording of the template: "This user has been blocked indefinitely from editing Wikipedia, per ruling of administrators, Jimbo Wales, and/or the Arbitration Committee." The nearest to one of thoose is the decision of one admin, which I don't think counts as a "ruling of administrators". Disruption warrants a block of twenty-four hours, increased if the behaviour continues, not a permanent block. If no-one else wants to, I'm happy to lift it. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 15:54, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you object to the ban because you think it's the wrong solution, that's one thing and I'm fine with it. But don't object to it on some sort of procedural grounds intended to preserve the authority of the Arbitration Committee. The Arbitration Committee is not specially empowered as the only entity allowed to come up with solutions. If the community comes up with a solution and wants to implement it, they don't need the ArbCom to endorse it. The only time that the ArbCom is specially required is when someone needs to be desysoped or debureaucrated, and that's only because of procedural requirements imposed by the stewards on Meta.</dd>

<p>I'm willing to support an indefinite ban, although I would compromise on a shorter ban duration and an injunction against getting involved with userboxes and other wikilawyering. Wikipedia is about writing an encyclopedia and some people are gaming us with their MySpacing non-encyclopedic userbox templates. The templates ROGNNTUDJUU! was arguing about were clear violations of Jimbo's T1 policy and did not help the encyclopedia at all; they were simply foolish, stupid, and divisive. We don't need scores of people hanging around questioning the motives of those of us who actually care about writing the damn encyclopedia. And I find it ironic that StrangerInParadise dares show his face in here, because he's on ice just about as thin as ROGNNTUDJUU!'s. And to those of you attacking this block saying that no specific policies were violated ... that's because of the wikilawyering and the gaming of the system. Although I would say that <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">WP:ENC</a>, which is the <i>spirit</i> of the project, was violated. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA">Cyde&#160;Weys</font></a></b> 16:08, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do not think the community at large has the authority to impose a non-total ban on a user against their will. This is not the Arbitration Committee, and it is for that purpose that we have such a committee. Also, this section looks quite distinctly like a straw poll. That's not how community bans work. They <i>only</i> work when there is 100% unanimity among admins. If any admin is willing to unblock, then there can be no community ban and the matter must go to ArbCom. I for one do not support an indef ban on the back of ROG...'s editing, although he is being tiresome for sure. I certainly do not feel able to support any more creative bans, as I do not consider that admins have the authority so to impose upon an editor. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 16:14, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think administrators have, and have always had, the power to indefinitely block accounts whose only purpose is to disrupt the encyclopeda, or which do not contribute to the encyclopedia in any way (there's ample precedent in the case of several users being banned for using Wikipedia as a personal file server). ROGNNTUDJUU! could end all of this right now by leaving the templates be and wandering back into the article space. That he persists in disruptive behavior is troubling.

<p>See my comments above about the Arbitration Committee. I fully disagree with the claim that the community lacks such authority, and I urge people to disregard objections to such solutions that are grounded solely in procedural arguments such as the above. Argue against the substance of the proposed remedy, not against the authority of the community to impose it. There is no division of authority on Wikipedia: al administrators act on behalf of the community and have the authority to use their powers however is required to serve the needs of the community. The Arbitration Committee's purpose is merely to break deadlocks when it is necessary to do so.

<dd>My objection is not merely procedural. I do not think that a group of admins can impose arbitrary restrictions on an editor. If I must argue against only the substance, rather than the foundation, of the ban, then I would argue that all of the substance is wrong, <i>because</i> of the inherent problems. The community is not arbcom's mother, either, and there are some things that are only usefully settled by the committee -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 16:43, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is attitudes like this that (a) let problems fester in the community, sometimes endlessly (because there is "no procedure for dealing with that sort of problem") and (b) overload the Committee by forcing it to deal with problems for which there is an obvious solution but which a handful of dogmatic holdouts in the community prevent from being implemented. Splash, and others who think like him, I ask you to consider whether your doctrinaire attitude against community action to resolve problems like these is in the best interest of Wikipedia. You've said that "there are inherent problems" but not identified them. You're not making a substantive argument, beyond "I don't like it, and therefore I will oppose it." If that is the meat of your objection, the community would be well-advised to simply ignore you. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 18:35, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That an arbitrary restriction of the nature of <i>"a community ban from creating, editing or deploying userboxes and making inflammatory political statements"</i> is not appropriate for the community to impose.

<p>Normally I can at least see the point of the other side, but in this case, I'm disturbingly in full agreement with the people commonly regarded as hardline boxen deletionists. I see no reason to unblock this user unless he agrees to stop disrupting Wikipedia. Let us remember that if your bad contributions outweigh your good contributions, you shouldn't expect much quarter unless you make a good faith effort to improve. I stay away from meta issues these days, but even I've run across this user now and then, and every time I've seen him, he's been stirring up a ruckus. Unless he agrees to stop (or at least try to reduce such incidents) disrupting our operations which (lest we forget) aim to build an encyclopaedia, he shouldn't be permitted anywhere near boxen-space. The community has every right to impose a ban on someone it finds intolerable. The only question now is whether enough people support the ban for it to be tenable. (Community rulings are getting rarer and rarer these days -- an unavoidable effect of having a larger community, which in turn raises the threshold for consensus.) While I personally support the ban and would like to see more "community rulings" in the future, I have a feeling this will end up in front of the arbcom pretty soon. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 16:47, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This doesn't need to be done as a ban, entertaining as playing at being an Arbitrator must be. All that is necessary is for ROG... to be made to understand that people are low on patience with him, and view his edits, particularly to userboxes as at best borderline disruptive. If people (admins, that is) decide that he <i>is</i> being disruptive, then they have all the latitude they need to block for e.g. 24hrs, and escalating as appropriate. Clearly, such blocks remain open to review as usual. There is no need to construct this as a ban. It can be done entirely decentralized. Again, if people wish to play at arbitration they should stand in the next elections. I should make clear that I fully agree that he is being a pain and that he needs to stop and that he has not been being constructive. I just don't think that a "hands up, who wants to ban him" approach is right. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 17:28, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Escalating bans are far more warranted, as is communication with the user about Wiki values and a warning that a block is imminent. If the user still doesn't get it after having this explained (which it now has been), then blocking becomes more appropriate. And perhaps Cyde is right: if ROG's 750 non-mainspace edits have been largely disruptive, why hasn't he been talked to and progressively blocked before? This user could have used lessons in Wiki values and Wikiquette a long time ago. Hopefully ROG can still be made into a productive editor. If he can't, well, that's too bad and he'll end up banned.

<p>Strange that you say "why hasn't he been talked to and progressively blocked before?" Well he hasn't been blocked before, but looking at his talk page I see plenty of evidence that other editors have complained to him about his disruptive behavior with respect to userboxes.

<p>Today I reverted some very interesting vandalism committed by two young users having some fun on the <a href="../../../p/i/m/Pimp.html" title="Pimp">pimp</a> article. Normally, such innane nonsense would be no problem, but it contained personal phone numbers, real names, and an IP address that let me know exactly from where they were editing (a high school in <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oregon.html" title="Oregon">Oregon</a>. I deleted the article and restored in sans bad stuff (admin may want to take a look at the last ten or so entries), and blocked the two accounts for vandalism and adding personal information. All standard stuff.</p>
<p>It gets interesting here: always looking for a way to impress upon youths the need for privacy on the Internet, I looked up the number for the originating high school, spoke with the asst. principal, informed him that he had some students who needed to be educated as to the recklessness of their actions, and gave him all of the information (names, phone numbers, deduced ages). He was <i>very</i> grateful.&#160;:) – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 16:37, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see no constructive edits among the sexist, POV edits. I also speedied an article he created, Weekly Musician which was just an ad to a website.

<dd>He is definitely a problem on the Jonathan Williams AfD as well. Apparently there was a split in the Aryan Nations when somebody important died, and 24 thinks Williams is not a "Real" Aryan Nations pastor. Its astonishing that he would be resorting to this since the AfD is actually going his way, despite the massive sockpuppetry. A short ban for incivility and disruption was warranted anyway. Indef is too long for a first offense, though.

<li>As of late the user in question has added some templates to the page which I would find as a reasonable compromise. If the AFD vote should result in deletion, I would hope that Dhanks would abide by that decision. I would have no problem with Dhanks adding a brief paragraph mentioning Enterprise Open Shell as a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fork_%28software_development%29.html" title="Fork (software development)">fork</a> of <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudosh.html" title="Sudosh">sudosh</a> on that article's page. I think it is more likely at this time that a user of sudosh, the current established product, would enter the query sudossh to find more information about enhancements, future versions, or information on competing products. Since Open Enterprise Shell claims to be sudosh version 2.0, in the interiem it should be best that it stay in the sudosh article. If in the future various open source unixish distros decide to include open enterprise shell, it then should get its own page in a more abbreviated form than it is now. Personally I think that Dhanks energy should be promoting his fork of sudossh to be included as a package with various unix/bsd distributions which would be greatly more important to his market share than a mere wikipedia article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBige1977_d3fc.html" title="User:Bige1977">Bige1977</a> 07:14, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You'll notice that, since you provided a citation on the article I put the fact tag on, I have not edited that article again. I didn't read the Seth Putnam article, so I didn't put the tag there. Are you saying that you don't need to provide citations for your allegations? I do see that you're trying to make backhanded claims of sockuppetry, but seeing as you have disagreements with just about everybody around here, everybody can't be sockpuppets of just one person.

<p>However, I noticed that he has apparently been using identical edit summaries for performing a set of otherwise unrelated edits, such as this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minneapolis_City_Hall&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47419201" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minneapolis_City_Hall&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47419201" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minneapolis_City_Hall&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47419201</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In earlier edits (identified as "using <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a>") he has used an identical edit summary for edits such as this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=900_North_Michigan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46605759" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=900_North_Michigan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46605759" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=900_North_Michigan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46605759</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Where he adds a new paragraph of text (good), and this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve_Bank_Building&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46599414" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve_Bank_Building&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46599414" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve_Bank_Building&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46599414</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Where he changes from "meter" to "metre" in an article about a building in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a> (very bad). Also, this edit, amidst his more recent edits to U.S. buildings articles, he curiously makes this edit with a deceptive summary, where he unicodifies the &amp;sup3; and &amp;cent; entities (arguably good):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minneapolis_City_Hall&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47419201" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minneapolis_City_Hall&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47419201" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minneapolis_City_Hall&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47419201</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I saw from the title that this was an American building, making the change described in the edit summary an inappropriate one, so I reverted the edit, but I looked at the diff and saw that he clearly brought that error on himself.</p>
<p>Somebody more bored than myself should look through all of his edits and make whatever changes (or un-changes) are appropriate on a case-by-case basis. People take offense to being called "bots" no matter how similarly to a bot they act in terms of functionality and responsiveness. "Cyborg" maybe? Fuck, I don't really know. I do know that use of automated tools for MoS (and/or personal agenda) pushing needs to cease and desist, because people either don't pay attention to what they're doing, or they simply don't care. — <small>Apr. 7, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[16:31] &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freakofnur<sub>x</sub>ture</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_freakofnurture_e7bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/freakofnurture">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&gt;</b></tt></p>

<p>I looked over some of his edits and they were <i>very, very</i> characteristic of someone using AWB, but with a changed edit summary to not reflect that fact.

<p>He seems to be apologetic on his talk page and an inspection of his history shows a bunch of other good edits using AWB, so I'm not sure what to do at this point. Maybe we should leave it up to the person in charge of the AWB CheckPage?

<dd>Okay, if he has agreed not to make more of these kinds of edits, yes, go ahead and unblock for the time being, and he can participate in this discussion. I would hold off on restoring his "AWB" privileges as he has used the tool for inappropriate edits, and because his edit vague edit summaries make it very tedious to determine which edits are which.

<dd>Oops, yes, I just removed the entire thread from my page, I wasn't about to force SS to keep his personal family stuff up there.

<p>I looked through that thread and nothing there warrants a block right now. Subjects of RFCs are permitted to contact those involved. They arn eiot permitted ot harass, but there was no harassment here. It was all, surprisingly civil. It was a discussion that, at times, got a little heated, but nothing over the line. If anything it was Bishonen who got more into it, but he/she is not blocked (nor should he/she be). But if Sam is going ot be blocked then he/she should be too. Please unblock.Gator (talk) 20:19, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Looking through the RFC in question...Clyde, you certified the basis for the dispute and are involved in that process. As such, you really shouldn't be blocking him and should have referred this to a neutral admin for his/her opinion.

<p>I'm inclined to agree with Gator here. (full disclosure I'm involved in the RfC and endorsed Bishonen's statement) Sam's comments while self-righteous, condescending, dramatic and unproductive, do not seem to have yet risen to the level that would constitute blockable harassement. 20:26, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sam has contacted me, as an uninvolved administrator, and I agree that there's nothing worthy of a 24-hour block here. Perhaps a brief cooldown period, but I think it's been long enough for that. I don't see anything uncivil, a personal attack, or any rule violations. Therefore, I have unblocked Sam Spade.

<dd>The proper questions is not "what is the basis for the unblock". The proper question should be "what is the basis for the block?" Answer: none. Therefore, he was corretly unblocked.

<p>Hi. I guess I can edit now. I just want to say I never intended to harass or threaten bishonen (I'm not sure how I could threaten her, its not like I'm an Uberhacker or anything...). Quite the contrary, I hjad been led to believe by a mutual friend that she was a nice person. I thought that if I let my guard down, and spoke to her from the heart, she might change her mind about me. That obviously did not happen, and I apologise to everyone for the mess. I am going to avoid conflict for awhile, and see if things can simmer down. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 20:39, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't object to the quick unblocking of Sam Spade, even though I was glad he was stopped short by a block, since he seemed to be spinning out of controll, getting only more angry and more imperious and contemptuous for being warned and for being urged to stop posting on my page. A very brief block was obviously enough to make him catch himself up. But I feel quite let down by Andre's not seeing "anything uncivil" in Sam's attempt to scold me out of that RFC, or in his majestic personal remarks ("I am chastising you for your unfortunate involvement in the RfC in question...") Also by Gator's perception that all that happened on my talkpage was that the subject of an RFC "contacted" one of those involved and initiated a "discussion", "a little heated but nothing over the line", and in which I was the one who "got more into it". Certainly I got angry. I was making what I still think a very reasonable request that Sam take his flames off my page; the RFC does have its own talkpage, which would have been an appropriate venue. Well, if you can talk about any appropriate venues for "chastising" fellow editors. No disrespect, but are you guys who see no incivility sure you know what "chastise" means? The <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thesaurus.html" title="Thesaurus">thesaurus</a> <a href="http://www.wordsmyth.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.wordsmyth.net/" rel="nofollow">Wordsmyth.net</a> offers the synonyms punish, whip, discipline, slap, cane, cuff, smack, castigate, wallop, discipline, thrash, spank, whip, beat, lambaste, belt, tongue-lash, berate, rebuke, censure , excoriate, upbraid, take to task, scold, reprimand, and bawl out. Apart from the kinky stuff, where I wouldn't inquire of anybody's tastes, how's that for posting a comment on an effing <i>Request</i> for comments? (A perfectly civil comment, btw.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Sam_Spade#Outside_view_of_Bishonen" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Sam_Spade#Outside_view_of_Bishonen" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>)<br />
SS insisted repeatedly that he would <i>not</i> stop unless and until I "removed myself" from "the situation", justifying himself by my "provocative action" of posting to the RFC. "I will stop posting on your page when there is no longer a reason to. .. a RfC is designed to provoke dialogue, and is to be engaged in only by those willing to communicate. If you are not ... I again ask you to remove yourself from the proceedings." And yet a couple of hours later SS is in victim mode here and on his own page, pretending that all he ever wanted was for me to remove <i>his comments</i> from my page (!) and to make it clear that I didn't want to talk (dear reader, if you've clicked on Cyde's link above, how soon was that clear to YOU?): ""She did what I asked by deleting the thread and making clear she didn't want to talk, so I have no reason to contact her that I know of."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;diff=47144914&amp;oldid=47144452" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;diff=47144914&amp;oldid=47144452" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> This is mere sleight-of-hand and misdirection after his attacks on me for daring to criticize him in an RFC. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:30, 6 April 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>I'm sorry you felt let down by my response, and I sincerely hope the insanity graphic in your user space isn't my fault. Keep in mind that I have the utmost respect for you (Bishonen) as a contributor, editor, admin, human being, etc. Also, I've tangled (unfavorably) with Sam Spade in the past (see the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_4580.html" title="Talk:Atheism">Talk:Atheism</a> archives).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I do feel that Sam Spade's discussion on your talk page was not actually uncivil or mean. Rude would be a good word, I think, but rudeness is not a personal attack and it is not reason to block. Clearly Sam wasn't using chastise to mean <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chastise" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chastise" rel="nofollow">"To punish, as by beating."</a>/punish, whip, beat, belt, or wallop (after all, how was he doing these things? Can you whip someone over the internet?) but rather the second definition of "To criticize severely; rebuke." Sam Spade's discussion on your talk page was condescending, patronizing, and somewhat rude, but it definitely was not a punishment, in any sense of the word (and I also feel chastise was a bid of an overly strong word choice, because he really wasn't criticizing that much).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I felt the situation actually escalated to truly heated levels at your comment of "Get off my page and stay off it. Now." That's when Sam got passive agressive (still not a clear personal attack and not entirely unprovoked), and you rose to the bait and responded in kind. At any time, you could have merely ignored Sam's responses, or reverted them and/or cleared that section of the page, but as long as you continued to respond, Sam was not harassing you, merely engaging in the increasingly heated dialogue. You do have the right to stop the discussion, but you did not truly invoke it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Once again, I mean you no harm, emotional or otherwise, and I just didn't feel that a 24-hour block was necessary for the mutual heat and rudeness that the exchange showed. I also think that the dislike many feel for Sam Spade and the (rightful) esteem many feel for you (Bishonen) contributed to the situation being handled as it was, in a way not entirely fair or just. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 00:05, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Andre, I'm pleased that I have always been able to speak to you "as a human being" and not <i>otherwise</i> (whatever that implies), still, I'm afraid that you are not so much drowning in semantics, but that this is more a case of selective reading, and dare I say, (seemingly) presonal bias. Incidentally, I will continue to support your RfB attempts, even though I do fear that with your rather consistent defence of SS throughout the years, bureaucrat status will render his misconduct all the more damaging (a measure of my esteem toward yourself is that I would still support you notwithstanding this). We already have members of the establishment who tend to similarly support SS (for example, Theresa Knott), and I feel that their efforts have also at times proved damaging to the project. Unfortunately, attempts to raise these issues have thus far failed, and I see little hope of improvement. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 02:59, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Geez, it seems like everyone on the "keep" side of the userbox debates is a sockpuppet. I can't say I'm surprised. I'm just wondering who StrangerInParadise is a sock of. He's already admitted to it, he just won't say whose. With this in mind I think we really need to pay close attention to the likes of DRVs, TFDs, and policy polls. There are a lot of people out there trying to game the system and destroy Wikipedia by moving it away from encyclopedia and towards MySpace. By the way, I would support an indefinite ban on both of these users. Running two users concurrently to give the appearance of there being multiple people when there's really just one is way beyond the bounds of what's acceptable. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA">Cyde&#160;Weys</font></a></b> 22:39, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

In the last two months and a half WAREL has been inserting unsourced, inappropriate or sometimes incorrect information in mathematics articles, and has been involved in lenghty edit wars to get his contributions to stick. He has antagonized the entire mathematics community, and refuses to follow any consensus, preferring to always revert to his own version. An excellent summary of this is at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_baf7.html#Statistics_on_User:WAREL" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics#Statistics on User:WAREL</a>. This behavior got WAREL indefinitely blocked at the Japanese Wikipedia, and he lied about the reason for block when confronted about it, see <a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWAREL_d306.html#A_genuine_suggestion" title="User talk:WAREL">User_talk:WAREL#A_genuine_suggestion</a>.</p>
<p>Short blocks had no effect on his behavior, neither a petition on his talk page, see <a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWAREL_d306.html#Petition" title="User talk:WAREL">User_talk:WAREL#Petition</a>. He ignored the request for comment, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_WAREL_c663.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/WAREL">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/WAREL</a>, and in the several days since, in spite on a note on talk page that he will be indefinitely blocked if he continues, he still keeps his reverts, this time at <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Field (mathematics)">field (mathematics)</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_%28mathematics%29&amp;curid=10603&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_%28mathematics%29&amp;curid=10603&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">hist</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finite_field.html" title="Finite field">finite field</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finite_field&amp;curid=11615&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finite_field&amp;curid=11615&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">hist</a>. While it is true that recently he (finally!) started using talk pages every now and then, his approach now is to make is point on talk, and then regardless of the fact that everybody disagrees with him, he keeps on putting his changes back in.</p>
<p>Hereby I blocked both accounts indefinitely, and plan to do so for any new account should he start engaging in the same behavior.

<dd>I fully support the use of admin tools against WAREL/DYLAN, but I think an indefinite ban is too strong at this point. There are faint signs that this user may yet change their ways, and also that they might one day have useful contributions to make. My preference would be for a 1 or 2 week block, renewable immediately on any signs of continued misbehaviour, lengthening to one or several months if several of these in a row have no effect. I think this would be a good compromise between avoiding wasting people's time, and giving WAREL/DYLAN a chance to think about his/her actions, away from the bright lights of the computer screen. I don't have any problems with permanently blocking <i>one</i> of the accounts. <a href="../../../d/m/h/User%7EDmharvey_69fb.html" title="User:Dmharvey">Dmharvey</a> 18:12, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I doubt it's a question of "learning". I don't think he has any intention of becoming a useful contributor; I think the adversarial interaction is his entire goal. If I'm right about that then doing things a few days at a time seems like wasted effort. I'd go ahead and make the block permanent next time, with the understanding that at some later date (say, a year) he can apply for reinstatement under parole, provided he hasn't tried to evade the ban in the interim. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 00:47, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">User:IronDuke</a> who has repeatedly and very publicly threatened to publish information about me. IronDuke has harrassed me by repeatedly calling for my removal from a page because of my personal affiliations. None of the information present personally identifies IronDuke, and the IP address (162.84.209.3) and email address are available in his own edit history. So the page of mine that you deleted reveals <i>nothing</i> about IronDuke that isn't already elsewhere on Wikipedia, whereas his accusations of me have been much more revealing.

<p>The relevant Wikipedia policy says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Posting another person's personal information (legal name, home or workplace address, telephone number, email address, or other contact information, regardless of whether the information is actually correct) is almost always harassment.

This applies whether the person whose personal information is being revealed is a Wikipedia editor or not."</i></dd>

<p>The information deleted did <b>not</b> contain a name, address, phone number, or any contact information <i>except</i> for an email address and IP address already available in IronDuke's edit history.

I have been through IronDuke's harrassing and pointless ArbCom case, and now he is snooping in my personal pages and getting credulous admins to tinker with them. There are numerous other harassing edits as well. But the central point is and should be: don't go messing with (hidden) personal pages without asking first! If there was something there that, after due consideration, was considered personally identifying (I think not), I would have happily removed it.

<dd>Quit the personal attacks. I could have blocked you for posting the link after I'd asked you not to post anything else, so I'm clearly not as hair-triggered as I should be. There is a technical reason I can't delete the post you've linked to, which I'll explain to any admin who e-mails me. In any event, it doesn't identify you. I've offered to take a look at the links you're most concerned about, but instead of working with me, you prefer to waste our time posting complaints here. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:12, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SilmVirgin, I don't see any birthdate information posted by Gnetwerker and how are the non-admins to know whether you could remove information or not if you won't explain the problem unless an admin contacts you? "Wikilawyering" is not a term to be tossed around lightly. It is akin to "trolling" and is a near personal attack. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">Justforasecond</a> 17:30, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

I've since had <s>three</s> four people message me on my talk page saying that the autoblocker has blocked two IPs and is preventing them from editing (or at least hindering, given that they still managed to post on my talk page).</p>
<p>What should I do? Unblock the affected IPs? I don't see blocks in the IPs' logs, so would that even work? Unblock Arbustoo - in which case I also obviously have to unblock the other side of the edit war for reasons that have nothing to do with their editing? Is it possible to stop the autoblocker from working, since I'm sure Arbustoo wouldn't use shadowpuppetry to circumvent his block?</p>

<dd>Thanks, that's useful advice. I tried that just now though and couldn't find Arbustoo's entries in the list, though I could find the blocks set up on the accounts and the autoblock on the other side of the edit war - was that because I just unblocked Arbustoo's IPs? --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 10:17, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The thing to do is to ask them to tell you the IP address. If you go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Ipblocklist&amp;action=unblock&amp;ip=" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Ipblocklist&amp;action=unblock&amp;ip=" rel="nofollow">the unblock page</a> and put in the IP, it will unblock it, even though the IP number does not appear on <a href="../../../i/p/b/Special%7EIpblocklist_2536.html" title="Special:Ipblocklist">Special:Ipblocklist</a>. For example, if 12.34.56.78 is autoblocked as #1234 (this is the way autoblocks appear on the block list), it can still be unblocked as 12.34.56.78. Anytime someone is blocked, thier IP is listed in the block message they receive (see <a href="../../../b/l/o/MediaWiki%7EBlockedtext_22db.html" title="MediaWiki:Blockedtext">Mediawiki:Blockedtext</a>) so it should be no problem for them to tell you what the IP address is, and you to unblock it. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 01:52, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I need help here. He has stalked me to Ross Perot, Reform Party, Mixed Economy, American System, Privatization, etc. etc. and now with Laissez-Faire. He engages in an Inquistor style in a relentless campaign of harassment, even after I provided numerous citations and references beyond the standards and norms of wikipedia.</p>
<p>The harassment policy is: <b>Harassment is defined as a pattern of disruptive behavior that appears to a reasonable and objective observer to have the purpose of causing negative emotions in a targeted person or persons, usually (but not always) for the purpose of intimidating the primary target.</b> The purpose could be to make editing Wikipedia unpleasant for the target, to undermine them, to frighten them, or to encourage them to stop editing entirely.<i>...<b>Harassment is sometimes described as a violation of don't disrupt Wikipedia to prove a point</b>...<b>Following an editor to another article to continue disruption (also known as wikistalking) The term "wiki-stalking" has been coined to describe following a contributor around the wiki, editing the same articles as the target, with the intent of causing annoyance or distress to another contributor.</b></i></p>
<p>I need someone to look into this and block this user for what he is doing. Harassment is a very serious offense here at wikipedia and I ask that it be enforced. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 06:35, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've set up a new page in response to the increasing number of admins who are being threatened or harassed off-site by someone they've blocked, which is usually possible because they've inadvertently left enough information in their contributions or on their user pages for abusive editors to be able to piece together who they are. <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdmins_willing_to_make_difficult_blocks_b657.html" title="Wikipedia:Admins willing to make difficult blocks">Wikipedia:Admins willing to make difficult blocks</a> is a list of admins willing to step in to take over a case where another admin is being threatened or is worried about being identified by an abusive editor. Feel free to add your name if you're willing to administer these difficult blocks, for example if you know there's nothing to tie your user name to your real name, or because you're prepared to deal with the consequences regardless. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:56, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
