<dd>The project has been split (starting from August 1) as user:HongQiGong proposed. User:HongQiGong has no valid reason to enforce what he proposed retroactively. The proposal has no retroactive effect on the archives. Nobody other than user:HongQiGong insists on keeping the cut-and-paste fork. Such edits as keeping cut-and-paste fork are simple vandalism, and should be reverted, no matter who do it. User:SchmuckyTheCat is now like abusing this page to challenge all my edits that he disagrees, regardless of whether these edits are related to the ArbCom case or not. He simply reports here everything he disagrees, although his requests have been ignored several times. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 20:30, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I am reporting a series of repearted incidents regarding the user called <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a>. This user was recently banned for removing sourced information from articles, and for making personal attacks at people who do not have accounts. This user is also on revert parole from an arbirrition case that led to him being banned for three months. This user is using a serious of ip adresses to revert any user, anmynous or registered, including admins, that change anything on articles he deems as 'his' claiming it as vandalism or restricted user changes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=156.34.142.158" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=156.34.142.158" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=207.179.133.131" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=207.179.133.131" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=142.166.234.19" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=142.166.234.19" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=216.21.150.44" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=216.21.150.44" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=198.164.250.64" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=198.164.250.64" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=207.179.133.116" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=207.179.133.116" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=198.164.251.73" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=198.164.251.73" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. He also just used an ip to delete someones post from an anymonous users talk page and instead leave a personal attack <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.143.124.233&amp;diff=72794246&amp;oldid=72787176" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.143.124.233&amp;diff=72794246&amp;oldid=72787176" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>.</p>
<p>The point in referring this is that these ips should be checked against his account. It may also be neccesary to inforce a prolonged ban with this user from these articles, as he has grown into a habit of calling admin abuse when he is banned (see arbirittion case evidence and findings of fact), and removing large sections of text written by others on article discussion pages, claiming they are banned users. He has even done this to an admin, claiming admin abuse when the admin reverted him. This is on top of the persistant violations of his parole regarding personal attacks and using sockpuppets to perform massive reverts, which he openly admits to being his by signing them as himself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.143.124.233&amp;diff=72794246&amp;oldid=72787176" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.143.124.233&amp;diff=72794246&amp;oldid=72787176" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.</p>
<p>This user is becoming a series tire to many users in the community, with many times admins refusing to deal with the user due to his claims of admin abuse when incidents are reported. This user also openly refuses to follow policy or respect that he does not own Wikipedia, and that articles are not just his, they are to reflect the opinions and points of all people, claiming in multiple instances that he can refuse to let others edit articles <i>because he said so</i>.</p>
<p>Here is his user contributions to give example of his estronous violations or revert parole across a series of articles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Deathrocker&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72756067" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Deathrocker&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72756067" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. He also states <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html#SockCatching" title="User:Deathrocker">here on his userpage</a> he is a <i>sockcatcher</i>, even though he was banned for making <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_Sockpuppet_Killer_d301.html" title="User:Leyasu Sockpuppet Killer">this account</a> and posting this personal attack against another user. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Heavy_metal_music&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70978754" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Heavy_metal_music&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70978754" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.</p>
<p>Of note also, is is that he has twice used two ips to blank a users comment from someones talk page for praising the work done by that user, leaving a personal attack, signing it as himself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.143.124.233&amp;diff=72800180&amp;oldid=72797989" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.143.124.233&amp;diff=72800180&amp;oldid=72797989" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.143.124.233&amp;diff=72800564&amp;oldid=72800224" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.143.124.233&amp;diff=72800564&amp;oldid=72800224" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.</p>

The reverting against Anon IP's that Leyasu is complaining about are all against her. Deathrocker is on revert parole and is limited to one revert per article per day. Although reverting vandalism does not count, I'm not sure reverting suspected edits of a banned user fall under the same exception. There <i>may</i> be technical violation of the revert parole here but I would be hesitant to enforce it, since Leyasu seems determined to continue to disrupt these articles. I will look deeper into it tonight. I would certainly be best all around if Deathrocker would leave the reversions to another editor, even if it <i>is</i> Leyasu. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 17:56, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I understand it, reverting a banned user is not a violation of revert parole. <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html#Reverting_edits_from_banned_or_blocked_users" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR#Reverting edits from banned or blocked users</a> says that reverting edits by banned users does not count towards violating 3RR, so I would say that it doesn't violate revert parole either. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_Havaname_2e6d.html" title="User:Idont Havaname">Idont Havaname</a> (<a href="../../../i/d/o/User_talk%7EIdont_Havaname_2580.html" title="User talk:Idont Havaname">Talk</a>) 18:04, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However, reverting users who are not myself, not banned (until now without just cause), registered or anymonous, is not allowed in his revert parole. He was recently banned by an admin for abuse on a bands article page with another user, completely devoid of me. Also, nor is he allowed to hold a sock farm which is again, a violation of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> AND his parole.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, in many instances, a lot of Deathrockers repeated reverts, and sock ips have been making his trademark 'Restricted User Changes' to articles that have been worked on by long time registered users, including admins that he has been warned by. Something that came up a lot in his Arbirrition case before.</dd>

<dd>So far, myself, i have only been making reasonable edits - most of which have as of late been to articles surrounding the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_Genome_Project_460e.html" title="Music Genome Project">Music Genome Project</a>. Ive only stopped by these when ive noticed, suprise suprise, a whole bunch of ip socks calling themselfs me, or Deathrocker, have been reverting the heavy metal articles left right and center.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of my actions, and the majority of my edits that run right under your scope of vision, that is not basis for Deathrocker to be allowed to violate his parole. If im going to indefinatly banned for doing something, it is only fitting that Deathrockers <i>I can do whatever i want coz i got through an ArbCom case</i> attitude is remanded for the same actions. Otherwise that is favouritism, especially when the majority of the incidents dont even involve myself. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a>/Serial Thrillers</dd>

<dd>Reasonable edits or not, this user (Leyasu) is <a href="../../../l/o/b/WP%7ELOBU_4a0a.html" title="WP:LOBU">banned</a> and should not be editing. <b>Banned users should not be editing Wikipedia at all</b>; being banned is a formal revocation of editing privileges.

The <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBanning_policy_2e63.html" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">banning policy</a> states that even valid edits made by banned users should be reverted; this includes complaints about other editors. I have blocked the IP that left the above message.

<dd>I would like to clarify that Leyasu was not banned by Arbcom, but by an admin after repeated instances of using sockpuppets to violate his parole. As such, he can appeal to either <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> or Arbcom at any time. However, given his continued edits to death metal and related articles as admitted here, an appeal is unlikely to succeed. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 00:19, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And like i said. Reverting me is fine. Reverting other registered users and anons isnt. And i am still well within my right to complain. And it also doesnt matter wether a banned user reports him or not either, <i>his parole is still supposed to be enforced</i>. Many of the new users simply dont know how to report him, and many of the older ones are unscrupuosly banned as being myself before they can complain. So now you know what he is doing, you have to enforce his parole otherwise there is absoloutly no point in him having it.</dd>

<p>The bottom line here is there is no evidence to support taking any action. The IPs provided by Leyasu are mostly from New Brunswick, Canada. I can't find any verified information on Deathrocker's location, but this <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Deathrocker_5443.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Deathrocker">checkuser</a> case, which was returned inconclusive, compared him with a kid who uses a U.S. e-mail address and an Australian ISP. It's hard to see how that request could be inconclusive if Deathrocker was a New Brunswicker, so I have to conclude that either he has found some open proxies or there is a Death metal fan in N.B. who knows about the arbitration case. (Similarly, while Leyasu is known to edit from British Telecom, the IP addresses that has provided at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Leyasu_87a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Leyasu">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Leyasu</a> as being improperly reverted are from completely different parts of the world, suggesting that Leyasu has also found some open proxies or has some imitators.) There just isn't enough evidence to support taking action against Deathrocker at this time. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 00:16, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The kid you mentioned, which Leyasu accused me of been a long time ago is <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike5193_0553.html" title="User:Mike5193">User:Mike5193</a>.. we don't not even have the same interests... he has a picture up and is a fan of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Metal_8e27.html" title="Death Metal">Death Metal</a>...

Perhaps a range block from the range which Leyasu edits would remmedy his block evasion?

<p>Arbitration case: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_SqueakBox_and_Zapatancas_ff79.html#SqueakBox_and_Zapatancas" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/SqueakBox and Zapatancas">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/SqueakBox and Zapatancas#SqueakBox and Zapatancas</a> . SqueakBox is blocked until September 22 in <i>all the Wikipedia</i> as he did not respect the ban imposed upon him by the mentioned arbitration case (see his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SqueakBox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SqueakBox" rel="nofollow">block log</a>).

Probably, because when Tony Sidaway blocked him the last time he didn't chose the "correct type of block".

<p><b>Response</b> Blocked users are permitted to edit their own talk pages. In reviewing the situation, I find the charge by Squeakbox that you altered his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJosé_Luis_Rodríguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=70380742&amp;oldid=70337486" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJosé_Luis_Rodríguez_Zapatero&amp;diff=70380742&amp;oldid=70337486" rel="nofollow">signature</a> to that of a user you suspected of being his sockpuppet. Regardless of your suspicions, this was dishonest bordering on vandalism, and if I had seen it at the time I would have blocked you for it. As it was more than 2 weeks ago, and blocks are <i>supposed</i> to be preventative, not punative, consider this a stern warning. The fact that Squeakbox is blocked does not give you the right to abuse the situation, and your suspicions that he has dishonestly used sockpuppets does not give you the right to be dishonest in return. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 00:47, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Terryeo is under an injunction not to engage in personal attacks, for which he was banned from the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>-related articles. Unfortunately he has continued to post innuendo about other users, using Wikipedia policy pages in an ongoing campaign. I have invited him to withdraw his attack on Raymond Hill but he has, regrettably, refused. I recommend a block, as he doesn't seem to have got the message that this is not an appropriate way to interact with other Wikipedians, and his continued misconduct is poisoning the atmosphere on a number of talk pages.

<dd>I do hope everyone examines my statement there. ChrisO suggest that I have commented on an editor's motivation. I have not commented on an editor's motivation. I have provides specific edit differences which show that <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_Hill_2635.html" title="User:Raymond Hill">User:Raymond Hill</a> cites in an article, as a secondary source, an archived message which he placed on his own personal website. To suggest that my presentation comments on Raymond Hill's motivation is a false and misleading statement. I state the situation. I comment that such a use of a secondary source of information will raise Raymond Hill's personal website traffic. All additional inferences are made by ChrisO and he states them. I do not state implication, I state the situation as simply as possible. To state the actual situation is not a personal attack.

<dd>I tend to agree with Thatcher131. If the message came from Google Groups, as Terryeo claims, then its copyright is highly questionable. If it was written by Raymond Hill, then it's pretty close to our ban on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. While I think Terryeo may have expressed this in a better way, I see nothing here that qualifies as a personal attack. Any uninvolved admin can, of course, disagree with me and impose a block. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 15:44, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Terryeo states: "<i>ChrisO suggest that I have commented on an editor's motivation. <b>I have not commented on an editor's motivation.</b></i>" Well, Terryeo did not just imply that my motivation was to increase traffic, but stated it (in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AReliable_sources&amp;diff=72376513&amp;oldid=72371797" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AReliable_sources&amp;diff=72376513&amp;oldid=72371797" rel="nofollow">edit summary</a>: <i>Raymond Hill's use of Wikipedia to increase his personal website traffic</i>.) Given his summary edit, it would seem Terryeo's concern about the origin of the cite was secondary.<br />
Just to avoid any confusion: the content reproduced from the newsgroups was actually a transcription of an article from a reknown canadian magazine, Maclean's. I had good reasons to trust that the newsgroups post in question is a proper transcript, because most of its content is actually supported by other reliable sources. The use of this article as a cite in a related wikipedia topic came down to have someone actually see the original article. I'm still looking for it. In the event I can confirm the cite, I understand I won't still be able to link to it because of copyright concerns, and because I am not a reliable source. This is where I erred. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_Hill_2635.html" title="User:Raymond Hill">Raymond Hill</a> 19:12, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The primary goal is to be able to say that the source is McLeans, volume X, page XX, date mm/dd/yyyy. Since no one has yet seen the citation itself, you are relying on an unreliable 3rd party source describing what the article says. When you or someone has seen the article and verified the transcript, you can put in the citation. You don't have to link to the text. Having seen the article first hand, you are allowed to list it, and the burden the falls on Terryeo to prove that the article doesn't say what you claim it says. (Interlibrary loan is not all that difficult if you live in a decent sized city.) There have been previous discussions about using external links to media that are copyvios; these are not wikipedia copyvios because wikipedia is not hosting the material. If there is a concern that you should not provide a link to a site you control then don't; but I would not then entertain the suggestion of removing the source entirely. There are millions if not billions of books and articles that are not on line and there is no reason to hold scientology articles to a higher standard of only allowing sources which are reliable <i>and</i> free <i>and</i> on line. In other words, after you have seen the original article, he can't turn around and say its not a reliable source because its too hard for other readers to verify it; and if you provide a transcript he can't then say it's disallowed because it comes from a site you control; and if you link to a third party site he can't argue it's disallowed because the 3rd party site is violating copyright. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 21:43, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That makes the situation considerably more clear to me, ty. I still wonder about linking to one's own site, however as it will tend to spawn special interest personal websites archiving information who's main use is to link to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 02:26, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for saying, SSS108. There are many examples of personal websites whose point of view doesn't even make a small town newspaper's page. Such publication as a personal website costs very little. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> doesn't yet confront the issue, but some talk of it goes on at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 13:01, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be drifting off-topic, Terryeo; you're clearly discussing something different from the rest of us. We are talking about situations where a reputable source that we would trust for reportage and analysis, such as an article from the <i>New York Times</i>, is reproduced by a website which we would not necessarily trust for reportage and analysis. Any honest analysis of this situation shows that the point of view held by the website <i>doesn't come into it</i>. The only issue is whether the reproduction is an <i>accurate</i> reproduction and though you've been challenged to find one case of a reproduction that looks accurate and isn't, you've failed to meet that challenge. Why are you <i>still</i> trying to <i>change the subject</i> so that you can talk about whether the "point of view" of the website would "make a small town newspaper's page"? Of course, it's not hard to tell why you're changing the subject <i>away from</i> the fact that you personally attacked another editor by alleging that he was using Wikipedia "to increase his personal website traffic". -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 13:50, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>EE's recent behaviour on this article is part of the reason why an RFAr was filed to begin with, and it's apparent that he's unwilling to change it. He considers the "Cool" article his own "baby", to be treated differently from other articles, under the control of nobody but himself (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cool_%28song%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=25592158" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cool_%28song%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=25592158" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cool_%28song%29&amp;diff=64780633&amp;oldid=64357416" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cool_%28song%29&amp;diff=64780633&amp;oldid=64357416" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>). The above description and diffs only scratch the surface; he's been edit warring on this article for months. I'm involved in this dispute, which is why I haven't temporarily banned him from this article myself.</p>

Oh yawn, these users are beginning to grow so dull. They claim I am hard to work with again; from my view, EM is far too difficult to work with and <i>doesn't</i> agree with any of my views and has been recklessly reverting me as much as I am recklessly reverting him. Bunchofgrapes fails to notice this and pinpoints that only <i>I</i> am the cause of this issue. As a result and because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cool_%28song%29&amp;diff=74022738&amp;oldid=74022461" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cool_%28song%29&amp;diff=74022738&amp;oldid=74022461" rel="nofollow">here (bother to read it)</a>, I actually tried to compromise our situation and two arguments were resolved.

<dl>
<dd>As you've been told before, it isn't optional whether you choose to accept the ban. Just two days ago you claimed you weren't EE; having your bluff called, you've now gone back to reverting edits that I've justified and explained to death on the talk page. We're not discussing content of the article here (though the edits in those diffs hardly constitute "excuses" and "nonsense", as anyone viewing them will see) because that should be done on its talk page; we're discussing your behaviour in relation to the recent ArbCom ruling on you. If I appear to be "recklessly reverting" you, that's only because I'm trying to stop you from asserting ownership over the article and having the final say on which edits stay and which go. Bear in mind that I could have banned you from editing this article, but I felt I was too close to the dispute and posted here to get the opinion of an outside admin. Your notion that admins are under an obligation to leave any disruptive user "alone" upon request - particularly when said user continues their disruptive behaviour - is ridiculous. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 15:52, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And as you've been told before, you are editing as "disruptively" as I am by introducing your edits as "proper". Bunchofgrapes never looked at our conversation on <a href="../../../c/o/o/Talk%7ECool_%28song%29_9848.html" title="Talk:Cool (song)">Talk:Cool (song)</a> — he figured it would be best to assume that it was <i>me</i> who was being disruptive. If I should say, it's your edits that are disruptive, because some are quite misleading; Bunchofgrapes obviously does not know this, and again, he found it best to believe it was me who was incorrect. Because <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28song%29.html" title="Cool (song)">Cool (song)</a> is currently locked as a result of your pitiful revert-warring, we will discuss <i>all</i> matters on the talk page. 64.231.131.175 23:53, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The notion that Bunchofgrapes didn't bother to read any of the discussions or look at the relevant edit histories before placing the ban is suppositional at best, as well as being incredibly insulting to a highly-experienced admin who I've never known to show unsound judgement. Your "pitiful revert-warring" remark is confusing, particularly because revert wars involve more than one user. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 21:18, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tony's advice looks about right. This seems like a content dispute, not a behavior problem. Can you work it out on the article talk pages? If not youo might try mediation or <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">third opinion</a> before coming to enforcement. I would add, though, that in my opinion, <i>nothing</i> on a personally created web site qualifies as a reliable source. If it's a copy of an article that <i>is</i> reliable, the citation should specify the original citation. If there is a dispute about linking, then it might be better not to. Any citation before about 1995 isn't going to be on line anyway. The point of citations is to provide a link should someone want to verify--it doesn't have to contain the text itself. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 00:59, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dt>Evasion of Ban</dt>

<p>I recently posted this message on Terryeo's talk page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Problems regarding your ban</b> From your Arbitration: "Terryeo banned from Scientology related articles 2) Terryeo is banned indefinitely from articles which relate to Dianetics or Scientology. He may make appropriate comments on talk pages.". However, since this ban, IP address 208.106.20.67 has edited several articles pertaining to Scientology: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=208.106.20.67" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=208.106.20.67" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>].

</blockquote>
<p>He removed this text almost immediately afterwards, and redid so twice without explanation after I reverted. This suggests guilt on his part. I understand that using an anonymous IP address in order to evade a ban is prohibited. In this case Terryeo is in serious violation of his probation. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYandman_f6bf.html" title="User:Yandman">Yandman</a> 14:47, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

It is technically <i>possible</i> that the IP was assigned to someone else prior to August 28, although I am also not convinced.

<dd>I have to side with Chris on this. This wasn't a case of succumbing to temptation in a moment of weakness, but rather 3.5 weeks where seven days was the <i>longest</i> Terryeo went in between violations of his ban, and the median was closer to four. And contrary to Terryeo's rationalizations on his talk page, these edits were awfully close to the very behavior that led the ArbCom to ban him from editing the Scientology articles to begin with. Here is his claim on the talk page about the edits he made:
<dl>
<dd>"I had raised the issues in talk pages, other editors had agreed about the issues, (with the exception that certain editors refused to discuss the issue, or raised other issues instead of discussing the issue) yet the articles didn't reflect what discussing editors had agreed to in principle."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If one took this as an accurate description one would think that Terryeo acted in situations where there was a general consensus of "other editors" who had "agreed about the issues", with just a few "certain editors" being the "exception". But here's the first edit he made as 208.106.20.67, to <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altered_texts_in_Scientology_doctrine_cc1d.html" title="Altered texts in Scientology doctrine">Altered texts in Scientology doctrine</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Altered_texts_in_Scientology_doctrine&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67686872" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Altered_texts_in_Scientology_doctrine&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67686872" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> . Is there sign of "other editors" supporting that edit at <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altered_texts_in_Scientology_doctrine_cc1d.html" title="Altered texts in Scientology doctrine">Altered texts in Scientology doctrine</a>, or are there only signs of Terryeo continuing the same "tendentious editing" that was specifically mentioned in the Final Decision of the ArbCom case against him?

Where are the "other editors" who agreed about the issues? Like ChrisO, I see no sign of contrition from Terryeo; the closest he comes is acknowledging "My ban says I shouldn't have" -- as if he's trying to argue that the ban exists, but its prohibitions must be weighed against the 'fact' that he is representing all those "other editors" who agree with him (whether they have shown signs of existing, or not.) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:17, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, first of all I didn't do as ChrisO states, I didn't lie about it on my discussion page as ChrisO states I did. Several of you have hacked at me, following me around, I post almost anything almost anywhere and along comes ChrisO or one of you telling everyone about how terryeo is a "banned user" or using other phrases which always seem to include "banned". ChrisO frequently twists my statements, saying "what Terryeo means is ....". And of course there was the statement I made about Raymond's mistake, which he examined and corrected, which was posted here earlier. In 100 edits on discussion pages, some of which are helpful such as my supplying a link which ChrisO used in history of man, any slightest hint of incivility is brashly attacked while several of you use disgusting language at me, about me and in evaluation of me while not responding to me. Yet I always say, "let's just follow wikipedia policy, let's just use good quality cites, let's cite this and not leave it hanging there". Jon Atack's OT III statement, "opposed both inside and outside the Church", Xenu.net's personal opinion about the cost of services. Those are simply not in accordence with Wikipedia policy. I invite outside opionion and outside opinion agrees, but several of you refuse to budge and revert uncited information back into the articles. Or in the Xenu.net case, personal opinion cites.

<dd>I think we must not miss the important point here. "Monica Lewinsky" is the name that springs to mind. The outstanding problem is not, in my opinion, Terryeo's stealth edits to articles which he had been banned from. This merits nothing more than a ban of a few days or weeks. The serious issue is the fact that Terryeo then tried to cover up the whole thing, by twice removing my question to him from his talk page [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Terryeo&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Terryeo&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>], before stating that he was innocent: "I have no idea. I use a common internet connection and don't know how those things works and edit with this screen name.Terryeo 15:49, 8 September 2006 (UTC)".

<dd>Just as Terryeo is very selective in deciding <b>who</b> should obey policy and <b>who</b> should be exempt from it, he is also selective in his quotation. Here, he excerpts one of Yandman's statements as "your inability to write anything" when what Yandman <i>actually</i> wrote was "your inability to write anything that does not blatantly defy the conventions of logic". While there is obvious hyperbole there, I would note that just between that page and this one, we have substantiation for it: On that page, Terryeo states, as a fact, that a particular Scientology technique would improve the prognosis for a man with an injured foot from "2 or 3 days" before he can use it again to "a few minutes". Yet in the same paragraph Terryeo insists that this claim to be able to drastically improve the prognosis of a medical condition is not a medical claim. On this page, we have seen that Terryeo at first claimed he had "no idea" about the edits made under his IP address, and then admitted that <i>yes</i>, <i>he</i> had made those edits (I hope it is not a disputable proposition that everyone who <i>makes</i> an edit has some "idea" about that edit.) And yet Terryeo's response to this black-and-white proof that he lied is to claim "I didn't lie about it on my discussion page as ChrisO states I did" and then launch into an assault on ChrisO, as if accusations against ChrisO -- even if they came from a credible party -- would justify Terryeo's deliberately evading the crystal-clear terms of his ban and then not only lying about it, but <i>lying about lying about it.</i> -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:27, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope the adminstrators will look at this offense in the larger context of Terryeo's behavior since the time of the arbitration committee's decision, not simply as an isolated incident. Here, he has unambigously engaged in deceit and flagrant disregard of policy. While he did finally acknowledge that he made edits against the terms of his ban, he shows no contrition at all--instead, he attacks other editors. On his own user page, he asserts that "expelled and declared suppressive persons control the articles"--in other words, he is charging that the Wikipedia editors active on the Scientology-related articles are sworn enemies of Scientology and of the best interests of humankind, belonging to an antisocial sliver of the population that, according to Hubbard, includes the likes of Adolf Hitler and Genghis Khan. "Expelled and declared" implies that these editors have been kicked out of the Church of Scientology and officially labeled as antisocial "suppressive" persons. Terryeo has continued to provoke tussles and disruptions on the Scientology article talk pages on almost a daily basis. He has been the subject of blocks and earlier enforcement claims here, and there have been countless "near misses" with regard to administrative actions against him, where administrators and other users have warned Terryeo that his behavior was inappropriate or concluded that he was lying or otherwise operating in bad faith. He has also become active in discussions on Wikipedia policy and guideline pages, particulalry <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>; my assessment is that his actions there have been aimed at influencing Wikipedia policies in order to gain advantage in arguments that serve his pro-Scientology agenda in the Scientology articles. (I encourage the administrators to investigate whether other editors who are familiar with Terryeo's history share my view.) In short, Terryeo has clearly been operating in bad faith. He has not responded to censure in a manner consistent with becomeing a productive member of the Wikipedia community. I urge the administrators to extend his indefinite ban to include the Scientology article talk pages as well as the main pages. If you find that my view of his actions on the policy and guideline pages is bourne out by your investigations, extending the ban to those pages may be appropriate as well. <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 20:35, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If Yandman had made a decision to start an entirely new entry on this page about Terry's behavior at a time when Terry had no reason to be watching this page, and did not notify Terry -- Terry might have a cause for complaint. <i>Even</i> if Terry had already been watching one section of this page, and Yandman had made a decision to start an entirely new entry about Terry's behavior on this page and did not notify Terry -- that <i>might</i> conceivably be cause for complaint.

<dd>What, exactly, is Terryeo claiming that he has grounds to complain about? Does he feel that receiving <i>two</i> chances to provide some sort of explanation for evidence of a very serious (and as we've seen, <i>justified</i>) suspicion, two chances which Terry made the choice to waste by ignoring them completely, is insufficient? <i>How many</i> times does Terryeo think he should have been given the opportunity to explain? Or perhaps Terry's belief that he is somehow the injured party here stems from a belief that even though he was <i>already watching</i> the section of this noticeboard that dealt with enforcing the conditions of the ArbCom decree, he should have been been given an <i>extra</i> notification that the very serious evidence he was already presented with and given <i>two</i> chances to explain would be quite obviously elevated to the next level when he refused to respond?

<p>The fact that Terryeo removed some warnings is hardly important enough for all this verbiage. Obviously Terryeo got the message; equally obviously the situation was posted here and finally resolved with an admission. Although I understand the importance of leaving warnings on a talk page so other users can see them, I don't agree with the zeal with which some editors edit-war over talk page warnings. If Yandman suspected Terryeo of editing while logged out, that accusation could be posted to the talk pages of the article in question where there would be no possible excuse for removing it.</p>
<p>Being new to this situation, I am quite disappointed with Yandman's reference to dead agenting. The term "personal attack" is rather inflammatory and I choose not to use it here but it was definitely an <i>ad hominem</i> argument. You shouldn't be trying to score points in a dispute by bringing up the character and motives of your opponent. The fact that Terryeo was taken to arbitration over similar issues does not make it right for others to do it. I would rather not hear about dead agenting or suppressive people, just whether their edits fit in with the purpose of this encyclopedia. Terryeo blanked a warning from a user he doesn't like; that is a fact and it is enough to say that.</p>
<p>I'm going to call in a favor and see if I can't get Terryeo blocked for the 4 days agreed upon at ANI, and then let's declare this discussion closed. When Terryeo gets back, he can resume editing the talk pages of Scientology articles and you all can discuss the merits of the article without making <i>ad hominem</i> arguments against one another. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:40, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"The fact that Terryeo removed some warnings is hardly important enough for all this verbiage." No. But the fact that, while under a parole from the Arbitration Committee to stop making personal attacks, Terryeo not only removed warnings but then falsely alleged that other editors had neglected to <i>give</i> him the proper warnings, <i>is</i>. The fact that Terryeo lied and said that he "had no idea" about the edits, then denied that he <i>had</i> lied and falsely alleged that another editor had lied about him doing so, <i>is</i>.</dd>
<dd>Thatcher, why is it that you only seem to be capable of seeing behavior as wrong when it's not Terryeo's behavior?

When Terryeo lies to you, telling you he has "no idea" about those edits, and you have the evidence that shows him to be lying, you tell him to reconsider his answer, not because he <i>shouldn't have lied</i> in the first place, but to put him in the best position to angle for a "short <i>symbolic</i> block" <i>(emphasis added)</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Terryeo&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74542031" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Terryeo&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74542031" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> and then when he follows your advice you advocate that he should only get a "short block" because "he admitted it".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Arbitration_enforcement&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74570472" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Arbitration_enforcement&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74570472" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> As if admitting it wasn't an action he took only after lying failed.

<dd>I guess what I'm trying to ask, Thatcher, is this: this board is called "Arbitration enforcement" for a reason.

<ul>
<li>I suggested that someone could be trying to set Terryeo up because I've seen it before. Signing a false name as an IP is trivially easy, and there was no prior information in the arbitration case or the checkuser files that could be used to determine whether the geographical location of that IP was compatible with Terryeo's geographical location (and I did check). Once I found the better diff, where Terryeo while logged in signs a contribution by the IP, I struck my comments.</li>
<li>I asked Terryeo to "reconsider" because being polite takes no more time than being angry. Oddly enough, it worked.</li>
<li>When ChrisO countered by suggesting a longer block, I agreed. I just contacted an admin friend of mine to try and get the block applied.</li>
<li>I've been intentionally not responding to this page because I don't want to be anyone's babysitter. I frankly can't fathom why someone would deny receiving a warning when this is a wiki and the warning and removal are obvious in the page history. But I equally don't see the point in someone constantly reverting the warnings and then complaining about it. Does it make the original offense worse? Debatable. Can it extend the punishment? No, by Arbcom ruling this block has a 5 day max.</li>
<li>If I wanted Terryeo to be punished as little as possible I would continue to ignore this page. Obviously at this point it is clear that no one else is watching, and no one took up the request when it was posted to <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive135_14c3.html#Arbitration_enforcement_needed" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive135">ANI</a>. I certainly wouldn't have specifically contacted someone to apply the block.</li>
<li>I don't know why no uninvolved admins haven't applied the block that was suggested here and agreed to by consensus at WP:ANI.

<dd>It's probably because, as usual, Terryeo has posted a snowstorm of verbiage to confuse the issue. It's a tactic we're very familiar with on the talk pages to which he contributes, and as Voice of All's comments on his own talk page indicate, unfortunately it works.

<dd>Thatcher, your assumption of good faith as regards Terryeo is laudable. However, I don't understand why you "don't see the point in someone constantly reverting the warnings and then complaining about it". Should I have just given up instead? Do Terryeo's deletions of the warning and statements of innocence make the original offense worse? No. Do they constitute a new offence? Of course they do. <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resisting_arrest.html" title="Resisting arrest">Resisting arrest</a> is an offence, as is <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perjury.html" title="Perjury">perjury</a>. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYandman_f6bf.html" title="User:Yandman">Yandman</a> 07:47, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"there is never a solution that makes all parties happy." Well, offering a proven wrongdoer a "short", "symbolic" punishment will certainly not bring happiness to those who had thought his premeditated violation merited a <i>deterrent</i> punishment. You know, to discourage him from doing it again. When those who abide by Wikipedia policy wind up envious of the pampering and sympathy and bare-minimum so-called 'penalties' received by those who defy it (I mean, 24 hours? That's not a punishment, that's simply a Wikibreak whose timing you don't choose) it's safe to say that it's not effective enforcement. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:40, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thatcher, check out the last few reverts by Deathrocker. According to him "we're trying to keep the zeppelin information short in order to avoid dispute.", meaning that he can have seven sources in the Led Zeppelin discussion, while the other side can only have two.

<dd>Deathrocker is limited to 2 reverts per week, so that's it for the next six days.

Before the arrests following the terrorist plans of BBET, the group was well known by ALL far right specialists, although most thought it was nothing more than a review and a group of neo-nazi teenagers. The police searches found military grade weapons, bombs and assassination plots, which make of it more than a simple "teenagers cult". He is deleting information, and changing content, claiming — against all of the Belgian press — that Manuel Abramowicz is not a "specialist of the far right".

<dd>Well, there are two schools of thought on that. There are people who read the user page guidelines and say what you do with your talk page is no big deal, and there are poeple who read the vandalism policies that say that removing valid warnnings from one's own talk page is vandalism. (There was even an edit war recently over what the policy should be, if you can believe that.) I tend to think that it's not necessary to treat warnings like {npa} as some kind of scarlet letter. He obviously saw it if he archived it, and if it ever becomes an issue its right there in the page history so he can never say he wasn't warned.</dd>

<p>I don't see anything worth taking action for yet. Intangible's calling some of your comments "nonsense" is personal, and a mild personal attack. But the two remedies available are to block him (per the usual blocking policy), or to ban him from the articles in question (per the arbitration decision). These comments wouldn't deserve a block from another user and I'm not convinced they should in this case. Also, repeatedly tagging experienced users with {npa} templates is often viewed as not a very nice thing to do, and you certainly don't need to edit war over their removal. A few nice words is often enough, and if not, then at least you've got nothing negative on your account. Otherwise, the article talk page comments look like two people with a content dispute who have stopped listening to <i>each other.</i> I don't yet see any trolling.</p>
<p>An article ban is a blunt instrument and I'm also not sure at this time that it is warranted. Let me explain why. Although arbitration decisions deal with user behavior, I have looked into the content dispute underlying this situation. There seems to be an effort to link the Belgian political party BBET with an American professor from a fringe white supremacist movement. This is based on a French language report that in turn is drawn from sources including the professor's remarks published in an obscure 24 page 3-times a year white supremacist newsletter. The newsletter is not online but the article is copied on a blog and on BBET's web site. Technically, WP:RS policy stands behind the newspaper. The allegations that the newspaper mistranslated the professor's remarks are poorly supported since the blog and BBET site they are cached on could have been altered. No one has produced a scan of a paper copy of the newsletter that could definitively impeach the newspaper. If such a copy were produced, it would not mean the newsletter was an RS, but it would cast strong doubt on the La Libre story.</p>
<p>However, I question the propriety of including the claim at all, even if it is sourced per policy. This is a classic example of attempting to prove guilt by association. I'm not sure why it is necessary to try and associate a Belgian political party with a fringe American to discredit it; would we include in an article on the US Democratic Party the fact that some party officials may have been visited by a fringe French or Belgian politician who was so obscure that the visit wasn't written about for two years? Surely there are sufficient Belgian sources to write an encyclopedia article about the activities of a Belgian political party in Belgium without having to rely on guilt by association through a single questioned newspaper article. I would strongly advice you to knock off the guilt-by-association unless you have more evidence of significant contacts between BBET and American white supremacists.</p>
<p>Regarding Abromowitz, I wonder about a "journalist" founding an advocacy web site. American journalists aren't generally allowed to be members of advocacy groups, much less be founders. You need to be very careful in selecting sources that are reporting, not advocacy (for example, newspaper articles, but not editorials) and a reporter who is also an advocate presents a real problem.</p>
<p>Intangible <i>has</i> been sanctioned for engaging "in tendentious editing which minimizes the neo-fascist tendencies of [nationalist or right wing European political] parties." But this case is a poor example of this and does not yet (in my opinion) rise to the level of a ban. Develop better sources, and avoid guilt by association. Things BBET said or did are vastly more powerful than who they have associated with. I didn't really want to analyze the content dispute but I did; hopefully this will prove helpful to any other admin who reviews the situation. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:41, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Note on the side&#160;: BBET isn't a political party, it's a small neo nazi grouping.</li>

<dd>The issue is indeed not about BBET being a neo nazi group, it is about alleged ties of BBET to a mainstream political party (VB), which do not exist. Intangible 14:33, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the clarification from both of you. It seems to me like the currently available evidence for a connection has some problems. In any case, edit warring over it is not the solution. If you can't find stronger evidence, you can try a request for comment, third opinion, or mediation. If there is a strong consensus one way or the other after some additional dispute resolution processes, and the article is still disrupted, there would be a stronger case for intervention. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 14:40, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I disagree with Intangible. The issue is not about alleged ties with the VB, the issue is about the way Intangible thinks he can edit. He simply refuses to discuss the content of the matter. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucVerhelst_3fe1.html" title="User:LucVerhelst">LucVerhelst</a> 15:16, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It looks like you both have discussed the content issue so much that you are no longer paying attention to each other and are just repeating old arguments. You think the LaLibre story is a reliable source and his argument about mistranslation is original research. He thinks the English language version of Griffin's comments proves the newspaper story is based on a mistranslation. My thoughts on the matter aren't important, as arbitration is about user conduct, not content. I do not at this time see this as one-sided disruption, but two people being equally stubborn. Please engage in one of the dispute resolution mechanisms I described above. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:29, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just want to note that about everybody who has had to deal in the past with Intangible has stopped listening to him. This is why <a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> has made a Rfa against him, and why he is on "parole". This explains why Luc Verhelst, whose used to dealing diplomaticall with people he disagree with, is having troubles communicating with Intangible. Intangible has decredibilized him in the eyes of 99% of the people here. I don't know if it's possible to have a fresh start (I'd like it too: I don't like the idea of banning someone forever because of some mistakes), but he certainly needs one if he wants to be able to edit in a confortable environment. Now, concerning the issue of the debate itself, BBET is not a party, but a fringe neofascist group. In this sense, it is not an attempt to smear by association to quote <i>La Libre Belgique</i> on its connections with the US revisionist professor, but a demonstration of the international links of neofascism. Any scholar who studies neo-fascism knows that, as fringe far-left group (trotskyists, etc), they can survive only by maintaining international connections. Thus, it is an important thing to point out. Second, alleged links between BBET &amp; Vlaams Belang (as between French skinheads and the <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_National_3f7b.html" title="Front National">Front National</a>) can be found in many newspaper articles and scholars' studies. For the simple reason that skinheads are used as "order service" during demonstrations of far-right, more "respectable" organizations. Last, Thatcher31's remarks concerning journalism &amp; activism is perfectly valid... in the US, as he has pointed out. In Europe, <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advocacy_journalism.html" title="Advocacy journalism">advocacy journalism</a> is very common, and it is actually only under the influence of Anglo-Saxon press that some have started advocating "neutral journalism" (such as <i><a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Monde_6137.html" title="Le Monde">Le Monde</a></i>). But, to the contrary of the States, this is certainly not the norm in Europe. If you take French newspapers, apart of <i>Le Monde</i> which has positionned itself as an "objective, non-partisan" newspaper (which of course has been questionned; e.g. it supported <a href="../../../e/d/o/Edouard_Balladur_2b21.html" title="Edouard Balladur">Edouard Balladur</a> during the 1995 presidential elections), <i><a href="../../../l/i/b/Lib%C3%A9ration.html" title="Libération">Libération</a></i> conceived itself as a left-wing newspaper, <i><a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Figaro_82d5.html" title="Le Figaro">Le Figaro</a></i> as an openly conservative newspaper (very good on international matters, but very partisan on national matters), and, of course, <i><a href="../../../l/27/h/L%27Humanit%C3%A9_4206.html" title="L'Humanité">L'Humanité</a></i> which used to be the Communist party's newspaper. Take Italy: all newspapers were organs of political parties. Etc. <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 20:38, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Um no I didnt, I admitted to using zer0faults previously adn not violating anything in WP:SOCK nor my Arbcom enforcement as the Arbcom clerk pointed out to you. Stop misrepresenting me.

I come here to edit adn your wikistalknig me is getting out of hand, I created a new name to get away from yuo constantly attempting to ally people against me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Stone_put_to_sky#You_don.27t_have_email_active" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Stone_put_to_sky#You_don.27t_have_email_active" rel="nofollow">[99]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Geo_Swan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78645273" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Geo_Swan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78645273" rel="nofollow">[100]</a> and you still follow me around.

I have not broken any Arbcom ruling not Wiki policy and I get this continued harrassment.

As Thatcher said "arbitration is also not supposed to be a club to beat you over the head with indefinitely" so if you are not here stating I broke anything in my Arbcom decision then stop harrassing me. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 17:37, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having an undeclared sockpuppet while under probation is wrong. It means you have an account that isn't subject to the decision, because no one associates the account with the probation. If that wasn't your intention, you should have revealed it, otherwise it was evasion. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 20:08, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now that it is revealed do you think further sanctions are warranted for the evasion? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:10, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It says directly on the zer0faults page that any Admin or Arbcom member can ask for the ID and it will be provided:
<dl>
<dd>I have left this username to edit under a new one. I am keeping an eye on my Arbcom ruling and while I do not agree with the decision I will however abide by it. I will not turn over this username to anyone but an admin with reasonable cause supported by a request by Arbcom, and then I expect them not to make it public. I will not vote twice and have no plans to edit any of my previous controversial articles. Peave love and Wikiness. I really liked this page and you all will be missed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>What I wanted to prevent by doing it this way was people like Travb following me around again, which he did in fact do, and then went on to message people off Wikipedia that I had disputes with. So there isnt any evasion when all someone had to do was ask from the start.</dd>
<dd>Here is another great example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NuclearUmpf&amp;diff=79541829&amp;oldid=79299657" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NuclearUmpf&amp;diff=79541829&amp;oldid=79299657" rel="nofollow">[102]</a> as to why I left the name behind and only asked admins or arbcom to ask for it. I think its getting to the point where I will need to have my new name hidden if it comes to more trolling on my talk page. The sad part is that this user is basically asking a dumb question cause zer0 already went under the RFCU thumb voluntarily and proved he was not rex (I / he).</dd>

<p><b>Response to NuclearUmpf</b> There is no general provision for hiding a new identity except from certain arbitrators or admins. There are only 14 arbitrators, and of 1000 or so admins probably only a dozen or so have particular interest in you or your types of articles (some admins can recognize Lightbringer socks on sight, for example, but not me). The only way to hold you to your probation is for you to continue to use the original account or for you to publically disclose your name change. Dmcdevit is right in that creating this new account was in reality an attempt to evade your probation even if such was not your intent. No action is needed at this time, but you need to pick one account and stick with it. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:50, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Response to Travb</b> Your recent comments on NuclearUmpf's user talk page could be seen as an attempt to provoke a reaction (in other words, trolling, although that word is overused). I would like you to read the top of this page, particularly where it says <i>"Most editors under ArbCom sanction are neither trolls nor vandals and should be treated with the same respect as any other editor. We should still Assume Good Faith. Arbitration Committee decisions are designed to be coercive, not punitive."</i> I'd like you to confine your comments to the talk pages of any articles you both edit and to discuss the substance of each others' edits, not the personalities behind them. (This, of course, applies to everyone on Wikipedia all the time.) If NuclearUmpf edits in a way that appears to violate his probation, you can make a new complaint here. (I am aware that he must have edited in a similar enough way to be detected, however, he is still allowed to edit, and he is allowed to oppose other users so long as he does it in accordance with commonly accepted standards of civility, consensus, and so on.) <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:50, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>thank you for your comments Thatcher131. Can I correct you on one small issue, if you don't mind? I have never commented on NuclearUmpf's talk page.

<dd>That is a great idea. The only page we have in common is the Alleged terrorism page. Unfortunatly, I will have to continue to defend myself if user Zer0faults reports me on <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a> again, and here of course. I have never edited any of this articles that he has been involved in, I made sure not too. I have voted in administrative votes/discussions and in AfD's he has been involved in. We both have followed each other around. The stark and only difference is I have never put an article up for <a href="../../../a/f/d/AfD_0ef6.html" title="AfD">AfD</a> that Zer0faults wrote. I hope we can put this all behind us. I want too, but the subject continues to come up. Unfortunatly, it is in my best interst to watch Zer0faults edits. I don't want to be ambushed by another <a href="../../../a/n/i/ANI_4ff3.html" title="ANI">ANI</a> etc. by Zer0faults. Again, I agree with you. I have been guilty of explaining "personalities behind articles", but since I was temporarily booted, then unbooted less than an hour later, for an unrelated incident, I have been incredibly civil. Anyway, sorry to drag you into this.</dd>

<dd>I have to agree with Dmcdevit and Thatcher131. Although your name changed User:NuclearUmpf, your behavior didn't. Why do so many people write so many mean things to you on your user pages? Why did you have 6 admins sanction you? It is because of your behavior. You can blame me for revealing your sockpuppet, to arguably "evade your probation", but I am not reponsible for the strongly negative feelings that quite a lot of wikiusers have against you.</dd>

<dd>Zerofaults, you can shoot the messengers, or you can change your behavior. At this point, shooting the messenger will eventually get you booted indefinently. So that leaves truly only one option, doesn't it? Based on my past experience with you, you will opt for the shoot the messenger option, sigh.</dd>

<dd>All because the people at WP:OR said you were wrong ... Oddly you said you never edited something I edited, yet you commented on the AfD I started right after I asked the people at WP:OR to take a look at the allegations page, did we forget that? I have given dif's of this user stalking my edits and attempting to ralley people to harass and bother me. You know what keep sending them my way because I will start reporting them and you from now on. I will continue to edit Wikipedia and laugh at the fact that the article will never be renamed and WP:OR will prevail. I am done playing this childish game.</dd>

<dd>I want to clear something up, I put Travb's article up for deletion he then followed me around and stalked my contrib list for the next week, voted against an AfD I started without giving any explanation, and began contacting anyone I disagreed with off wiki such as GeoSwan, the difs are above to prove this. My final message to Travb is that all his wikidrama will not change the fact that WP:OR is a policy and I will continue to ask you to follow it, yes dont shoot the messenger indeed.</dd>

<p>(Travb, I may have gotten you mixed up with RyanF, who was posting to my talk page last night. Sorry about that.)</p>
<p>It sounds like you both should let the community speak for you. If the consensus of uninvolved editors at a neutral forum (such as AFD or WT:OR) is with you, that is sufficient rebuke; if consensus is against you, it doesn't really matter who started the conversation.</p>

<dd>In this case I agree that the reversion of the tags was a "content" reversion within the spirit of the decision. It is certainly commenting on and deprecating the content, so I count it as a content edit (as opposed to reversion of simple vandalism). Reverting the tag without discussion was defintely a violation of the parole. Infinity is required to discuss his reverts; he made no contributions to the article talk page yesterday. If the issue was under discussion by other editors, they could have replaced the tag if they felt it was needed. However the damage was minimal so consider this a warning. If Infinity want's to challenge my interpretation of "content", he can take it up with Arbcom in the Requests for clarification section of <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:30, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>O.K., I see how you could read it that way as well. I've added two more reversions regarding the Muhammad article to the top of this report. Tom makes tiny reversions, far apart, sometimes against different editors or in different places, in the hopes no-one will notice. He also fails to discuss many of his reversions. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 21:25, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just for the third opinion, yes it does seem to be one per article, per week, and yes he has contravened that.

<dd>I would have started with 24 hours myself but I have no objections to the 48 hour block imposed by Humus. Not only were there three reverts of the image in a week, there was no discussion by IPT on the talk page as required, and these particular reversions were part of a larger revert war over this image.

I do not believe this decision was just, and I have chosen not to participate as an editor at Wikipedia rather than continue editing while subject to an unjust probation.

<p>If you compare Nobs01's edits to the edits from users from the IP range they use the same type of language and have the same odd obsessions (COINTELPRO proves everyone was a spy, citing Haynes and Klehr all the time etc.) Having dealt with Nobs so much, I know this is him, but for those not as familiar, you will probably have to do some comparing. I am also fairly confident that there are 4.240.x.x IPs I have missed that he is using. <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> 23:37, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, none of the IPs you cite is any more recent that Sept 10. Since these are IPs the only thing that could be done is to reset Nobs' one-year ban, and I'm not comfortable doing that just on this basis. There is an old checkuser in which Fred Bauder comments about Nobs' geographic location. I'll ask and see if he still remembers. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 00:48, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First of all, none of those edits is a reversion. TDC is allowed to edit articles. A revert would be, for example, if he re-added the paragraph about the Cornell student after you removed it. Second of all, copy-pasting stories and candidate press releases from the World Socialist Web site into an article violates at least three policies I can think off (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYVIO_ef21.html" title="WP:COPYVIO">WP:COPYVIO</a>) and removing them wouldn't count against his revert parole even if he had reverted the edits twice in the same day, which he didn't. There's no violation here. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:46, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please look at the Turn Left edits again. TDC inserted something eight months ago that was promptly removed. Now he put it back. Given his history and the argument he put forth on the talk page, it's hard to assume good faith and not see it as a sneaky revert attempt. You don't have to actually revert an article to a previous version for an edit to be considered a revert. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> 13:41, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Secondly, I already told you on the talk page that I was going to leave inclusion of the material to your discretion, and if you did not think it was notable, then I would trust your judgment on its exclusion.

<dd>Not a reversion under the meaning of the probation. TDC is not under personal attack parole or general probation, only revert parole, and I don't believe that comment was actionable.

<dd>Thatcher131, I'm sorry if I'm making myself clear. I'm not asking anyone to take action over what TDC wrote on the talk page. My main objection is his re-insertion of a passage that was removed eight months ago from the Turn Left page. So far as I understand, an edit can be a revert without someone actually flipping to an earlier version of the document: "A partial revert is accomplished either by an ordinary edit of the current version" (<a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html#How_to_revert" title="Help:Reverting">Help:Reverting#How_to_revert</a>). This is what TDC did, eight months on. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> 15:17, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't realise that there was an edit war going on in this article. I was trying to make a positive contribution by mentioning what most reliable sources do. I answered the <b>crystal ball</b> argument in the talk page by saying that there are many articles that in one way or another predict the future if that future is regarded my many as more or less certain. As such I regarded the removal of the paragraph as a form of depletion of the article which could otherwise be more informative.Sanmint 15:11, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As long as it's only one or two edits a day you will have to deal with it in the usual way. He seems to have such a wide range of IPs that a rangeblock would do far too much collateral damage. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 23:02, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been struggling with User:Intangible for days on several articles where this pattern of disruptive editing has re-appeared. If needed, I can provide other diffs that show the offending behavior. I thought that by starting with one incident, the sanction could be mild and instructive, rather than punitive. Note that the case was "Closed on 08:33, 12 September 2006 (UTC)." Note the dates of the diffs cited by Intangible below.

<dd>Regarding Intangible, no action on the diffs cited. Neither of those lists had any citations. (Can you imaging, for example, <b>List of celebrity lesbians</b> without reliable sources?) In the case of <b>Parties Considered to be on the Far Right</b>, note that <i>considered to be</i> is weasel terminology, and many of those parties are <i>not</i> identified as "Far right" in their own main articles, so compilation of the list looks like someone's opinion. I suggest rebuilding the list including only parties that are labeled far right in their main articles, assuming such labeling is backed up by reliable sources. (In some cases the label is applied perjoratively by critics and disputed by the party itself; it will likely be unproductive to go over the labeling issue in two articles, which I why I suggest basing inclusion in a list on the terminology used in the main article, with leeway allowed for disputes—perhaps <i>Parties labeled as "Far right;" see main article for more information</i>.) Likewise for the inclusion of paleocons—find some pundits to source the statement to.</dd>

Intangible may be banned from articles he edits disruptively. In this case I do not see disruptive editing. He removed the list in June after a 6 day waiting period on the talk page. Cberlet added it back without discussing it at all, and Intangible has not even removed it again. If (for example) someone were to update the list using the criteria I suggested (or some other criteria based on reliable sources rather than one person's opinion), and explain the reasoning on the talk page, and Intangible were to continue to remove it, that might actually constute disruption. The thing is, Intangible being under arbitration does not relieve other editors of the obligation to provide sources or work with him. Let me give two counter-examples. Editor A removes several sourced sections from an article alleging the US engages in state-sponsored terrorism. The sources proved that bad things happened, but not that the US was alleged to be behind them. While editor B went to AN/I to complain, editor C found and added sources making the allegations of a US government connection; editor A agreed the sources were acceptable and the article was ultimately improved by the addition of reliable sources through the wiki process. One the other hand, editor X frequently disputes classification of bands in different music sub-genres, edit warring with other music fans. In every case I have looked into, there are no reliable sources offered on either side, and the classification of a band is based on web forums or statements like "every fan knows this", "this band is generally considered to be" and so on. If Intangible disputes editors' characterizations of far right groups, make sure you are quoting reliable sources rather than your own opinions. If he removes them then, it may constitute disruption. If he adds sources with differing views, then you report the views of all reliable sources per NPOV policy. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 13:38, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Intangible games the system by finding one cite that is then claimed to refute all other cites. Then there is a staged debate over deleting all the cited published material that claims a group or person is part of the political right. Certainly we all need to provide sources, but the reason I picked <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_right.html" title="Far right">Far right</a> is that it was part of the summer editing blitz by Intangible involving hundreds of pages, in which editors could not even keep up with his massive deletions. That's why the artitration was opened in the first place. Intangible posted the comments on <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_right.html" title="Far right">Far right</a> before the arbitration was opened. Then months later deleted the material. There are scores of pages where Intangible can do this. It violates the spirit and intent of the probation. Please go back and read the arbitration. It is not about sourcing, it is about Intangible disrupting "articles which relate to nationalist or right wing European political parties. It is alleged that Intangible engages in tendentious editing which minimizes the neo-fascist tendencies of such parties." Intangible does not constructively participate in writing entries that explore a variety of views, Intangible engages in promoting an idiosyncratic POV that sanitizes from entries published claims regarding right-wing affiliation.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 14:22, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am aware of the arbitration record and I believe I have been reasonably diligent in pursuing an understanding of the complaints against Intangible (see <a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_Archive_14_2394.html#I.27m_taking_you_up_on_your_offer_of_free_advice" title="User talk:Dmcdevit/Archive 14">here</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Intangible_4014.html#Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration.2FIntangible_.28encore.29" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Intangible">here</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_Archive12_6415.html#Could_I_trouble_you..." title="User talk:Mackensen/Archive12">here</a>). Intangible may be banned from articles for disruptive editing. "Disruptive" is always going to be a matter of judgement, of course, but I don't think any uninvolved admin would find changing an article once in June and once in October to be "disruptive." I was very concerned about BBET when it was <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Arbitration_enforcement_Archive2_0a93.html#User:Intangible" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Arbitration enforcement/Archive2">brought here</a>, but as both Intangible and LucVerhelst were guilty of edit warring, I was wary of appying a one-sided sanction, and Dmcdevit <a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_Archive_14_2394.html#I.27m_taking_you_up_on_your_offer_of_free_advice" title="User talk:Dmcdevit/Archive 14">shared</a> the same concern. I was also prepared to ban Intangible from <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Belien_d2e8.html" title="Paul Belien">Paul Belien</a> over his peculiar interpretation of the reliable source policy, but it seemed that Intangible and Luc were engaged in productive discussion on the talk page, which is a) not disruption and b) generally what we want people to do. Arbcom could have outright banned Intangible from editing articles about right wing politics and they declined to do so. As Mackensen said when I <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_Archive12_6415.html#Could_I_trouble_you..." title="User talk:Mackensen/Archive12">asked</a> him about BBET, "<i>Intangible represents a useful counterpoint to the other editors and hasn't passed the threshold at which his contributions cease being worthwhile.</i>" Maybe there are other articles or better examples of disruptive editing, but you haven't made the case regarding Far right and BBET. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:55, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progress_Party_%28Norway%29_d3cf.html" title="Progress Party (Norway)">Progress Party (Norway)</a> article Intangible is campaigning for more than just the removal of unsourced criticism; he desires to delete several scholarly citations which describe the Progress Party as "radical right". He and another editor, <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor">User:Heptor</a>, demand that the party be labelled according to its own skewed perceptions of itself. Moreover, Intangible claims that news reports from mainstream, reputable media organzations such as the BBC and CNN are inadequate. Yet, even when I insert the opinions of the scholarly sources he's always clamouring about, he claims that they are outdated and therefore irrelevant or that their opinions are invalid because they don't all use the same definition of "radical right"; so it is impossible to satisfy his demands. He has used these same specious arguments in articles about other far-right parties; they are what caused him to be banned in the first place, as you know. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 03:06, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You should read the last two threads on the talk page whenever you have the opportunity, but in the meantime here are a couple of comments on the talk page that exemplify Intangible's disruptive nit-picking:
<dl>
<dd><i>What about the sentence</i> "I use the label <b>‘populist right’ as opposed to the ‘new radical right’</b> (Kitschelt and McGann 1995), since I wish to underline that these parties’ 1990s manifestations are generally not radically neo-liberal on the economic issue dimension, and being so is a defining feature of Kitschelt and McGann’s ‘new radical right’ category" <i>don't you understand? Intangible 12:37, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>You don't understand. There is a debate over terminology among scholars. Each author tries to define a specific subset of right-wing politics. Our job is not to point out the terminological variation, but to highlight the central themes of the nmajority of scholars of the political right. Intangible, you continue to use these terminological debates, which are well-known in the field, as an excuse to sanitize from many articles any claim from a reputable published source that a particular group is right-wing, or far right, or extreme right. This is the core of the problem with your disruptive, endless, contrary, nit-picking discussions on this and other pages. You have a POV, and you engage in territorially priapic, structurally omphaloskeptic, faux intellectual word games to mask your POV war against majority scholarship. And yes, I do understand, since I co-wrote a book on the subject . . . . --<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 13:15, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what your point is WGee. Re the Progress Party, I have already given examples that show the party is just labeled as "right-wing" or populist or whatelse, and I don't see what it would add to the article to say that "some label the party as right-wing, some label the party as radical right."</dd>

<p>&lt;-------------The above statement by Intangible clearly demonstrates an unwillingness to abide by the guidelines regarding reputable sources established on Wikipedia. Intangible is a deletionist continuing a POV campaign to eradicate any scholarly terminology with which Intangible has any disagreement. Here is another clear example of Intangible scoffing at the terms of probation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AProgress_Party_%28Norway%29&amp;diff=88212272&amp;oldid=88206717" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AProgress_Party_%28Norway%29&amp;diff=88212272&amp;oldid=88206717" rel="nofollow">Diff.</a>. The position being articulated once again by Intangible is precisely the "disrupts by tendentious editing," that primarily take the form of idiosyncratic POV pushing regarding the terminolgy used to describe various groups considered "right wing" by a majority of scholars. Certainly there are matters here where more citation is required, but that is not the issue around which I am asking for enforcement of the probation through an appropriate administrative action.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 15:57, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know I will not be popular in certain quarters, and I encourage you to find somone else to review the situation. In the current context, I don't find Intangible's edits to be disruptive enough to warrant page banning. I think both sides have misunderstood <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Intangible seems to want to neuter the article of any point of view, while Cberlet has been arguing that if a majority of academics state something, then it must be so. NPOV contemplates reporting all significant points of view. I would suggest that that introduction should have reasonably neutral intorduction, and a discussion in the body can report how different sources classify the party. However, classification of political parties as left, right, etc. is part of the way things are, and if Intangible continues to try and remove all attempts to report party labels that havbe been applied by others then I will consider an article ban. More on the article talk page. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 12:37, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After some clarification on this issue at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Confusion_on_Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration.2FFourthAve" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Confusion_on_Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/FourthAve</a>, it can be safe to say that the above edits constitute evasion of the one-year ban and thus requires a reset. Since I do not know of any further edits from FA, I hereby ask that someone unblock and reblock FA to September 23, 2007.</p>

<p>Is it possible to increase Copperchair's block to indefinite and block IP range 190.10.0.XX as well? Since the 1 year and 1 day block, Copperchair has continuously violated the block and the probation via sockpuppets most originating from the indicated IP range:</p>

<li>Well, for starters I will reset Copperchair's one year ban to one year from now. If he keeps it up it will amount to an indef block anyway. The IPs can't be blocked longterm because it might affect other users. When you see edits from that range the IP can be blocked briefly and the edits reverted, or the range blocked for a couple of days, but not longer. I'm afraid the only practical long term solution is to keep reverting his edits and hope he gets bored and finds something else to do. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:20, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
