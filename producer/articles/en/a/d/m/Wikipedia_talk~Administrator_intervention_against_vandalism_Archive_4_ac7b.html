<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edit conflicts</span></h2>
<p>Is there some way - any way - of avoiding edit conflicts, or at least minimising their inconvenience, on this page of all pages? I have just typed in the same vandal warning five times, and on each occasion lost my text in an edit conflict. The competing warnings were equally valid, but is there not some way of holding text for resubmission in this situation?--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 17:52, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, it is annoying - what I do is "Show preview" before posting and if I am advised that another edit has been made, scroll down to the second edit screen below where my edit is still intact - cut and paste it into the top edit screen and with luck and fast fingers only have to do this a few times before I get in there. A pain, but at least you don't have to keep losing and re-typing that same text. Hope this helps - of course if the edit system can be improved as you suggest, all the better. --<a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 18:06, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Similarly, I use "show changes" and, if anything comes up yellow, I copy what I've written (or, if I'm posting several responses in a single thread, I copy what has been said in the meantime). <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 18:36, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Depending on your browser and cache settings -- the last page on your back button should still contain the text you typed in. This has worked for me every time I have had an edit conflict. -- <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenesis13_6b6b.html" title="User:Renesis13">Renesis</a> (<a href="../../../r/e/n/User_talk%7ERenesis13_5466.html" title="User talk:Renesis13">talk</a>) 18:18, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>First, I type FAST! I do not care about typos in my explanation, the admins get the picture. Second of all, If i have edit conflicted and I suspect it again, I usually do a quick &lt;SHIFT&gt; + &lt;HOME&gt; then a &lt;CTRL&gt; + C top copy and it is on the clipborad in case I gotta repaste it quick. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 18:39, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Type your edit into a text editor, then click the edit button, paste, then save, this reduces the chance of an edit conflict to just a few seconds. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 18:40, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>If I have an edit conflict, I: back up to my preview screen, cut the text I typed in, back out of the edit and the page altogether, wait a moment, go to the page again, edit again, paste in the text, and save it quickly. That almost always works for me. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 05:26, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of valid vandals</span></h2>
<p>How come many times, admins remove vandals from the list because they haven't vandalized in half an hour or an hour. The page says don't list it if they haven't vandalized in 24 hrs, don't list them. A vandal can stop for a little while and then resume. What if he took a break to do something, like eat lunch. Does that mean their name gets removed? In my mind, if they've vandalized after the final warning less than 24 hours ago (not one hour), they can be blocked. <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETeckWiz_cd20.html" title="User:TeckWiz"><b>T</b></a><span style="color:green;">e</span><a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETeckWiz_cd20.html" title="User:TeckWiz"><b>ckWiz</b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/e/c/User_talk%7ETeckWiz_cb9b.html" title="User talk:TeckWiz">Talk</a></sup><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TeckWiz_ea80.html" title="Special:Contributions/TeckWiz">Contribs</a><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_TeckWiz_0fa0.html" title="Special:Emailuser/TeckWiz">@</a></sub></small> 17:56, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really can't vouch for this, but I personally ignore periodic breaks from vandalism sprees. Your thoughts were the exact same I had in my mind when I started blocking vandals, and I still will block vandals if they have vandalized within the last 18 or so hours. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 21:38, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My personal cutoff is around 1.5 hours. Blocking is a preventative action, not a punitive one. If they've stopped vandalising, there is no point blocking them. That's with IP addresses - logged in users, I'll block regardless of the time. With IP addresses, you need to always keep in mind that you might be blocking a helpful editor who happens to use that IP next, 1.5 hours is more than long enough for someone else to be using that address. My main exception is if they've just come off another block, as that usually means it's the same person, so is probably a static address. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 21:50, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally, if a user hasn't vandalized in the last 30 minutes, I won't block him, although I would leave him listed for 45-60 minutes in AIV just in case. As stated, you block to prevent further damage, not to punish what someone has done in the past. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 00:55, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I figure that if a guy has vandalized maybe 15 hours ago, they'll probably come back and vandalize within the next day or two. According to your system of blocking, that user would not be blocked, and they could continue to vandalize sporadically. I would block them because I am inclined to believe that this user will come back to vandalize. It may seem like a punitive measure, but I do what I feel is most appropriate in such situations. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 01:07, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the important thing to consider is how long ago they vandalised relative to the length of the block you would impose. If you're only going to impose a 24 hours block (as is normal for IP addresses), it won't stop them coming back in a couple of days. In your example, the vandal should have been blocked for 24 hours 15 hours ago, so he would have 9 hours left. A block at the right time wouldn't have stopped him coming back the next day, so why should a late block do so? If we were worried about IP vandals coming back the next day, the standard block would be longer than 24 hours. It isn't any longer, since we don't want to risk collateral damage. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 12:13, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding ReyBrujo's comment, maybe there could be some sort of "watchilst" section either here or somewhere else? Sometimes I am keeping track of a user adding “sneaky vandalism” to articles, such as changing facts despite warnings to desist. If I have to sign off, the user might be able to continue in this manner for a while before he is recognized. I could solve this problem, though, by adding the user to some sort of “watchlist” page, which could also be used for sporadic IP vandals who are currently on their last warning. This would clean up the main WP:AIV page by removing users who probably won't be blocked unless they vandalize again. But these are just my own thoughts– please let me know if such an arrangement would be practical.

<dd>Well, we could have a WP:AIV/LT (long term?) page, and move them there instead of just adding a comment like "keeping here to watch for a little bit". If paranoid, we can full protect the page so that only admins can report and remove from there, which would prevent anyone from bypassing AIV. This may solve cases where users vandalize a little every day, but not enough to get blocked by some admins (or at least, I) due this "moral" problem we have.

<dd>How about "Only list here if they have vandalised in the past few hours, or have been previously blocked for vandalism."? It makes it a little longer and more complicated, but I think it accurately determines which vandals will get blocked. I would be tempted to reduce "past few hours" to "past hour" - especially for IP addresses, an hour of silence usually means they've stopped and will probably have a different address when they come back. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 13:40, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know, I think it's fair to give a user one or two more warnings if they're coming back after a block. Especially if it's a school or IP or another IP with a lot of users, they get a ton of blocks but helpful users also contribute from them. And also if a block was a long time in the past, it could be a different user just being a newbie. But I would say they shouldn't necessarily get all 4 test templates over again after they're coming back from a block. Just my take. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelldot_cc92.html" title="User:Delldot">delldot</a> | <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelldot_82a5.html" title="User talk:Delldot">talk</a></small> 20:41, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Verily, delldot. What I had in mind when I said this was IPs that are shared by a school or organization. Even if the IP has been blocked before, it seems unlikely that blocking it for edits made 8 hours ago will prevent vandalism; rather, it could prevent other anonymous helpful edits from the same IP. Blocking should be preventive, not punitive, but this IP would seem like a valid listing per the "24 hour" clause.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">final warning</span></h2>
<p>The instructions are written in a way which would seem to imply that someone is not reportable here after the following sequence of recent events:</p>
<ol>
<li>Test4</li>
<li>Vandalism</li>
<li>Another test4</li>
</ol>
<p>They are clearly reportable after (2) above, and it would be odd if someone posting another warning (3) were to change that. The point is that someone should be reportable here if they have vandalised after a recent warning which <i>claims</i> to be a final warning, even if it turns out not to be. I'm going to change the wording to reflect this. —&#160;<i><a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan012_a44e.html" title="User:Alan012">Alan</a></i><sup><a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlan012_49aa.html" title="User talk:Alan012">✉</a></sup> 18:11, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>However, <a href="../../../o/p/_/WP%7EOP_2cfb.html" title="WP:OP">WP:OP</a> specifically states "To prevent abuse or vandalism, only proxy checks by verified users will be accepted." That and other information on the page would seem to suggest blocking before such a check by a verified user, regardless of the RBL link availability, is a no-no.

<dd>Things are uselessly stale over there, with the backlog sharply growing due to the increase in spambot postings (there was an organised campaign to flood with spam yesterday and today, too). That was, until a recent purge got the backlog down to 2 weeks.

<dd>That's not a reason to circumvent the process, in my opinion ... have you considered pursuing becoming a 'verified user' so that you can work at that desk directly? That would seem to be the better option over putting inappropriate material on AIV ... inappropriate based on there not being vandalism from the IP's perpetrated in the recent past. My understanding is that AIV is for fast-response activities - things that need to be taken care of right away. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 13:32, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Unfortunately, what is "widely considered bad form" is also encouraged by long-established recommendations, first introduced as an article by a person who has served on the Wikimedia Foundation board of directors. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Refactoring_talk_pages&amp;dir=prev&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Refactoring_talk_pages&amp;dir=prev&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> "Refactoring is a stronger word that copy editing." The current version of that page states that some consider Wikipedia at odds with peers in that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Refactoring_talk_pages#Terminology" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Refactoring_talk_pages#Terminology" rel="nofollow">refactoring and editing are elsewhere considered synonymous</a>. Copy editing is a lesser form of refactoring (or editing as it is more widely dubbed) but is one element of editing (sometimes called refactoring) because it is intended to "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Refactoring_talk_pages" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Refactoring_talk_pages" rel="nofollow">improve readability while preserving meaning.</a>" If improving readability while preserving meaning is considered by some not to advance the purpose of composing an encyclopedia, perhaps those who have reached such a conclusion need to reconsider their conclusion in the context of well-established traditions, guidelines and practices. Wikipedia lists <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Refactoring_talk_pages#Significant_Examples" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Refactoring_talk_pages#Significant_Examples" rel="nofollow">a significant example</a> of refactoring, which may be considered bad form by some, but is probably more widely accepted as evidenced by the presence of a project article encouraging the practice. I suggest if people object to the practice, instead of calling one well-intended editor a vandal for doing what appears to many to be suggested practice, they contribute to the page that encourages the practice to see if others there agree that the practice is not as helpful as the page represents in its effort to get people to adopt the practice. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKindWordsNotHeard_314e.html" title="User:KindWordsNotHeard">KindWordsNotHeard</a> 04:36, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please do not condescend toward me. I am well aquainted with the concept of consensus, though you have in no way suggested why your allusion to the concept is relevant here. The odd guideline to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">Ignore All Rules</a> could as logically support my analysis as it could "in one sweep nullify" my input, and because it can nullify any argument in any context, it is not a very mature argument, as arguments go. Grown up arguments have legs. How is your argument valid that my response here to the invitation to edit is "wikilawyering" while your offering of letter soup to imply my donation is not useful is something else? Have you passed the Wikilawyer bar exam, and are qualified to do so while others are not permitted to reflect on policies, guidelines or practices in a specific context? If I were to visit some places, I would be labeled with a certain disparaging term that starts with an "n", but that doesn't mean the disparagement has merit. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKindWordsNotHeard_314e.html" title="User:KindWordsNotHeard">KindWordsNotHeard</a> 06:05, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Where, if not here, is the debate about whether or not this is vandalism to be conducted? And what are we to debate if not whether editing talk pages for grammar and spelling is a widely endorsed practice? You might consider that this is not the page for "intervention against bad edits" so an opinion about whether or not the edit is "bad" is not appropriate here; the discussion is about what comprises vandalism in the context of specific edits referenced here. If you would like to continue discussion about the <i>propriety</i> of practices discussed here in the broader context, I have already suggested that you address your comments to the page where the practice of refactoring is advanced as a laudable practice. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKindWordsNotHeard_314e.html" title="User:KindWordsNotHeard">KindWordsNotHeard</a> 06:05, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Whether or not the edits of others' comments are vandalism is beyond my wisdom, but this debate is getting kind of hot.

<li>I think we already have a consensus, albeit among a very few respondants, unless the reporting user does not concur with the consensus that followed, which agreed the edits were either "not bad" or "not vandalism". The heat, as it were, seems not to involve whether the edits are vandalism or "bad", but whether I am qualified to respond and whether my input was responsive to the context. While I may be willing to offer further consideration, for my interests at this point I consider the matter here closed. I honestly only responded here because I was astounded to see someone's effort to correct spelling and grammar cast as a pseudo-criminal activity (vandalism). I consider the allegations that my input was not welcome to represent only of the views of the person expressing such views, though the recurrance of a poorly argued "you're-not-appropriate" responses to legitimate input does inform me somewhat about the capacity of some people to recognize and make use of valuable input offered by others. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKindWordsNotHeard_314e.html" title="User:KindWordsNotHeard">KindWordsNotHeard</a> 06:51, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi everyone. I certainly didn't mean to start this when I reported this user. Really, I'm assuming that this user is editing these talk pages in good faith. I really think that the user is probably just bugged by sentences that don't begin with capital letters and badly misspelled words and words that are run together and when the user stumbles accross talk pages that have these types of errors, goes about copy-editing. But, it's problematic to have anyone messing with what someone else said on a talk page. For starters, sometimes errors are purposeful. But also, talk pages are really the only way to get to know people, and you don't want to get to know edited versions of people.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The other problem is is that I don't even know how to warn this user. The user uses at least three IP addresses: 24.183.40.221 and 24.14.139.44 which I originally reported as well as 66.191.117.215 and has a wikipedia user name <a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysterypaw_c074.html" title="User talk:Mysterypaw">Mysterypaw</a>, though hasn't made any edits with it. I was able to find this by going only a month back in the edits for 24.183.40.221 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Warriors_%28book_series%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=90226354" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Warriors_%28book_series%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=90226354" rel="nofollow">(see talk page)</a>.

I have no idea how many IPs this user uses or how many usernames the user has which makes this user difficult to warn. I do feel that some action should be taken because the user shows a consistent pattern of editing other people's content on talk pages whenever something appears to bother the user. <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 09:24, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</b></li>

<p>What can be done to reduce the number of incorrect reports made on AIV? Every day we get dozens of reports where someone hasn't been warned, or hasn't edited since the final warning, or even hasn't edited for a week (I just removed one of those)! How about getting all reports to be done via a template which requires the reporter to link to the diff for the final warning, and the edit after that warning? I don't like the idea much, as it makes it much harder to report someone, which might reduce the number of correct reports we get (and thus, increase the amount of vandalism). Any better ideas?

<dd>I agree: non-admins should remove users that will definitely not get blocked to save time for admins, such as users that have not received any warnings because they don't even have a talk page yet. Thinking more about this, though, where is the line? It seems reasonable for a non-admin to remove someone who has not edited in the past week, but what if it is the past 6 hours? Where is the line? I think there should be a more explicit policy for when non-admins are allowed to remove users from AIV.</dd>

<dd>I hate instruction creep though. I'm happy for non admin but experienced users to make a reasonable judgement call. If a non admin is not not happy to stand by their judgment then don't remove it. As for templates - personally I destest them. They are used way too often. If a user doesn't read the instructions on the top of the page why should they read a template message? A personal little note is much better IMO.

Like I said, I only send a message for people to do it repeatedly, because those are the ones who would benefit most from being informed. Otherwise, considering the nature of how we process AIV, anything else would be approach instruction creep. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 21:47, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><s>Only one gripe -- as you may know, convention on AIV is to provide an edit summary saying "EMPTY" if an admin removes the last remaining user on AIV, so that other admins viewing the edit summary on their watchlists know that the list is empty; conversely, "NOT EMPTY" is written when entries still remain unresolved. Would it be a hassle to get the bot to check whether it is removing the last entry on the page, and if so, note this in its edit summary? Other than that, it's a fantastic idea and I imagine it will be a great help for admins in AIV's future. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">theProject</a> 07:59, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</s></dd>

<p>One possible issue - with a bot removing blocked vandals so quickly, there isn't an opportunity for the blocking admin to give an explanation in the edit summary, which can sometimes be useful. I guess admins could remove the vandal before blocking, so the bot doesn't have anything to do with it, so it's not a serious issue, but it might be worth thinking about. Could the bot give the block reason in its edit summary, perhaps? --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 17:05, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The edit summery of my bot is already rather long. If I added the block reason to it, it would exceed the maximum length of the edit summery. Block reasons can be rather long. If an admin wants to put a comment in the edit summery when removing a report, then removing it first then blocking it would be the best way. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 17:19, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, it shows how long is remaining on the block, and which type of block it is. No bomb. It uses the timestamp in the http header from Wikipedia so the figures are very accurate. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 17:56, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know like nothing about bot implementation, but just a question for you. Would it be easier to just display the duration of the block rather than the duration remaining? For example, "6 weeks" seems a little more neat than "41d23h59m." It's not a huge thing to me either way, just curious if you have thoughts about it either way. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 18:05, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think showing the time remaining is important as not everyone remove from the list was just blocked. Users are often added to the list long after they are blocked. What's more I would have to look into the block log aswell as the Ipblocklist as the Ipblocklist only gives the expiry time.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Block type abbreviations</span></h2>
<p>I am going to add the type of block to my bot's edit summery. I was thinking of using the abbreviations AB(for autoblock), AO(for anon only), and AC(Account creation).</p>

<dd>AC and AO for sure, those are abbreviations that I think most of us are familiar with. Personally, I'm not as familiar with the "AB" abbreviation, but it's intuitive enough and if I'm the only one not familiar with it, I don't see why it shouldn't be used. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 16:27, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AC for Account creation <i>disabled</i> seems a little counter intutive. How about NAC ("no account creation")? --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems logical to me as it is. - the type of block is "a block on account creation", etc. I read it as "Block type: <b>A</b>ccount <b>C</b>reation (is blocked)" Perhaps it's just me … <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 22:11, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Put that way, it does make sense. The reason I expected it to be the other way around before I actually read the legend was being the default is to block account creation, so I was expecting a mention in the summary to mean it was different from the default. It does make sense this way round, though, you're absolutely right. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 01:25, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It reads the words <i>account creation blocked</i> from the blocklist. I have made my flags in the same context that the MediaWiki engine keeps them in.

<p>I see a few solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>We create a transcluded subpage, similar to the one the bots report to for requesting page protection on already blocked accoutns userpages. This requires no modification to my script.</li>
<li>We create another template for reporting already blocked vandals such as {{blockedvandal|WoW has Aspergers, Obesity and Trisexual}}. This template can link to talk page and talk page history, and the talk page protection button. This would require a minor adjustment to my script(so it does not look like a comment), which is no problem. The added advantage to this method is that if for some other reason in the future a blocked user should remain on the list, the template will work for that too.</li>
<li>Instruct people to go to <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a>. This is not a good solution in my opinion because blocked talk page vandals are dealt with much faster here.</li>

<dd>These type of protection are obvious and common enough that they seem better handled here than RFP or ANI.

<dd>The problem (which should be obvious to all of us) is that I spend a significant fraction of my time on Wikipedia reverting vandalism. And much of the rest of my time here is checking to make sure that no vandalism occurred to one of the articles I watch or that someone else repaired it. The cost of fighting vandalism is a limiting factor on our ability to improve (or even preserve) Wikipedia. There has to be some way to transfer that cost back to the vandals or we will drown in a sea of vandalism. Theresa, you should not count the value of other editor's time so cheaply. Many people have quit editing because of this problem. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 09:01, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

Both of them are shared IPs. Neither of them wree active when you reported them. Neither had edited remotely close to the time you reported them, therefore, they were inactive. The first one hasn't been warned since December 22. You felt the need to report them but not warn them? It's a shared IP, the same user isn't using it each time so warnings are appropriate. This is why your reports were removed, not because we're too soft, but because we recognize that more than one person uses these IPs. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 16:14, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When deciding whether to block IPs, is any attempt made to determine whether the IP is static or dynamic? In my view that would make a big difference in determining what frequency of vandalism merits a block. If the IP is static, it's far more likely that it's the same individual doing the vandalism each time. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 16:28, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If some group, e.g. an elementary school, has an unusually high level of vandalism, then perhaps it is best to block the whole group (IP address).

<p>Hmmm... I said it was time for bed 3 hours ago, but I'm still here. I've taken a closer look, and I agree, the range is far too big to block for the sake of one article. Semi-protection (as Theresa has done) is the best solution. He's only used 6 IP addresses in the last month, by my count, so it wouldn't be hard to block them all individually - it's not necessary while the page is protected, though. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 02:31, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Revert and report</span></h2>
<p>I'm seeing a slightly disturbing trend lately where people are reporting vandals here but not reverting the vandalism itself. Apparently we need to encourage people to <i>revert</i> as well as report. (I'm not even talking about 2-week-old vandalism that was missed - I'm talking about where someone reported here about a single vandalism edit to article X but I watched article X and it was never reverted until I did several minutes later.) —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 21:28, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've also noticed an increase of the reports where an IP vandal has vandalized recently, but their test4 was issued several days ago or some variant of that (warned piles of times months ago but never blocked, and is now back).

<dd>I don't think they are being sloppy, but instead they want to work faster. Apparently, lately quantity is more important than quality. I work with copyvios, and usually users tag articles as copyvio but never care informing the user that their article has been put into speedy deletion. The same happens when prodding, or tagging images. From time to time, when it becomes serious (in example, many of such tags without informing users) I tell them. But otherwise, I do not really mind doing that myself. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 22:41, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I'm not sure weather to hope for another VP release that will be stable of hope the AWB team's IRCMonitor gets finished. RC patrolling may suck right now (it does, IMHO), but that doesn't relieve people RC patrolling from having to meet the same high standard of precision in dealing with vandals and vandalism. Reverting every bad edit, warning the vandal, checking the vandal's past contributions for other on-top edits, and reporting them after the last warning. Jimbo's quote about being nice to maniacs is totally right on, even though it may be really annoying. Yeah there are good reasons why RC patrollers are getting buried and rushing, but, in my thoughts at least, that doesn't make it okay to rush through and leave things done halfway. --<a href="../../../i/m/j/User%7EImjustmatthew_9344.html" title="User:Imjustmatthew">Matthew</a> 01:11, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If there are a lot of articles vandalised and AIV isn't backlogged, I think it's reasonable for a user not to doggedly revert it manually, because when an admin comes round he can use rollback to take the whole lot out in seconds. Even popups is fiddly compared to rollback. I had a fake-rollback tool before I was an admin but I don't think it ever worked on users' contribution lists (and it still worked more slowly than proper rollback).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The main problem I find is users posting content disputes over fancruft, where if users change some fictional details it's very difficult, if not impossible, for admins to tell whether it's misinformation that rises to the level of vandalism, or a content dispute. One of the things that makes it much more likely that I'll remove the report is to see the supposed vandalism unreverted despite being around for a while. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 11:55, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Autobacklog</span></h2>
<p>An idea has been proposed several times to have HBC AIV helperbot automatically add and remove the backlog notice on <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>.</p>
<p>Basically the current line:</p>
<dl>
<dd>{{noadminbacklog}} &lt;!-- {{noadminbacklog}} or {{adminbacklog}} --&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<p>would be replaced with something like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>{{noadminbacklog}} &lt;!-- Autobacklog=On AddLimit=15 RemoveLimit=5 --&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<p>Where <b>Limit</b> would be the number of reports needed to set the backlog to on. The Autobacklog parameter could be set to <b>Off</b>(or anything but on/On) to temporarily disable autobacklog function. This way the use of the function can be determined by regular editing/consensus.</p>
<p>What do people think? Pending a consensus here to implement this idea, I will code it then request an expansion in my bots approval to cover this. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 19:33, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>How easy would it be to have a time parameter too? "IF there are reports more than X hours old THEN add the backlog tag." Old reports often aren't a problem on AIV, since it generally means the vandal has stopped, but I think it should still be counted as a backlog. Informing admins of a backlog could be done with a template that admins put on their user page/talk page similar to the defcon thing. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 10:53, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is now running, just as described above. I did some testing on a sandbox page and it seems to work fine. Now I just have to wait for a backlog to test it.

<p>I made a slight modification from the above instructions. The backlog will now be added when the number of reports reaches the value, as opposed to my first plan which was when the number of reports passed the values. Basically I used &gt;= instead of &gt;.

<p>Rather than post to other users' talk pages, which would in my opinion post a lot of messages to admins who can't do anything about them (because they're offline), what about having a template which, when AIV becomes backlogged, the bot writes "AIV is backlogged" in it, in some sort of box, and when the backlog is cleared the bot blanks it? Admins could then transclude it to the top of their talk page, and whenever there was a backlog the message would appear. When it was gone the page would go back to normal. We might even add it to <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, although perhaps that would be information overload on those pages. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 12:01, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you don't mind hearing the opinion of a no-name user, I think it's a great idea. As Alpha said, we'd bring in a lot more reports (I'm not saying that admins don't have enough to deal with in the first place), though we'd probably also get a lot of dab reports from users in hopes of getting an award, which isn't what the whole barnstar idea is about. // <a href="../../../p/o/e/User_talk%7EPoetic_Decay_7f41.html" title="User talk:Poetic Decay"><font color="black"><i><b>Poetic</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Poetic_Decay_98fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Poetic Decay"><font color="purple"><i><b>Decay</b></i></font></a> 02:27, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sort of on the fence about such an idea. Many have pointed out that the Anti-vandal star does sufficiently reward users for deterring Wikipedia vandalism and I agree with them on that. As far as promoting reports, it is a constructive effort to encourage more users to utilize this page more often but should barnstars be used in such a bribing fashion? On the other hand, this page is an asset to both Wiki-admins and non-admins, so I do see why you may believe it to be beneficial to reward users for increasing the productivity and effectiveness of this page. If such an award was proposed on <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia%7EBarnstar_and_award_proposals_787a.html" title="Wikipedia:Barnstar and award proposals">Wikipedia:Barnstar and award proposals</a>, I would probably reiterate what I said here and submit my vote as a neutral.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Feedback to reporters</span></h2>
<p>I had a read through the responses to the sections above on the AIV Barnstar and reports of unwarned vandals. I am neither an admin nor a vandal patroller but I use this page occasionally when I see vandalism - normally on a page I'm watching. One thing that strikes me is that is would be be useful to give reporters feedback on their reports. You could design a template quite easily that says, either "Thanks for your report on User:xxx, they have been blocked" or "Thanks for your report on User:xxx, they cannot be blocked as they haven't been warned - please do not list them here until they have been warned first and reoffended". The feedback could then be given by the amdin doing the blocking (or even a BOT (??)). You needn't necessarily give feedback al the time, but it might be useful where the same users are persistently making false reports and could do with some "education" <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewRT_eb6f.html" title="User:AndrewRT">AndrewRT</a>(<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrewRT_58ab.html" title="User talk:AndrewRT">Talk</a>) 21:09, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Admins do, on accasion, speak to people if they add inapropriate reports. But to be honest, adding even a template to tell someone "thanks for reporting the vandal" seems like a bit of an effort for little gain to me. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 21:23, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Most admins who decline to block on a given report will give the reason in the edit summary removing the report from the page, so a reporting editor who is interested in the outcome of a given "case" can watchlist AIV or check the history for that. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At peak times it's often very difficult to read through the history and tell when your vandal hasn't been blocked, HighInBC's bot has made it easier by showing pretty clearly when someone is blocked, but its still tough to know if that vandal you thought was borderline got blocked or not. AndrewRT makes a great point in that for an average user it's nice to receive feedback on the vandals you report so you know when you're screwing up before you do it too much. (Hurrah! for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Control_theory.html#An_example" title="Control theory">closed loop</a> systems!) --<a href="../../../i/m/j/User%7EImjustmatthew_9344.html" title="User:Imjustmatthew">Matthew</a> 22:27, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because I'm a lazy, lazy bastard, I wonder if we should make a template to leave for users who leave reports that don't need intervention? I just left a note on a user's talk page explaining how to check the date of the last warning and make sure it's recent, and how to leave new warnings for users. I'd be more inclined to give feedback to misreports if I could just type subst:aivr-report or the like. I suppose I could draft something up, if I thought others would use it. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope"><b><font color="#3D59AB">Merope</font></b></a> 18:47, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I suppose it could be helpful for admins to have a template to use in the situations described by Merope, but (speaking as someone who has reported vandals, with varying results) I think that routine feedback to reporters would be both unnecessary effort on the part of the reporter and unnecessary clutter on the Talk page of the recipient. I keep my reportees (and warn-ees) on my watchlist, so I can tell when they are blocked or re-warned, and if I want to know why an admin did not act, it's easy enough to search for my username on the <b>Administrator intervention</b> history page. --<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 19:07, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Definitely unnecessary effort on the part of admins. Frankly, reacting to premature/malformed/misplaced reports takes enough time without having to go other to the reporter's talk page - and watchlist it for further replies (I support thread continuity). I don't want people to be afraid of making reports for fear that it'll be rejected - but if you want to know what happened to it, check the history. And a much more productive use of time than checking the history would be to continue patrolling for new vandals, rather than checking ones that have been dealt with.--<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 03:34, 20 January 2007 (UTC) <span id="63294534932"></span></p>

<p>I agree that further formal instructions for "order of processing" are not necessary. Normally I assume an admin would start with the oldest, i.e., the report on top, but sometimes the description will make it clear that a newer report is particularly urgent. If an editor on this page writes "vandal has blanked userpages of 10 editors who have reverted him" or "vandal has repeatedly put obscenities into the first sentence of today's FA after bv warning" then any reviewing admin would know those should be dealt with out of sequence. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:30, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I quite often start at the bottom. A half hour old report at the top is often of a vandal that's stopped vandalising since the report, so there is no urgency. A report that has just been made in the last couple of minutes is probably a vandal that is still going and needs to be blocked quickly. If we've built up a backlog, it's often too late to do much with the ones at the top - priority should always go to where you can do most good. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 11:29, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Some folks like to warn with a test4 after a test3, some like to report after a test3. The little distinction I seem to remember from days of yore is that a test4 was most appropriate for use by an admin who could actually back up the threat with an actual immediate block, whereas test3 was most appropriate for a normal editor who needed admin intervention to enact a block. Of course, with the existence of <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, that old distinction is largely gone. Now, it's really up to the judgement of the editor whether to use test3 or test4, and likewise up to the admin whether to block after a test3 or require a test4 first; however, requiring a test4 after a post-test3-vandalism seems to have a slight whiff of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:instruction_creep">m:instruction creep</a> to it... --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 19:22, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That doesn't make sense. That user wasn't a vandal (not yet anyway), and I have reported other Users without that tag.

<dd>Well that is true. However it is the current practice to use {{<a href="../../../v/a/n/Template%7EVandal_ff98.html" title="Template:Vandal">vandal</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../i/p/v/Template%7EIPvandal_4f49.html" title="Template:IPvandal">IPvandal</a>}}. I think that only usernames you believe to be made in bath faith should be reported there. I have always questioned the title of the vandal templates myself as lacking the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> required for dealing with potential vandals. The short answer is yes use the {{<a href="../../../v/a/n/Template%7EVandal_ff98.html" title="Template:Vandal">vandal</a>}} template for offensive usernames if you don't want the bot to remove them. You may wish to bring this up on the AIV talk page, I will certainly participate. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 19:48, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I moved this here because there are some interesting points raised, and I would like more opinions. The user in question, User:Igotfuckedbyman, while having an offensive name was not vandalizing.

<dd>Interesting...I think a new template would be a good idea: one for Usernames.

<dd>(edit conflict) Potentially offensive usernames usually require some more thought than a simple vandalism-examination.

<li>I think that reporting offensive Usernames should remain with WP: AIV, after all, only Administrators can block. All we need to do is create a new template for Usernames to be reported here. The User I reported wasn't a vandal, it just had an offensive Username.

<p>All I have to say about this is, why? {{<a href="../../../v/a/n/Template%7EVandal_ff98.html" title="Template:Vandal">vandal</a>}} is too offensive for a {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsername_3cbf.html" title="Template:Username">username</a>}} block now? If the username is offensive, then it gets blocked, and this is the place to put it.

Asking people to use a new template because someone finds {{<a href="../../../v/a/n/Template%7EVandal_ff98.html" title="Template:Vandal">vandal</a>}} offensive is introducing bureaucratic for the sake of bureaucratic.

<p>I've reported several vandals here, but not one has been blocked.

In one instance, the user had vandalized six times after his most recent warning, all within 25 minutes after the warning. This IP had ten warnings on his talk page, five of which were "final". But the user was not blocked because he had not vandalized within the past nine hours. What if the user had to go to work? What if the user went to bed? He'll just come back and vandalize again, and we are not sending a good message by adding repeated "final" warnings and not following through.</p>

<dd>Ben Aveling pretty much covered it, but I'd like to add that it is a timing issue with the report. The guideline is that you need to report them "soon" after they vandalize, generally meaning sometime within the last hour. It's not just when they vandalize past the last warning, but how long ago was it. If it has been hours since the last edit, admins will often delete the report as the assumption is that the vandal has stopped. Not always though. There are some cases were the IP will be blocked no matter what the time, but those are special cases like spambots. -- <a href="../../../g/o/g/User%7EGogo_Dodo_6e56.html" title="User:Gogo Dodo">Gogo Dodo</a> 06:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll echo Ben and Gogo. And I also want to add that we generally assume that an account is shared unless the IP is editing the same articles day after day. Shared means that many people (sometimes thousands) share an IP. So a user vandalizing at 2 pm and one at 3 pm on the same day are often different people. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 06:51, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to repeat Woohookitty: <b>always</b> assume an IP address is shared unless you have a specific reason to assume otherwise. The most likely reason is that they always vandalise the same, or related pages, or they always do the same thing to those pages (and something more distinctive than just blanking). Just because there are no useful edits doesn't mean it's not shared, it just means it's not shared with anyone that has edited wikipedia in the past - they may well edit in the future, and blocking the address would stop them. Blocks are not used to punish, but to prevent. If you don't have good reason to believe they will vandalise in the next 24 hours, then a 24 hour block is pointless (same applies to blocks of other lengths, although IP addresses should only be blocked for more than a couple of days in exceptional circumstances (eg. schools), or if the IP addresses is definitely not shared.) --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 18:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">vandalproof and autoreporting</span></h2>
<p>Hi. I left a note on a user's talk page asking her please to report IPvandals using {{IPVandal|xx.xx.xx.xx}} and logged-in user vandals with {{vandal|Username}}. (BTW, the commented instructions for that at the top of the main AIV page seem to be incomplete now.) The user told me that she uses vandalproof, which does the reporting automatically. But it reports IP users with the vandal template. We are curious whether it matters to admins. If so, what's the best course of action? I suppose one could just stop by AIV and minor edit the entries, but a revision to vandalproof sounds as if it might be a better option. Thanks for your input. <a href="../../../m/k/o/User%7EMKoltnow_7f00.html" title="User:MKoltnow">MKoltnow</a> 17:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right now, the main thing it affects is the AIV bot that incorrectly reports remaining items in the list, divided by IPs and users, because it uses the IPVandal and vandal templates to identify the users in the list. In addition, IPVandal has useful links (such as WHOIS). Therefore, I think it would be much better if you could incorporate both templates in the reporting. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 18:22, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please could it be clarified what is the general consensus regarding reporting vandals to AIV if they have returned from a block, but not been issued with another warning since that time. Naturally the user page will show at least one final warning prior to the block; is another 'final' waning necessary before they are reported again?

<dd>It depends how soon after the block expires they come back. If it is within a day for a short block, or a few days for a longer one, then just report them straight away. Otherwise, go through the usual steps (although, you can probably start with {{<a href="../../../b/v/_/Template%7EBv_74e1.html" title="Template:Bv">bv</a>}}). --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 13:32, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It also depends on the nature of the IP. If it's a dynamic IP from an ISP, I tend to start anew (except that, depending on the nature of the IP, I might now use bv or test2 instead of test1). If it's a school IP with a long history of vandalism, I tend to be a lot less patient, and either issue an immediate bv or block them for a long time (thank goodness for the AO flag!). I think in the majority of cases, I would issue a bv and wait for more vandalism. I tend to err on the side of caution when it comes to IP addresses for fear of hitting a bystander, but if once I'm reasonably certain the vandal is active and the IP address has a long history of vandalism, I tend to hit for longer, due to the AO flag. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 14:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Argh...

<dd>I've also noticed a lack of knowledge about the new user templates. And I have a minor related gripe. When I patrol recent changes, I revert the vandalism, then I go to the (ab)user's talk page to leave an appropriate note. I am somewhat annoyed to find someone has already left a note--and not necessarily the one I would have chosen. I don't want to step on another editor's toes, but I find it a bit rude. I typically like to use progressive warnings, as this thread suggests. I have been amazed at the number of times even a blatant vandal responds to uw-vandalism3 or something before the need to send it to AIV. So many editors <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume bad faith</a> even before I would, and I'm incredibly cynical! I think a lot of vandals have no idea that their edits are trackable, so they think they can vandalise at will. Once they find out that a) someone is watching, and b) their changes have already been reverted, I think a lot of them just feel it's not worth the trouble. Others continue and end up blocked. I better get off my soapbox now, my legs are getting sore. <a href="../../../m/k/o/User%7EMKoltnow_7f00.html" title="User:MKoltnow">MKoltnow</a> 05:48, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>On the other hand, there are many who simply revert vandalism without giving a warning.

<p>I normally try to use the "bump 'em up" strategy myself. Some problems as listed below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bots rarely follow the scheme or check existing warning that I saw. When the do number their warnings, those numbers have little to do with our numbers.</li>
<li>Some users write warnings by hand and skip the numbers.</li>
<li>Sometimes, especially with suspected socks/open proxies, I have to start out at a higher number. This might be {{<a href="../../../u/w/-/Template%7EUw-vandalism4im_4977.html" title="Template:Uw-vandalism4im">uw-vandalism4im</a>}} for a vandal that has been really persistent.</li>
<li>The user I most recently listed at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, who was blocked btw, was very insulting to me and others. He had just left a personal attack on my talk page. I deleted it and <b>then</b> issued a final warning. In just a few minutes, the personal attack was back. So that was when I listed the user (who signed in) at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. Within a few minutes, the user was blocked.</li>

<p>If the problem with users reporting on AIV and issuing a final warning at the same time is that VandalProof and other tools allow it, perhaps VandalProof should disable issuing a bv/test3/test4 with reporting to AIV simultaneously. It wastes our time to check and remove warnings when the IP hadn't yet vandalised past a bv/test3/test4. Maybe VandalProof should have a big flashing window saying <b>Hey, did you first check to see if the user vandalised AFTER you sent your final warning?</b> These "easy-to-use" tools might save the vandal reporter some valuable seconds, but it sure wastes a lot of the janitors' times... --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 14:59, 30 January 2007 (UTC) P.S. Or maybe <b>we</b> need a tool (call it "VandalProofProof") that allows us to send a message to the reporting user when we remove a report because the vandal hasn't vandalised past a bv/test3/test4. Either way, I guess since there are enough admins on AIV that I can afford to take a bit of extra time to manually start educating some of our hard-working AIV reporters. It's not their fault that VandalProof has that option. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 15:07, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hang on, VP's "revert &amp; send warning mesage" and "report to AIV" are different operations.

<p>The problem is, the people reporting to AIV are doing a much needed, tedious and often thankless task.

<dd>precisely. I frequently come on AIV with a 8-10 IP backlog. It's somewhat ridiculous to run through the list and manually inspect whether each and every IP has been properly warned.

<dd>Yes, I do, after looking at their contributions. I can see whether or not they have been warned when I post the block message on their page. The block can then be adjusted or removed if sufficient warnings are not present. If someone is in the process of vandalizing wikipedia, it doesn't make sense to first spend time investigating whether procedural steps have been followed. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 05:15, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Surely you have to load the talk page in order to edit it, so why not load it and check for warnings before you block, and then add the block notice? It takes a few seconds longer to actually read the page and saves you incorrectly blocking and having to unblock, which takes much longer. You really shouldn't be blocking people that haven't been warned. Also, if you're not reading the talk page first, you won't know if the IP is a school, for example, which would require a different kind of block. You'll also have no idea how long to block for. You really need to read the talk page in order to have any idea what actions needs to be taken. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 13:28, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>School blocks can be tweaked after reading the talk page. It's usually fairly obvious whether or not a user has been warned or not. When there is some doubt (such as no recent vandalism), I don't hesitate to check their talk page. Schools don't receive a separate type of block. I block every IP as anon-only with account creation blocked. As for block length: it's almost always obvious from the bottom of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockIP_8afa.html" title="Special:BlockIP">Special:BlockIP</a>.

<dd>I am assuming good faith on the part of vandal fighters, and I'm not belittling their work. That's why I'm not admonishing them. Assuming good faith also means assuming that if you tell them about the right course of action, they will do it. I let a few people know, quite nicely (I think), that I removed reports because the IP hadn't edited after the final warning.

<li>I may be one of those who listed a "final warning" on a user talk page, and then listed the IP at AIV. The IP I noticed is this: <a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168.8.148.20.html" title="User talk:168.8.148.20">168.8.148.20</a>. The AIV request was rejected since the IP had not vandalized within 12 hours (or 20 hours; I cannot remember). Perhaps a quick clarification of the time frame you expect for <b>now</b> in <i>"the vandal is active now"</i> guideline to editors would help. To me, the number of block warnings received by this IP, the pattern that when a block expires, the vandalism continues, and the fact that the IP vandalized within the last 24 hours feels like "now" to me. Please advise where this should have been reported so it would receive proper attention. It's not checkuser, since we apparently already know "who" it is (University System of Georgia).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Who tells the vandal that he has been blocked and why</span></h2>
<p>I have noticed that occasionally a vandal is blocked without any message telling him that he has been blocked. More often, he is told, but the specific act of vandalism (after the fourth warning) which justified the block is not described. In a few instances, I have said something like "I am requesting that you be blocked for vandalizing <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion.html" title="Newton's laws of motion">Newton's laws of motion</a> on 5 February 2008." before reporting him. However, I do not like to do this because if the administrator does not actually block him it would undermine confidence in the system, while the administrator might feel that I am forcing his hand for the same reason. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 07:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't recommend that you tell the vandal you are going to report him for two reasons: The first is the reason you state. And the second is that it could be read as a taunt and might prompt them vandalize even more before they get blocked. I recommend issuing the final warning and if the vandal keeps going, just report him to AIV without leaving another note. Let the blocking admin notify the vandal that he has been blocked. Most of the time an admin will notify the vandal of the block, but sometimes admins won't. I won't if I know that the vandal is unlikely to read it or I know that the vandal doesn't care. For example, I won't notify spambots that they're blocked because I know that there isn't a person reading the warnings. -- <a href="../../../g/o/g/User%7EGogo_Dodo_6e56.html" title="User:Gogo Dodo">Gogo Dodo</a> 07:49, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think it helps to notify the IP that they're blocked not just for the people behind the IP, but for other Wikipedians who check the IP talk page before issuing another warning or block. Seeing a fairly recent block notice usually means I'll issue a bv rather than a test1. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 15:09, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Generally I leave a message notifying of the block, and I try to include the duration of the block. I agree this is helpful to vandalism moppers, both regular and sysop, and a final courtesy to the vandal (perhaps a demonstration of class will rub off on one of them someday).</dd>
<dd>The <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">blocking policy</a> states, "Users should be notified of blocks on their talk pages.

Although this is from an official policy page, that line is worded in such a way that I would consider it a guideline, i.e. not mandatory, at the blocking admin's discretion. --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_66a1.html" title="User:Ginkgo100">Ginkgo100</a><sup><a href="../../../g/i/n/User_talk%7EGinkgo100_02a2.html" title="User talk:Ginkgo100"><i>talk</i></a></sup> 20:48, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not so sure about the length of the block. Knowing exactly how long a block is for would be quite useful for the semi-casual vandal to simply come back and vandalise right after the block expires. OTOH, for the rest of us, it's quite easy to see how long a blockw as for, including the block logs and the "block user" page. This is, by no means, a certain thing, as it's quite common to post block durations.

<dd>Yes, I really don't like that template. I've been thinking of removing it outright from IP talk pages because it gives vandal reporters the wrong impression (and might be the reason for the whole slate of immediate AIV reports I've been seeing lately). It was likely created back when we didn't really have a way of dealing with IPs with a long history of vandalism. Now that we have the AO-only flag, there's no real need for a template advocating a block without warning. For example, I simply AO-block school IPs for a very long time if they have a long history of vandalism. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 14:12, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a good edit summary. Putting the list size info at the beginning has the advantages of being visible even when the edit summary is truncated and making it easy to scan with human eyes because it's at a fairly consistent spot in the history. Redvers's allcaps suggestion is a good one, I tend to put "LIST EMPTY" or "NOT EMPTY" in allcaps when I manually edit AIV anyways. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 20:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Level 3 and bv warnings are also fine, since they also menion the possibility of a block. Perhaps use "final warning" and give examples of a final warning in the template (anything that mentions the possibility of a block could be construed as a "final warning").

<dd>I very much disagree and would be in favor of using this template <i>extremely</i> sparingly, if not deleting it outright. It's similar to the reason that the Personal Attack Noticeboard had problems with just tagging a {{npa}}, as such a template would be more likely to inflame passions than anything. If you want to make people who report vandalism - who are often currently pissed off at having an article they watch vandalized - feel like they get in trouble for it since <i>they</i> get a stern warning as a result, this is the way to do it. It's patronizing and aggravating. I'm not saying that submitters of invalid reports shouldn't be told why a reported user couldn't be blocked, but that can be done in a personal message, not a warning template. I forget where it is, but there's an essay/guideline somewhere in the WP namespace explicitly suggesting that established users not have templates thrown at them, in general. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 18:03, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting reaction. Personally I am someone who reports here every now and then when I find vandalism on my watch pages - neither an admin nor a vandal patroller or whatever you call it. Most of the time, it is very hard to find out what happended to your report without wading through the huge history. I created the template because I personally would like feedback - including thank you where people <b>have</b> used the template correctly, and a nudge where they haven't. You're absolutely right that it should be done in a way that is extremely gentle and encourages people to continue reporting to AIV - hence why it starts with the words "Thank you". I'll try and reword the template to make sure the message is a positive one overall. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewRT_eb6f.html" title="User:AndrewRT">AndrewRT</a>(<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrewRT_58ab.html" title="User talk:AndrewRT">Talk</a>) 22:18, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. Well, as I note below, if this template makes interaction with invalid report submitters more common, then great. It just strikes me that the current template is, if anything, over-complete. To put things another way: people can be rankled when told things that (they think) they already know. This template works fine for a first-time submitter perhaps to explain the whole process; however, I don't think it works when the submitter knows the process- or at least part of the process- and the problem was elsewhere. For example, say there's an IP address that vandalized a lot 6 months ago, got the final warning sticker, then went silent. Then it makes a new piece of minor vandalism, and someone submits it to AIV due to the 6-month old final warning template already being there. In this case, the admin may be within their rights to not block and simply add another warning template; if that is done, the use of InvalidAIV is likely to rankle. A short, tailored message explaining the thought process would be far better. To put things another way, you could divide invalid AIV reports into two categories: "user knows the rules but is expecting an exception / misunderstands the facts of the case" and "user does not know the rules." The template <i>may</i> be appropriate for the latter case (generally for non-odious vandalism), but it is not appropriate for the former case. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 00:41, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to emphasise this point. I've made probably a dozen reports here and I have <b>never</b> had any feedback from any admins and <b>never</b> found out what happened to the report - if the user was blocked or the report rejected for whatever reason. It's not about admins being busy, feedback is something that simply never happens - and partly because it isn't proceduralised via templates and (eventually I hope) bots.

<p>Question: Where, exactly, is the guideline that Administrators shouldn't block until a "final warning" is received? I was going to edit the InvalidAIV template myself, but when I checked the claimed cite for that fact, it wasn't there. Neither <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> nor <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a> mention it. I mean, yes, it's mentioned on the template on top of this page and at <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleaning_up_vandalism_4314.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleaning up vandalism">Wikipedia:Cleaning up vandalism</a>, but those aren't policy pages.</p>
<p>Speaking of the header template on top of this page, I see that it has changed. While I completely agree with Theresa Knott that instruction creep should be avoided, and I also agree that it's a good idea to add a general clause like "unusual circumstances" for blocking sans warnings, it might not be bad to provide at least one example for just how unusual the circumstances are, like was done before (vandalbots, etc.). <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 06:11, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a converse problem to that pointed out in section 6 (above), I have seen many incidents where (a) the proper warning templates have not been used, (b) where multiple acts of vandalism have resuloted in just one warning being issued, which compounds, (c) a lack of reporting on the page here when a final warning stage has been passed.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Not sure where to get help on this one</span></h2>
<p>Hi all, there is something of an edit war going on in the Bloodless Bullfighting article between <a href="../../../p/e/b/User%7EPebs96_42e0.html" title="User:Pebs96">User:Pebs96</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFethers_68c9.html" title="User:Fethers">User:Fethers</a>. Fethers just blanked and redirected the entire page. Pebs96 wants help. I reverted to the last complete version prior to the last round of edit warring. The article itself has a lot of POV and style problems, but also a very dedicated and passionate editor working on it. I am not an admin, I do not want to be dragged into this. But I don't know who can go over there and knock heads together. So if this can direct an admin to look into it, or if you can suggest some appropriate things I can do to help, let me know. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 01:40, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the heads up that you were going to AIAV over this instead of just dropping me a line on my talk page. I don't see anywhere that Pebs96 (AKA Webmistress Dive) has asked for help; I'm pretty surprised, because that article started as an opportunity for her to promote her business. In addition, she started articles on a myriad of people whose promotion she is directly tied to. As an example, take a look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Vitor_Ribeiro_%28bullfighter%29_5a83.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Vitor Ribeiro (bullfighter)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Vitor Ribeiro (bullfighter)</a> and the linked AfDs. Her first edits to User Talk pages were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SCEhardt&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32041836" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SCEhardt&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32041836" rel="nofollow">pointed statements</a> regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jredmond&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32052013" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jredmond&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32052013" rel="nofollow">removing her self-promotion</a>. Helpfully, she has also archived <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pebs96/Archive-original" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pebs96/Archive-original" rel="nofollow">her previous warnings</a> regarding such things. The sole, somewhat referenced portion of Bloodless bullfighting was the history section, which I merged to the extant section in <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullfighting.html" title="Bullfighting">Bullfighting</a> and redirected at the original source per the GFDL. This is less an edit war than it is just long-necessary cleanup of a self-promotional, unreferenced article. <a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFethers_68c9.html" title="User:Fethers">fethers</a> 02:04, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, it's really exhausting reading Fethers go on and on about how this person seems to think that my purpose on Wikipedia is about "self-promotion". Just an FYI, my business is in graphics and web design.... which I don't see how it is related to Bloodless Bullfighting. I just happen to be "passionate" about the art of bloodless bullfighting. Secondly, this "myriad" of people Fethers talk about... who are they? Bullfighters? These are very well known Rejoneadores/Cavaleiros (mounted bullfighters) and they have fought in California, which is tied into the the art of bloodless bullfights in California. Thirdly, I am an "amateur" on Wikipedia and with that, I noticed that people have archived their long drawn out pages.... which is very legitimate to do. Archiving text does not equate to hiding stuff. Archiving is simply putting away old stuff and it also allows a person to read current updates. All I did was put aside the clutter and created a link to where anyone can read it easily. And why would Fethers be so concerned with me "archiving" my stuff, when Fethers has completely removed all dialogue from last year and noted to just view history. That in itself is hiding something...&gt;&gt;see this&gt;&gt;&gt;(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fethers&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=87629130" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fethers&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=87629130" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fethers&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=87629130</a>) And yes, Fethers hid the part where he told me to "stuff it". Around December 20th, 2006, Fethers had all of my images removed without giving me the "PROPER" notification. The images were never flagged, because if they were, it would have given me ample time to remedy any problems it may have had. The following also had some vindictive issues towards me because they only attacked the articles (relating to bloodless bullfighting) that I had contributed to at the time.

This Fethers person could easily be any one of those listed above, but just happens to have a new user name OR can be a friend of theirs.

<dd>One must really have the time and energy to review all of this madness as I have.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I created the bloodless bullfighting article and separated it from the bullfighting article because it deserved it's own file. California "bloodless bullfighting" involves the bulls NOT getting killed in or outside of the arena. Bullfighting (Spanish style) involves the killing of the bull. Even though the bull is not killed in Portugal, blood is still drawn to slow the bull down. And those two are the simplest reasons why the "bloodless bullfighting" article was created. It should not be mixed up with either NOR should it be redirected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, since when did Wikipedia put a "timeframe" of when an article has to be completed? I don't remember seeing a deadline anywhere. Like I said, I am an amateur at all this and getting a "reference" on this particular article will take a while to do. So again.... PLEASE get this Fethers person off my back once and for all because for me to have to write this is so unnecessary and is also creating undue stress to my current disability. Fethers' actions are deemed as harrassment and causing nothing more than harm.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is now 3:20am, it has taken me more than an hour to just write this. Is it justifiable? No!!! I should be sleeping or doing something more constructive.... but instead, I am having to defend myself and an article I created, all because this Fethers' person feels the need to cause misery.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removing section header</span></h2>
<p>El_C wants to remove the section headers <b>Bot-reported</b> and <b>User-reported</b>. I think they should stay because it provides a direct link to the two sections. Without it there is no fast link to the bot report page, and all the reports are lumped together. I don't see the advantage to this change. He has made the suggestion that all bots bold their report, and that a separate link be made. I don't see how this does anything but make it more complicated for people trying to serve these reports to recognize and reach them. The current system makes it clear which is a bot and which is not, and when you click the edit button on the section heading you don't end up editing the whole page which is nice. Also, with the new idea all the bots need to be changed to bold their entries. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 14:44, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The edit to the header indicates to me that El_C thought/thinks that the "Bot-reported" section (/TB2) is for reporting bots that are vandalizing/misbehaving. In fact, /TB2 is for bots, which monitor for and detect vandalism (such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntiVandalBot_aa84.html" title="User:AntiVandalBot">AntiVandalBot</a>, when it's running, <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowbot_64a7.html" title="User:Shadowbot">Shadowbot</a>, and <a href="../../../v/o/a/User%7EVoABot_II_04bf.html" title="User:VoABot II">VoABot II</a>), to report persistent vandals that they have detected, just as humans report on the main <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> page. Or, I could be entirely wrong, and there's something else that El_C thinks is inefficient about the page's structure, in which case, I'd agree with HighInBC, I'm all for improving it, if we can get a clear idea about what's inefficient. —<a href="../../../k/r/e/User%7EKrellis_efff.html" title="User:Krellis">Krellis</a> 17:30, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I never really understood why we need a separate section for bot-reported vandalism anyway. What difference does it make where the report comes from?

<dd>Bot reports need to be handled slightly differently, as the warnings the bots give don't follow quite the same structure as the warnings humans give.

<dd>Editors have less time to contribute to Wikipedia when so much effort is consumed with deleting 'Jimmy Jones is GAY!!!' messages and the like. It shouldn't take twenty such edits to receive a short block which is itself a very limited sanction. The work involved in adding the correct template is significant for most editors who are not using anti-vandal tools so most reverts are carried out without the appropriate warning messages being added. It would be nice if the edit screen had a tick box to indicate that an edit was a vandalism reversion. In that way, the system could add appropriate messages and autoblock users following an agreed number of vandalism edits. Unfair blocks could be challenged and inappropriate use of the vandalism flag would result in the reporting editor being blocked. Comments? Curtains99 12:38, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a pretty evident message here in the way that the system is heavily weighted towards the vandal. Because we contribute, our goodwill can be taken for granted. Our interests count for little. We are supposed to give freely of our time, tolerate the witless, the crass and the puerile, and even to clean up after them on the remote chance that someday one of them just might have something of value to contribute - which has a probability of the same order as that of seeing a flying pig. Every now and again, I make two mistakes: firstly that of caring about it, and secondly that of thinking that someone who might be able to do something might actually give a damn. I'm beginning to learn, though. After all: if Jimbo Wales doesn't care that Wikipedia has become a cretin's playground, why should anyone else? --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Burnett_2542.html" title="User:Stephen Burnett">Stephen Burnett</a> 13:57, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The key piece of data that is missing here is whether a given IP address is dynamic or static. Static IP addresses (those that are permanently assigned to a given individual or organization) ought to be blocked much faster than they are today; we give them a lot of leeway because unless someone is willing to actually look up who the address belongs to (do a <i>reverse DNS</i>), we can't be certain they're not a dynamic IP address that do deserve a certain amount of leeway.</dd>

<dd>But some of the worst are those IP's which are static, which have been traced and which belong to schools. The kids know the "rules" as well as we do. They take it to the edge so they get a final warning and then back off, knowing that editors have to go through the whole cycle again. Nobody here is stupid, and it should be obvious to anyone with the most casual experience of child-rearing or education what the result is when they get a long string of "final warnings", none of which are acted upon. Unfortunately what we seem to have is a victory for dogma and ideology over basic common sense. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Burnett_2542.html" title="User:Stephen Burnett">Stephen Burnett</a> 14:23, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For schools that are marked on the talk pages as schools, I try to apply a simple heuristic: If it's a sudden spate of vandalism from a school that has made some worthwhile contributions in the past, I issue a short block, often for as few as three hours, usually with the block reason of "Go back to class". But if the school has produced constant vandalism far out of proportion to their useful edits, or if the first few edits coming back from a block are obvious vandalism, I issue ever-longer blocks. Occasionally, at this point in the year, I'm even willing to block them until the end of the current term.</dd>

<dd>Not true. Vandalism is not getting worse at all in my experience. In fact it is now easier to deal with vandalism than it ever was. People generally choose to spend thier time dealing with vandalism. If you choose to do this then obviously you see a lot of vandalism. If you feel that dealing with vandalism is a waste of your time then the answer is obvious - simply stop. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 14:14, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I must confess that I kind of got sucked into it. At first it was because they crapped on stuff I actually contributed. Then it was "hmmm, I wonder what else they've done"? But by definition, there is never any end to fighting vandals - partly because there are so many, but largely due to the way they are tolerated and even encouraged here. I definitely agree that contributing is more satisfying, and its high time I went back to it - but the very strong message from all this is that Wikipedia doesn't think enough of my efforts and those of people like me to put in place some basic protection on what we do. That is, to say the least, discouraging. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Burnett_2542.html" title="User:Stephen Burnett">Stephen Burnett</a> 15:04, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Such admins do not exist. Admins are trying to do what is best for wikipedia, sometimes that means blocking an IP and sometimes that means not blocking one. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 14:45, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's really not that hard to get someone blocked. It seems to me that the biggest problem, at least as far as AIV, is that vandal fighters aren't doing their job. Don't waste our time by reporting an IP that hasn't edited since the last warning, or that hasn't been warned in days. Stop posting "final warning" templates the first time a user makes a mistake. Abuse of the bv template and improper AIV reporting just leads to frustration for everybody. Do what you're supposed to do, issue the appropriate warnings (<i>every</i> time you revert vandalism), go through the proper steps, and vandals <i>will</i> get blocked. It's no more difficult now than it was when I started here. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 14:36, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my prolific experiences as a vandal fighter. Many vandals think that they are getting away with it. When that yellow box pops up, a majority of all vandals i have warned stop. It is the ones that continue after the warning that are the danger to wikipedia. Many of these are school kids, afraid they will get in trouble. That is why a {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">Test</a>}} warning actually works in my experience. It is the ones that push the limits, who vandalize after the warnings that need to be reported. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 15:07, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Chris is right.

The IP vandalized one article in a relatively minor way. Immediately, an editor issued a "blatant vandal" warning - the only warning issued in almost a week - <i>and</i>, if that wasn't enough of an overreaction, didn't even wait for another edit from the IP before reporting it at AIV. So <i>one</i> kid made <i>one</i> edit to <i>one</i> article, and we're supposed to block the school for that? No. Reporting like that just wastes everyone's time, because the responding admin has to double check all these reports intead of just trusting that they were done properly. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 15:29, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a good illustration of the point I made earlier - one which you are apparently determined to ignore. After the so-called "final warning", which of course was not final at all, nothing happened for a week. The kids know the game - because they're dealing with an entity which has a limited memory, all they have to do is wait a few days for the slate to be wiped clean. Then the whole cycle starts again, until it goes right up to another "final warning". Is it so inexplicable, or even surprising, that an editor gets frustrated at having *his* time wasted, and over-reacts? --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Burnett_2542.html" title="User:Stephen Burnett">Stephen Burnett</a> 17:52, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How do you know it's the same kid? Or that they even saw the warning? When someone posts a message to you, it only says "you have new messages" until you look at your talk page. So if someone other than the vandal looked at the warning, the vandal might never even notice it.</dd>
<dd>What you seem to misunderstand is that blocking is not supposed to be used as a punishment; it's supposed to be used to stop active disruption. If the vandals aren't active, they don't need to be stopped.</dd>
<dd>Admins aren't robots; we can use common sense just as well as you can. If I see that edits appear to be from the same person, I won't require the full set of blocks every time. I spent a long time in your position, so I know how frustrating it can be. But I also found that following the rules gets much better results than complaining about them or trying to get around them. I don't let vandals game the system, but I don't let vandal fighters game the system, either. The rules are there for a reason. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 17:59, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It doesn't have to be the same kid. One game that seems pretty popular, for instance, is for several kids to use a page to pass messages / insults / whatever to each other. When the "final warning" goes up, they all know the fun's over for a while; then it starts again. As for the rules - the reason they are there is to support someone's conviction that the world works in a certain way, because he thinks it ought to. As I said: a victory of ideology over common sense. Frustrating? Damn right - but not any more. Someone else can do my share. Or not.

<dd>While that may not be what wikipedia is for (passing messages and such), that could be the gateway for just one of those kids to get interested in contributing. I always look at vandalism as something that can be removed. Losing a possible contributor because of a block cant be, "reverted". We can argue about this all day, but I think the blocking policy was fairly well desgined to protect this. What is wikipedia? the enclylopedia that anybody can edit. By blocking anons punitivly, we take that right away from the next person who may be here for good. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 18:18, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>←I think in the end, as stated by Theresa below, just not getting emotionally involved is the best way to do it. I dont profile specific ip address, i profile vandalism. When I find vandalism, i go to warn. I check, has there been a recent warning? if not, i give one. if so, i either escalate or report. After that, i forget that vandal and move on to the next. As stated by kafziel above, how do i know the same kid is vandalizing? chances are its not in many cases, especially the school. Sure, a block of an entire school will fix the vandalism problem (which can generally be fixed with a quick revert from the large rc patrol team we have) but may block a truly interested editor. One student, sees a problem with a page and goes to fix it just to find that they are blocked. the frustrated student gives up and we lost a potential long term contributor. We cant fix that with a quick revert from the army of rc patrollers.<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 18:06, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm relatively new here, and have been trying to fight off the vandals. I can't believe Wikipedia has such a cumbersome vandal warning system that is heavily tilted in favor of those who only want to disrupt, and the jumping through hoops that have to be done by responsible people to report vandalism. What a colossal waste of time for people who would rather do some worthwhile editing.

<dd>The vandalism patrol is not as effective as it gives itself credit for. Example: <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_of_Appalachia_6cae.html" title="Museum of Appalachia">Museum of Appalachia</a> was the victim of four separate vandalism incidents during the period November 6 to December 7. The second of the four bogus changes was quickly reverted, but the other three bogus changes remained until I found them earlier today. All of the vandals appear to be vandalism-only accounts (one of which has been blocked repeatedly). Yes, high-profile articles are regularly patrolled and the most blatant types of vandalism are detected effectively, but bored 12-year-olds sitting in their middle-school study halls can do a lot of damage to contents of lower-profile articles without being noticed. It seems to me that there are many IPs on which permanent blocks would do far more good than harm.--<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 20:20, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I get frustrated as hell too, but we just have to learn to live with it. Community policy is <b>not</b> going to change. The view of the <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">powers-that-be</a> is that the principle of open participation outweighs almost all else. That's true even if the resulting tolerance of vandalism makes constructive contributors give up in despair -- one wonders about the implications of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> here.

<dd>We don't have to "learn to live with it"; we could always change our policies to make a different tradeoff on the accept-vandalism vs. suck in new contributors spectrum. I note that <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a> has taken two steps we've been reluctant to take: They <b>DON'T</b> allow any anonymous editing and they have a <b>one strike policy</b> on vandals. It will be interesting to see how they evolve versus Wikipedia. People have waxed poetic above about how vandals might quickly convert themselves into being useful contributors; I think that's true in a few cases, but in the vast majority of cases, only age and maturity will have any chance of turning a vandal into a productive contributor. And in many cases, nothing will help; the vandal is already as mature as they're going to get and will always remain a vandal.</dd>

<dd>Well, there are several things you are not taking into account. Anon IP's can be used by hundreds or thousands of editors. I am ok with a 1 or 2 strike policy for named editors but anons i cant agree with that because the way it works with named editors is very very very different from anon ip's. Sure, the vandals may not mature but, but, if they are at school, the kdi next to them might feel bad and want to fix the mistake. An 1 strike block could prevent large nubmers of anon editors from contributing. I will be the first to argue that I dont think vandals are going to change there minds. And yes, those repetititve vandals, who push ths limits, vandalize after warnings, should be blocked to prevent current ongoing damage to wikipedia. However, a very very very large number of vandals stop (at least for me) after a friendly test1 warning. They have no idea that what they see is what everybody can see. They may think it is there own personal copy for them to do with what they please. It is only vandals who blatantly continue their vandalism after a final warning which should be temporarily blocked (i.1. less than 48 hours)<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 14:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Clearly, I understand the difference between dynamic IPs and static IPs. We should make an effort, through software, to automatically identify and tag (<a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverse_DNS_32bb.html" title="Reverse DNS">reverse DNS</a>) <b>every</b> static IP and we should then treat these static IPs exactly as we treat named users. We should also "rate limit" dynamic IPs so that they can't make more than, say, 10 edits per week, encouraging the dynamic IP user with every edit to register a username. And we should get a lot less tolerant of vandalism from all sources.</dd>

What I'm looking for is feedback on a slightly modified version of the instructions that I have come up with to use when this function is approved and goes live.

To prevent vandals from being able to force the bots to place arbitrary text on the page, these instructions will need to be protected before we go live, so I felt it best to get consensus on them before that time.

This IP address has been blocked three times, the last Feb. 16. The address was responsible for three clear vandal edits last night. I just noticed them this morning, but my report was dismissed because there was no "recent notice." The reason that I feel this incident should trigger a review of policy is one of the acts of vandalism I fixed today from this IP had gone undetected since Feb. 13. It involved changing dates and numbers in an article <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vega_program.html" title="Vega program">Vega program</a> and could easily mislead a reader. I came upon it reading the article, not by following a vandalism trail. Other readers might not have picked up on the minor inconsistency I noticed. If we keep giving someone with a clear pattern of vandalism the benefit of the doubt, sooner or later they will cause undetected damage. Vandalizing after blocks should result in a longer block without the need for additional warning, in my opinion. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 02:58, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We don't block IP addresses without warning because the person using any specific IP address can change. If there's a similar pattern that makes it clear the IP is static rather than dynamic, then we usually block for steadily increasing periods of time, but still only after warning unless the abuse coming from the IP is long-term and then there's usually a talk page message indicating that the IP may be blocked without warning.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 10:33, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removing stale reports</span></h2>
<p>Where an IP is reported and it has clearly become stale e.g. over an hour has ellapsed without further vandalism, is it acceptable for non-admins to remove to remove such reports. I just did so a minute ago, but it occurs to me that maybe I shouldn't have. What do people think? <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 11:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>See the discussion above. I think the idea that a report becomes stale in an hour is ridiculous. If you really believed that, then you'd never block for more than an hour. If it's acceptable to block an IP for a day, then a report can't become stale in less than a day. By refusing to act on a report, after editors have gone through the trouble of issuing repeated warnings, and have issued a final warning which has been ignored, you're telling those editors not to bother any more. And you're telling the vandals that a "final warning" just means "take an hour's break and you'll be fine". -- <a href="../../../z/s/e/User%7EZsero_14cb.html" title="User:Zsero">Zsero</a> 14:36, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am a little reulctant. What definenes stale? Sure a vandal may have been reported to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> for over an hour but maybye they are still vandalising? A quick check on the contribs could do that (which I am sure most admin do anyways before blocking). The question is, what defines stale? I think time, in and of itself, is an innapropriate measure for this. It should be directly based on how long it has been since they have edited since the last warning. Now, if there is a time limit when, after last warning there is no activity, i would not have a problem with non admins possibly removing it. I however think it opens the doors for people possibly removing reports of themselves and it not being checked. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 15:13, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Is there any statistical validation for the frequent statements that if an IP has not vandalized in the past hour it is unlikely to vandalize again in the next twenty-four hours? What are the reliable sources for that belief? I bet that if you did a probability study you would find that if an IP address has had a vandalism incident within the past week, the probability that there will be another vandalism incident within the next week is elevated compared with a random IP. If that hypothesis is true, then failure to block IP addresses with vandalism in the past week can be shown statistically to increase the level of vandalism on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 18:09, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, yes, an IP that's being used to edit Wikipedia is more likely than a random IP that may not be used for anything at all. Schools are certainly more likely to vandalize than businesses (although businesses are more likely to spam). But there's no way to know that it's the same vandal as yesterday, or even an hour ago. High School classes change every 45 to 60 minutes, with a whole new crop of kids strolling into the computer lab or the study hall. They have no reason to see the warnings we gave to the last kids who were in there. We don't go so overboard as to wipe a school's slate clean after each hour, but wiping it clean every couple of days is perfectly reasonable. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 19:44, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>We don't go so overboard as to wipe a school's slate clean after each hour</i>. But that's exactly what you <i>do</i> - or at least, it's what admins such as <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> do, and it's precisely that behaviour that I'm complaining about. Removing a report because no vandalism has come from that IP for a whole hour means that the vandal has no reason at all to pay attention to warnings, no matter how dire or "final" they claim to be. He laughs at being reported to AIV, because he knows that the report will never be acted on, and that by the time he comes back for another round of vandalism it will have disappeared down the memory hole. If that's really going to be the policy around here, then the warning page should say that we should never give a "final warning" to an IP address, because it's likely to be meaningless. And if that's going to be the policy then IP addresses should never be blocked for more than an hour. <a href="../../../z/s/e/User%7EZsero_14cb.html" title="User:Zsero">Zsero</a> 20:26, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The issue I have with stale reports (i.e. reports more than 30 minutes old or so) is that most are from shared IPs where the person who was doing the vandalism is probably no longer at the computer anymore. If they <i>do</i> return, we can always block them then; it's not a huge deal. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 20:01, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unless it's truly a dynamic IP that changes frequently (like a dialup line), there is value in retaining the old reports since they help to establish a pattern. This is especially the case for schools. Yes, it's possible to go back through the Talk page history to look for old warnings but levels of vandalism often are so high that it's impractical to do so. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 23:20, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In that case, what's the point of giving a "final warning"? Earlier today I reported a vandal who'd vandalised past the final warning, and you deleted it with the note "remove IPs that haven't edited in the past hour". Doesn't that make a mockery of the "final warning"? Perhaps the warning should be changed to: "If you continue to vandalise Wikipedia you <b>will</b> be blocked (but only if you do it nonstop forever; if you take a break every so often then you're free to continue vandalising)."</dd>
<dd>Another thing: admins here seem to insist that warnings be given in strict order. But <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html" title="WP:Vandalism">WP:Vandalism</a> clearly says "There are several templates used to warn vandals. They are listed at right in order of severity, but need not be used in succession".

<dd>I am also feeling very frustrated by the lack of enforcement of what on the surface seem like clear warnings. Does final warning mean that, or not? Failure to enforce these rules wastes tremendous amounts of time by those who are disrupted. Is it more important to retain a vandal in hopes they will shape up, or retain a person who has made an effort to fight vandalism? <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 08:42, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) Effectively, what that means is that the vandal has already stopped on their own. A lot of IP addresses are shared (amazing how many vandal IP addresses trace back to schools...), and also may be dynamic. Generally, though, if I see an IP with a long page of warnings and blocks, they'll receive a BV or 4im warning rather than the usual 1 or 2 for the first go-round. If they stop after that, well, they only vandalized once, not much harm done. Blocks are intended to <i>prevent harm</i>, not <i>punish an offender</i>. If the harm's stopped on its own, a block would be punitive. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 08:54, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, but what if they <i>don't</i> stop? What if they continue vandalising, but they're not bots, they do have other things to do, so they only vandalise a few times a day? It's a hobby, not a profession. If the standard is that nothing will be done unless they've vandalised within the past hour, then why would they ever stop? You give them one warning, and then the next, and then the next, and finally you report them on AIV, and next thing you know the report is removed without action because they haven't vandalised for a whole hour! If that's going to happen, why should I bother warning them in the first place? Why bother reporting them, if nothing is going to happen, and why make a fool of myself by issuing a "final warning" when it's a paper tiger?</dd>
<dd>And don't tell me that "every blocking is judged on a case-by-case basis", when admins "remove IPs that haven't edited in the past hour".

<dd>What about the harm that is done to the solid users who are victimized by these vandals? In your calculus you must factor in the amount of time lost by many people. A vandal may make many edits on many pages before becoming bored. Then it may take much more time to unscramble it than it took to break it, particularly if the edits are not obvious. The total time lost to the community is <i>harm</i>. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 09:09, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bottom line: I think "active now" should mean that the account has been used to vandalise within the past week.

<dd>I think the past week would be very reasonable. As a non-admin I am trying to understand how a user with an account (not an IP user) could wind up with three active incident reports going simultaneously, making dozens of disruptive edits after final warnings within the past few days, and still be active "now" defined as within the past few hours? <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 09:22, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I completely agree with those who are frustrated at the ease at which repeat-offender vandals can do their dirty work here Wikipedia. Bending over backwards in their favor is doing harm to those who want Wikipedia to be a reliable source, and too many times I've seen this 'not recent enough activity' excuse come up for not doing a block. The vandals know exactly how to game this broken system. - <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsfullofstars_bea3.html" title="User:Itsfullofstars">Itsfullofstars</a> 09:29, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The statement "Blocks are intended to prevent harm, not punish an offender." makes a ridiculous distinction. Punishment IS intended to prevent harm by deterring bad behavior or disabling the perpetrator from repeating it. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 09:43, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Punishment does prevent harm, but it isn't the only way of preventing harm. Blocks prevent harm directly, they prevent harm by acting as a deterrent as well, but that's just a side effect, that's not the reason we block vandals. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 13:30, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Blame the ambiguity of 'very much','extreme' and the family of such words!Any way,active now just means the vandal will vandalise again... Of course,if a Vandal has so much free time to precisely mock the power of warnings by time and time again taking a weekly break of vandalising a page every time,it is reasonable to block due to the fact that if so and so person takes a week break after vandalising a page,he can continue freely and mock and laugh at the warnings and people. Also,this ambiguity applies to a series of warnings. I'd say 3 warnings with the last being a Level 4 or 'Severe' makes it a 'series' of warnings,although it need not be in order and there may not be 3,maybe 2 only(Rare,you don't promote a 2 to 4,nor should you warn a person with a starting level of 3).Bottom line:being 'Active' is a GUIDELINE,if someone vandalises So and so page 52 times a year due to bordom,so and so admin should block that bored dude.121.7.56.203 15:18, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You've got that backwards. It's not that a vandal has so much free time, but so little. The people who aren't interested in any vandalism that happened more than an hour ago seem to be concerned only about vandals who have no life, never eat, sleep, or use the euphemism, and vandalise at least once an hour. The ordinary vandals who hits a few pages, and having scratched the itch goes off to do something else until the next time they're bored, these admins don't seem to care about them. <a href="../../../z/s/e/User%7EZsero_14cb.html" title="User:Zsero">Zsero</a> 15:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Technically yes, but that infringes on another whole controversial topic. Accoding to your reasoning they should have to sign in to be held accountable when one of the important concepts of wikipedia is that you should be able to edit anonymously. By blocking an anon IP, and forcing an editor to sign up for an account kind of goes agains the spirit. I think that is why the blocking policy is written to include a statement that says only should be used to prevent current ongoing vandalism. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 16:34, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The standard warning templates seem defective to me because they do not include any that allow you to note a pattern of behavior by the vandal. All of them are looking at single incidents of changes to specific pages. There needs to be a series of warnings that can be used to draw attention to observed patterns of behavior. On recent change patrol I often find a single vandalism change to a page. I revert that change. I then check the contribution log for that vandal and find they have just made similar vandalism on a dozen other pages. I then go to the vandal's talk page and what am I to post, using the standard warning templates? Is there a template for "This vandal has just trashed a dozen pages in the past hour?" <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 18:01, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand that I can enter anything into the warning, thanks. The point I am making is that even if there is a demonstrable pattern of abuse across many pages, it seems that the fact that only a single warning about it has been given is used an excuse to permit the vandal to continue. The <i>standard</i> warning templates have no templates that are appropriate to flag patterns of abuse. It would be easier for those of us who do recent change patrol if there were such templates. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 19:38, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I have done is issue one warning, escalated as required, for each incident of vandalism that has taken place on different articles. That seems to have been criticsed in the past week or so, and so I am at a loss as to what to do. I think this area is where the advice given should be clarified about warnings, making explicit what one should consider and what to do in certain situations. The additional problem I have seen is where vandalising attempts have been reverted, but no warning has been logged. This then prevents any easy detection of patterns. When one attempts to make a case for patterns of vandalism in the appropriate places, one is said to have misunderstood what "active now" means. The whole area needs looking at and clarified. However, I imagine people might say they do not have enough time to take this task on board. Of course, they will not if they continue to implement a policy which allows so much vandalism to occur which requires time to revert, and yet which seems to have few consequences to those committing it. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch"><span style="border:1px solid DarkGreen;padding:1px;"><font style="color:White;background:DarkGreen" size="0">&#160;DDStretch&#160;</font></span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../d/d/s/User_talk%7EDdstretch_65ba.html" title="User talk:Ddstretch"><font color="DarkGreen" size="0">(talk)</font></a> 19:41, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So, if a user's last warning was <b>uw-test3</b> or 4 how many days have to pass before it resets to 1?

<dd>As far as I know there isn't a requirement that you need to begin with level 1 every time. According to the template page level 1 assumes "good faith", level 2 assumes "no faith" and level 3 assumes "bad faith." So it's something of a judgement call. I view standard juvenile vandalism usually as level 2, or level 1 if it could be interpreted as a genuine test. I have no problem going straight to level 3 for particularly vicious, racist vandalism. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 19:40, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Tricky question. I'd bet you twenty wikibucks no two editors will give you quite the same answer.&#160;:p In my case, if a shared IP address (say, a high school) has <i>only</i> bad edits, going back a month or more, on a regular basis (several times a week), then we don't need to bother waiting for somebody to pass t4. It's a drain on resources, and blocks are preventive, anyway (in this case, preventing needless damage and effort). If, on the other hand, the vandalism is more dispered, either over time or because there's some (maybe even <i>any</i>) good edits, I'm far more hesitant to block the same way. I'd say it also depends a bit on whether it seems to be the same person -- sometimes a person will come back and make the same sorts of edits, at the same pages, a few days later, and in those cases I'd still consider the prior warnings valid. So, um, it's tricky, I guess. I don't have a hard and fast decision rule, just yet. Not sure if anybody does. Good question, though. – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 19:44, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>When I started posting warning on users' talk pages I would the 24hr rule but, then I saw that the norm was several days. Then I posted an IP address to the AIV to be blocked (it had a t4 from 2 weeks ago) and it was rejected and I got a nice message on my talk page. So, that's what got me wondering. If I'm going to report vandals to be blocked, I want to do it in whatever parameters WP sets. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimonandreou_c50c.html" title="User:Kimonandreou">Kimon</a> 19:49, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't mean to imply that you would need to start all over each day or anything. It seems most admins (though as Luna said, this is not universal) would like to see at least one warning issued (and subsequently ignored) on the same day you report the vandal. Exactly how recent it needs to be depends on the admin. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 19:53, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And I'm fine with that Kafziel, I wasn't bothered, I just got curious. And it appears there isn't a consensus. You're right though that it was while since the last warning was posted (Feb 8th I believe), I went to the AIV since that last one was a t4 and it had to do with vandalism with malicious intent. I may have jumped the gun though. Oh well, lesson learned. I still think that a general rule of thumb should exist. A rule of "at least one warning must be posted within the last 24hrs" may be a good start for posting to the AIV. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimonandreou_c50c.html" title="User:Kimonandreou">Kimon</a> 20:03, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, if the IP hadn't made any vandalism edits in 2 weeks since receiving the warning, it's likely a block wouldn't have prevented any (as it may have been shared or the person simply wasn't coming to Wikipedia anymore). Blocks have to be timely and preventative, rather than punitive. <font color="#1874CD"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 19:57, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For me, it depends largely on the nature of the user. I will count t3/t4 on a registered user even if it is fairly old, because we know it is the same person being warned. I need a more recent warning before blocking on an IP that appears static, since it is possible that it is actually a different user. For shared IPs, I only block if the final warning is quite recent because it is highly likely a new user is at the keyboard. On the other hand, if abuse from these shared IPs (such as school IPs) is chronic, I may block without a final warning at all. Those are my guidelines, but other admins do things differently. Like non-admin vandal fighers, we tend to rely on intuition, which may be imperfect but is better than rigid instruction creep. --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_66a1.html" title="User:Ginkgo100">Ginkgo100</a><sup><a href="../../../g/i/n/User_talk%7EGinkgo100_02a2.html" title="User talk:Ginkgo100"><i>talk</i></a></sup> 22:29, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
