<p>Even though I'm an administrator, I wanted to see if other admins agreed with how I'm proposing to deal with <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamdevino_6051.html" title="User:Williamdevino">User:Williamdevino</a>. This supposed 14-year-old kid from England is going around posting racist and hateful comments on different talk pages, expressing support for the KKK while also sphewing hate at people of color. For samples of this, see his <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamdevino_6051.html" title="User:Williamdevino">userpage</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamdevino_1c39.html" title="User talk:Williamdevino">talk page</a>, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ku_Klux_Klan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103446757" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ku_Klux_Klan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103446757" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Williamdevino&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=102531826" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Williamdevino&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=102531826" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. That last link shows <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamdevino_6051.html" title="User:Williamdevino">User:Williamdevino</a> demonstrating his talent at truly wonderous language. That last post also seems like it falls under the blocking policy for making "Personal attacks that place users in danger," as well as a violation of the <a href="../../../n/p/a/Wikipedia%7ENPA_8739.html" title="Wikipedia:NPA">NPA</a> guideline. However, before I blocked him I wanted to see if other admins agreed with doing this. Also, should he be given a warning before blocking or has he already crossed the line on acceptable behavior?--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 20:51, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would have indef-blocked already based on edits such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Williamdevino&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=102899698" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Williamdevino&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=102899698" rel="nofollow">this</a>, but since he's extremely likely to violate the warning it may not matter much. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 20:59, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks.

<p>BTW, I love this comment on his user page: "I am a supporter of the KKK, AWB and NAZI party and have been since I had an apifamy of sorts and acquired white, Christian, European pride." Apifamy?

<li>It's not a death threat, it's garden-variety inarticulate bigotry. I still support banning this fuckwit on the grounds that he has made it abundantly clear that he has no intention of abiding by policy, but we really must stop over-reacting to use of the word <i>kill</i> when there is no credible threat of harm.

<dd>I think what Guy meant is that there's no <i>credible</i> threat of harm. If I start receving letters written with newspaper clippings from the KKK, that's a death threat.

<dd>Right. It's like the drunk in the pub yelling "I'll kill you!" then falling flat on his arse because he's... well, drunk.

<dd>I would worry about it. What Highshines wrote is the kind of profanity you don't want to translate.

Is that enough or do I need to give you a verbatim translation?.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Niohe is both exaggerating and lying. All I have said was that the person who removed my user page (not Teke, but after him) must have had a bad upbringing. I can provide a verbatim translation: "<i>To whomever deleted my userpage: The one who had performed stealthy actions on my userpage must have been forced to do bad and brutal things by his mother. Also, he must have been beaten badly by his father. Therefore, he was formed that way.</i>" At that time, I was really angry with Niohe because he had frequently vandalized my userpage and talkpages before. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighshines_d63f.html" title="User:Highshines">Highshines</a> 20:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>It is an accurate translation. I can show it to every one word by word with a Chinese-English dictionary. My remark is clean, but your paraphase has added further sexual contents to it.

<p>The whole phrase "谁妈的逼" means "who has been forced by his mother to [do bad and brutal things]". The character "谁" means "whose", and the character "逼" is a verb which means to force someone to do something he/she is unwilling to do. In this case, I meant that someone so vandalic must have been "force by his mother [in his childhood] to do immoral things". I know it is a bit strong, but I already suffered enough from the vandalizations of my pages. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighshines_d63f.html" title="User:Highshines">Highshines</a> 22:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Highshines blanked the block message 3 times so I have protected her page as well. I don't know of any precedent with this so in this case I did what I think is the most convenient thing to do.

<p>I find User:Weatherman90/deathpool to be macabre and in poor taste. I realize that this is a user page, and that I have the freedom to just not go to it, but I am concerned about the image this page portrays of the wikipedia editing community. The insensitivity toward death of notable people and the hand-slapping and <i>points</i> giving, seems in particular to be contrary to the standards of conduct that are implied in most of our policies. After reviewing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUser_page_2532.html" title="WP:User page">WP:User page</a>, I don;t find a section I can cite and say directly prohibits this <b>game</b>, but it just doesn't pass my <i>smell test</i>. If people do a wikipedia search (and include the checkboxes of user pages) on recently deceased celebrities, they are likely to wind up on this page. I would be embarassed, (after bragging to all my friends and business associates that I help edit the wikipedia), if a news article came out about the pedantic and insensitive <i>activities</i> of these few editors. I believe that this game should be taken to an off-wiki venue. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 06:59, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, please excuse me if I'm posting this on the wrong board.</p>
<p>On Mitt Romney's page, about halfway down, in the section titled "Governor of Massachusetts, 2003-2007" there is a picture of Mr. Romney addressing some troops. Someone has vandalized the picture by putting the word DOUCHEBAG in large bold type on the bottom of the picture.</p>

<dd>I know that occasionally an account has been deleted, but it may be that it requires a developer to do it and therefore it wouldn't be practicable as a solution to this situation.

<dd>There are a couple of points on the username account deletions, firstly we actively encourage people to sign up to accounts so they don't get bothered by irrelevant messages, this can apply to someone who only reads as well as editors, having an account also enables setting of other perferences. The other thing is many have been blocked on creation as being inappropriate usernames, or created as preemptive doppelganger accounts to prevent abusive/confusing usernames. Going ahead and deleting those would just broaden the pool for reuse by those who have nothing better to do with their time than make a nuissance of themselves. A better solution may be to enable the password and email of accounts to be reset on a similar basis to checkuser/oversight at the moment (i.e. a small group of trusted users with logging in effect.) --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 13:12, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I agree with Jimbo. The whole point of Wikipedia is that we are all volunteers, who are in this just for the love of it. We have no vested interests in this project, we have nothing to gain and nothing to lose (besides an off-wiki life&#160;;). Paying someone to edit Wikipedia for you is absurd.

<dd>The idea of hiring an independent source is common but inherently ridiculous. You're not independent of someone if you get paid by them.

Perhaps, he may even defended the article on my bio from being edited or having information that may be libelious and negative to not only my political campaign but my life as well. If someone can obviously argue his way through the system, such as lawyers often does for their DUI clients, then I see no reason why we (an experienced wikipedian) can't be payed. Perhaps my hidden skills as an expert writer, lawyer, or something else will help propogate my POV. Perhaps a real paid lawyer could give me a fair representation during my debates. Perhaps a well experience wikipedian will know how to contour the rules in this persons favour. Remember every article is full of POVs (see the quote on my user page). I'm not saying we should keep the information, but if Microsoft wants to spend 10'000 $ during the launch of Windows Vista to make sure that certain POV are well sourced and properly reference as per wikipolicy, I'll make sure to argue it the best I can per my knowlege and experience in advocacy at AMA and as per my education.

<li>LOL, Well... where do I start.... (self referene back to my above comment? nah). Well, in general, being a prosecutor (attacking), I think, doesn't require much imagination, but being a defence lawyers requires a lot more imagination. ie.: He might have been here, he migth have been there, we could done this instead, the wikirule might have meant this, etc... (oops! Advocates aren't lawyers that's true.) Anyways, being an advocate is about the same because you are somewhate making a choice to defend the other side, all while remaining still technically being honest and ethical. However, again, it always requires, a lot more imagination to defend someone. "There is always another way of seeing things or the possibility of another solution to what is being alleged." Surely, and I mean this as a compliment, your <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_train_that_could.html" title="Little train that could">little train that could</a> still has some imagination to remain an advocate and undestand that there is really nothing unethetical about arguing other possibilities!!!

<li>COI is a guideline, and has next to no teeth. (All it says is try to avoid them)</li>
<li>The whole point of Wikipedia <i>isn't</i> about the "love of it", but is about writing an encyclopedia.</li>
<li>I thought the whole treatment of the MyWikiBiz scenario was an absolute farce, and involved drawing up some of the worst guidelines ever. (It involved the paid party writing articles off wiki for other unrelated users to copy over, which pretty much meant in was incredibly hard to trace compared to say drawing up articles in the userspace or AFC)</li>
<li>I have no qualms over <a href="../../../r/e/w/Wikipedia%7EReward_board_d4ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Reward board">Wikipedia:Reward board</a>.</li>
<li>I believe that you can be paid to write something an still maintain a neutral encyclopedic stance, even if you are being paid by an involved party.</li>
<li>I believe that if we maintain a high level of accountability of paid-edits they can be beneficial to Wikipedia. And a lot <i>less</i> damaging than the hordes of drive by vanity anon spam that we get.</li>
<li>Having your firm/services connected to the use of a paid-editor is a hell of a lot less damaging for your publicity than having crap erroneous articles about your firm/services.</li>

If you are notable enough and its not written like an advert noone will ever know and it will probablly stick.

<dd>I personally don't quite agree with Jimbo's stance on this. While I understand somewhat his opposition to the MyWikiBiz, and even agree with it partially, this is somewhat different IMHO. Microsoft appear to have down this in a fairly resonably way, approaching a blogger who I presume was considered fair and neutral, not someone who wrote about Microsoft the best company in the world all the time. Their conditions clearly didn't require any level of performance and as this blogger wasn't running a business, it seems far less likely they would care much whether they kept their hirer happy. Indeed, as a blogger with a reputation to keep, it would seem not that likely IMHO. Definitely it's far better then the goodness knows how many companies who have employees doing it on company time. Perhaps MS should have done this via the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">Wikipedia:Bounty board</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/w/Wikipedia%7EReward_board_d4ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Reward board">Wikipedia:Reward board</a> and gone for FA or something 203.109.240.93 17:36, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All points of view should be represented in the article. I am not sure why a commercial interest shouldn't be able to contribute to an article, as long as they don't prevent others from expressing different views. The problem is when a commercially motivated editor camps on an article. If somebody does a PR/SEO job, it's very easy to spot, tag and clean up.

<p>I would like to present the information I've noted in this last week, for evaluation and comments now that I've been mediating a week on it. If feedback is not greatly adverse to Ludvikus I shall continue working as at present.

<p>I have included DIFFs for matters I myself have seen. I have <i>not</i> included any diffs that others might make if it was taken further. For now, as a mediator, I would simply like independent WP:AN feedback on the posts that I have seen this last week. I would also like to check whether the evidence tends to support a view that "the community's patience is exhausted", as some have suggested, and whether editor concerns over Ludvikus should be addressed before progressing further.

<dd>There can be no doubt that there is a consensus for a community ban amongst the editors of the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">Philosophy</a> article. The only question here is, is that sufficient to ban someone from the Wiki? That is, as I asked before: For the purposes of a <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBanning_policy_2e63.html#Community_ban" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">community ban</a>, what counts as "a handful of admins or users"? I am of the opinion that in this case there is sufficient evidence of mischief for a ban to be enacted. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 01:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I beg to differ here, there may be some consensus but it is not a strong one and comes only from one "edit war" to which many of the "ban" editors were drawn in by their friends. So it is not widespread and is largely from a certain bunch of editors who contacted one another about the same edit-war. This handfull of editors were involved in this edit-war and disputes were fairly drawn out but not totally unreasonable, but this edit-war ended a number of days now. Nor had he disturbed much the actual articles. Now I witnessed the whole thing and if someone started being nasty or using bad language etc. it was not Ludvikus. Now different people react to such provocations in many ways, his reaction was perhaps strong but I cannot say he has not changed nor that he may be a young or inexperienced user. To not give fair warning on this matter I believe is not inline with wiki policy, and the "community ban," which I never heard of before, came out of nowhere and is largely post-factum. Also I notice the evidence gathering may be biased against him. It was these other editors who started using foul language and strong insults, Ludvikus just started reflecting them back many-fold. I also think the litigation thing is a red herring, there really were many editors drawn in and taking cheap shots at him. <span style="font-style:oblique">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 03:09, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The user's conduct is appalling, and is of negative value to Wikipedia (sorry, I realise that's very utilitarian). That being said, I would urge you to consider removing the 'behavioural analysis' section, which is not helpful - diagnosis by proxy of the user's psychological state is wildly inappropriate.

<dd>While I only have a minor background in philosophy (arg, looking back I didn't mean that as a pun), I get the feeling that I should link to this page in case I should ever want to write a textbook on disruptive editing. Vague legal threats, mentions of 'fisticuffs', persistent and admitted incivility (even if the admission was for a retaliatory portion), as well as the content edits themselves... When it actually becomes more brief to mention the types of problematic editing user isn't engaging in, and the behavior doesn't change and has a noticeable and pressing harmful impact, what really remains as a question? <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 17:24, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not that complex of a matter. Responding to disagreements or even incivility with combativeness and mounting incivility is wholly inappropriate and disruptive. The actions of other editors might in cases serve somewhat as a mitigation, but never a justification. And actions an editor would take "on the street" are entirely irrelevant. I'm also unsure that showing that you find the above appropriate is something that you really want to announce, particularly given the nature of this section. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 00:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The issue is quite simple really. Two administrators, who control the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">Philosophy</a> page, and other pages, for content, maintain that it is Wikipedia Policy to rate an Editor on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Stool_Chart_3b60.html" title="Bristol Stool Chart">Bristol Stool Chart</a>. Administrator <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">User:Mel Etitis</a> has rated me to be between a 6 and a 7. Apparently, the Community to which he belongs suports this Rating System. Administrator <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">User:Banno</a> also suppots this rating system, and has failed, repeatedly to take appropriate action. I have asked Mel for an apology, but he has not yet done so. It seems clear to me that he has such a great reputation at Wikipedia, that he can tream me as <i>shit'</i>. If this community fails to take the appropriate action against those who condone such disgusting behavior I do not, and will nor, have anything to do with Wikipedia in this vulgar and primitive stage. It is funny how my remarks are being misconstrude. I've effectively said that in the streets of New York, who someone calls you <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Stool_Chart_3b60.html" title="Bristol Stool Chart">SHIT</a>, you punch him out. But this is Cyberspace. So gentlemen, all I ask is that Mel and Banno apologize to me for the repeated use of said chart. But before you banned, I ask all of you judges, who are now asked to judge me, image yourselves in my predicament. Just click on Mel and Banno's <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Stool_Chart_3b60.html" title="Bristol Stool Chart">Bristol Stool Chart</a>, and ask yourselve how you would feel if you were so rated? If you allow powerful Administrators, like Mel and Banno, to be that abusive to editors, then I do not want to have anything to do with any of you myself. So why waste anyone's time, just answer my simple question: are these two powerful administrators, Mel and Banno, going to be permitted to indulge in such disruptive behavior? If yes, than out the door I go.</dd>
<dd>At the same time, if you take the trouble to look, I have listened carefully to <b>FT2</b> and used all my Wisdom to end the Philosophy Wars. I've even award Barnsters to those of my adversaries with whom I've had honest difference of opinion, but who have not been abusive. I am very curious if it is possible for Wikipedia to be just to me. Banno and Mel have been here a long time. But I'm a new person. So they are very arrogant. They have complete confidence that they shall prevail. And of course, they have many friends at Wikipedia, who will, and are, siding with them.</dd>
<dd>I have contributed several hundred articles already. And I have never been subjected to such abuse.</dd>
<dd>My recommendation is that you also consider a Conflict of Issue problem. Mel is Wikipedia's In-house Philosopher. And that's why he wants me banned. It is simple, I know more philosophy than he does - and that's a threat to him. He complains how horrible the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">Philosophy</a> page is -- all the time -- but he's its <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_writer.html" title="Ghost writer">ghost writer</a>. --<a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudvikus_1a4c.html" title="User:Ludvikus">Ludvikus</a> 19:44, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It would have taken me hours to undo all that vandalism,, and someone did it in like 20 seconds.

<p>Hi. I'm looking more for an admin opinion or two than particular action. Sorry to post here, but the involved admin seems to be on an extended break. The question is about <a href="../../../a/c/q/ACQ-Kingdom_Broadcasting_Network_59dc.html" title="ACQ-Kingdom Broadcasting Network">ACQ-Kingdom Broadcasting Network</a>, which was recently deleted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=ACQ-Kingdom_Broadcasting_Network" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=ACQ-Kingdom_Broadcasting_Network" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> as part of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Batang_Kaharian_3714.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Batang Kaharian">a 25-article group</a>. Although participation on that mass AfD was sparse, I'm sure most of the deletions were fine. This article though, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_ACQ-Kingdom_Broadcasting_Network_b2e6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/ACQ-Kingdom Broadcasting Network">passed a previous AfD</a>, and I think it accidentally got caught up in the sweep. Should I just let this one go? If not, is there a more casual route to bringing it back than Deletion Review? That seems to be a more dramatic route than I'd like.

<p>I looked at 'whatlinkshere' and found that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikEh__3b27.html" title="Wikipedia:WikEh?">Wikipedia:WikEh?</a> is hardly linked from anywhere. The only useful place it is linked from is <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearching_5336.html" title="Wikipedia:Searching">Wikipedia:Searching</a>, and the link was added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Searching&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98253341" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Searching&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98253341" rel="nofollow">here</a> by the user who created this 'new' internal search engine. Is this really new? It seems to me to just be an alternative to the search box, but with a very slightly different interface. It is ultimately based on what is at <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasky_Searchbar1_205c.html" title="User:Masky/Searchbar1">User:Masky/Searchbar1</a>. So does anyone know if this really is new, or just the old search box in a new guise? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 15:02, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yo guys, sorry about hosting WikEh? search engine on my userpage, then redirecting it there. I didn't really expect this to happen. You can delete it if you like. I don't really need it anymore. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasky_f5c6.html" title="User:Masky">Masky</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMasky_9deb.html" title="User talk:Masky">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Masky_64fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Masky">contribs</a>) 20:28, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I still don't understand what this talk of a WikEh? search engine is all about. Since it doesn't seem to be linked from anywhere, and the creator doesn't mind it going, I'll MfD the WP namespace page at some point unless someone speedies it first. I'll wait another day in case someone says that this WikEh? thing really is a different search engine, which I doubt. I'll leave the user pages alone (they were transcluded to the WP namespace), as that is useful experience in experimenting with coding. Incidentially, is it frowned upon in general to transclude from the less formal namespaces to the more formal ones (other than template namespace to other namespaces)? Is that similar to not wanting cross namespace redirects? ie. Is transcluding from user namespace to WP or article namespace, or from WP namespace to article space, generally bad practice? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:37, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Wikipedia:WikiEh? does exactly the same thing as the normal search function, accessing the same pages, so is serving no real purpose (and has a confusing name).

A long time ago, we were having a long argument about heights and weights of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_888c.html" title="Street Fighter">Street Fighter</a>-characters. There are many different versions of the heights and weights of these characters. Now JuJube has removed these Heights and Weights because this is too difficult to verify. Other users have asked him why the heights of these characters have been removed and JuJube blames me and says that these things have been removed because of <b>my</b> "constantly editwarrings". But to me, he said that the heights have been removed because this is too difficult to verify. Well, JuJube harasses me and I'm afraid that if other users would add the heights and weights to these Street Fighter Characters that JuJube would blame ma again and I'm also afraid that he would add a sockpuppet-shield to those users who would add the heights. And these problems are very frustrating for me. Please do something against <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> and I'll be very happy. Thanks.

Well, I've created a new account because my old username is a name of an existing character and everytime when I type my old username into the google-web machine, my contributions also appear and also JuJube's sentences about my old username also appear. Please don't forget to tell JuJube that he should use my current username in any cases. Well, I've left you a comment because JuJube has to be stopped, as I mentioned.

However, since ED is trying to ruin the lives of many notable Wikipedians and has succeeded somewhat (e.g. harassing MONGO enough that his good judgment was messed up so he started to overreact and therefore caused him to be relieved of his administrative duties in the Seabhcan arbitration case), this is one of those rare cases where WP:IAR should trump WP:NLT this time. Since that site coordinates attempts to abuse Wikipedia, which could be considered computer crime in a technical sense, Wikipedia should take steps to defend itself.

<p>It seems to me that the crux of the perennial IRC issue is that people complain about the lack of accountability there, and the apparent fact that it does not fall under the jurisdiction of the ArbCom. The solution, then, seems fairly straightforward: <b>Create a new IRC channel that IS accountable to the Wikipedia community</b>.

<dd>Great theory, but note that IRC is a different system necessitating a different culture. (Your proposal might easily become like implementing finnish culture in saudi arabia,&#160;;-) or vice versa, if you're not careful). I'd like to invite you over to freenode to discuss!&#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>I agree this would be the best course. I suggested something similar in my comments on the proposed IRC ArbCom case. Specifically, I would suggest making a 'Wikimedia administration' channel, for all the English Wiki projects, which is open for everyone to <b>READ</b>, but not write to... easily done in IRC by making the channel moderated and giving the 'voice' setting only to those who should be able to write. In the rare cases where truly confidential business must be conducted (OTRS/legal/office/whatever) a private channel can be set up in seconds. Such a setup would allow everyone to see what was going on without filling the channel with tons of gab like the general channel. If an admin acted abusively their 'voice' could be taken away temporarily, or permanently for recurring problems... and any user could temporarily be given 'voice' to ask a question or participate in a discussion relevant to them. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:58, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Obviously what we need now is yet another IRC section so we can have yet another long meandering discussion. That said, I'm for anything that enhances accountability, <i>except for public logging</i>. The rule isn't specific to #wikipedia-en-admins at all, but is common to most Wikimedia IRC channels. If I have to worry about how not just the people in the channel, but how every single Wikipedian might misconstrue my words after reading a small excerpt of the logs, then I might as well have a preview button and not carry the discussion out in real time. (the same principle applies to real-time discussions at Wikimania, or to the Florida Wikimedia office... it would be intrusive to suggest everyone's informal conversations be recorded and be available for public posting) --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 14:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On IRC I assume that everything I say is public. If someone posts a partial log, I take it as permission to post the rest of the log as well. Even so, I do understand your position as well.

<dd>Definitely. If you have a conversation at a large lunchtable, everything should be considered public because anyone is free to relay their own impressions of what was said. But if speakers at the table were aware that the conversation was being recorded verbatim and that selective snippets could be replayed to anyone else, they'd almost certainly word their conversation more carefully. That's certainly a good thing in many cases,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_United_States_Senate_election,_2006#Allen.27s_macaca_controversy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_United_States_Senate_election,_2006#Allen.27s_macaca_controversy" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> but for people who are <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/38227.html" class="external text" title="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/38227.html" rel="nofollow">essentially good</a>, it's also sometimes needless overhead. For those who have lunch at work, how many would be willing to have their lunch conversations recorded? How many people would be totally comfortable with having the audio in their workspace recorded by their employer, to ensure a professional demeanor at all times? Yes, it's good to be able to have both logged and unlogged conversations. And if we can make sure that IRC has adequate ways to deal with civility problems, then it's the place for unlogged conversations. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 18:38, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think public longing is undesirable, especially given that a lot of the communication on IRC is personal material only tangentially related to on-wiki matters. However, I don't think it's reasonable to assume that what you say there isn't being recorded. Nor to think that what say there won't become public knowledge. In light of this, comments made on IRC that personalize disputes can be as detrimental to the collaborative process as comments made on-wiki, and to my mind ought to be regarded in more or less the same light. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 22:14, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive73_30f2.html" title="Edit section: Unprotecting salted pages">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Unprotecting <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">salted</a> pages</span></h2>
<p>A quick procedural question. I recently <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">salted</a> a page - <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flashes_Before_Your_Eyes_4a2c.html" title="Flashes Before Your Eyes">Flashes Before Your Eyes</a>, the latest episode of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost</a> - that had been repeatedly recreated against policy. However, I knew at the time that the chances were that within 4/5 days the page would be able to be created as an article per <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Lost_episodes_b415.html" title="Talk:List of Lost episodes">the policy on future Lost episodes</a>. I advised users at the time who were intending to recreate when verifable information came to light that they should go to <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">requests for unprotection</a> when necessary. However, when done so, the users were sent to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>.</p>
<p>Now, its important to understand that the users wern't requesting that deletion of the article be overturned; they wanted it unprotected so that a new article can be created. Would I be right in asserting that the requests for unprotection, rather than deletion review, is the correct place for that? Or have I misunderstood this one? The policy states "Re-creation of such pages can be requested at deletion review if the deletion was incorrect or circumstances have changed". However, it is not 'recreation' of the article that is wanted, it is the brand-spanking-new creation of a brand spanking new article; or have I got that wrong? --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 15:27, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If it is a substantially new article then I don't think a DRV is needed. I would really depend on the reasoning of the deletion, if it was per crystal balling, then I think once the episode it out it is fine to recreate. In other words if the deletion reasons don't apply to the new article, then they don't apply. Unless I am wrong. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 15:30, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Ahem: that's not a <i>policy</i>, it's a group of lost fans agreeing that every episode, past or future, is of surpassing importance and must have its own article - maybe they think we are a mirror of Lostpedia or an episode guide or something. Just to be clear. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:05, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just to be clear, you're right the policy that Robdurbar is referring to is not policy on Wikipedia. However, it is documented consensus resulting from a mediation with a unanimous decision. This discussion should not be focused on the justification of Lost episode articles but rather whether protected deleted pages should go to requests for unprotection or deletion review. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedical_7c58.html" title="User:Wikipedical">Wikipedical</a> 22:36, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not being a natural mediator, I have tried to do so, as it's something I feel I should try to do from time to time. I have tried to solve the ructions going on at <a href="../../../f/l/o/Talk%7EFlorian_Gate_905f.html" title="Talk:Florian Gate">Talk:Florian Gate</a>. A number of users have been disputing whether this article should be at <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florian_Gate_e8bd.html" title="Florian Gate">Florian Gate</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Florian%27s_Gate_521f.html" title="St. Florian's Gate">St. Florian's Gate</a>. The article has been moved back and forth, and a few shotgun moves have been carried out without consensus. An attempt to engage the Mediation Committee fell through as not all parties agreed to mediation (the user who had carried out the most recent move refused).

<p>Following a fairly conclusive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_November_7&amp;diff=87352403&amp;oldid=87351402" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_November_7&amp;diff=87352403&amp;oldid=87351402" rel="nofollow">DRV discussion</a> the old 'Wr' series of templates for telling people they could not remove warnings from their user talk pages were deleted. Subsequently a {{Removewarn}} template was created with the stated purpose (and text) of telling people who habitually remove warnings that no offense is intended by them and giving links for possible discussion of the issues. That was iffy given the history, but seemed ok in principle. However, despite warnings not to do so, in practice people are often using this template whenever a single warning is removed... and they revert the warning back onto the page. Further, this has been cloned as {{Removewarnusertalk}}, {{TYWLAM}} (which claimed removing warnings was a blockable offense before being changed to a redirect), and back to the old name {{Wr}}. There is also now a {{Dontremovewarn}} which is used when a warning is first placed to tell the user they may not remove it. There may well be others.</p>
<p>My impulse at this point is to speedy delete the lot of them as G4 (recreations) / T1 (inflammatory templates) / just plain wrong... but I'm bringing it here for consideration. Is it worth trying to retain some sort of 'people place warning templates to help you' template or will it just inevitably be used as a back door to insist that users have to retain and display any 'scarlet letter' any random user decides to inflict upon them? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:39, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Frankly, even if it was freely licensed content, it is not obvious to me how encyclopedic a gallery of logos would be, but I suppose that a case could be made. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 05:44, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To those not familiar, articles about television stations tend to accrue galleries of non-free images of the station's previous logos. There is little to no commentary on these images (so they fail <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> #8), and there's little need to have galleries of as many as two dozen images to identify a single station (so they fail <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> #3).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have made a practice of removing such galleries, for the last several months. It's just that there are so very many station articles. It's unfortunate that this necessary work amounts to undoing the good-faith work of others, but it is nevertheless necessary. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:45, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

There is much more that can be done than taking out a couple logos here and there. <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> 05:49, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair use requires "critical commentary." This is most preferably done in a history section, where one talks about eras, histories, etc.; see <a href="../../../l/a/c/LACMTA_4fc2.html" title="LACMTA">LACMTA</a> and how I intergrated a gallery of 4-5 images into the history section. Fair use is a legal issue and this requires sweeping intervention; this is out of the domain of the regular grinding and slow progress of other issues. Hbdragon88 05:57, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It might have been a better idea to have instead of just taking it upon himself to axe every gallery with just a curt note saying "rm gallery -- fair use", to have (a) started a discussion at the project page with the concern, and perhaps tried to integrate the images better into the article if the article actually discussed the image. If there was 27 images, you could still go and delete all of the ones that didn't have any mention in the prose of the article -- that's what these discussion pages are for. A Man In Black managed to go about this in a way that could do nothing but provoke people, and the cavalier way he seems to dismiss the concerns that others have don't help any more. I absolutely understand the bind you folks are in with this, but reaching out could have stemmed this ill-will many people have over the removal of the galleries. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESterlingNorth_8b85.html" title="User:SterlingNorth">SterlingNorth</a> 22:32, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe that the difference is that your website does not tell people that its content it is freely available for republication like wikipedia does. Your liability on your website ends at the site itself, which you can easily continuously monitor and ensure your use of images does not infringe on the rights of the owner. On wikipedia, since the content is mirrored and included in so many external sites, it is not possible for wikimedia or the editors of wikipedia to police all that external use. Therefore cerefully written image copyright guidelines have been established and are aggressively enforced. Hopefully you can see that this is not an attempt to curtail your good faith edits, but rather to protect the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 07:09, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It isn't that we "don't want them"; it's that copyright law simply prevents us from using and redistributing them without the permission of the copyright holder. <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">Fair use</a> is a very limited exception to copyright law that varies by country. As far as your personal website goes, it's simply that either the copyright holder(s) don't care, or that you're not a big enough target for them to have even noticed. If your website happened to be one of the most visted websites on the Internet, you would have plenty of copyright issues.

There is no legal reason why we shouldn't be able to have historical logos in an encyclopedic article about the logo's subject; this is an entirely fair use of these images. When there is no legal issue, Wikipedia policy is supposed to be decided by consensus. And there is no consensus that Wikipedia policy forbids these images in this context. Given that, there is no good reason why these logos should be removed. Although the discussion has failed to reveal a clear consensus, the fact remains that these logos were added by hundreds of editors over the last few years, and now ONE single adminstrator has recently taken it upon himself to delete them all.

<li>It can be 'solved' if there were more administrators with the time to do this. Closing CfDs is frequently not easy. When I do it, I need to have 3 windows open so that I can cut and paste to the various places. Then there is the content that has to be reviewed. Sometimes this is not an issue. In other cases the various opinions require the administrator to closely read through the comments and see if they can find some consensus. In one recent case, there was no consensus on a new name, so rather then just close this as no consensus, I closed as no consensus and relisted with a rename vote for the two options hoping for a consensus. In some cases, I simply don't understand the discussion and have to skip it. Also, administrators need to avoid closing discussions that they are involved in unless there is a clear consensus. This sometimes keeps some administrators from closing specific discussions. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 21:35, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>sufficient to who? you? How "meaningful" can commentary be when it is, as you put it, "WFOO changed their green logo to orange". Would you like me to put "At 16hours on the 10th of October, the tempature was 57 degrees and a bus is passing by, WFOO has just switched their logo from a disgusting lime green to a nice pumpkin orange that gives me an Autumn feeling". Would that work better for you? Sheesh....logos are logos. You look at the picture, then look at the text..."this was used from 19XX to 19XX but only on Tuesdays"....how much commentary do you need and want? - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> 07:40, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe people don't do the research cause they know you are just going to come along and delete it anyway....or more likely as HBDragon88 just said...it doesn't exsist...then you have to go with the picture as the reference until an actual article comes along that it can be referenced to.

<dd>Calton, AMIB doesn't have an answer as to where I can find a source that is found quickly and easily that is acceptable so I can reference an article or picture, so using myself and my website (I use my website) is the next best thing until an article or such can be found and then I will reference it to that.

<dd>Unless you are an academic who has written perr-reviewed articles or books on the subject, then it's original research and isn't allowed to be on Wikipedia. If you can find peer-reviewed articles, or even newspaper articles (from reliable sources), then those are acceptable. I seem to recall several articles many years ago about the NBC logo because there was a controversy over NBC having spent millions of dollars on consultants to come up with their new logo, only to find that it violated the trademark of Nebraska Public Television, which had spent a couple of hundred dollars to create it in the first place. If there's such an article history on the subject, then we can use it as sources. But your un-peer-reviewed website is not a suitable source. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvus_cornix_890e.html" title="User:Corvus cornix">Corvus cornix</a> 17:52, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If the threshhold of inclusion for information in Wikipedia were that it had to be published in peer-reviewed academic articles and books, you'd have to delete 90% of what's in Wikipedia. Fortunately, it's not. This is TV station history, not <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_physics.html" title="Nuclear physics">nuclear physics</a>. I'm not aware of any academic institution which specializes in this subject (or many, many other subjects which are covered in-depth in Wikipedia). Newspaper articles can also be difficult to find, as newspapers are notoriously poor at covering what their competition is doing (unless it sells newspapers, ergo you <i>can</i> find TV listings and articles about popular shows, although even TV listings have been recently disappearing from newspapers due to on-line TV listing services and DVRs). <a href="../../../d/h/o/User%7EDHowell_acb6.html" title="User:DHowell">DHowell</a> 23:09, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to add my thoughts: I agree with everything AMIB is doing with regard to these articles and images.

<dd>Here is where you all are losing me. You want research, but not original research. If you do the research yourself, you know that you have searched the web and what you find is what you can find. If "Bob" does it, how do you know he didn't just look at one site and call it research?</dd>

<dd>See, now we have WP:FUC #3 and #8, "Fair-Use", "a legal issue", "unsourced commentary", "not discussed in the article", "no reference", it's "decorative", "meaningful commentary", "reliable source" (though AMIB admits he knows of no place to find a source), "violation of two of Wikipedia's foundations", and "the right thing to do" as reasons given why these logos should not be up...each time, a different reason. All for a logo that no company has or probably will make an issue about. It is easy for you to just delete something, have others do the research (that you are going to deny anyway) that you all know is almost impossible to find on older images, especially some recorded from over-the-air, then actually do the research yourself or just leave the image be.</dd>

<dd>I ask again, what is the number of problems that Wikipedia has had with "fair-use" images....and again, please don't tell me the answer is none. Like I have said before, I doubt Gannett, FOX, or any other company is going to come along and sue Wiki cause a logo from the 60's, 70's, 80's or whenever is up here. If it is defamatory, then yeah, but if it is just for historic purposes, I kinda doubt they care. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> 22:55, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's not about lawsuits. It's about having correct, reliable information. I don't know who you are. I don't know whether you are making up what you are saying.

These policies are not an excuse to go around deleting <b>factual</b> information that doesn't cite sources because you think they are "trivial" or for some other reason. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says "editors should provide a reliable source for material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or it may be removed." But that doesn't mean you go around challenging normally uncontroversial and uncontentious material simply because you have some other reason to remove it. If I wanted to violate <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, I could blank everything in <a href="../../../4/_/%28/4_%28number%29.html" title="4 (number)">4 (number)</a> because that article doesn't cite its sources. Original research! Where is the reliable source that says that 4 "is the natural number following 3 and preceding 5" or that "Four is the only number in the English language for which the number of letters in its name is equal to the number itself"?! Now if I were to delete such things from <i>every</i> number article, you have a pretty good analogy to what AMIB is doing to the TV station articles. Except that TV station history is a more obscure subject than arithmetic, so the information is harder to verify (please note that "hard to verify" does not mean "unverifiable", and "obscure" does not mean "non-notable" or "trivial"). <a href="../../../d/h/o/User%7EDHowell_acb6.html" title="User:DHowell">DHowell</a> 22:33, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Naturally I hope it will not come to that.</p>
<p>Ludvikus has been discussed on WP:AN twice this month in relation to a possible community ban. See above for details or <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_Evidence_pages_Philosophy_603d.html" title="User:FT2/Evidence pages/Philosophy">User:FT2/Evidence pages/Philosophy</a> for background. He has been blocked three times now (two bans, one extended). The article has been protected twice now within a month. Article editors are near unanimously in agreement, and there is significant consensus amongst the majority of other editors and admins who have expressed views.</p>
<p>I have been given Ludvikus' word in email that he will henceforth utterly forgo certain kinds of inappropriate editing on all pages, in order that I can trial unprotect the article. He may be able to keep his word, he may not. I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Philosophy&amp;diff=104448678&amp;oldid=104395530" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Philosophy&amp;diff=104448678&amp;oldid=104395530" rel="nofollow">posted a formal explanation</a> that if there is further problematic editing contravening our agreement on his conduct then he may be treated as community banned based upon existing consensus, and enforced by block. I have posted a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ludvikus&amp;diff=104452622&amp;oldid=104439369" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ludvikus&amp;diff=104452622&amp;oldid=104439369" rel="nofollow">further heads up</a> on his talk page to ensure there is no doubt. I do not consider further explanation needed since I have also given him explanation and advice multiple times that should be clear to any reasonable editor. (eg: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ludvikus&amp;diff=104333916&amp;oldid=104324859" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ludvikus&amp;diff=104333916&amp;oldid=104324859" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ludvikus&amp;diff=104439369&amp;oldid=104435908" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ludvikus&amp;diff=104439369&amp;oldid=104435908" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and email)</p>
<p>If the agreement is kept henceforth, then I will be glad. If the agreement is broken I would propose to post a WP:AN note to the effect that he is considered community-banned, and an indefinite block to enforce this, being consensus as best I can judge it.

<p>It all started with a mini-revert war on <a href="../../../e/r/d/Erdvilas.html" title="Erdvilas">Erdvilas</a>, and article that I re-wrote from sratch using reliable sources. Then a user came adding the infobox and other information based on myths about <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palemonids.html" title="Palemonids">Palemonids</a> from <a href="../../../b/y/c/Bychowiec_Chronicle_5b28.html" title="Bychowiec Chronicle">Bychowiec Chronicle</a>... But the edits it seemd strangely familiar, so I investigated further and what I uncovered is an extremely long-term sockpuppetism that I need an advice from from fellow admins how to deal with.</p>

<li>a bunch of IP that I did not bother tracking</li>
<li>and probably more</li>
</ul>
<p>How to recognize? First edits are to userpage and usertalk page. Userpage is created by adding username, an image, or some random text (i.e. userpages are useless and do not give any personal info). No edit summaries. A number of unilateral unexplained page moves. Almost no activity this past November-December (active again). Fields of interest: dukes of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>, Trubetskoy family, anarchism in Estonia, politics of Estonia, nacism... Loves obscure spellings.</p>
<p>S/he was not noticed for such a long time (contributing at least since early 2005) because contributions go to obscure very low-trafic pages. Those pages are not watchlisted and such edits escape unnoticed for a long long time. They are severly POV, usually unsourced, disputable. While going through contribs noticed just a couple edits to talk space. Haven't noticed Wikipedia namespace edits.</p>
<p>So it is not a classic sockpuppet brought to vote, but creating multiple accounts so that edits could not be traced. This is clearly disprutive. How would you advise to proceed? <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenata3_94d8.html" title="User:Renata3">Renata</a> 01:33, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>RFCU is cumbersome and is not full-proof of anything. Committed puppeteers can get around easily by posting from remote IP's, be those open proxies or simply accounts at remote computers. We have several known pupeteers whose socks are blocked based purely on their contributions alone either because they are known to post from IP's that always change or because RFCU takes a large effort to compile (a case needs to be brief and convincing for a checkuser who has no idea of the dispute) and are backlogged. So, if there is clearly a disruptive account that looks like sock and acts like sock, it should be blocked, especially if there is a known sockmaster with the past pattern. To not accidentally block legitimate users under vague suspicion is important though and the to avoid this, each case needs to be investigated very thoroughly. It seems like Renata did the homework and it would be best if Renata who is best aware of the situation makes the decision on her own because it is unlikely that anyone here will bother to investigate this matter as thoroughly as she already did. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 20:20, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Actually, a checkuser doesn't take all that huge an effort to compile; it's tedious, but not difficult (click click click with an occasional cut and paste); work is underway to streamline the process. And there is no significant backlog; there's one case in which I've asked for additional information; and another in which the additional information just came in while I was doing the last one; and there is one outstanding IP check case. RFCU is quite helpful for less sophisticated puppeteers, of whom there are plenty; that it's less helpfu for the harder cases doesn't change that at all. RFCU alone shouldn't be sufficient to block anyone, because non-abusive sockpuppets are neither disallowed nor a problem to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 21:03, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not stupid, much of it is. Questions should either be briefly 'Explain x', with a reply 'See article y', or 'I read article x, could you please clarify y?'. There is, imo, inevitable spillover into discussion of these issues on <a href="../../../r/d/2F/WP%7ERD_H_97dd.html" title="WP:RD/H">Humanities</a>, and intricate technical questions, that we could never have articles for, on <a href="../../../r/d/2F/WP%7ERD_C_ca47.html" title="WP:RD/C">Computing</a>.

<dd>True, it shouldn't turn into a forum for discussion on various computing topics. It does seem that of all the Reference Desks, the computing one might spark the most discussion/debate/general talk. I doubt anyone will get into a long discussion about Volcanic Ash at the Science Desk. It seems generally fine for people to ask technical questions, but is there a point where things get too in depth? Is that necessarily bad? Does it then turn into something like people asking specific medical questions? Of course it's not the same as medical questions, but the detail of some technical questions kind of reminded me of that. This of course doesn't really answer any questions, but just some thoughts. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_459d.html" title="User:Natalya">Nataly<font color="green">a</font></a> 02:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One can argue on behalf of this artical as: &gt;&gt;The cartoonists treated Islam the same way they treat Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and other religions, or wikipedia is Secular bla blaa...</p>
<p><br />
Now my comment will be inflamatory but you must degest it for the sake of argument. My comment will not personally insult an administrator but its a general metaphor for a person to give reasons.</p>
<p>If you allow your sister's private parts to be shot by photographers, does that mean It is obligation for me to let it do for my sister? If Christian allow the fetish cartoons and images about The Honored Jesus (PBUH) does that means Muslims must allow the ugly cartoons about their Prophet? (Even Muslims wont like Jesus (PBUH) to be portrayed). A Royal family does not comprise our faith. Faith is something beyond if you really are a Christian you must agree. If people do not mind their cartoons to be made then who allowed cartoonists to make cartoon of every person? How the hell a person make my cartoons and publish in papers without my permission? Its simply violation of my personal possessions and an abuse same as somebody can not print my picture.

<li>I understand that Wikipedia is not censored. That does not mean an OpenSource website starts to publish the Mircrosoft Windows source code on its website. If Muslims themselves do not want their Sacred Personalites be disgraced then who the hell are others? Just because Wikipedia's moderators and admins are not Muslims, does this make them free to abuse anyone's Faith? Faith is much more sacred than someone's father or mother, yet I would ask: Can I make abuses to your father? or can I publish his evil cartoons or will you mind it?</li>

<p>Thanks to you all for your attention. I must say, what is a consensus? If some people just capture one person and sell him somewhere, will you listen to them on the basis of majority (Democracy/Poll) or will you look for the ethical possibilities? If 90% people want to abuse remaining 10%. Does it mean that abuse becomes 'OK' on the basis of Democracy, Policy or whatever?</p>
<p>Do you have to follow the ethics too? or just name the dog and kill on the basis of majority? An article on Wikipedia has to be scientifically written if you can call it a scholastic article (Given that the policy of wikipedia is secular then only scientific facts can be digested). While you admins might know better than me that any poll/edit conducted on the internet is never considered scientific but just an idea with and amount of doubt.</p>
<p>The situation of articles on wikipedia is like this: 1- you bring allegations then you ask the victims to disprove with references. 2- When victims say they are very few and dont have enough resources to prove their innocense. 3- You declare them guilty.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Pardon me but I see a lot of bias on many many wikipedia articles. Just because a huge majority of wikipedians are non-Muslims is an evidence in itself to make it a bias. Well, you might not agree with me on this, but I would ask, will a Christian like an Islamic point of view on a topic related to Christianity? NO. Will a Muslim like a Christian point of view on a topic related to Islam? He cant, simply because poll means 'all' here in wikipedia.</p>
<p>Any Christian can add whatever rubbish hugely biased link mongering the hatered against Islam and that is justified. A Muslim can not add a link even under that topic. Just take few examples: 1- <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_terrorism.html" title="Christian terrorism">Christian terrorism</a> 2- <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamist_terrorism.html" title="Islamist terrorism">Islamist terrorism</a></p>
<p>Try to compre the size and comprehenssiveness of both articles. Behold, In the topic <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_terrorism.html" title="Christian terrorism">Christian terrorism</a> how cleverly a reader is diverted to a very minor example of 'one person' killing 'one other person'. How nice? In all 2 billion Christians in the world, only this stupid example is available? All Christians are pious? while this one murder is the biggest example of terrorism? How about I define the "Islamic extremist terrorism" as the killing of Dr. ABC by some Moron? Will you accept that example in the article? I am 100% sure that the so called majority will not let it place even at the end of article.</p>
<p>Now I give you my last example before you trash my arguments to the basket of wikipeida:</p>
<p>1- A leader of a group named "ABC" Claims whatever major acts he does is actually told to him by God. 2- That group is evident as daylight that it is doing mass murder of people on the basis of lies. 3- That hypocrite group ruins the people in the name of self-interest or democracy while totally forgets about democracy when some dictators help that group to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>Will you let that group cite in the wikipedia's articles related to terrorism?</p>
<p>But just because unfortunately that group called 'ABC' is the same one who certifies any organization to be terrorists, so 'ABC' itself can not be cited as terrorist in wikipedia source, right?</p>
<p>This group leader is Mr. Bush. Ok this is not what I am saying, this is cited here:</p>

<dd>Mr. Durova, the case you are refering is under the U.S. law. Should I consider U.S. to be Master of all Coutries? and should I consider the US law to be the law of world? Keep your law to your country only and dont apply to the sacred figures of other religious people thousands of kilomerter away from you. Our Prophet' Personaly might be objected by some nonmuslims but we neither worship animals or rediculous objects that it can simply be justified to portray and make fun of. Secondly, the personalities which are made fun in the media not those who are totally accepted by one religion and being objected by the other. Those personalities are simply seen from secular point of view because they have nothing to do with the aspect related to religion. Faith IS SUPERIOR than you Freedom of Abuse. I would argue that bible is currupted by humans but I would never throw that to dust bin, I would rather give the bible due respect.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(Now please take my next comments to understand logic and not for the sake of offense) ok ok, even under your freedom of speech allows to intensively object or portray the negative part of someone's personality, does you freedom of speech allow to abuse anyone by portraying him as animals such as Pigs etc? If abusing someone is really that simple then please go to your parents and call them pig and bitch, right? will they enjoy your "FREEDOM of SPEECH" and Secular Policies, will you refer to them the Hustler Magazine's case? What you would rather do that you will talk in civilized way about the objectionable part of their personality, right? Because you 'Respect' them, right? When come your parents then you talk in civilized way because you respect them, when somebody else's parents come then you bring your "Freedom of Speech" and "Secular" policy of Wikipedia? and Prophet of Islam is much more respectable to Muslims as compared to their parents, their wives and even their own lives. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualEye_6b62.html" title="User:VirtualEye">VirtualEye</a> 10:05, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>We have articles on a company and its owner/CEO that've been edited by several registered users and IPs who've identified themselves by name as the owner or officers of the company. The editors all seem to have been the same person. One account was banned for legal threats but several others have posted threatening or intimidating language. The editor has engaged in various edits which represented conflicts of interest, such as promoting the company in other articles, removing information from the articles of competitors, and trying to settle scores on behalf of his late father. In addition to violating <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> and <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a>, the editor has repeatedly violated other policies and guidelines, such as <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYVIO_ef21.html" title="WP:COPYVIO">WP:COPYVIO</a>, etc.</p>
<p>A new account claims to have no relation to the company or its owner, but it is clearly the same editor based on his editing patterns, spelling mistakes, interests, etc. Outside information, such as the contents of a MySpace account, further supports the theory that the new editor is the owner of the company. Proving the connection to the owner serves to prove that the editor has a conflict of interest and that he's the same editor as previous usernames. So, given that the person has already made the revelation under a different account, is it legitimate to reveal a user's probable real name in the interest of enforcing Wikipedia rules?</p>

<dd>There's little chance that it's an employee. The company is extremely small, and some of the edits concern the owner's father. Further, the new account (the one which claims no association whatsoever) has made edits congruent with postings by the owner outside of Wikipedia, and with the same spelling mistakes. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 23:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The earlier habit of the editor was to use a series of accounts and IPs, so there wasn't really an "original account". Those accounts are now all too old for checkuser. However, the current username occasionally edits without logging in (he has come back and fixed his signature to take ownership of the unregistered edits) and those IPs are in the same range, and geo-located in the same small area, as the previous users. Also, concerns about invasion of privacy would seem to be minimal because the the person in question promotes himself as much as possible and does not post his home info anywhere. So, if what I say is correct and if this action is for the purposes of policy enforcement, is there a problem with re-identifying a user who has previously identified himself, based on internal and external factors? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 01:04, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Based on your description, it sounds as if they could be blocked right off the bat for evading their original ban. While you have made a reasonable case that invasion of privacy is not a legitimate worry, how will identifying the editor help stop them from editing in the future under new usernames or ip addresses? If their real identity is connected with their earlier incarnation, this banned editor from however long ago it was, it seems like they'd try to keep the connection quiet, no? <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 01:21, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All of this is preparatory to filing a user-RfC, the requested outcome of which would be that the editor avoid articles where he has a conflict of interest. I agree that the user has engaged in block evasion, but since he has not renewed his legal threats I don't feel comfortable blocking him outright for that cause alone. While he could sneak back again, as he already has, his editing is pretty obvious due to the obscurity of the topics. He has been trying to escape detection with the new username by claiming, many times, to be totally unassociated with the topic and to have only a passing interest in it. Despite that claim, his strong interest and continuity of identity is apparent. I don't hear anything from Picarron, Durova, or Peter to indicate that it would be wrong to say "User X is the same as User W, who identified as Person Doe". If I read those comments correctly, we can proceed with the RfC on that basis.

<p>RFC may not be necessary if you present a convincing case that these are all socks of the same banned sockmaster. When I tracked down the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELong_term_abuse_53c2.html#Joan_of_Arc_vandal" title="Wikipedia:Long term abuse">Joan of Arc vandal</a> I wrote up a report in user space that connected all the dots, then introduced it here to request a community siteban (he hadn't been banned until that point). Line it up with diffs and other evidence. The bit about trademark spelling mistakes interests me: since this will be circumstantial make sure your ducks are in a row. BTW the Joan of Arc editor disclosed his identity on his original account, which made it fair game for the investigation.

If you'd care to make any comments about the file in the meantime I'd appreciate the feedback.

<p>Every one can have their opinion, and may express them up to a point on Wikipedia. Supporting a resistence movement would be fine, but what I would NOT condone is supporting an armed conflict. Hence, the word <b>armed</b> is the keyword here and should be removed. --<a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdokter_4a5a.html" title="User:Edokter">Edokter</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/d/o/User_talk%7EEdokter_9869.html" title="User talk:Edokter">Talk</a>)</small> 15:05, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do agree that 'armed' is the major problem here, but I still think the whole idea of supporting Hezbollah on wikipedia fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>. To support any political party anywhere within wikipedia which is supposed to be neutral surely is a bad thing. It will also be highly offensive to Israeli's, they will not see themselves as causing hostilities. All in all, I think that this userbox is highly provocative and therefore should be removed. I've checked through all the pages the Hezbollah picture links to and can't find any other user with the same userbox <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 16:39, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As mentioned before, this one was brought to my attention, that is why it was removed, there is no crusade as you seem to want to make it out. Citing somones political stance as democrat or republican is far less inflamatory than stating someone supports a terrorist group involved in an armed conflict. If you don't see the difference, try and get a bit of perspective. Incidentally, <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExpatkiwi_7ee2.html" title="User:Expatkiwi">User:Expatkiwi</a> DID have something removed from his userpage at the same time as <a href="../../../e/m/b/User%7EEmbargo_72ff.html" title="User:Embargo">User:Embargo</a>, as you will see if you look back at the history. You also seem to be forgetting, that in an environment where anyone can edit, saying "A is there so B must be allowed to remain" is not a solid argument, because B may also violate policy. It comes down to this:
<ol>
<li>Jimbo himself says inflamatory statements on someones views or ideals do not have a place in the userspace.</li>
<li>He is perfectly entitled to his opinion, but as it could be found to be highly offensive by some mebers of the wikipedia community he is NOT entitled to express it here. This is backed up by two policys: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a free webhost</a> and <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">You do not own your userpage and it should not contain inflamatory content</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>I just had a look at the userpages you mentioned, and although they all contain some sort of politics (seems you are the one singling out people who support israel) none of them declare that they support a terrorist group in an ongoing and very bloody conflict with another country. Or for that matter (that I noticed) any side in ongoing violence wether that side be the US or iraq in that conflict, or one of the groups involved in the sudanese civil war. You really don't know wether those that support the state of israel support a peaceful resolution to hostilities or an all out <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_war.html" title="Total war">total war</a>. It is because that these views are NOT expressed that the userboxes are not inflamatory. And yes, they, for xpressing political ideaologies still go agaisnt Jimbo's wishes as quoted in [[WP:USER], but in a far less controversial manner than that under discussion. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:25, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think <b><a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html#List_of_militias" title="Militia">many people support armed resistance</a></b> to hostility. However, at the moment this specific case is a very sensitive subject, and I accept that this is inflammatory given the current political environment. If one were to put on their page <i>"This user supports armed resistance against Hezbollah hostilities"</i> (or <i>"Hezbollah = Murder Incorporated"</i>) it would be just as inflammatory.</p>
<p>So we are going ahead with the <i><a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumption</a></i> that Embargo is implying that Israel initiated hostilities against Hezbollah. Would any of these be acceptable:</p>

<dd>The term "resistance" might be a preferred term, but it implies "something is wrong which must be resisted". As opposed to (say) <i>This user supports action against hostile activity</i>. Reminds me a bit of the pedo-userbox issue: - a userbox that is inflammatory in that way by labelling Israeli activities as "hostility" and then supporting "resistance" (emo-plea for the underdog's "resistance") ..... I'm not sure that userboxes that pejoratively label <i>others</i> (especially others that are disapproved of) rather than describe the <i>user</i>, are helpful. That's probably a global thing -- "This user supports capitalism" is different from "this user supports destroying evil communism", so to speak. My $0.02 on userboxes generally. They comment on the user, and should not be a platform to express pejorative views. A pejorative of others can always be expressed in terms of a non-pejorative of oneself.

<dd>The main problem is that given the focus of Embargo's work thus far, and the fact that his userpage contains nothing but this box, the most natural reading is "I have a point-of-view and I'm here to promote it." In general, userboxes like this are often put up by new users who haven't yet been involved in a serious conflict, and aren't aware of the fact that strongly indicating a personal agenda is likely to intensify such conflicts. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 17:45, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Remove the editprotected. If there is no consensus yet for an edit, then there is no point in requesting an edit. If an edit is still discussed or waiting for feedback after announcing, editprotected can be added again later. Also, some edit requests for templates I have seen in the past are way too unspecific to be implementable. Requests for template edits should provide the new "code" for the template and a reference to the consensus or absence of opposition after due announcement. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 12:58, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's not so much a policy proposal as an experimental dispute resolution option I'll call <i>community enforced mediation.</i> For the present I'll host this in my own userspace. Established editors could research past arbitration cases and voluntarily place similar restrictions on themselves. Piotrus and Ghirla were agreeing to mutual civility parole. I've worked out a proposal to cover the details. This site lacks an alternative to ArbCom for content disputes with a user conduct dimension. On a selective basis I'm willing to fill that gap if the community approves the experiment. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 17:17, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Deleting things at Commons takes a really long time, at least as compared to en:, which is also typically backlogged in spite of having more than ten times the number of admins. One has to orphan the image from every project it is used by and check each project that the toolserver isn't accurately reporting on. Images with bad names are one of the lowest priority deletion tasks, so it really isn't surprising that it's badly backlogged. That said, Commons could use more admins willing to do this, so if there's someone here with some experience at Commons that was thinking about applying for adminship, please do step up. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 22:07, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Blocking users is supposed to be used as a means to prevent edit warring or other disruptive behaviour, not as punishment. In fact , the very second line of Wikipedia:Blocking policy states explictly and clearly that "Blocks are used to prevent damage or disruption to Wikipedia. They should not be used as a punitive measure." Today, <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">User:Durova</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Armon&amp;curid=8232443&amp;diff=105180226&amp;oldid=104828803" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Armon&amp;curid=8232443&amp;diff=105180226&amp;oldid=104828803" rel="nofollow">blocked</a> <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">User:Armon</a> for allegedly violating <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDALISM_fbc5.html" title="WP:VANDALISM">WP:VANDALISM</a> on <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_Media_Research_Institute_241e.html" title="Middle East Media Research Institute">Middle East Media Research Institute</a>. Given that the MEMRI page has been protected for several days, I can't see how this block of Armon, for actions he took several days ago is anything but a punitive measure, in clear violation of official Wikipedia policy. As a side note, the allegation that Armon's edits for which he was improperly blocked were a vioaltion of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDALISM_fbc5.html" title="WP:VANDALISM">WP:VANDALISM</a> are tenous, to say the least.

<dd>I was the other user, and it was not my idea to impose a block, but I think it was a good idea, as Armon was deleting sourced and relevant material without explanation. He didn't bother to explain his edits until after an edit war led to page protection (with his version of the page protected). It was good that an administrator stepped in. Users should not delete sourced content without explaining their edits and engaging in discussion. This block appears to have been imposed to prevent edit warring, not as "punishment." <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 18:33, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

It is unfair to speculate to the community about my frame of mind, and particularly so because my previous posts on the subject should have been sufficiently clear. Repeated deletion of properly cited material over several days, refusal to discuss the matter on article talk when requested, and attempts to mask the deletion of references by marking edits as minor constitutes clear reason for blocking...and I think it goes without saying that a brief block citing <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL</a>, the relevant policy, with a link to the first of that series of deletions is a <i>preventative</i> measure to remind that editor not to delete the references a fifth time once the article gets unprotected. My block notice even suggested two alternative means of resolving any conflict and explained the reason for the delay: I had been discussing the possibility of resolving the related conflict through alternate means. That editor has collected quite a few other blocks recently. I also went to the unusual length of placing an additional statement on the article talk page to clarify any policy confusion and recommend better solutions. No, the block was not solicited.

<p>There is no basis for this block in the relevant policy, which states: "<b>Vandalism</b> is any addition, removal, or change of content made in a <i>deliberate</i> attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia."

Good editors delete sourced material all the time, and well-sourced articles are often deleted, too. This is just the way Wikipedia works.

<dd>When the deletion of sourced material is made with deceptive edit summaries, mislabeled as "minor," without discussion, over and over, it is difficult to see them as good faith.

<dd>I did not call for the block; your use of evidence is extremely misleading. I suggested that if Durova thought a block of Isarig was warranted for his conduct that I think it would be a step in the right direction. That paragraph was not about blocking Armon, and in fact when I mentioned Armon's behavior earlier I made clear that I only did so in order to explain why you attacked me. I did accept Armon's apology, but I did so purely on good faith, since the evidence he used to support his explanation was completely misleading (he wrote "Read the edit summaries you are so obsessed with" and then linked "edit summaries" to a different one than the ones I had a problem with). Frankly, I do not find his explanation persuasive at all, but I accepted it on good faith because it appeared he was willing to discuss the issue once he had been called on his deceptive and disruptive edits. You will note that I continued to hold that those edits were deceptive. Please do not call me "disingenuous" here; the evidence clearly shows otherwise. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 22:37, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I did not post this notice here in order to get you scolded, I did it realizing that you may be off-line, so that other admins may review your actions and undue the improper block, which is what happened. Surely you don't expect your being off-line to be reason to hold off on any action? Suppose you had blocked someone inappropriately for 3 days, and then left on vacation? Would it be reasonable to wait for you to return before undoing your actions, just so that you will have a chance to respond?. I will not, however, retract my claim that your actions were a violation of WP policy, becuase I believe they were, and several editors here seem to agree with me. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 22:50, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>These assumptions of bad faith are inappropriate and disappointing. Durova acted in good faith in order to make sure the revert war didn't start up again when protection was lifted. I acted in good faith by overturning a block that I felt had no basis in policy. Durova and I have discussed it and it's over. I see that Beelzebarn who was reverting on that page too has turned out to be a sockpuppet of banned User:Marsden, which probably didn't help the atmosphere. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:31, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I object to speculations about SlimVirgin's motives as strongly as I object to speculations about my own motives. SlimVirgin has a superb reputation and I trust she would recuse herself if she felt political views might influence her decision.

<dd>I agree. Stubbornness and POV are pointedly examples of what <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#What_vandalism_is_not" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism is not</a>. I'm curious about the other point though; that this 24 hour block several days after the fact was an illegitimate use of blocks as punishment. If Armon had committed blatant and indisputable vandalism, would this block have been proper, or would that be using blocks as a punishment? <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 02:07, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I shouldn't have to clarify this yet again, but the deletion of properly cited material was what I defined as vandalism. I believe that's covered here:
<dl>
<dd><i>Removing all or significant parts of pages or replacing entire established pages with one's own version without first gaining consensus both constitute vandalism. Sometimes important verifiable references are deleted with no valid reason(s) given in the summary.</i> See <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html#Types_of_vandalism" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL#Types_of_vandalism</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Any other supposed reasoning such as content disputes, stubbornness, POV, etc. are simply red herrings. I never claimed those as reasons for blocking and strongly object to spurious allegations of that nature. The delay in action might be a valid reason for objecting to the block, but I believe I have explained what <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> should have relieved me of any need to explain: during that delay I was seeking alternative solutions to the related problems. I have already explained in detail why this block was not punitive and repeated claims to the contrary, which regurgitate points I already addressed, are inappropriate. This seems to be a case of <i>throw enough mud and some of it will stick.</i> If I have made an actual error I will gladly correct it, but I strenuously object to threads that proceed in the manner that this one has. False accusations resolve nothing. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 02:33, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This doesn't seem to be an example of removing "significant parts" of the page, and they seem to use edit summaries and the talk page which puts it into the "content dispute" bin as I see it, but the particulars aren't important. I'm sorry for attaching specifics to my hypothetical—I'm not accusing you of acting in anything other than good faith. I want to know for my own reference what the consensus is on blocking someone a couple of days after they committed their vandalism. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 02:42, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In the past I've blocked for deletion of properly cited material in the context of an edit dispute and those blocks have been uncontroversial. What mattered was not so much the total quantity of material blanked but that the material had full citation to reliable sources and the deletion lacked regular discussion or consensus. In making those decisions I typically weigh deceptive practices such as marking the deletion as minor and signs of uncooperative behavior such as repeating the deletions after requests for discussion - both of those events happened here. I hadn't anticipated that to be construed as controversial because of the obvious implications: if deletion of cited material is unactionable within the context of a content dispute, then disruptive editors could generate the appearance of a content dispute on any subject and inflict great harm to Wikipedia's database. That precept would be highly exploitable. I agree my delay was potentially objectionable and welcome feedback on that point, or on any other legitimate basis.

<li>Pat, is this for Bob Fink?

He has a serious problem with this. For example, if you searcht he web for references to his book <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-912424-06-0</a>, which he cites and represents as a major view in some articles, the <i>only</i> references appear to be Wikipedia and mirrors. I can't see a lot of evidence that his view here is mainstream, for example the theories he puts forward do not seem to coincide with my music texts. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Pseudoscience_f6ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience</a> reviewed a similar situation where a proponent of certain ideas was restricted from editing in respect of those ideas.

<dd>Hi Guy, Nope it's not Bob! Why was he blocked? I'll see what I can do to help him out instead of all these other weird sock puppetry cases. But I actually went to the UofO library and I have his books right here! It is a legitimate work and the irony is I remember using it back in high school for a history project on ancient greco-romain history... music instruments. I don't know if I may be biased because of this but I think I've seen similar theory repeated in newer publication through my studies in music. (I guess they cited Fink!)</dd>
<dd>Well I might as well just say, for the block thing, it is <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlivierd_19c8.html" title="User:Olivierd">user:Olivierd</a>, Benio76, etc... and let another administrator check out the IPs. We have been emailing each other the last 2 weeks and I think this could maybe use a second glance. He has been trying to contact the administrator that blocked him. The reason I didn't want to say the names is because I myself usually like to tr and contact the blocking adm. prior to doing anything. Unfortunately in this case I have decided not to do so. He has a convincing evidence that shows that there are in fact two different people. The IP's, If I could see this... (unfortunatelly I can't because my RFA failed ... but I'm not bitter! lol) according to Olivierd should show that most edits came from another location. He did however say his friend was editing from his home a couple time. Anyway. In short I believe there where infact two people and I don't think the block should be indefinate, considering they both have their own seperate registered websites with similar names to their respective alias' they use here on wiki. Anyway, I'm not asking for much, just a quick independant review of the checkuser results that where used. thank you! --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 05:22, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ah, another editor on a mission. You certainly pick 'em. You don't get an "independent" review of checkuser, because very few people are trusted with the checkuser tools, too much potential to violate privacy. Admins cannot see the IPs either. To all intents and purposes, what the checkusers say is gospel so you'll note they are quite cagey and even when two users edit from the same IP all we know is that they both used the same IP. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:20, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is a protracted issue at <a href="../../../o/b/l/Obligations_in_Freemasonry_9a28.html" title="Obligations in Freemasonry">Obligations in Freemasonry</a>, and I need one or two admins to assist in dispute resolution. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI">SeraphimXI</a> has been an ongoing problem on a few articles (most notably <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahbulon.html" title="Jahbulon">Jahbulon</a> and the aforementioned article). We assumed GF a long time ago, and that didn't last long, as she refuses to acknowledge the simple fact of what anyone says, because it's obviously "covering up Masonic secrets" (no matter how many times we say otherwise and show proof). When she cannot answer a question, she spins the whole argument back on itself by restating the history of the issue, or old arguments. This has become a persistent problem at this point, because we have a number of POV editors on this one article, and while I do not think that this can be resolved without an RFC or an ArbCom case, I am requesting admin intervention to try to avoid a protracted process, and I am posting here because, while I could ask a few of the "regulars", as it were, I would like an admin totally uninvolved with the Masonic articles to minimize any other nonsense. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 17:59, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to disagree with <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">User:MSJapan</a>'s characterization of the problem. The actual problem is with three Masonic editor who are triple-teaming to edit war, deceive, and to demand that other editors adhere to some undisclosed personal standards of these editors above and beyon what Wikipedia requires. The will not take simple answers to question, but spin every answer as inadequate. So far they have put deceptive comments on the talk page claiming that quotes don't match the source when in fact they do, trying to remove them on this pretense. This is actually a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> issue for these three editors. The best thing to do would be for an admin to mediate the discussion, and give these three feedback when they make unreasonable demands on other editors. <a href="../../../2/0/4/User%7E204.122.16.13.html" title="User:204.122.16.13">204.122.16.13</a> 18:58, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tagged the following categories for deletion last night (along with about 30 others that got deleted) and I wake up this morning to see that these were declined, saying "consider nominating at WP:CFD". The categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Category:Wikipedian salesmen</li>
<li>Category:Army of Serbia and Montenegro</li>
<li>Category:Armenian photographers</li>
<li>Category:Wikipedians from Kerala</li>
<li>Category:Wikipedians who love Basset hounds</li>
<li>Category:Wikipedians who listen to LBC 97.3</li>

<li>Category:Wikipedians in Merrimack</li>
<li>Category:Wikipedians in Papua New Guinea</li>
<li>Category:Wikipedians in the Isle of Wight</li>
</ul>
<p>You can look at my deleted edits to see the slew of others that were deleted. All of the categories are still empty and they have been empty for more than four days. Also, the few that have a CfD tag at the top are long closed, just nobody bothered to remove the cfd tags. I realize that the speedy criteria also says "If the category isn't relatively new, it possibly contained articles earlier, and deeper investigation is needed" but does "deeper investigation" mean to remove the tag and ask the person who tagged it to nominate them at CfD? I am asking if these do in fact qualify for speedy deletion as I originally tagged them, or not. If not, I'd like to know the reasons so I can better judge what qualifies as speedy, I spend so much time tagging things for deletion I thought I had it down correctly, but perhaps not. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 20:11, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(after edit conflict) Well, it was obvious he is going to say that he didn't feel they were speedy deletable (for whatever reason), and I didn't feel much could be resolved in a discussion consisting of me saying I felt they were and him saying they aren't, since we both know the criteria so it looks to me like the only possibility is a difference in opinion as to one of the aspects of CSD#C1, which a community consensus is required to determine. As to what that difference might be I'm not sure, but I was talking with another administrator today and they were hesitant to delete the categories themselves because the CSD criteria says a category must be devoid of content, and they were unsure if that literally meant ANY content (i.e. a description at the top of the category would count) or if it simply meant category members, as I have been under the assumption of. If that is an area of confusion then it would also be beneficial to bring it up here as to determine which is correct, since I think hardly any categories would be speedyable if that were in fact what the criteria meant. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 00:35, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>See for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sandpoint%2C_Idaho&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105438938" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sandpoint%2C_Idaho&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105438938" rel="nofollow">this change</a>.</p>
