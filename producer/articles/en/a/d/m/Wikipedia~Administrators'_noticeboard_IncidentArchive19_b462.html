<p>An Admin named RickK posted in response to my complaint to him about a User named JEZ. RickK told me this was the place to post a complaint about a user's general behavior. I was requesting RickK that a user named JEZ be banned, as explained below. If there is some other procedure to follow, please let me know. Thanks.</p>

<p>Request to Block User "JEZ"</p>
<p>Hello RickK,</p>
<p>I am writing to make a request that you block user JEZ. I do not know the actual procedure for requesting this, as I am new, but I will follow whatever procedure you have. I am making this request for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1) JEZ failed to make a good faith effort to engage in discussion over his alleged unhappiness with an article I was writing.</p>
<p>2) JEZ then engages in "sneaky vandalism" of this article, as such term is defined by wiki.</p>
<p>3) I then reported the "sneaky vandalism" and an Admin restored all the deletions made by JEZ's sneaky vandalism.</p>
<p>4) JEZ, by that time, had engaged in two cover-ups of his sneaky vandalism - (a) by subsequently posting his "reasons" for a selected number of edits, not even attempting to justify the most contraversial edits and deletions in his pretend-post-discussion; and (b) by then accusing me of starting a "flame war" with him requiring him to contact admins, after I had already contacted admins due to his sneaky vandalism, informed him of that, and posted a definition of sneaky vandalism on the article discussion page.</p>
<p>5) Since the time of the Admin decision to restore all text altered by JEZ -- and, by the way, much of that text changed by JEZ was not even written by me, but by other people who previously worked on this article, and had discussed it and reached consensus on their text -- Jez has engaged in personal attacks against me.</p>
<p>6) These on-going personal attacks, in retaliation for my correct and accurate accusation of his sneaky vandalism, and him being caught, and an Admin restoring the text, are in retaliation against me. He is posting on his talk page, repeatly, that I am an "idiot" and a "shrill fool" and complaining to an Admin that he needs to register his "displeasure" with me because I am a "shrill fool." At no time does he acknowledge what he did was wrong, and at no time has he sought to apologize to me. Instead he is compounding his initial bad faith, sneaky vandalism and cover-ups.</p>
<p>This person JEZ is, I believe, what is known as a "political hack" as his sneaky vandalism did not reflect his alleged objections to the article, and concerned old text, not "recent" changes, as well as text that informed the reader with material and interesting facts.</p>
<p>The article subject is JEB BUSH. The administrator who restored the article is MATANI2005. The administrator on whose discussion page JEZ has attacked me is JOY STOVALL, or JOYOUS.</p>
<p>I can provide other information if you need it.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering my request to ban JEZ. I was actually planning to let this all go, but his personal attacks against me have led me to now ask you to ban him, so that I can continue to write and edit in peace and in cooperation with others who have a genuine interest in sharing knowledge about the subject of the article.</p>
<p>SummerFR 17:45, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS Prior to JEZ's sneaky vandalism, this article had already been read by an Admin (Joyous) who had no objection to the article save the location of one link. I believe JEZ saw her favorable comment posted to me on my page, and, purposely did not disclose what he intended to change in his sneaky vandalism, knowing the article had already been found acceptable to an Admin.

<p><b>Comments:</b> <i>To copy and add slightly to what <a href="../../../b/i/e/User%7EBiekko_f159.html" title="User:Biekko">Biekko</a> wrote on the talk page:</i> Like countries argue about tiny irrelevant rocks in the middle of nowhere, Wikipedians argue about single sentence picture captions. The big deal here is whether the caption of the map should say "The designation (U.K.) is disputed" or "Ownership is disputed". I don't see why it matters but <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> contends that a dispute about these brackets is something separate from dispute about ownership. Users <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClemMcGann_9ec9.html" title="User:ClemMcGann">ClemMcGann</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_King_2192.html" title="User:Red King">Red King</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/e/User%7EBiekko_f159.html" title="User:Biekko">Biekko</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> have all reverted Jooler's edits on this. This issue does not need to get out of hand and we should be able to resolve it without flagging the page as disputed or protecting it. I invite all the involved editors to please try and reach an agreement on this rather minor point and ask of them all to refrain from editing the caption until some sort of a agreement is reached. I would also like other Wikipedians to have their say on the issue.</p>

<dd>It's not completely clear if those are all reverts, but if not they seem to be gaming it. He doesn't like the way it is, so he starts by changing it incrementally. Someone else reverts back. He then changes it more, and now his didn't count as a revert but the person reverting it has fewer reverts left. Is this as bad of a loophole with the 3RR as I see it as? --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 00:05, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>OK - this is absurd. I'm happy with the compromise and there is no longer any edit war. Everybody has cooled down, so why would there need to be a timeout for anyone at this point?

<p>JonGwynne requested I look at this and I have unblocked him. This is really a stretch of both the 3RR and the ArbCom. On the ArbCom side, limiting him to one revert a day may be reasonable up to a point; but the decision is incredibly broad: <i>any</i> article dealing with global warming for an indefinite period. Even murderers typically are let out someday.</p>
<p>To his actions: I saw someone making a sincere effort to explain his insertion and look for a wording that met the objections to his insertion. The different insertions, complained of as reverts, were not, IMO.</p>
<p>To the substance: I find it quite reasonable to have the single word "reconstructed" in the caption. A caption is supposed to be descriptive yet concise. When you show a chart of such detail, it is important to let readers (like me) know that we are looked at assumed and not actual data. The fact that the data is a reconstruction is not insignificant. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> Â®</a> 02:49, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand that a fellow by the name of Rush Limbaugh, who it seems has some kind of extreme rightwing talk show on the radio in the USA, recently mentioned Wikipedia and, according to the account I heard, described it as a leftwing encyclopedia.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> blocked me recently for a variety of reasons:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>These reasons are bogus in the extreme, could be send to apply to many other editors but were exclusively applied to me</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SlimVirgin was enforcing the will of a group (probably sockpuppets) who have agenda pushed in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_c079.html" title="Ward Churchill">Ward Churchill</a> article to the point that it is protected and marked with warnings as to its neutrality etc. It has been the battleground of competing groups of sockpuppets who have either added false claims against him or removed all claims against even if reported in the mainstream press and well sourced.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SlimVirgin (without warning) purported to block me for 24 hours for breaching the 3RR rule (which he'd earlier found that I hadn't breached!), unspecified edit warring and a false accusation of 'sockpuppetry'. He provided no reasons beyond this, no facts in support of it, proposed no process other than if you don't like it email me. I believe that offer was intended to improperly force a bargain over the content of the abysmal <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_c079.html" title="Ward Churchill">Ward Churchill</a> article. I am - I should say was - a new user so I am not aware of how things are meant to work but I can smell a deceitful abuse of power and this is one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The consequence of this is that I will not be editing at all. Let Wikipedia become owned by the online equivalent of the opinionated angry freaks that call up <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a>. Perhaps though the next time SlimVirgin blatantly abuses the blocking power he has been trusted with, he will be scrutinized. It is wrong for someone who has demonstrated a strong agenda (without even contributing to it!) on an article to selectively block editors who are not acting within that agenda. He is unfit to administer anything. He should be removed from any position of trust. He has abused it and undermined Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMarvin_acee.html" title="User:TonyMarvin">TonyMarvin</a> 11:29, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>In response to Tony Marvin's complaint about me, he was clearly warned, and furthermore appears to be engaged in sockpuppetry that is causing considerable disruption. Details as follows:</p>
<p>For the record, I know very little about Ward Churchill, have no POV about him, and haven't edited the article, except to revert the sockpuppetry yesterday and protect the page. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMarvin_acee.html" title="User:TonyMarvin">TonyMarvin</a> (<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonyMarvin_1fd9.html" title="User talk:TonyMarvin">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TonyMarvin_ab40.html" title="Special:Contributions/TonyMarvin">contribs</a>) has made 224 edits, most of them to <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_c079.html" title="Ward Churchill">Ward Churchill</a>, a controversial native American academic. Tony's edits have included POV and unencyclopedic contributions: his suggested intro kicked off with the claim that Churchill may not be an American Indian, and that he's being investigated for fraud, ethnic impersonation, and plagiarism. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ward_Churchill&amp;diff=12615454&amp;oldid=12615077" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ward_Churchill&amp;diff=12615454&amp;oldid=12615077" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> Even <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s intro manages to say something neutral about him. During the 12 or so hours leading up to his block, Tony reverted numerous times against the wishes of several editors, and was reported by <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> for a 3RR violation at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a> at 16:41, 21 Apr 2005. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AN/3RR#User:TonyMarvin" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AN/3RR#User:TonyMarvin" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></p>

I left a note on <a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonyMarvin_1fd9.html" title="User talk:TonyMarvin">User talk:TonyMarvin</a>, asking him to e-mail me if he felt the block was unfair, but he didn't. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATonyMarvin&amp;diff=12686379&amp;oldid=12647550" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATonyMarvin&amp;diff=12686379&amp;oldid=12647550" rel="nofollow">04:47, Apr 22, 2005</a></li>

<p>Regarding the suspicion of sockpuppetry, the page had been edited by several sockpuppets between Tony's first warning and his block. After he was blocked, four sockpuppets repeated his editing pattern and were blocked for having been created to violate 3RR. The page had to be protected and still is. Another four vandalized the talk page, one of them called Slamvorgin (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Slamvorgin_7f53.html" title="Special:Contributions/Slamvorgin">contribs</a>), who replaced the page contents with a personal attack against me. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AWard_Churchill&amp;diff=12651358&amp;oldid=12651336" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AWard_Churchill&amp;diff=12651358&amp;oldid=12651336" rel="nofollow">[21]</a></p>
<p>For the record, there are three remaining accounts suggestive of a link to TonyMarvin, who have also been engaged in disruptive editing.

Many of his edits are problematic with regard to content, but that's a matter for other pages. The problem with which I'm concerned is his English. It's appalling. It's so bad, that there are times when I really can't work out what he's trying to say, making the only option deletion. Moreover, he's convinced of his own linguistic abilities, to the point of "correcting" other editors' English and making quite strong attacks on their grammar, style, etc. He seems absolutely impervious to criticism. I don't normally comment on another editor's English, but instead quietly correct it; in his case, I've found it necessary to do so, with increasing bluntness — nothing gets through. He's started claiming that he's using Singaporean English, hence my problem (and that I'm using American English, or Irish grammar...). I suppose that his behaviour is just about bad enough for an RfC, but it's marginal, and anyway I'd rather not take that route if I can avoid it. There seems to be no other approach, though. Advice would be welcome. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 13:29, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've had a look at some of his edits. He doesn't seem to be acting discourteously or breaking policy. You told him that his actions were vandalism because you apparently dislike his use of English and you disagree with his use of {{gcheck}}. I don't understand why. This is a classic content dispute. Resolve it in the usual way and stop threatening him. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:20, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm afraid that this is nonsense; I can only assume that you were looking at the wrong User. One needs only look at <a href="../../../z/a/n/Talk%7EZanskar_7fae.html" title="Talk:Zanskar">Talk:Zanskar</a>, in which he repeatedly berates (in broken, barely comprehensible English) another editor for poor English, blanks the <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanskar.html" title="Zanskar">Zanskar</a> article and replaces it with a voting form with links to the original version and his version, etc. I was brought into this precisely because his behaviour had led to an RfC on <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanskar.html" title="Zanskar">Zanskar</a>. But if you don't think that page-blanking as part of an edit war is vandalism, there's little more that I can say. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:46, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, I think if his behavior is as you represent it that might require a RfC. Having poor English is hardly something we can blame somebody for (although I suspect I'm not alone in wishing that non-native speakers who have difficulty writing comprehensibly in English would simply contribute in their native language's Wikipedia instead), but being hostile towards those who try to help them and improve their work, and even berating others for poor English, is pretty bad. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:31, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In fact he insists that English is his first language, which is possible I suppose (though it's even worse than the average undergraduate's). He's apparently taken an editing holiday, so I'll wait until he returns before I decide on what action to take. I'd like to avoid anything as formal as an RfC, but perhaps that will be necessary in the end. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 13:14, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>English has been spoken in some Asian countries for hundreds of years, long enough for the language to diverge significantly from English used in the West. I agree that if he's behaving abusively and not responding reasonably to attempts to communicate with him then the next step (RfC) is appropriate. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:08, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am perfectly aware that there are other forms of English; over the past twenty or so years I have had many friends and colleagues and have taught many students from Singapore, Malaysia, etc. I'm also able to tell the difference between alternative styles of English and bad English. For Mr Tan's latest "correction" of an article, see the admittedly minor yet telling example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zanskar&amp;diff=12969016&amp;oldid=12962118" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zanskar&amp;diff=12969016&amp;oldid=12962118" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Are you claiming that changing a correct English sentence to one lacking a main verb or subject is just Singaporean English? I've no idea why you want to belittle or dismiss the problem like this, but it doesn't demonstrate a particularly helpful approach to the Wikipedia community. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 13:49, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That Mr. Tan is disruptive seems obvious. Whether it's malicious disruption or simple lack of competence is not obvious. I'd personally advocate an RfC - their usefulness in dispute resolution may be marginal, but they do tend to show how crazy a user is. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 14:04, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've finally felt forced to got an RfC.

<dd>The comment is false. I enjoy every bit of information that can be added to the page. Noisy's reverts deleted text I added, which benefits the page. I've requested for Noisy to discuss changes on the talk page many times in the past few weeks, but this entry of the 3RR is the only comment he has made on the talk page. Noisy has violated the 3RR, but I chose to try to dicuss it with him rather than block him. I've added other content to other pages; this one is just of a more active interest -- it's my family not my page. - <a href="../../../j/h/b/User%7EJhballard_c248.html" title="User:Jhballard">Mr. Ballard</a> 18:11, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Lantong maintains that the article states that John Money is part of queer theory - which the article does not. Hence he keeps removing that paragraph; in the past he also insisted of removing other bits of the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Queer_theory&amp;diff=12339914&amp;oldid=12337418" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Queer_theory&amp;diff=12339914&amp;oldid=12337418" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. He also claims to be an "expert" on the subject (don't we know that phenomenon) and clearly voices his intention to make this article his personal property: " I cannot begin expanding, until it is settled -- if not by "consensus" than by fact ...". Seth Ilys did not want to block him, see talk page, but I disagree; given his past behaviour, he needs to see a STOP sign before things get worse.
<ul>
<li>I left him a warning on his talk page and on <a href="../../../q/u/e/Talk%7EQueer_theory_4dc3.html" title="Talk:Queer theory">Talk:Queer theory</a>. He has clearly violated the 3rr, but as he has at least started talking, I felt like blocking him would only escalate the situation, and so I did not. Anyone other admin, of course, may, under WP policy. - <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESeth_Ilys_3523.html" title="User:Seth Ilys">Seth Ilys</a> 17:56, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>I've offered on numerous occassions to engage AlexR in dialogue ... requesting quotes, texts, specific references to the use of a reputed "serious researcher" Dr. John Money in relation to queer theory. So far, none have been offered. AlexR has used his admin status to bully not only myself but others, see his talk page for some illustration. A good bit of my editing involved moving paragraphs from one section to another to allow more flow to the article. I admit to removing content involving Dr. Money, as well as prostitution, as none of these subjects have been made to connect to queer theory through use of any specifics. Further, as the talk discussion shows, the use of Dr. Money as a source for the article remains offensive.--<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELantog_6b32.html" title="User:Lantog">Lantog</a> 18:45, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not an admin. I have not bullied him, nor any other. He refuses to address any points made, instead cluttering the talk page about his seemingly infailable status as an "expert".

<li>I don't see how he could honestly believe it's vandalism, as the text I restored was the original text and had been there for a while, it wasn't something I added to be snarky or anything. I'm sure he called it vandalism because I've been removing his vandalism to my talk page and decided to accuse me of doing what he was doing elsewhere.

<li>He made a couple of changes that I reverted along with the main one, but his next act was to revert to one of his edits. The fact that he reverted to one without those other changes he also did doesn't make it any less of a revert.

<li>The anonymous user has failed to discuss the changes even when the page is under dispute as specifically ask for discussion. The reverts appear more as a personal attack to undo information that may benefit the page, like mere citations and other forms of popular names for Joan of Arc.

<dd>Please see my comment several lines above for the link to the archive. There isn't a policy with regards to a time limit, but it doesn't seem reasonable, in my opinion, to block a user for a 3RR violation from two weeks ago. The fact that you moved the information off of the 3RR page leads me to believe that you no longer considered it a 3RR matter.

If the edit history is very important, then posting it on the regular pages is probably a better idea, as even when it is archived, the history will remain. If preserving the page <i>and</i> the edit history is important and you want to retain control of it, then perhaps it should be created in your user subspace, as long as you're linking to it anyway. With regards to 3RR, I disagree with blocking a user long after the violation. I view blocking for 3RR (which I actually have never enforced) and vandalism as control, not as punishment. This case <i>is</i> a bit unique as GRider was blocked for a week. Perhaps the thing to do in the future, were this to recur, is to e-mail some administrators and ask them to block, or at least to post it on the 3RR page on behalf of the user. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 23:55, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a content dispute at <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a></i> and various other movie-related pages about whether to include a particular external link. AndyL has waded into the dispute in a partisan way by reverting to his preferred version and then immediately applying page protection. I believe this is entirely inappropriate. I unprotected but he has now protected again.</p>
<p>He is also in the minority in this content dispute, since no less than 6 people including admins have been reverting the singlehanded attempts by <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMista-X_e9fc.html" title="User:Mista-X">User:Mista-X</a> to add (spam, in my opinion) these links to the various movie-related pages, and until AndyL got involved, Mista-X was singlehandedly reverting to his version against opposition from multiple other users.</p>
<p>See <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Matrix_1a4f.html#MIM_review" title="Talk:The Matrix">Talk:The_Matrix#MIM_review</a> and discussion at <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMista-X_d49a.html" title="User talk:Mista-X">User talk:Mista-X</a>, and AndyL's comments at <a href="../../../c/u/r/User_talk%7ECurps_e767.html" title="User talk:Curps">my talk page</a>. His comments at my talk page contain some strange rationalizations: <i>I didn't revert the article prior to protecting it. I protected an earlier version...</i> (!) This is true technically, since in fact he applied protection at 16:59 UTC, added a "protected" template at 17:01, and reverted the article to a prior version at 17:35.</p>
<p>The protection was extremely premature in any case, since discussion were taking place at various users' talk pages (since that is where Mista-X left his various comments), but the partisan way in which it was done was inappropriate. I hesitate to get into an admin war by unprotecting the page again, but perhaps some other admin might do so after assessing the situation. It was not appropriate for AndyL to abuse admin powers in this way in a mere content dispute.</p>
<p>In the face of interim consensus, the page should go to the status quo ante, and those who wish to change it should gracefully back off and seek a wider consensus through RfC or voting. This is the Wikipedia way. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 20:22, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Curps unprotected my protection using the excuse that "AndyL's user page says he is on wikiholiday until May 1; not appropriate to protect page under these circumstances" which seems to be a rather slim justification for lifting a page protection prior to there having been any discussion on the related talk page. There is no policy saying an admin on holiday cannot protect a page nor justifying quick reversal of said protection because of that. In any case, a perusal of my edits would make it clear to anyone that I was not on wikiholiday, in fact. Curps simply wanted the page unprotected and seems to have found the slimmest of pretexts for rationalising an unprotection prior to any discussion on the page's talk page of the edit war in question.

<p>You protected the page at 16:59, added a "protected" template at 17:01, but then reverted to your preferred version at 17:35. If you protect a page, you should not turn around and edit it yourself. You should not abuse your admin power if you are a partisan participant in a content dispute (particularly when the interim consensus is against you). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 20:50, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Background: <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMista-X_e9fc.html" title="User:Mista-X">Mista-X</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMista-X_d49a.html" title="User talk:Mista-X">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mista-X_a164.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mista-X">contribs</a>) has been adding external links to a fair number of movie-related pages; across these various pages, a total of 6 other users have reverted him (including some admins). One of these pages was <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a></i>. AndyL has now joined the content dispute, taking Mista-X's side. Protection was premature in any case, since there was active discussion taking place (at user talk pages rather than <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Matrix_1a4f.html" title="Talk:The Matrix">Talk:The Matrix</a>, since that is where Mista-X left his comments. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 20:53, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There would have been no incentive for going to the Talk pages had I protected the version you prefer and in any case, since the external link in question is not a violation of wikipolicy there's no reason to protect the version excluding it. I had intended to protect the earlier version to ensure Talk was used but erred and then corrected my error. That does not justify your editing a protected article.AndyL 20:56, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The person who edited a protected article was in fact yourself (and you were the one who protected it). I believe the justification you cite for doing so is a rationalization and doesn't hold water.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, the discussion which was previously scattered across user talk pages (because Mista-X left his comments there) is now at <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Matrix_1a4f.html#MIM_review" title="Talk:The Matrix">Talk:The_Matrix#MIM_review</a>. The page remains protected, but I think upon reflection you will agree that your 17:35 post-protection revert was perhaps not a good idea; I have applied your own 17:01 version. I will leave messages at the various user talk pages where Mista-X exchanged comments, and invite them to centralize the discussion at <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Matrix_1a4f.html" title="Talk:The Matrix">Talk:The Matrix</a> as you suggest. I believe we can come to a consensus in the usual Wikipedia way. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 21:07, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for "joining the debate" my comments were intended to facilitate and then to justify the protection. To whit:</p>
<dl>
<dd>On what basis do you disagree? What is the justification for removing the link besides the fact that some people disagree with the page's content? What policy, if any, does inclusion of the link violate? Given that there are external links to articles that discuss the Matrix from philosphical and Jewish viewpoints what is the objection to having a link to an article with a political take? AndyL 17:20, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mista-X has stated that he is neither a member of MIM nor a MIM supporter. The reverts, as far as I can see, have been carried out without any discussion in the Talk pages which seems to me to be a violation of wikipedia policy. Further, the reversions don't seem to be based on any wikipedia policy but simply on the fact that some editors dislike the links. Certainly the argument one editor put forward that they are POV is not a justifiable reason as all film reviews are, by definition, POV and that in any case there is no policy against POV external links. If editors are reverting without justification then the problem is with the reverting editors. All I would like is a discussion of the arguments in favour and against keeping the external links rather than a mindless editwar. If agreement cannot be reached than the parties should seek mediation, not enforcement of a majority view through superior firepower. AndyL 19:42, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The above comments are related to the content dispute, not to any alleged abuse of admin power. Therefore, this is not the place to reply.

<p>They are a response to your contestable claim that "AndyL has now joined the content dispute". In any case, if you wanted to contest the version protected you should have brought it up here, not taken it upon yourself to revert a protected page.AndyL 21:36, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Once again, the person who reverted a protected page was you, and you reverted it after you yourself protected it (timeline: 16:59 you protected, 17:01 you added the "protected" template, 17:35 you reverted). You did the very thing you are trying to accuse me of... in complaining that reverting a protected page is an abuse of admin power, you are actually damning yourself. You can either protect the page, or do an ordinary edit (revert), but not both in that order. It was appropriate for me to undo the latter (either by unprotecting or by returning to the original 17:01 protected version). Your doing a protect-then-revert clearly indicates that you were joining the content dispute, and your supposed justification (you had to revert in order to permit discussion to take place on the talk page) simply doesn't make sense at all. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 21:53, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"You can either protect the page, or do an ordinary edit (revert), but not both in that order."</p>
<p>Wrong. When one is protecting a page one is under no obligation to protect the latest version. It is quite common not to do that, in fact. Look at the protection log.</p>
<p>"Your doing a protect-then-revert clearly indicates that you were joining the content dispute,"</p>
<p>No, it indicates that I was correcting my mistake. If you wanted to contest the version of the page that I protected you should have brought it up here, not taken it upon yourself to revert a protected page. As I said, I was intending to protect the version that would ensure the parties involved went to talk. Protecting your version would not have done that. AndyL 22:29, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not for the editors who agree with the protected page.AndyL 23:26, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Additionally, you have failed to adequately defend your initial unprotection of the page. An act made with a dubious justification. AndyL 22:38, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You're both in the wrong, really:</p>
<ul>
<li>AndyL: Admins should not protect a page because of a content dispute and choose which version should be shown - articles should not be edited while protected.</li>
<li>Curps: You violated the 3RR and, while I understand your part the edit war, you should not be doing that especially on a protected article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully the discussion at the talk page can resolve this. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 18:54, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I protected the page because of an edit war that wasn't being discussed on the talk page though I agree I should have left the article alone once it was protected. AndyL 20:56, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>However, if Curps felt I was in the wrong he should have taken the matter here rather than unilaterally act to unprotect the page and do so using the dubious pretext that my page said I was on wikiholiday. AndyL 15:48, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is listed on VfU. It is repeatedly being undeleted despite the valid VfD vote. Undeleting an article before the VfU vote has run its course is exactly the same thing as deleting an article before the VfD has run its course, and the admin(s) who keep doing it should be treated exactly the same as I would be treated if I started deleting articles before the vote was over. I will not deal with this article after the VfU vote has completed its proper time, <i><b>and</b></i> after the person who undeletes it follows proper VfU process and relists it on VfD.

<p>This gentleman has had a bit of a tumultuous introduction to Wikipedia. He created an article Aaron Scott which was promptly (and rightfully) nominated on VfD. He then replaced the content with "DELETED BY THE ORIGINATOR." which I interpret as a request for deletion. It really isn't necessary for this to go through VfD; I was going to delete but then I thought it would be better to move it to the his user page. Problem is that the VfD notice says "Please do not ... move this article while the discussion is in progress." I don't want to violate any rules, but just want to use common sense. I am therefore closing the VfD and moving the article to <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronescott_6755.html" title="User:Aaronescott">User:Aaronescott</a>. If anyone objects, please note it here or on my talk page, and reverse my changes if you feel it appropriate. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 00:35, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>14:40, 24 Apr 2005 I partially restored it, deleting some of crime section in consideration of user 4.22x.X.X's "suggestions", with edit summary <i>why it was important for yale that this not be 'random murder'</i>, i.e. the piece I did not delete as 'redundant'.</li>

<dd>Erm, how can emulating a banned user ever be done in anything other than a bad way?

<dd>Say the banned user wrote good content about something or other, and a new user was behaving similarly to that. In any case, of course I see what the evidence suggests; I don't feel like looking into it, but I'm not all that concerned about the individual case. What concerns me is that Snowspinner can throw down a block without any proper justification beyond his opinion that it's a sock, without getting a developer check, and then declare "Bang!"—I guess he imagines himself as an old sheriff who shoots first and asks questions later. I know I'm supposed to just nod my head and accept that his actions are beyond reproach, but somebody ought to say something. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:33, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>It isn't just his opinion that its a sock. I posted the evidence in this section, Calton and I have been discussing it above, linking to more evidence. Deathpoenix's comment also suggests he agrees (although I haven't checked the timestamps of his comment and Snowpinner's block).</li>
<li>I trust him to review the evidence before acting.</li>

<li>This isn't like shooting someone in the Old West, blocks can be undone, killing someone can't</li>
<li>If you can't be bothered to look into the evidence how can you claim Snowpinner didn't act in accordance with it?</li>

<dd>That's false on both counts. RickK makes plenty of good decisions. I don't criticize him when I agree with him. As for Snowspinner, he seems to make abusive use of his admin powers more often than not. It seems pretty much all his activity on Wikipedia involves harassing people, and I can't really endorse that.

<p>I find it difficult to believe that there is any overt or implied threat of physical violence in Xiong's statement. That Xiong has taken such a strong stand wrt Netoholic is troubling, but it is hardly grounds for a block in and of itself. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 22:05, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've reblocked, clarifying that this is under the disruption policy for both the personal attacks against Netoholic and the violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> in listing TfD on VfD. I admit puzzlement to the objections here - normally I'm criticized for escelating things to the arbcom. This time I'm trying to deal with a disruptive user with more mild measures that give the user a chance of reform, and I'm power mad. Take your pick - either disruption goes through the block feature or the arbcom. I've sent this one through the block feature. Unblock, and I'm happy to just arbcom him for the continual disruption. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 22:44, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

It seems to me that Snowspinner and Netoholic seldom agree about anything, and it would have been easy for Snow to not interfere between Xiong and Netoholic.

<p><b>Comments:</b></p>
<p>This is a revert war about whether "poor social skills" as a trait of self-described vampires is ascribed by said self-described vampires themselves or by "detractors and critics" (and more recently, whether anyone ascribes it at all). Gabrielsimon provides no justification other than NPOV (although, in all the ways in which the statement's been presented, it's been clearly presented as an opinion), and DreamGuy offers no justification other than Gabrielsimon's motive - neither side has presented evidence despite an invitation to do so on the article's Talk page. (Although in DreamGuy's defense, he didn't add the sentence that's being re-re-reverted.) I think it will soon be time for some proper <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a>. For now, hopefully a short block will set both these guys a little straighter.</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielsimon_92ed.html" title="User:Gabrielsimon">Gabrielsimon</a> already has been blocked for violating the 3RR rule on the same article once before. He also has been nonstop harassing me on my talkpage for several days, for which vandalism reports and a request for assistance at the village pump have done absolutely nothing. He's completely unrepetant and has never made a change to an article I've seen yet that was not strongly biased. He should have been prevented from making any further changes a long time ago. I was taking pains to try to explain the concepts to him, but he insists upon labeling my restoration of a previous editor's additions as vandalism. I've also been trying to count reverts so as to not end up violating the three revert rule (see pass history of the page to see where I left the bad version solely for no other reason than for not getting into trouble with this policy even if it meant letting the other editor constantly get away with his biased edits) but apparently miscounted somwhere. I am getting thoroughly disgusted with Wikipedia at this point, as this person <b>constantly</b> harasses me and makes blatantly biased edits and nobody else seems to care or even responds to the help request or the vandal report I made. And <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">Nickptar</a>'s claim that nobody prevented evidence on the talk page is complete nonsense. If he'd bother to read the posts from before he ever showed up on that page (or looked when i pointed them out to him) he'd see that it was already explained, but instead he just keeps asking for evidence over and over that is already there. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 03:46, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, I am sorry for being frustrated and putting my frustration in that bit above. Since then Gabrielsimon tried yet again to report *me* for vandalism, and for the edits in the revert war mentioned above of all things. Some admins have stepped in to say he was out of line and even go so far as do the reverts to the page in question above for me (but of course Gabrielsimon reverted that too, not sure how many reverts that makes it for him). I'm now feeling a bit better about the Wikipedia experience in that eventually some people show up to support me for doing what Wikipedia is supposed to be about. If you need to ban me for the screw up on the miscount of reverts earlier, feel free, it's only fair. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 12:04, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While doing an RC patrol, i came across <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> (<a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrace_Note_389c.html" title="User talk:Grace Note">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grace_Note_c9c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grace Note">contribs</a>) removing {{cleanup-notability}} tags from several article. The majority of these article were school related articles, a contentious issue here on Wikipedia. The reasons he gave for the remove of the tag were the following. (these are only from article in which i contested his removal of the tag)</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Labelling schools as not notable is trolling. Please stop doing it.</i></li>
<li><i>Labelling particular types of article as not important enough is tantamount to trolling</i></li>
<li><i>Please don't use this tag on articles that you know some people feel are important.</i></li>
<li><i>Please don't tag schools as unimportant.</i></li>
<li><i>It's a terrible article but some believe schools are important. Please don't misuse these tags.</i></li>
<li><i>Please don't misuse these tags on schools.</i></li>
<li><i>I know. It's rubbish and probably should be deleted. So do the VfD, all above board.</i></li>
<li><i>See other schools with this tag.</i></li>
<li><i>This is already marked as a stub. That indicates that it needs expanding. No other notice needed.</i></li>
<li><i>Already marked as stub.</i></li>
<li><i>Mark as a stub, not cleanup.</i></li>
<li><i>Better to use stub than cleanup, which it doesn't need.</i></li>
<li><i>inappropriate tag changed to stub</i></li>
</ol>
<p>The vast majority of the tags were placed by <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> (<a href="../../../v/e/g/User_talk%7EVegaswikian_d6a2.html" title="User talk:Vegaswikian">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vegaswikian_9ca0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vegaswikian">contribs</a>), whom Grace Note has accused of being a troll, with several also being placed by <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Allen3_3dda.html" title="Special:Contributions/Allen3">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Android79_a330.html" title="Special:Contributions/Android79">contribs</a>). Based on the edit histories of the users who placed the tags on the articles, i have no reason to suspect that any of the users that were trolling any school related articles in anyway, more then likely the user seems to have been engaged in RC or RP patrol at the time that.</p>
<p>Though i do believe that the actions taken by Grace Note are seriously bordering on trolling if not editing in bad faith. GN also put a comment on Vegas talk page, that combined with the statements that the user left on my talk page leads me to believe that he is, and i do mean this in a slightly joking way, part of the militant faction of school inclusionist that have been found here on Wikipedia. Also based on his comments, and his somewhat knowledge of the Wikipedia workings, the user leads me to believe that it has been involved with Wikipedia longer then his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Grace_Note" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Grace_Note" rel="nofollow">User contributions</a> would lead us to believe, which based on his edits would still put in (IMO) as a noob, which raises sockpuppett questions of this user.</p>
<p>I am not going to said what was said between the users, all can be found be appropate talk pages, if any "administrator" needs a clarification of my position, please feel free to contact me threw my talk page. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">comhrÚ</a> 08:55, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>NOTE: I couldn't help but notice the broken link, so I fixed it. Wiki-links use a verticle bar (|) and double [[]], BUT external links use a space ( ) and only single []. Hope that helps you!</dd>
<dd>Since I fixed the link I can't resist sticking my oar in, even though it's probably not wanted, but I'm going to ramble on regardless!</dd>
<dd>It seems to me that Grace's "all schools must be saved!" mentality has blinded (her?) to the fact that they are still supsceptible to Users' (non)-notablility concerns the same as with any other pet topic page. NO page should ever be percieved as automatically protected unless there is a matching clause in one of the semi-/policy pages to back it up, and yet Grace has worded (her?) statements as if they are authoritative and not to be questioned under any circumstances. Note that I say "blinded", rather than implying any sort of intentional maliciousness on the part of the User, that it is, that good-<i>intentioned</i> actions overpowered good <i>reasoning</i> actions.</dd>
<dd>However, Boothy443's sockpuppet suspicions seem to me to be fairly well-founded, but, again, I'm not in any way condemning, merely seconding this suspicion. But it could be the User merely guessed at Boothy's experience (rather than manually checking) and so deemed (her?)self the elder. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 10:45, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These are extremely controversial templates in no way represent Wikipedia policy. In fact, the statement that something may not be "important" enough to be in Wikipedia is a very serious misstatement about Wikipedia deletion policy. There is a <i>proposed</i> policy (<a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a>) but this enjoys no great consensus and is extremely controversial (<a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia_talk%7EImportance_cac4.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Importance">Wikipedia talk:Importance</a>). I think it's fair to describe the systematic misrepresentation of one's opinion as Wikipedia policy as trolling. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:38, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The template in no way states that it represents a policy - and in fact, many templates used on Wikipedia don't represent a policy. The template simply states that "If you are familiar with the subject matter, please expand the article, or explain on its talk page why it is notable. If no expansion or explanation is provided, this page may be nominated for deletion." That is a lot nicer than nominating it for VfD outright, isn't it?
<ul>
<li>The template was earlier nominated for deletion, and kept (<a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_Not_deleted_April_2005_0b91.html" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/Not deleted/April 2005">here</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do, however, agree that the school issue is troublesome, and would really prefer if both parties somehow found a compromise. Adding 'NN' templates to a lot of schools is just as spurious as removing them all. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 12:51, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The wording of the template is as follows: "The subject of this article might not be notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia.". That is a false statement. There is no established Wikipedia policy on notability. It is a falsehood. However this falsehood can be addressed by editing the template. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:09, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm in the camp in the cross-fire. I think some schools should be included others shouldn't. I think there needs to be enough material to actually write a solid article, so I tend to find cleanup tags more fitting than importance tags (they'll spur disputes anyway). If no actual info is conveyed in an article, it should be either expanded or deleted. <b>BEEFSTEW</b> is a good way to assess the worth of a school article. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:55, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's clear enough to see what has happened. I object to people pushing the POV that there are subjects not important enough to include in WP in this way. There are other forums for expressing that view. I'm unapologetically in favour of a broadly inclusive encyclopaedia but I understand others have their own views and, because I staunchly support both the NPOV policy and the right of editors to right as their conscience dictates, I have no problem with that. I put a polite notice on Vegaswikian's page because I felt that as a very new user he might not be aware of the contention surrounding this issue. Boothy, a user I've never encountered before, slammed a rather rude message on my page. I'm not sure why he thinks I'm trolling. Anyone can see from my contributions that I often pick random pages to copyedit, and I happened on one with this tag. I had a look-see to see what other pages it had been used on. I think it's wrong to push this particular view through what appear to be "official" notices, particularly where those using them don't attempt to communicate the originating editors. It seems to be the standard-issue complaint these days though. Call someone a troll and that excuses any sort of personal mudslinging you want to indulge in. The other guy's just stirring. I'm here to work on an encyclopaedia, not indulge people who have a bone to pick. Too many articles in need of my tender mercies to waste too much time on satisfying the needs of these fellows.

<li>I don't believe that <i><b>anyone</b></i> has said that schools, in and of themselves, are "subjects not important enough to include in WP". As far as I know, each school's importance has been judged on a case by case basis. On the other hand, there <i><b>are</b></i> several people who are under the belief that <i><b>all</b></i> school articles, no matter how ridiculous, no matter how non-notable, no matter what the content of the article, are, sui generis, required to be kept. Now, how's being pedantic? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 22:26, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, Rick, I'm certainly not going to take you on for pedantry but I will indulge you since you are, I know, interested in this issue as a broader question. I think it's closer to the truth that some believe that schools must establish their "importance" in ways other things do not. That's to say, they're not in themselves important enough, which is what I said. Rick, I think we need to distinguish between the ideas that <b>all schools are important</b> and <b>all school articles are good enough</b>. I certainly subscribe to the first idea, because I'm of the belief that the bar to entry for a nonpaper encyclopaedia can and should be low; but I do not sign up to the second. I don't either think that my belief in the first idea trumps anyone's not believing it! We can have a difference of opinion without feeling that that must inevitably lead to conflict. What I'd be much more interested in would be mutual recognition of the value of the views, and an attempt to find middle ground. I don't think that this is served by slapping these tags on to school articles (or, necessarily, by routinely keeping <i>any</i> school article without attempts to clean them up).<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 06:58, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Since I'm clearly "the other guy" I will keep stirring! I should point out, though, that I made my comments far more generous and non-accusatory than the others have since... I agree many schools are worthy of inclusion here, but it seems to me that some that Schoolwatch has saved should have been deleted. Not to say Schoolwatch is inherently "evil" but some members of it perhaps conform to its guidelines a little *too* closely. I agree the template seems to be erroneously worded, and, regardless of the outcome of this little incident, it MUST be looked at and reworded. We cannot have future problems resulting from it. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 00:52, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Kim's actions do not seem to go beyond anything any editor could do. I fail to see why this merits discussion on this board—not everything admins do should appear here because they're admins. I find it highly unlikely that what you mention can be generalized in some way to be put up as a valuable lesson for all admins on "how not to do it". "Incidents" is not a neutral word; don't slap things on this board too hastily. Your disapproval is elevated to something the whole adminship community should review, which is arguably going too far.</dd>

<dd>Correct me if I'm wrongly filling in the details on any of this. From where I stand, this seems like a classic case of misinterpreting (or overinterpreting) someone's actions.

<dd>this <i>is</i> the right place for informal complaints about admin behaviour, which is exactly what Mel was doing. "voting is not permitted" is not a corollary of "WP is not a democracy". We do have lots of votes, we just cannot vote to disregard policy. The problem seems to have been resolved, but it is presicely the purpose of this board to ask for opinions when admins think they risk clashing with other admins. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:51, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small>

No opinion on Kim's "voting" comment, which I regard as valid a personal opinion as any others, admin or no.

<dd>I'm very careful with my words, and I have already done my best to address all of Mel Etitis' concerns clearly, concisely and adequately at the appropriate times. This means that either he has missed something, or that I have been unintentionally unclear. Since I don't want to repeat myself here, I suggest that Mel Etitis check back what has already been written to discover where this misunderstanding stems from. If I have missed anything pertinent, he should be advised that I am quite approachable on my <a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKim_Bruning_6ded.html" title="User talk:Kim Bruning">talk page</a>, which I hope he'll turn to ahead of AN/I in future. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 15:32, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What JRM said, and thanks to JRM for digging out the pertinent quotes from the daunting archives at <a href="../../../t/e/a/Talk%7ETeach_the_Controversy_27d4.html" title="Talk:Teach the Controversy">Talk:Teach the Controversy</a> and setting up an overview here, so we can all more easily see the posts Mel refers to. To say that Kim and the others "appeared suddenly" on the talk page of an article they hadn't edited seems to be intended as criticism, but I totally don't understand why. Doing just that is generally supposed to be a helpful and useful thing, in case of content conflict and acrimony. We even have a special page, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a>, devoted to asking people—"outsiders", non-editors of the article—to go to the talk pages of conflicted articles and post comments on them. This is because calm outsider eyes and voices are considered to be promising remedies when a conflict has started to feed on itself. And, while I admit I can't face reading through all those archives, how can it be wrong to call for consensus instead of majority vote? That <b>is</b> the wiki way. If Kim Bruning, of all people, is supposed to behave "oddly", Wikipedia needs more oddness, not less.--<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 16:31, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This probably isn't really the place for a discussion on voting, but I wanted to add an opinion. Traditionally, voting has certainly been highly discouraged - we work by consensus, not democracy. Voting can easily shut down the options, making both sides dig into their positions and neglect to attempt to find mutually acceptable solutions. Polling can be useful at times to clarify the current thinking of contributors - but certainly shouldn't be the be all and end all of decision making on Wikipedia. Kim perhaps put this a little more strongly than I would have done, but the sentiment is very valid. Jimbo's talk at Harvard this week touched on this. The <a href="../../../j/i/m/Wikipedia%7EJimbo_Wales_discussion_at_Harvard_Law_School%2C_April_25%2C_2005_bf4c.html" title="Wikipedia:Jimbo Wales discussion at Harvard Law School, April 25, 2005">transcript</a> doesn't seem to have caught it all, but basically he talked about voting being of limited use on Wikipedia, and that even where we do use it (he mentioned VfD) it is best used as a form of dialogue rather than as a simple numbers game. Recently there has been a move towards more voting on Wikipedia, in my opinion this is very anti-wiki and should be discouraged. We need to get back to the ideal of consensus - hard as it can be with the larger community we have now. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 16:46, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sannse as usual is full of good sense. Now, it isn't correct to say that voting isn't _permitted_ on wikipedia -- we hardly ever have such firm rules. You can't really say it that way. Voting (in a non-binding poll) can be a valuable tool for gaining consensus, though. In many cases where I might feel the majority is wrong, I'd still tend to tell myself to relax if I found that 95% of editors disagree with me. But usually it's better to engage in reasoned discourse to try to find a creative way to resolve the disagreement.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 23:43, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A few responses to comments above.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>I certainly didn't mean to imply that there's anything wrong with "outsiders" contributing to a Talk page which has seen long and acrimonious disagreement, though doing so in order either to leave inaccurate claims about what's permissible on Wikipedia, or merely to leave slogans about voting, is at best unhelpful.</li>
<li>Whatever might be said about voting, the plain fact is that voting <i>is</i> permissible on Wikipedia, and to state that it is not is therefore to make a false claim. It's as simple and as straightforward as that. If Kim Bruning had said that voting isn't encouraged, or that votes shouldn't be allowed to take the place of discussion and consensus, or any of a number of perfectly true claims, I shouldn't have objected. It is not, however, merely a case of putting things too strongly; voting is permisible, and he stated that it wasn't.<br />
This is all independent of any view of what Wikipedia policy on voting <i>should</i> be; it concerns what the policy actually is, and what Kim Bruning claimed that it is. I find it disheartening that so many editors should care so little for the importance of restricting ourselves – whether as admins or non-admins, but especially as admins, whose claims about policy are often taken as authoritative – to the truth.</li>
<li>"In general, only long-running disputes should be the subject of a poll" [In general, only long-running disputes should be the subject of a poll]. It doesn't take an exhaustive or detailed trawl through the archives to show this was a long-running dispute. I had come to the page because of an RfC, and had tried to mediate between two entrenched sides, each pushing a strong PoV, mainly <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorpalBlade_6ce8.html" title="User:VorpalBlade">VorpalBlade</a> (<a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVorpalBlade_303a.html" title="User talk:VorpalBlade">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_VorpalBlade_7c0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/VorpalBlade">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> (<a href="../../../u/n/g/User_talk%7EUngtss_7624.html" title="User talk:Ungtss">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ungtss_96ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ungtss">contribs</a>) on one side and <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Pitchford_f7f8.html" title="User:Ian Pitchford">Ian Pitchford</a> (<a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIan_Pitchford_edcb.html" title="User talk:Ian Pitchford">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ian_Pitchford_ef57.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ian Pitchford">contribs</a>) on the other. There were times that I thought consensus was near, but it never really came (or it came and was immediately disrupted). The vote/poll seemed to be the only sensible way forward. Kim Bruning's false statement that voting is impermissible affected that poll, and was certainly (see the Talk page) the reason that some Users gave for supporting the idea of a VfD.</li>
<li>Finally, I pointed out all of this on the Talk page, and on the VfD page; I don't think that any of Kim Bruning's responses were adequate, but they're there for others to judge. I couldn't (and still can't) see the point of repeating them on his Talk page. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 22:23, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Perhaps it would help diffuse misunderstandings to simply use softer words such as, "Just remember that votes are not binding. It is better to think of them as opinion polls."

<p>I found some rather odd looking edits and new articles last night, and decided that the user was trolling. I reverted and speedied some material that looked trollish. Because this is a very subjective judgement and I have implicitly failed to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> I request a peer review of my actions.</p>
<p>The first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Victoria_Moy&amp;timestamp=20050426233642" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Victoria_Moy&amp;timestamp=20050426233642" rel="nofollow">hint of trolling</a> was a very strange new article about someone called Victoria Moy (only administrators can use this link because the article was deleted). It looks to me like marginally plausible twaddle, and the unencyclopedic style tipped the balance. Another article was one called "Hyper-intelligent" which gave a nonsensical dicdef ('An adjective which describes hyperactivity as a sympton of high intelligence'). Nobody is that dense. See [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Tony+Sidaway" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Tony+Sidaway" rel="nofollow">my deletion log</a> for more.</p>

<dd>An interesting case. His/her edits up to 19:14 yesterday (the comment at <a href="../../../b/a/i/Talk%7EBai_Ling_cbee.html" title="Talk:Bai Ling">Talk:Bai Ling</a>) appear to have been made by a semi-new user - familiar enough with us and our processes to be adding images but not always doing it in a smooth fashion. My take on the case up to that point was an anonymous user who finally decided to create an account.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The edits after that point suddenly change topic and become much more speculative. He/she added several dicdefs with incorrect definitions (one speedy deleted, one I just nominated for VfD), a harmless but probably pointless redirect and a small number of POV edits to existing articles which were all reverted (only some by Tony). The deleted article on Boss Models was a sub-stub whose only facts were largely incorrect, though there really is such a modeling agency. The deleted article on Farene was a "secret society" variant - inherently unverifiable. The deleted article on <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male_supermodel.html" title="Male supermodel">male supermodel</a> (since independently recreated as a redirect to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermodel.html" title="Supermodel">supermodel</a>) was a POV rant but not outrageous. The deleted Victoria Moy article qualified as patent nonsense since it consisted of three utterly unrelated sentences.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I probably would have used VfD rather than speedy deletes for all but Victoria Moy and might have worded the comments on the user's Talk page a little differently. But overall I think you were correct to be suspicious - especially since at least some trolls have announced their intention to create accounts with innocuous contribution histories before launching their vandalism campaigns. (Does anyone still have the link to that claim?) I would probably give this user a bit more rope and see what happens. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 14:32, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Odd. Overall it looks to me like the work of an Asian teenager with a slight English language barrier. Probably not malicious IMO, just mildly clueless. The second two sentences in Victoria Moy go together, it's just not clear how they relate to the woman. Farene was unverifiable (at least for an English-speaker), but we'd need a Chinese editor to tell us if it's implausible. The only things that look trollish to me are the RC and VIP listings. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 20:32, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

They originally were involved in editing disagreements on various articles, but have given up all pretence of being interested in anything but harassing him. The only thing that I can think of doing is to permanently block each one as it appears (which is why I'm now included in the attacks, but I'm only incidental); is there another approach? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 08:45, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, I initially did not want to do this, but since Jon started with the above here we go again. User JonGwynne is known for his reverts and edit wars and is under parole. According to the ArbCom ruling <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_JonGwynne_a62b.html#Final_decision" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/JonGwynne">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/JonGwynne#Final_decision</a> he "is limited to one revert per 24 hour period on articles related to global warming; violations shall be interpreted as violations of the three revert rule."</p>

<dd>Yes, but this article isn't related to global warming. If this was a mistake on your part, I'll accept your apology. If you did it deliberately then shame on you.--<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonGwynne_1879.html" title="User:JonGwynne">JonGwynne</a> 06:27, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>JonGwynne now changed his strategy and makes small revert-like edits to circumvent the 1RR. If you look into the version history you see that his edits are reverted not only by me, but also by Vsmith, by WMC and even by Cortonin.</p>

<dd>Geni, please be more careful in the future. My 1-revert restriction is for articles on global warming only and "Scientific consensus" doesn't really qualify.--<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonGwynne_1879.html" title="User:JonGwynne">JonGwynne</a> 06:27, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
