<p>As this is an encyclopedia, I'm wondering what the benefit to Wikipedia is of her presence, and I'd like to know whether anyone agrees that the account should be blocked.

<dd>My experience with this user is limited, but I do have some, and it hasn't been positive. She was extraordinarly rude and disruptive at <a href="../../../z/a/t/Zatanna.html" title="Zatanna">Zatanna</a> over a fairly minor issue. I believe, if I'm remembering correctly, that I also blocked her there for violating 3RR. While blocked for 3RR several anons began to show up to continue reverting. The article remains protected, in part because she (and other users) cannot agree on this continuing problem.

<p>I'm not an admin, but I've been watching this user quite closely. She is an unrepentent edit warrior on multiple pages. She has an uncanny knowledge of Wikipedia's politics for being here just two weeks. She's been attacking and disparaging multiple users. Blocks of ever-increasing length is a good strategy, until/unless someone can confirm whether she's a reincarnated banned user. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 19:19, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am convinced they are one-in-the same based on some specific editing quirks of both users.

There were at least two others like this that I saw. Given the timing of her block, I also strongly suspect it was her behind User:N000 (see its deleted revisions, if you don't mind waiting a long time for it to render), User:Saveus, and the other two IPs I blocked on the 1st in relation to this whole mess. —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 19:31, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am 100% convinced she is a reincarnation of SOME long-time user, banned or not - nobody truly new leaps into Wikipedia and instantly starts MULTIPLE wars on known contentious subjects and knows how Wikipedia works like that. I haven't seen any credible theory on who she might be a reincarnation of, however. The sockpuppetry allegation should be checked out, that's for sure. I would support blocks for excessively warring behaviour; we are here to produce an encyclopedia, not to argue as a goal in itself. —<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 19:43, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I met MSK when she was replacing pics of Jimbo with those of a video-game megamaniacal warlord and I was doing vandalism patrol. After a few 'pleasant' comments on my appearance in the photo on my userpage I made a joke, she felt bad, and we have since gotten on fine. She is a handful to be sure, but does make some constructive contributions to the article space from time to time. My favorite editor? No. (that'd be <i>me</i> of course)... but not beyond hope or redemption.

<dd>um anyway joking aside I'm not a vandal or whatever and I'm definitely no-one's sockpuppet: And those other people (Mr Data, CSB and N00000) are NOT me: I bet SlimVirgin never even checked first - *They were* internet friends though, but in getting people to help me I was just doing the same as what Yuber was doing at the time: going round to other editors and getting them to revert for him:</dd>

<ul>
<li>Labelling the Pro-Islam source "evidence" while the other is a "claim" is wrong: they're both claims as I tried to point out, I talked to <a href="../../../s/v/e/User%7ESvest_a04b.html" title="User:Svest">Svest</a> (<a href="../../../s/v/e/User_talk%7ESvest_825f.html" title="User talk:Svest">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Svest_0525.html" title="Special:Contributions/Svest">contribs</a>) and he was ok with it after I explained in more detail on his talk page and pointed Yuber towards that but he wasn't interested and carried on revert-warring</li>
<li>And it's <i>true</i> that there's no way someone could end puberty at <i>9</i>. I mean come on, that's a relevant observation: It's a sick joke to say someone at 9 is post-pubescent.</li>

<dd>I already am. Your definition of "constructive" seems to mean nothing more than "let my friends walk all over you and revert war all they want" though: This is what's been going on recently. If anyone's "stalking" anyone it's Yuber and Farnhansher doing it to me. For example how Yuber tells him to go around reverting every edit I make all the time on articles he's interested in back to his own personal POV which often include unsourced personal opinions, original research and clear bias: For example like in Aisha how he was venhement in labelling the one saying about that Aisha may have been older as "evidence" and the others as "claims" and reverting when I tried to change this to say both as claims (NPOV): He does this kind of stuff all the time and when he needs help in revert wars he goes to you and you help him: You block my friends claiming they're sockpuppets with no evidence, yet his group of reverting anonymous IPs (with just as much evidence, often with no other contributions than reverting) that appear occasionally when needed are ignored out of hand --<i><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMistress_Selina_Kyle_f76f.html" title="User:Mistress Selina Kyle"><span style="color:#18186b;text-decoration:underline">Mistress Selina Kyle</span></a> <sup><b><span style="color:#800080">(</span></b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMistress_Selina_Kyle_04f4.html" title="User talk:Mistress Selina Kyle"><span style="color:#18186b;cursor:help;">Α⇔Ω</span></a> ¦ <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mistress_Selina_Kyle_1a28.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mistress Selina Kyle"><span style="color:#18186b;cursor:help;">⇒✉</span></a><b><span style="color:#800080">)</span></b></sup></i> 01:36, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Your sole purpose in making the edit was to underline that <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, believed to be a prophet by Muslims, was a nasty old pedophile, which shows a lack of knowledge about male-female, male-male, and possibly female-female, sexual relations during that period.

I was assuming good faith believing they are really newbies! A few weeks later, still assuming good faith but this time believing I was totally wrong!</p>
<p>One more issue. I am not a fun of <i>festivals</i> of userboxes (I got enough though) but i saw the user creating havoc and anarchy in the community re the issue, which i personally consider it is not the first thing we need here. We need good editors, editing and avoiding useless controversy. I mean, seriously, we have some weird userboxes (i avoid to name them wikiboxes to not participate in their spread and be accused of conspiracy) and see that as a sign of individuality in wikipedia that i am against.</p>
<p>MSK, appart from the non respect of policies (being blocked more than enough) and the amount of conflicts they have had with tens of wikipedians, including myself in the case of <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a> and its relative <a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html#Aisha_-_your_revert_war" title="User talk:FayssalF">discussion</a>.

<li>I'm not an admin, but I'm going to disagree. Looking at the "evidence" of disruption available on this page, I see hardly anything worth a block (with the exception of the vandalism to <a href="../../../i/a/i/Iain_Lee_0c3f.html" title="Iain Lee">Iain_Lee</a>), much less an indefinate one. Looking over her block log, I can see only six or seven blocks that were not a) two admins blocking at the same time for the same offense, b) a block to reblock, or c) <s>blatant corruption</s> innappropriate interpretation and application of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. Looking at the evidence initially provided by SlimVirgin, I have a few things to say. First, there is no rule against re-structuring your talk or userpage. Changing headers on your user talk page is not innappropriate behavior. Second, I fail to see any evidence in the diffs provided of innappropriate removal of talk page comments. Third, when Mistress Selina Kyle editted SlimVirgin's comment on her talk page, it was to correct the diff she had provided. SlimVirgin had linked to a diff where MSK was removing a blatant personal attack - MSK corrected the link to point to where she implied the user was a fundamentalist muslim. Certainly not "hiding" anything - in fact, being so polite as to point it out to you. Mistress Selina Kyle is disruptive at times, I'll grant that, but I fail to see any egregarious violations of policy. Just my two cents, for what it's worth. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 08:40, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that short blocks applied liberally for specific bad edits may be less controversial than an outright indefinite block. (I'm not saying I particularly disagree with the block in this case tho.)

<dd>A sock check was very informative: Mistress Selina Kyle is a vandal. Of the five IP addresses she uses, two belong to a hosting company (unusual) and one of those is shared with at least two dozens vandals of the worst sort, including at least one incarnation of Willy on Wheels.

Now you can feel free to act however you like without fear of reprisals. This is User:Zordrac/Poetlister all over again.

<dd>Maybe it would make for a better atmosphere if you tried to understand his upset. He seems to have misconceptualised the situation but slamming him won't fix his misconceptualisation, will it? Be gentle. I don't think Kelly's "evidence" proves much. So she uses a hosting company. Does it issue IPs on the fly? If so, MSK has the misfortune of sharing a hosting company with vandals, and so much for "research". I daresay she uses them because she was banned under a previous name. I agree that MSK is more trouble than use, but it seems to me she's fuelled more by overenthusiasm than malice (the one silly vandalism aside). It surely would have been more friendly to block her for a couple of weeks to think about whether she wants to contribute constructively, and to place her on a revert and PA parole (by which I mean suggest that she should <i>agree</i> to both and <i>agree</i> to be blocked for a week for a breach -- paroles are after all supposed to be agreements on the part of the person who has been punished). You have to ask yourself whether you can believe that she genuinely wants to contribute. Some -- and I don't blame them, SlimVirgin in particular, who has been sorely tried -- are going to think not, but I like to be positive about people -- assuming the best I can about them -- and I think she should at least be given a shot at redemption. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 09:11, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hosting companies are almost always (I've yet to find a single counterexample) instances of CGI open proxies. A normal user will not get an IP from a hosting company. If she (or anyone else) used two IP addresses from a hosting company, both should be indefinitely blocked as open proxies, unless someone comes up with a really good excuse for the specific IP. OTOH, the use of them is no indication of malice — some people simply like using them, and they being shared with vandals is an inevitable consequence of they being open proxies. She could also have used them to evade collateral blocks (which can happen often if you use AOL, or some ISPs which use a single shared proxy), or to try to access Wikipedia from somewhere which blocks Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 01:47, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would like to point out for those reading this discussion that <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Evilphoenix</a> has now unblocked MSK with the recommendation that she take her case to the arbitration committee after the elections. Apparently MSK thinks new arbitrators will be more favorable to her case. I am all for an arbitration case so all relevant facts can be aired and I think the case should begin immediately so that justice is served either way. Waiting to see what the election brings is a form of temporal forum shopping, and it is contrary to our best interests to hold up action. If MSK has been wronged, or if she has wronged Wikipedia, then in either case the community needs to take and enforce remedies quickly. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 01:00, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I see no reason to unblock in this case--looking at his recent contributions on this matter, it seems to me that Evilphoenix leapt to conclusions and took precipitate action without proper consultation, against substantial support for this indefinite block.

<dd>I did look at this thread, and I think this is all very convoluted, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. From what I've seen on her Talk page though, she seems frequently incivil but not bannable, and I'm trying to sort out why she was banned. I unblocked her because I don't at this time support a ban, and my understanding is that if Admins dispute a ban, then it's not a community ban. (those being ones where user are banned simply because no one else supports unblocking them). That being said, I'm also not going to unblock again, I've taken my action, I'm not here to engage in a wheel war over it. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 02:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe Kelly Martin used as a justification to block MSK that she was connected to vandals who used the same (or in someway connected) proxy. However it turned out that the user had to use a proxy as her College bars access to Wikipedia so it is unlikely she was in anyway connected to the vandals. The user has made valid contributions and is a member of Wikimedia UK. Although she has exhibited incivility I don't think a indefinite block is justified. Arniep 01:42, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm with Arniep on this, there's definitely been some vandalism connected with MSK though, 212.183.131.161 is particularly worrisome, and I think we need to figure out if there's a connection there. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 02:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree as well. I've looked through her contributions and don't see justification for an indefinite block.

<p>This 12 blocks thing. Can we clarify that she has actually been blocked 12 times in two weeks and that it's not a case of blocking, unblocking, reblocking? How many offences actually was she blocked for? If it's fewer, can editors please stop stirring the pot by repeating the claim? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:33, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>She recieved four blocks for violations of 3RR, one block for vandalism, and two blocks for questionable definations of "personal attacks". The rest were multiple blocks at the same time, or unblocking to reblock. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 03:40, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>So, frankly, let's review. The anon above that's posting inflammatory posts <i>isn't</i> her, so Cryptic's (one of the indef blocking admins) comment that he'll block her till Doomsday shouldn't apply. I'm looking through the diffs people have been posting and I'm seeing incivility and some bad choices, but somebody help me understand what exactly it is that's gotten her banned. This needs to be an RfC or an RfAr. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 03:04, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>She hasn't been banned; she is currently just blocked indefinitely. Bans can only be imposed by Jimbo, by the arbcom (neither of which applies here) or by community consensus (which doesn't apply here either, as there is patently no consensus). <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 03:25, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fully agree with unblock by Evilphoenix. Appropriate procedural actions (RfC, RfAr) weren't taken, so we have a user, indefinitely blocked for NOTHING (remember presumption of innocence and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>).

<dd>Oh, drop the drama, please. MSK had virtually no edits to the encyclopedia, and had dedicated virtually all her attention to playing wargames with other users. We've assumed good faith for the last few weeks, but it's gotten well to the point where the ongoing damage she's causing to the project <i>vastly</i> outweights her five or so edits in the article namespace.

<dd>Except that she made a number of useful edits, in several namespaces, and certainly a lot more than "five or so". Sure, she was heated often, and definately overzealous in her contributions, but as for "ongoing damage to the project"... there is none. She vandalized one article, and was reprimanded for it - no other vandalism has taken place. She has more frequenly been involved in revert wars, but the way I see it, a revert war takes at least two people. As for "dedicating attention" to "playing wargames", it could be argued that pointing out abusive behaviour is far more beneficial to the project than passively ignoring it under the pretense of building an encylopedia. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 09:46, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Spare the personal attacks, Grue. Edit counts really don't cut in here, as even MSK, in her own defence, could only give about eight examples of useful things she'd done - about four relatively minor edits, and about four things in the userspace. I notice that you don't even try to show otherwise, but instead throw ad hominems around. She was a nightmare to deal with for anyone who disagreed with her, and she was actively engaged in driving her opponents off the wiki. At the same time, there was very few, if any, ongoing useful edits. It is patently obvious that an arbitration case would have resulted in the exact same result two months down the line, with either the old or the new committee. As such, there was absolutely no benefit in keeping her around pending the inevitable. I'd like to think you two were above this "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" nonsense.

<dd>I repeat: cut the bullshit. Read her contributions instead of recycling the lies of her opponents. There are lots of good edits in main namespace.

<dd>For the benefit of those that are undecided, could you provide 15-20 diffs of good mainspace contributions? If you're correct that "<i>There are lots of good edits in main namespace</i>", this shouldn't take long.

<li>I am going to have to make myself unpopular with the people who are concerned with cutting the nonsense and side with Blu Aardvark here. I have looked through MSK's contributions list and she has several valid edits to the main article namespace, so I think saying that she only has five or so is highly inaccurate. I am <i>not sure</i> either that the ArbCom, present or future, would impose an <i>indefinite</i> ban. Even with highly disruptive and unpleasant users such as <a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIrate_d7f6.html" title="User:Irate">Irate</a>, the ArbCom initially imposed a ban of three months only. MSK has vandalised once, but is not an indisputable vandal account like Willy on Wheels so an indefinite block for that reason seems unwarranted. MSK has engaged in edit-warring, but we don't impose indefinite bans for that, initially we enforce 3RR (done here, no complaint about that), and Arbcom penalty for that is typically imposing a 1 revert-limit or a ban from a certain type of article. There does not appear to be community consensus to support an indefinite ban either, considering that several respected users such as Aardvark, Evilphoenix and Grue are opposed to it. Disruption is what this indefinite block is based on, but if we look at the blocking policy: <i>"blocks should not be used against isolated incidents of disruption from IP addresses <b>nor against user accounts that make a mixture of disruptive and useful edits</b>"</i>. The only thing here which I think <i>would</i> justify an indefinite block is if MSK is a sockpuppet of a banned user. That is possible but I cannot see that it is proven. In this case, I <i>do</i> think ArbCom review is warranted, clearly MSK has upset several users and caused quite a lot of disruption, but whether or not the disruption is serious enough to warrant an indefinite block is a decision which should not be made by a few admins only. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:20, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I disagree. MSK was against Slim Virgin in relation to her behaviour in the banning of <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxwoman_c5ae.html" title="User:Taxwoman">User:Taxwoman</a> and extended that towards her behaviour on other projects, which then led to her attacking of <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">User:BrandonYusufToropov</a>. Note that the ban of Taxwoman happened a long time before any attacks on BYT, and can be seen as an extension of her attacks on Slim Virgin. That being said, I would like to know who Chaosfeary was. He is NOT a banned user - but was someone who was given a few short term blocks, therefore even if she was a "sock puppet", then it is not grounds for a ban. However, I can see no evidence that they are the same person, and indeed <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">User:Jayjg</a> had already proven through CheckUser that they were not the same person, and I think that we should take this as given. Whilst it is obviously unfortunate that she didn't like BYT, I think that the issue should be what she said to BYT rather than any allegations of sock puppetry, which, in my opinion, is irrelevant anyway. Since MSK wasn't banned for anything she said to BYT, I think that BYT should perhaps present what she said to him. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 15:36, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've asked TonySidaway to reconsider, as a number of people (myself included, based on what has been said here) don't seem to think the case for an indefinite block is sufficiently clear at this time, and it therefore either needs to be made more clearly (either here, or through RFC or RFAR) or replaced with some other measure (eg mentorship). <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 22:43, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no dog in this fight; I reinstated a block, originally placed on the basis of known bad behavior over a protracted period and a checkuser report, that appeared to have been removed by one editor without any discernible discussion. I brought it here for review--a practise I have made with all blocks almost since my first actions as an administrator. I wouldn't presume to second guess the checkuser information and I have yet to see an adequate explanation of why this editor, supposedly at a British college, cannot simply edit Wikipedia from a direct connection. This isn't China. The user's pattern of extreme personal attacks since being blocked does not fill me with confidence in his or her willingness to edit Wikipedia. Nevertheless I would not oppose a <i>considered</i> unblocking on the understanding that any sign of this user continuing her attacks will result in reinstatement of the permanent block. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:13, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>She said she used the hosting service because she was scared someone would trace her to her college and cause her trouble. I think that's plausible enough. Tony, I don't see any "extreme personal attacks" frankly. A bit of mouthiness, that's all. Do you not think that a user who's been blocked permanently might feel <i>hurt</i> though? There's lots of editwarring on Wikipedia and lots of people talking to each other like shit, some of them "respected users". She's probably not quite clear that she's done anything much wrong. Why not unblock her, ask her to agree to a personal 1RR with a day off for each infringement and caution her not to mouth off at other editors? Surely that would be much more constructive than throwing the book at her? -- GN. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.206.77.40.html" title="User:203.206.77.40">203.206.77.40</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.206.77.40.html" title="User talk:203.206.77.40">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.206.77.40_8dd8.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.206.77.40">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Oh I've already indicated that I wouldn't oppose an unblock if she doesn't continue with her personal attacks--which, whatever you may say, were extremely inflammatory. She's been unblocked and I'm fine with that. I've tried to follow her instructions about <i>"find the link for a screenshot, do a search on the page for "photobucket"</i> but, alas, without success.

<dd>In reply to Robchurch, I'm not a member of Wikimedia UK but I do know people who have attended preliminary meetings. As far as I'm aware nobody answering her description has done so--she could well be involved in Wikimedia in some way but if the extent of that is to put her name down on a wiki page or subscribe to a mailing list it's not really getting us any further in refuting the checkuser evidence.</dd>

<dd>Of course it's MSK's right to use an anonymizing proxy, and also being somewhat kinky myself I understand that she could plausibly be reluctant to give away any informtion that might lead to her being identified, but users who use such proxies to misbehave risk being blocked.

The more I think about it, the more I'm realizing that it really isn't my role to figure this out, but rather is up to the Wikipedia Aspie community to address. While Aspies have made some wonderful contributions around here, I and others, have found some behavior to be very disruptive. There are some rules of behavior that have been reached by consensus by the community. Some of these rules, like assuming good faith, the three revert rule, no personal attacks, etc... are essential for the continued success of Wikipedia. It seems unreasonable to exempt some people from these rules because of a neurological condition. Instead, I hope the Aspie community could figure out a way to participate without being disruptive.

<p>I think that discriminating against someone for a mental disorder is discrimination. Whilst each country has their own laws, I am sure that in USA such behaviour would be considered to be illegal, and it would also cover internet use. Whilst Wikipedia can legally ban or allow whoever they like, they cannot forbid someone entry on the basis of race, gender, religious preference, sexual preference, or mental disability. Pretty simple thing. Whilst you are entitled to treat her as if she did not have a disability, you are not entitled to consider this to be a factor warranting a ban. To do so may be illegal, and put the individual person doing the ban/discriminating and/or Wikipedia itself in to jeapordy for legal action.

<dd>I think you've got this backwards. Please re-read my comments. I am trying to think of accomodations for the disability to help keep people from getting banned.

<dd>No problems. I guess that I am a bit wary of people doing things like this. Going for equality really is important, and discrimination is an issue that needs to be considered. I mean we wouldn't ban someone for being muslim, would we? Or even for believing in Goat Cheese. But we might not like them pushing these views. I hope that you didn't think I was attacking anyone there. I just get very nervous when people talk about things like this, especially as at least a few people have commented in a way that suggests that they should be able to ban autistic people for being autistic.

<p>Well, (so sayeth the psychs) I've got Asperger's syndrome; however, I am of the distinct opinion that the behaviour demonstrated by MSK could not really be ascribed to that. Asperger's syndrome sufferers are widely held to have issues with social skils, with emotional development and integration happening late-on (or to an impared degree). Asperger's syndrome could not possibly be used as an excuse for some of MSK's vitriol, because quite frankly I am capable of restraining myself from her distinctly unpleasant mode of interaction. Although I do have my odd moment of difficulty in this area I could not see it being expressed in such a manner. I think Wikipedia needs to bear AS in mind, perhaps, but it is not by any means carte blanche to behave poorly. Indeed, to ascribe MSK's inability to behave in a civil and reasonable fashion to AS would be to do a great disservice to its sufferers. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 01:50, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

While it's true that all individuals with these disorders share the trait of poor or unusual social skills and vary in their abilities in this regard I would find it extremely hard to believe that one would actively seek out confrontation like MSK has. Doesn't mean it doesn't happen but if it has I've never heard of it. The typical reaction would be to shy away from such confrontations and occasionally fall into one by mistake. But, I'm not a shrink, I only deal with my son's issues day in and day out and explain this stuff to people almost daily! --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 03:46, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Like Nicholas and MSK, I also have Asperger's, and he's right, it shouldn't be an excuse for rudeness or incivility. Indeed, despite my eccentric nature at times, i've done things that you wouldn't associate with someone with "social issues", such as <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_New_Hampshire_General_Court_Election_14c5.html" title="2004 New Hampshire General Court Election">running for public office</a>, as well as the seeds of careers in heavily people orientated careers such as <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism.html" title="Journalism">Journalism</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_Estate_f954.html" title="Real Estate">Real Estate</a>.

<p>However, Tabor's also right, it's different for everyone, especially for people like MSK, who not only has AS, but is also young, which usually exasperbates the misconceptions that are common between neurotypicals and those with AS. I'm not going to touch the block for the time being, because she needs to calm down anyway, but I hope there's some way we can make her realize that being a jerk to those she disagrees with isn't cool, because I don't think she does or feels that kindness won't work at this point with what's been going on during the past few weeks. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 05:00, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My understanding of autism is that it is a spectrum rather than just something specific. It is extraordinarily ill-defined, and in fact covers a wide range of different disorders. It is also one of the most poorly diagnosed syndromes imaginable. So saying that this is how one person behaves therefore all of the others must behave in the same way is wrong. The spectrum has an allowable set of behaviours in order to be considered to be autistic. Mistress Selina Kyle's behaviours comfortably fall within this spectrum. This does not mean that all autistics will exhibit these behaviours. It is probably less than 10% who would behave in a similar manner to MSK in similar circumstances.</dd>

<dd>As for the confrontation, no, Aspies aren't scared of confrontation. They misunderstand confrontation. What this means is that in school they will often be teased and take it literally, not realising that it is an attack on them. Similarly, they may tease others and not realise that there is anything wrong with it. This means that Aspies are regularly incorrectly believed to be "stirring up trouble" when in fact they are not. This is typical behaviour. And if you look at the allegations of MSK's "personal attacks" and "incivility", all of them fall comfortably within this boundary. MSK hasn't actually personally attacked anyone here, nor has she been incivil. What she has been is a typical Aspie.</dd>

<dd>That being said, her confronting Kelly Martin and Slim Virgin is not typical Aspie. That has nothing to do with her condition. That is because she felt that these people were corrupt and needed to be exposed. So if she is being criticised for trying to expose corruption, people should realise that her doing that had nothing to do with Asperger's Syndrome. She might have done it in a different way to others. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 04:46, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Frankly, I fail to see the supposed abundance of unjustifiable personal attacks; she's simply blunt. This is to be expected, and I find it an admirable quality, though those with thin skins and a better ability to sift through bullshit tend to disagree with me. Be that as it may, despite my status as a plebe around here, I see no reason for an indefinite block. Presuming that she does indeed have Asperger's (unusual in a female, but it does happen and would explain her unusual behavior), then her only behavior which isn't almost inevitable in an Aspie (that is to say, conflicts of personality arising from failure to empathize, <i>not</i> from malice) is her crusade against perceived corruption among the admins, and that is not a blockable offense in itself, as much as any theoretical corrupt admins (or admins annoyed at being so investigated) might like it to be. What that speaks of to me is integrity and overzealousness, and God help us if either of those traits become bannable offenses. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_9_6eb1.html" title="User:Rogue 9">Rogue 9</a> 08:58, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it should be noted that most "Aspies" are possibly self-diagnosed. The existence of a userbox makes this extremely easy. It is unfortunate that in this day, bad behavior is hidden behind a constructed disorder. We say a child has <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder.html" title="Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder">ADHD</a> and administer pharmaceuticals instead of addressing the possibility that she lacks discipline. When the child grows up she can hide behind the label of an "Aspie" instead of dealing with the fact that she is a jerk. This is unconscionable. Even if someone has a legitimate though manageable disorder, it's the person's responsibility to deal with it instead of <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger_syndrome.html#Asperger_syndrome_as_a_social_construct" title="Asperger syndrome">hiding behind it</a>.</p>
<p>After reading Kelly Martin's comment on MSK's lack of quality editing and MSK's replies on her talk page, I decided to look into it myself. When I ran an edit count last night, I found that only 30% of this user's edits were on articles, images and associated talk pages. This means that 70% of this user's edits have nothing to do with developing the encyclopedia (unless you strongly believe that userboxes have extraordinary value to the project). Furthermore, if you remove talk pages, deleted edits, and vandalism from the statistics, her useful edits only amount to about 20%. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">malber</a> 14:22, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The dismissal of a diagnosis of any other user, cheapning it as "self diagnosis" is... Well, I'm at a loss for words, in that regard. Let's toss it in the "evil" bin. Secondly, I think some of you fail to understand the symptoms of Aspergers, or more correctly, the behavior of those so diagnosed. I don't particularly feel that the user went out of her way to confront anyone. As others have said, she is dedicated to producing articles and does contribute. It is when that is interfered with (this is commonly referred to as "hyper focus" in text on the subject -- see <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0684801280</a> for more details), the user is left with very few coping skills. What you see is the result. Lastly, going after edit counts can be used on just about anyone. I recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NSLE&amp;diff=35098964&amp;oldid=35090633" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NSLE&amp;diff=35098964&amp;oldid=35090633" rel="nofollow">examined</a> the same statistics for <a href="../../../n/s/l/User%7ENSLE_4a42.html" title="User:NSLE">NSLE</a>.

I'm stating a basic fact; if nobody wants you around, you're gone. And besides, if this were an ochlocracy, we might have had fair use images on userpages a long time ago, regardless of their legality.

<dd>Ochlocracy is not consensus. Consensus is the foundation of Wikipedian governance, although it's breaking down fast. If someone is strongly opposing a witch hunt, then there is no consensus, and as a result, no action should be taken until consensus is gained. That's the boon and bane of consensus, and if you want to see it in action, mosy on over to <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">FAC</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFARC_beb0.html" title="WP:FARC">FARC</a>, quite possibly the last two places on Wikipedia where consensus still rules. So you are plainly wrong. Under consensus the majority cannot overrule the minority. If <i>nobody</i> wants you around the encyclopedia (as in if a vote were to be held on whether you should be banned, every Wikipedian would say "yes"), maybe you should reconsider your behaviour or get the hell out.

<dd>*sigh* Normally I wouldn't dare enter these types of situations but after reading this and witnessing all the fighting and bias I'm afraid I have no choice. To those who seem to think Aspie's "hide behind our diseases" or "we use it as an excuse" is entirely untrue, pathetic, sickening and offensive to all who have this rotten disorder. Yes, I realise some of MSK's actions may <i>not</i> be due to AS, but for you people who are lucky enough not to experience this disorder firsthand I fail to see how you possibly have a good understanding about it. You should be considered lucky; I went undiagnosed for over 10 years and it's safe to say my life was a living hell back then. I would suggest reading <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger_Syndrome_92e0.html" title="Asperger Syndrome">Asperger Syndrome</a> if you haven't already done so.

<dd>And nothing says her diagnosis is self-applied except a gross assumption. I have the syndrome (and yes, it was professionally diagnosed by two separate psychiatrists) and can tell you that no one's saying she should be excused for her "bad behavior" because from where she's coming from there was no bad behavior in the first place. Her reactions were perfectly normal for an Aspie; if I was plunged into a situation where a lot of my work was suddenly deleted by an imperious admin going on about how I was a waste of space I'd be going off like a volcano because I frankly wouldn't know what else to do. Hell, that's not even being an Aspie; that's being human. Asperger's will simply make the reaction worse because it makes it difficult to understand what the other people want unless they come out and say it, which makes negotiation difficult to say the least. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_9_6eb1.html" title="User:Rogue 9">Rogue 9</a> 04:22, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's also note that it wasn't a personal attack. If you are actually incapable of avoiding going off like a volcano when Wikipedia's policies and guidelines are enforced, you should not edit Wikipedia. A compulsion to go off like a volcano makes you less suitable for the project. If Asperger's is why you have this compulsion, then Asperger's makes you less suitable. That's why it's a disorder - because it makes you unable to do things that healthy people can. That doesn't mean I don't sympathize. That doesn't mean I haven't winced when I've blocked people who obviously have Asperger's or some similar disorder. But it does mean that, well... if you can't play well with others, this is not the project for you. That's not a personal attack. That's just a really sad and unfortunate truth. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:19, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm quite capable of avoiding exploding over enforcement of the rules; I'm talking about abuse of power like that which happened to MSK's work in the userbox project. What's said below about Asperger's patients working better with structured rules is true; what's also true is that breaking those rules in an unpredictable manner is upsetting because we expect those rules to be followed by everyone. Try to look at this from Selina's point of view; from where she was sitting, Kelly Martin just swooped in and, ignoring every possible policy on the matter, unilaterally deleted a large body of her work while simultaneously expressing utmost contempt for not only her but everyone she worked with on the project. This is upsetting to <i>anyone;</i> having a disorder that makes it difficult to cope with sudden change and unpredictable situations makes it worse. Oh, and I didn't accuse you of a personal attack; I was attempting to avoid making one myself, because the rules make no allowance for insults thoroughly earned.</dd>

<dd>Anyhow, now that I'm calmer, I will address Snowspinner's profoundly ignorant remark concerning Aspergians and suitability for Wikipedia. (If one will pay attention to the subject of that sentence, it was what Snowspinner said, not Snowspinner himself. Don't try to whip out NPA at me.) I contend that having Asperger's makes one <i>more</i> suitable for the project than your average neurotypical, not less. The penchant for almost obsessively gathering and sharing information is the most obvious benefit to a repository of knowledge such as this, of course, but it's hardly the only thing. The same mania for organization that makes dealing with (too often inconsistent) people so infuriating makes one fact-check and organize to no end, as well as spell-check to no end for that matter. We're able to focus on a problem or subject with an intensity that most others simply don't believe; as an example, I once read through <i><a href="../../../r/o/b/Robinson_Crusoe_f001.html" title="Robinson Crusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a></i> in a span of two hours and ten minutes at the age of eleven. Repetitive tasks such as checking through articles one after the other for spelling errors are easy for an Aspergian. Frankly, if everyone on Wikipedia had Asperger's, the project would be a whole lot better off, even though a lot of the editors wouldn't. &#160;:p That is, of course, too much to ask for, and I wouldn't wish this condition on anyone, but the point is that problems occur when we're interfered with, not when left alone to work on articles or whatever else one of us chooses to work on. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go clean up the article on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_8-Bit_Theater_c900.html" title="Characters of 8-Bit Theater">Characters of 8-Bit Theater</a>; the spelling and grammar is atrocious. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_9_6eb1.html" title="User:Rogue 9">Rogue 9</a> 05:31, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to present, off the top of my head, some practical information about working with people that have Asperger Syndrome and about disruptive behavior as alleged above.</p>
<ul>
<li>The rules apply to everyone. Disruptive behavior is not to be tolerated. I should add that it is quite uncommon among Aspies, and ascribing it to their having Asperger Syndrome is unwarranted in virtually all cases. And even if one does ascribe it to AS, the remedy remains the same. Explain, point out rules, be civil, assume good faith - be a good wikipedian and it doesn't matter whom you are trying to correct. Stay cool. Blocking and problem resolution as usual.</li>
<li>Asperger Syndrome is much more pronounced in children. Like other children, Aspies learn to adapt to the differences between them and the rest of the world (since the rest of the world won't adapt to the differences). It takes them longer and is more difficult, but in the end many do not really stand out from the crowd in day-to-day communications. It means that, probably even more than regular teenagers and adolescents, Aspies can be expected to improve their behavior given time, and getting a new chance after six months or so should always be negotiable. And since we're building an encyclopedia, it would be a pity if Wikipedia unnecessarily lost the contributions from - often quite intelligent - people with a knack for gathering facts and a far more than encyclopedic knowledge of specialist subjects.</li>
<li>As to being "wheelchair friendly" - Wikipedia is all that and more. Most Aspies do not have a problem with rules per se; in fact it is almost a defining symptom that they fare better in a well structured environment with clear rules. The absense of eye contact and body language when co-operating via the Internet solves any remaining sources of miscommunication so in fact Wikipedia and Aspies are a well-suited combination. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">&#160;AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 08:38, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I find this comforting, if beside the point - I don't think anyone here is arguing that we ought ban Aspies. Rather, I think people are saying that whether someone is an Aspie should be wholly irrelevent to whether or not we ought ban them. If being an Aspie does not lead one to behavior that would get one banned, this makes that question comfortingly academic, but it instead opens the nasty can of worms as to whether the self-diagnoses are accurate or not, etc, which remains a messy subject. Cleaner, I think, to just note that the basic rules of conduct apply, and that, for the purposes of enforcement of those rules, we don't really care why someone is incapable of following them. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:28, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil</a>, it's good to see you think what I wrote is comforting. But beside the point? I think most of this Asperger Syndrome section is beside the point (the point being an assessment of MSK's conduct, which I haven't even looked at). I argued that Wikipedia should not give Aspies preferential treatment. One of my reasons for posting the above was your assertion (which could well lead to the <i>opposite</i> of preferential treatment) "that Asperger's Syndrome makes one rather less suitable for the project". I was hoping you would retract it, or provide us with supporting facts and statistics. Anyway, seeing that you support my main line of reasoning (no special treatment on Wikipedia) takes away most of the doubt your assertion had raised in my mind.<a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">&#160;AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 14:12, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>People shouldn't be editing someone else's user page unless there is a very good reason for it. I will check out the edits and comment further. But please be a bit nicer to him about it.

<p>Okay I checked it and <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">User:Snowspinner</a> has been making misleading edit summaries, stating incorrectly that he was removing text because it was a personal attack, when there was none on there. Really, there was nothing wrong with Dschor's version, so let's just leave it be. It's just very petty to go around changing people's user pages for these kinds of reasons. Get rid of personal attacks by all means, but not opinions. We might call it vandalism if you do edit his user page like that, and with good reason. So please stop. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 01:49, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> has made one edit, with the remarkably accurate summary: "Reverted edits by <a href="../../../d/s/c/User%7EDschor_7a19.html" title="User:Dschor">User:Dschor</a> <a href="../../../d/s/c/User_talk%7EDschor_a5d4.html" title="User talk:Dschor">(talk)</a> to last version by <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a>". Tony made the changes you refer to, and I'm curious why you didn't discuss things with him before acting. Questions of intent and civility aside, you need only look at Dschor's talk page for your comment:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Obviously stating that you oppose Kelly Martin for ArbCom is not a personal attack. However, perhaps you should not include "Beware the Cabal".</dd>
</dl>
<p>And Tony's above that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, while your stated opposition to Kelly Martin was probably okay, the allegation that she is a member of some Cabal is an attack and we don't allow personal attacks. I've removed it for now; please feel free to restore minus the attack.</dd>
</dl>
<p>...to see your thinking is along closer lines than you might suspect. Maybe before attempting to set Dschor's expectations regarding his User page, you should reach a consensus here first.

<dd>You are correct, I am getting tired of fighting this type of vandalism on my page. I never stated that Kelly is a member of a cabal, but I did notice the prominent display of an "I love the cabal" image on her user page. Seemed like a harmless reference to her own stated affection. I assume good faith, but I ask that you please notify me before making significant changes to my user page. It's simply the polite thing to do. --<a href="../../../d/s/c/User%7EDschor_7a19.html" title="User:Dschor">Dschor</a> 10:25, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Vandalism suggests malicious intent. I don't see that here, but I'm only a neutral party. What I see is a difference of opinion on two counts: should Users (such as yourself) be allowed to reserve edit rights to their User page, and was the "cabal" comment a personal attack. While consensus doesn't seem too firm yet, it doesn't seem to be going your way at the moment. I'd ask you consider the comments above about User pages and community space. I'd also suggest that <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin's</a> original edit, regardless of it's factual accuracy, was a good faith edit and not a personal attack or attempted vandalism.

<dd>Not to be picky, but the heading for this section does not reflect any statement that I have made, and is a straw man created to distract the casual observer from the fact that Administrators are taking their POV and inserting it into a user page against that user's strenuous objections. I do not claim unique rights to edit my user page, but in the interests of accuracy, I cannot permit editors to remove my own opinion, or insert their own. I do not doubt that Kelly felt she was doing a service in adding her name to my user page, but her failure to revert upon my request was not appropriate, particularly considering that my account was blocked during her edit. There are many other users who use the same travel brag sheet, and as far as I know Kelly made no effort to add her name to their pages. I did not have any notice advising users to clear changes with me, because I assume good faith. Unfortunately a number of edits have been made to my user page that show a pattern of aggression toward free expression. I believe I have the right not to have my opinion distorted or deleted so long as I follow the guidelines for user space on Wikipedia. I consider this matter closed, and expect that editors will respect my user page, and refrain from edits that do not improve it.

<dd>My user page is intended to be a description of me, not a place for editors to add their own false claims and opinions. It can and will be edited by other people, but if they don't make improvements, then I will revert their edits. I do not presume that all people who edit my user page mean harm, but I reserve the right to make the determination on my own terms. I like to think this is a wiki, but when I observe admins speedy deleting the contributions of others for no reason, I have to wonder. And when admins come to my user page to make counterfactual edits while I am blocked, I presume that this is vandalism, and revert it. --<a href="../../../d/s/c/User%7EDschor_7a19.html" title="User:Dschor">Dschor</a> 02:28, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> I'm bringing the following out of the archive to discuss the returned vandalism by the IP block range owned by UK Internet for Learning. The following is my note on the vandalism to <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">User:Demi</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have just stumbled on your research at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive54_d522.html#Recent_activity" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive54">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive54#Recent_activity</a> while trying to find out what has or can be done to deal with the massive amount of vandalism coming from the IP block 62.171.194.0 - 62.171.194.45 (owned by Research Machines/IFL up to 62.171.195.255, though no vandalism seems to be coming from the rest) which is the network for a school or several schools in the UK. You originally suggested that users be blocked individually for a few hours at a time. The vandalism seems to have died down during the holiday break but now is coming back in full force (except for the weekends). In particular, there have been some especially nasty edits like subtle word changes (bonds to bondage on <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Gorges_Dam_1276.html" title="Three Gorges Dam">Three Gorges Dam</a>) and numerical changes (33% to 37% on <a href="../../../a/s/c/Asch_conformity_experiments.html" title="Asch conformity experiments">Asch conformity experiments</a>) that weren't caught for days and that I only caught because I was checking for vandalism from these users. This is in addition to countless incidents of blanking and childish vandalism, dozens happening just today (the 10th) during school hours.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most of these IP addresses have been blocked 5-15 times, and it doesn't seem to be doing the trick. In fact, the vandals probably don't even notice they have been blocked most of the time. I propose blocking anonymouse users from the whole set (about .5 - .45) indefinitely, and allowing only valid user accounts (there is at least one administrator who accesses his user account from this range). Is this possible? I would hate to see dozens of people working hours each day to chase down and revert the changes these IP addresses make, not to mention the many harmful edits that might make it through unnoticed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>...It seems to me it is not worth the effort to continually warn, re-warn, block temporarily, and repeat. There must be a better way...</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Unfortunately it is not. When an IP range is blocked all edits from the range are blocked, including editors with user accounts. I was on the fence before about blocking the whole range, the fact that there is an admin editing from the range as well as an increase in vandalism. I would like other people's attention--would it be possible for you to copy the discussion out of the archive and bring it up on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> again?

<p>This vandalism has occurred again extensively today (the 11th) in many IPs (I am only up to .13, from .5). Also of note is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Todd_%28footballer%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34687686diff" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Todd_%28footballer%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34687686diff" rel="nofollow">this instance</a> in which 62.171.194.7 (now blocked for 31 hours) blanked a page and added "I will not stop until all IPs are not able to edit Wikipedia."</p>
<p>What can be done? This is extremely harmful to Wikipedia - who knows how much vandalism is slipping through the cracks? --<a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenesis13_6b6b.html" title="User:Renesis13">Renesis13</a> 15:57, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Note:</b> I have just completed a check for vandalism from this range today. There are 19 IPs involved:</dd>
<dd><b>4 - 13</b></dd>
<dd><b>36 - 38</b></dd>
<dd><b>40 - 45</b></dd>
<dd>All vandalism from today has been reverted I believe. Now that school is out, we have about 18 hours before it starts again.</dd>

<p>From them flows a steady, deep, inexhaustible river of childish vandalism into the encyclopedia. After quite some time spent sampling, I haven't found one single good edit from any of them, though I can't swear that one isn't hiding out somewhere, obviously. All the warnings posted on all the talkpages by all the ambitious Wikipedians have an air of pathos, if you read them all together. Don't we have enough to do? If the range is indeed static, and the sole purview of enthusiastically scrawling children, can it be blocked wholesale, by someone who understands the art of range blocking? Or can somebody who's better than me at navigating the intarweb find their way to someone in a position of responsibility at the <b>UK Internet for Learning</b>? Or, does anybody have any other suggestions? Please? --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:03, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing_1d82.html" title="Classless Inter-Domain Routing">Classless Inter-Domain Routing</a>. 62.171.194.0/23 is a range of 512 IP addresses from 62.171.194.0 to 62.171.195.255. It's also the format that you use for range blocking on the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_59cc.html" title="Special:Blockip">block</a> page. Personally, I would like to see a greater consensus here before we take action to indef block such a large range. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeL_c5a8.html" title="User:GraemeL">GraemeL</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraemeL_c70d.html" title="User talk:GraemeL"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:09, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm uncomfortable about potentially blocking every primary school in the country. It seems horrific. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 16:23, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I find it hard to believe that 18 IP addresses cover every primary school in the country. I think that was a misconjecture on someone's part during the above research. In any case, I see no problem with blocking editing from a set of IP addresses which contribute 99% vandalism, including dozens of incidents per day. If these IP addresses are only used by schools, then I assume anyone with good intent would still have other opportunities (home/work) to contribute meaningful content. --<a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenesis13_6b6b.html" title="User:Renesis13">Renesis13</a> 21:21, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just a comment... primary school is quite young. I have a child at one. I'm rather doubtful that a school would encourage children to edit wiki anyway... they tend to be sensitive to possible exposure to naughty things. So for a school to lose write access would probably be no big thing... though this is a guess. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<dd>The <i>X grid for learning</i> aren't just for primary schools, but for secondary schools aswell. I doubt highly that the vandals are primary school pupils. I don't know what primary school is like now, but I'm doubtful as to whether, 1. the kids would have much unsupervised time on the internet, 2. that internet would not be a <i><a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden.html" title="Walled garden">walled garden</a></i> or something similar.

<p>I received an email indicating that this block is also affecting some libraries in the UK. I still haven't heard back from the ISP and I asked the user that mailed me to try and get the IPs of the library computers to see if I can work round that range with the block.

<dd>If we can get the library range (i.e. if the vandal fonts are, indeed, static), we can except them, but we need to be aware of the fact that libraries may be one of the sites of vandalism, and the only thing denied them now is the ability to edit. We're still good for researching on.

<p>The "other" edits are good-faith attempts to create content, or at least, aren't clear vandalism (some of them have been reverted, some have not). Many of them are reversions of other edits from this range. The overall pattern seems to me that of schoolkids teasing each other using Wikipedia, and some other people (older students?) reverting them and sometimes adding content. The vandalism seems to come in short spates, and I'm guessing the IPs might correspond to workstations in a computer lab or school library. My gut feeling is not to re-block the IP range, but since the vandalism doesn't come very fast, to block the individual IPs as needed for short periods (but without separate warning). <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 08:50, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When you say "this IP"--do you have a specific IP that you always get?

<dd>Would it be possible to leave the block for a week or so so that the users who have been adding vandalism in the past get used to not being able to edit? Then you could probably go ahead with unblocking for yourself without much risk of anyone trying to vandalize while its open. Another option is the <a href="../../../6/2/2E/User_talk%7E62.171.194.36.html" title="User talk:62.171.194.36">19 IPs</a> that have contributed from that range could be blocked individually, and then you could unblock one at a time for whichever you come up with.

<dd>Well, I will only be unblocking briefly to make a few edits then reblocking, so no more vandalism should come out.

<dl>
<dd><i>Hey man, first of all, do you have access to "Internet preferences"&#160;? Tools-&gt;options in Firefox, Tools-&gt;internet options in IE. If you do, you could try changing the proxy settings to just one of those IPs (its probably currently a round-robin) and then use that one and block all the others. If it is only set to one IP, this is probably some kind of local proxy that makes requests to a round-robin of upstream proxies. In this case, you can still try and make direct requests to the upstream proxies, but I don't know if it will work. Is your sysadmin a reasonable (and non-braindead) guy? You could ask him about it. If all else fails I can set you up some kind of HTTP/HTTP proxy.

<p>I've been chasing a troll through this range and just chatted on IRC with Celestianpower about it. What I'm seeing (from checkuser on various /24 segments) is that anon edits from it are mostly crap while logged-in edits are less so.

Earlier up on this page I said I would unprotect <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guangshen_Railway_6580.html" title="Guangshen Railway">Guangshen Railway</a> and ban them if they restarted the edit war (ie, protection is a means to allow dispute resolution to take place, but here we can enforce an end to the edit war without it), and it has restarted, even after the latest ban yesterday (above). I find almost <i>no</i> productive edits, just continued alterations of wordings and format, back and forth, with snippy unproductive edit summaries, and little or no discussion of reverts on talk pages (since they already thoroughly know what the other will say). In fact, I'm sure there are other articles where they are doing the same thing, and I hope this will send some kind of a message. I urge admins to take a look at this situation and scrutinize their edit wars, as it's been going on entirely too long.

<p>Thanks, good idea, I have done so.

<dd>I strongly protests this action on the part of Wgfinley. That was a discussion page, not the article page, and using my comments here as basis for a page ban is sending a message to everyone that perhaps all of us should stop using discussion pages least they be used as basis for administrative actions which are not fought over in the article itself? And I find it absolutely ridiculous for Wgfinley to say that I appear "much more interesting in bringing up other arguments and other articles without any reference to this one.", when the conversation he refers to was ignited by comments made by instantnood <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barbecued_pork_with_rice&amp;diff=34805475&amp;oldid=33021528" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barbecued_pork_with_rice&amp;diff=34805475&amp;oldid=33021528" rel="nofollow">[138]</a>, which included the words "<b>A similar debate is around the Singapore-centric set up of the <i><a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakkwa.html" title="Bakkwa">bakkwa</a></i> article (see <a href="../../../b/a/k/Talk%7EBakkwa_69c5.html#Singapore-centric" title="Talk:Bakkwa">talk:bakkwa</a>)</b>" That he considers this evidence of "edit warring" on my part alone is completely baseless. Impartiality on the part of Wgfinley is sorely missed here, and I am inclined to think he is also reacting based on discussions taking place in <a href="../../../h/u/a/User_talk%7EHuaiwei_1532.html" title="User talk:Huaiwei">User talk:Huaiwei</a>.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 02:00, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does Wikipedia have a clear stance with reference to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a>? I ask because of the conversation now going on at <a href="../../../b/u/d/Talk%7EBudapest_6e37.html#Please_delete_Holocaust_promotion_from_Budapest_page" title="Talk:Budapest">Talk:Budapest#Please delete Holocaust promotion from Budapest page</a>. Frankly, it is straining my limits to stay within the bounds of civility there. It is possible that I am misreading the remarks by Bloblaw, but it reads to me as if, besides questioning the mention of the Holocaust in this particular article, he is saying that it is POV to make an unqualified assertion that the Holocaust occurred. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:16, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I left a note on the article talkpage. As for the more general issue, I don't think any opinions should be verboten in Wikipedia. Someone can think that Santa Claus or Xenu is real, that the moon landing was a hoax, or that the holocaust is a fabrication. What they cannot do is force these opinions into articles over the objection of a consensus of editors citing reliable sources. But we don't need a special stance for holocaust denial. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 07:45, 12 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We don't need a special stance, but we shouldn't let fringe groups influence content in a wide range of unrelated articles. For instance, WTC conspiracy theorists have tried to rewrite <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservation_of_energy.html" title="Conservation of energy">conservation of energy</a> to express the belief that the release of energy during the building collapse "disproves" the laws of physics. I see this as similar to a holocaust denier attempting to influence the content of <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>. It is fine to explain the beliefs of holocause deniers in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a>. Outside of that article, we can deal with widely accepted historical facts, without the need to make concessions to the holocaust deniers, who in truth are a tiny minority. NPOV doesn't require us to give their opinion every time we mention a holocaust-related statistic. This falls under the "undue weight" clause. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 07:59, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, of course not. I was saying they were entitled to mention their position on the talkpage, but not to have it inserted into the article over the consensus of reliable sources that rubbishes their opinion. I don't think that sort of opinion has a place in the Budapest article at all, just as the belief that the moon landing was a hoax has no place in an article that mentions the landing only in passing. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 08:08, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About User:Bloblaw specifically, this attack convinces me that he will probably never be a worthwhile editor: "You are very likely a Zionist shill paid to police the internet media by your ideologic handlers." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dsol&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34745009" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dsol&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34745009" rel="nofollow">[139]</a> i.e. the Jewish media conspiracy. He also believes that all Muslims are holocaust deniers. Nothing wrong with blocking people like him after a few of these anti-semitic rants. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 08:16, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please be careful here, Rhobite because Antizionism (article sorely missing) is rarely if at all <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">Antisemitism</a>. Especially Israel itself has become a hotbed of antizionism, which is no wonder because these people, being semites for the most part, suffer directly from <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>. A growing number of antizionist Jews and Palestinians are more than just sick and tired of the murder and mayhem perpetrated by Zionism, both by Zionism and by retaliation against Zionism. Please keep this in mind, calling you a "Zionist shill paid to police the internet media for ideologic handlers" is albeit dumb, not antisemite. It's pretty much the same logic as most people abhor socialism and communism and still do not hate the German or Russian people who had these ideologies foisted upon them unwillingly. To Bloblaw should he or she be reading I have this to say: They don't have to PAY most people to police the "internet media" because their "ideologic handlers" (i.e. their school, university, television etc) have done such a fine job that people do it for free. (However I might add: reality is what you make of it and do try to question your conditioning, willya everybody&#160;:-) )</p>
<p>As far as Holocaust Denial is concerned, it is highly illegal to do publicy deny the Holocaust in Germany no matter how compelling the uncovered evidence one has against the official historic record. Just think about Mr. Zuendel of <a href="http://www.zundelsite.org" class="external text" title="http://www.zundelsite.org" rel="nofollow">Zundelsite</a> who was extradited to Germany to stand trial for it. In the same vein, people denying the Holocaust online (no matter where they live in the world and what their local laws may be on this), they fulfill the criteria for prosecution under the relevant articles of the German Penal Code and in theory may find themselves extradited to Germany. I'm saying in theory, because up to now they've only gone after high profile cases. 84.160.220.48 22:24, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This guy is <i>quite</i> a problem, as anyone who has run across his edits will know. At the end of last year, after a series of bewildering edits, and a course of mentoring which didn't work at all, he was banned for a week. After the week was up, there was no sign of Maoririder... but up popped <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJingofetts_b62c.html" title="User:Jingofetts">User:Jingofetts</a>, with an identical style, and eventually he revealed himself to be Maoririder. Having lost his password, he had simply come back with a new user name. So far so good, except that his extremely distinctive editing style hadn't improved any, and in his first week back, he was blocked again. Now Jingofetts has fallen silent, and we have <a href="../../../m/a/o/User%7EMaoJin_d27b.html" title="User:MaoJin">User:MaoJin</a>. Exactly the same MO, and the user page says that the user "lost password".</p>
<p>Something needs to be done about this guy. It's fairly clear that his intentions are good, but it's a hell of a job mopping up after him - unintentional vandalism would be the best way to describe it. And since he keeps losing his password and coming back with a new name, it's never easy to know where he'll pop up next. Cleaning up his patent attempts at stub-templates alone takes long enough... he seems to have a fixation with using as many templates as possible (have a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ladybird_spider&amp;oldid=34893263" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ladybird_spider&amp;oldid=34893263" rel="nofollow">this</a> for a fine example.

<p>Having looked at his contributions and his user page for that matter I first have to grope for a political correct way to express myself here. I have to agree, saying he is not the sharpest needle in the box is probably the nicest way of putting it - but this is by no means me passing a judgement of such magnitude out of hand over someone I have never met in person, but merely the impression I get reviewing his contributions. I would also like to note that I know personally a few people that are not considered particularily bright but in the end all that is "amiss" with them is that they take a bit longer to think things through. Interestingly enough, sometimes they come up with anwers and insights that elude most of us "smart" people. Now as far as Maoririder is concerned, the situation we are put in with him is not one of our or his making but a result of misguided, ill politics taken to the extreme that do much harm and little good to both sides of the equation. However it is not our place to try to convince this individual not to remain in this project do to his mental ineptitude and thus I recommend more mentoring and damage control where possible. The vandalism Maoririder engaged in recently, I would ask you to let that slide in this case. I think he vandalized that page more out of frustration than anything else. 84.160.220.48 00:29, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, this is not only vandalizing but supplying <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disinformation.html" title="Disinformation">disinformation</a>. If someone told me the Peanuts lived in a town called "Comerica City" I would swallow that hook and sinker because I never really got into the comics strip and the only character I remember is Snoopy. The only behavior far more insidious and heineous than supplying false information for fun is making false statements about political organizations and individuals or selectively providing a one-sided view by omission. Telling enough is that most of those who engage in that kind of behavior are "Administrators". You know who you are 84.160.239.19 00:32, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I had returned today to search for something and while I was here, decided to browse through some disputes that have grown old. Analyzing her talk page history, I came across that comment and decided to proceed to post a comment here. I would like to take this opportunity to announce that my Wikipedia career had been cut short due to a ridiculous situation. I had been blocked and subsequently banned from this website because <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">v</a><a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">a</a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">r</a>i<a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">o</a><a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">u</a><a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction">s</a> users <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assumed bad faith</a> (I am tired of bringing that guideline up) and insisted that I had been conducting the accounts <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrippingInk_8cfa.html" title="User:DrippingInk">User:DrippingInk</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinnermario_90f7.html" title="User:Winnermario">User:Winnermario</a> and operating them as sock puppets. This was due to an IP check. However, without allowing me to go into much detail and plead my case, both of the accounts were blocked, and my account User:Hollow Wilerding was subsequently banned up to two weeks. This had been based purely on assumptions, bad faith, not allowing me to have a major case, and ignoring a compromise. I had suggested a compromise by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Siblings_CW" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Siblings_CW" rel="nofollow">creating</a> the account <a href="../../../s/i/b/User%7ESiblings_CW_0ee8.html" title="User:Siblings CW">User:Siblings CW</a>, for my brother who previously operated the User:DrippingInk account.

The "cookies" and "cupcakes" is basically speaking the following: <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attacks</a>. No compromise was suggested at the RfC either. So what is the use of the request for comment option if the entire community is going to laugh about the situation and suppose that they're correct? They had never considered that they could be the ones who are wrong.</p>
<p>I would like a compromise and a chance to operate another account solely, without my brother or roommate accessing Wikipedia. (They're both... infuriated with the situation that occurred.) The only reason I came to Wikipedia was to make it more wholesome and widespread. If this is the way Wikipedians are going to treat others on the edge of slippery slopes, then we're far from ever completing the encyclopedia. As I am attempting to plead my case, <i>please <b>don't</b> block this IP</i>. It'd be appreciated. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.231.179.104.html" title="User:64.231.179.104">64.231.179.104</a> 00:57, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although Snowspinner — Phil Sandifer — has blocked the User:Hollow Wilerding account indefinitely, it's my earlier two-week block that's the operative one, since shortest block rules. My block will be released on January 15th or 16th — whatever your timezone says — together with any longer block. I won't reblock, personally; I've blocked HW—the main account—twice, and that's enough from me. It's indeed obvious, as you say, Sean, that all the <i>other</i> old accounts won't get unblocked: they've been used for block evasion, vote stacking, and other abuse,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=33782999&amp;oldid=33782910" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=33782999&amp;oldid=33782910" rel="nofollow">[146]</a> I can't imagine them ever being unblocked.</dd>
<dd>Sean, I have to say, though, that I'm quite opposed to advising Hollow to get a new account and pretend (yet again) to be somebody else — hasn't there been enough of that? A truly new departure, IMO, would be to start the new career, if any, with acknowledgement of the past and the use of the original (more or less) account. If the HW account now appears, understandably, as an albatross, I advise an <i>open</i> change of username. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:59, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Simply put, this user has been committed to block evasion. The user was blocked as Winnermario, then became Hollow Wiledering. When that was blocked, he immediate became Siblings WC. When <i>that</i> was blocked, he became Empty Wallow. When <i>that</i> was blocked, he continued to post as a series of dynamic IP's. Now, what's clear is that the user has not endured any block time and will not play by the rules that <i>all other users</i> have to abide by. For me, this is a far worse case than any given misbehavior (personal attacks, voting for himself three times, supporting his own motions, etc.). The misbehavior shows a dedication to <b>lying</b>, but the block evasion is an attempt to avoid the only method of discipline (not punishment) that Wikipedia has. That cannot be tolerated. When the user ceases to edit, from any IP, for two weeks, he will have simply caught up with past offenses. The offense of block evasion is a separate matter, with a separate penalty. In the Willy case, I believe we wanted a hard ban. I am not recommending that, but I wouldn't be too shocked if others wanted it. After all, the behavior while editing has been deception upon deception, although not article vandalism. How much should that count? However much it does, block evasion counts more. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:23, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Also, <a href="../../../s/i/b/User%7ESiblings_CW_0ee8.html" title="User:Siblings CW">User:Siblings CW</a> <i><b>was not</b></i> created after I was blocked but two days before. Please do not post a comment if you are unaware of the accurate information because it makes me look like a criminal. I believe that I deserve to post on Wikipedia just as anyone else does. After all, the motto is "The free encyclopedia that anyone can edit!" It is not "The free encyclopedia that anyone who is not a vandal, sock puppet, or user who has been accused of something that has not been proven can edit!"

I find it very questionable why one would come to edit Wikipedia, make enhancements like these, and subsequently be called "a useless contributer". I would like to create a new account (unless User:Hollow Wilerding is unblocked). I would <i>also</i> like to know where a few users are getting the idea that <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinnermario_90f7.html" title="User:Winnermario">User:Winnermario</a> may be me, but <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrippingInk_8cfa.html" title="User:DrippingInk">User:DrippingInk</a> is not.

<p>Civil answer from an administrator who has no involvement in this whatsoever and no ties to any of the other administrators previously involved:</p>
<ol>
<li>All the answers to your questions are right here on this page, as well as the demonstrations that many of your assertions are mistaken. I saw them and have no other source of knowledge about you.</li>
<li>For example, no one is keeping <i>you</i> from editing wikipedia. You are welcome to make a fresh start with another account. It is the previous persona, behavior, attitude, and bad faith that have been blocked and are unwelcome, and the paragraphs on this page provide direct or indirect evidence of all of them.</li>
<li>Please do not argue about this any more. We are all sick of it. Your next post is your choice to make. Either
<ol>
<li>Start editing an article of interest in a different manner than before under a new name or even just an IP number, or</li>
<li>Keep arguing here about how you don't understand or don't accept the community response to your previous behavior and it will tell us that what you really want is a public theater or courtroom to play out your victimization psychodrama; if you choose this course it will of course confirm everything you are denying.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Be a grown-up. Enjoy the chance to make a completely fresh start with people you have offended in a way that never happens in the real world.

<dd>No, I don't plan to block you <i>again</i>; you're <i>still blocked</i>, and therefore the new account is yet another sock. I certainly will block it. Sorry, but I'm quite confounded by alteripse's statement that "no one is keeping you from editing wikipedia. You are welcome to make a fresh start with another account." Making a "fresh start with another account" <b>while blocked</b> is one of the things that have gotten the <i>person</i> — not any one of her accounts, or all of them — into all this trouble.I'm surprised at the need for saying this, but I'll say it: HW — the person, the user who operated the account User:Hollow Wilerding, is not welcome to edit under another account while blocked! No blocked user is welcome to create another account while blocked and edit from it, as I'm sure alteripse knows. Alteripse, I'm wondering if perhaps there's a date confusion: did you realize she is <i>still blocked</i>? My two-week block will run out in two days' time, and when that goes, so does Snowspinner's indefinite block. We have been talking, above, about letting her start editing again at that point. You haven't unblocked HW yourself, and nobody else has either. <b>To Hollow</b>: I've blocked the new account. I'm sorry if you were given the wrong impression, and I won't hold it against you that you created a new account at this time, since there seems to be some misunderstanding. But as you can see above, you are expected to sit out this two-week block. It's frankly little enough to ask, considering the circumstances. DO NOT try to edit until the two-week block runs out, unless a total change of consensus is indicated here, in this thread, before then. So far, nobody but alteripse has suggested that it's remotely appropriate for you to start editing before then. Please don't try. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:00, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For those who may not know, this isn't solely about creation of sockpuppet accounts, deception and disruption (though those infractions in and of themselves I would consider grounds for permanent banning). Winnermario was blocked for 24 hours for making homophobic personal attacks not too long ago, and also became one of the subjects of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Pop_music_issues_ef8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Pop music issues">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Pop music issues</a> (there's more to be said, which I'll leave out for brevity's sake). I have an extremely difficult time believing that Hollow Wilerding's admittance that she had previously been Winnermario was "written by [her] brother", especially given the falsehoods that whoever this person is has been coming up with while rotating through new accounts and IP's.

<p>I just checked my log to make sure I'm not crazy, but Hollow was blocked until the 16th. I reblocked Hollow's new IP until the 16th. The USER is blocked, and evidently Hollow, her siblings, her dog, and anyone else who has access to her name is also blocked as they all have showed spectacularly similar conduct. At the very least Hollow is blocked. This has not changed, and continued block evasion is just asking for a new block.</p>
<p>Anyone able to give me a good reason NOT to block the new user name and IP until the 16th if not later?--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 01:49, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh yeah. Both IP and new account are blocked until 20:00 Jan 15 UTC, although I'm considering extending them.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 02:04, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tznkai, please see my reply to alteripse above. I really think he may be unaware that she's still blocked. Anyway, I very much agree with you, and I've also blocked the new (sock) account. As I said, still higher up in this thread, I'm not planning on re-blocking HW after the two-week block runs out (unless there are more shenanigans). Please don't sanction her for creating the Solar Serenity account, as it looks like she was led by alteripse's post into thinking she had a right to do that. But honestly, if she now, after my clarification above, can't or won't sit out the remaining two days now, I'd be all for you re-blocking. Behaving herself for two whole days would be the very first gesture of good faith and cooperation she has made since this sorry business began. I don't think that's too much to ask, as a token of respect for the community and its policies. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:50, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with Bishonen. The user has not been two weeks without editing. In fact, the user has evaded the block on every day <i>but</i> three during the two weeks. Re-blocking this one particular account name may be moot, as the user now has <b>six</b> accounts, but I would not be satisfied until the user goes fourteen days with no edits as an anonymous IP, as Siblings WC, as Empty Wallow, as Solar Serenity, or as Winnermario, or as Drippinglink, or as Cruz Along, or as <b>any of the other accounts the user has set up to evade blocks.</b> After those two weeks, let there be Arb Com or Mentoring. If no one but Everyking is available to be the user's mentor, then I'd suggest ArbCom and permanent blocking on sight. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: the only method of discipline the project has is the block. Evading the blocks is vandalism, no matter the content of the edits. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:22, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the off chance Hollow is telling the truth, I'm going to issue a blanket block for all person's in that house because of their inability to clearly show a lack of sockpuppetering, individual identity, and civil behavior. In otherwards, they are all blocked for the same duration, for disrupting the Wiki, whether all is one or twenty.

<dl>
<dd>Tznkai, the ArbCom already formally defines such households as one person. But, since this has been explained to HW several times and she seems to have trouble grasping it, I think the blanket block is a great idea: it may help her get her mind round the concept that she's responsible for anything, including any lies, that are posted from her computer with her password. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:51, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me once more say very clearly, in words that the user can grasp: <i>fulfill the two week block by not editing, under any guise, for two full weeks, and then you can have an RFC on your actions.</i> At the very least, you would need someone trusted and dispassionate to be your mentor. I don't know why user:alterpise said what he did, but his view is not supported by any of the other administrators (except one) who has reviewed the case. You are <b>not</b> free to open yet another account and edit away. In fact, you are responsible for each of the edits made by the brother/lover/husband/roommate/self (and you've explained each each way). The lies pile upon each other to such a degree as to render each and every statement null. There is no information you can offer about yourself that can be believed. At this point, the single user case you remind me of most of all is Michael. He was blocked for over a <i>year,</i> and when he came back, it was only with a very patient mentor. Let ArbCom decide on what terms you can edit, if you wish to edit at all. Otherwise, you are going to be treated by many administrators as simply a vandal to be blocked on sight. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:16, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know alot about this case, but believe that we - as a whole - should look over the issue from the beginning, for if an unfair block was leavied against this - as I believe* - decent editor and contributor it would drive her to protest any way she could, which since her talk page has been shut down (one of the worst things that you can do to a blocked user IMHO) would include making new accounts. In one of them she plainly states who she is - doesn't sound too sneaky to me...</dd>

<dd>Also while I don't know the situations of her family I do believe that you are being hasty for unless you know 100% that she's the only one in the house you don't have a right to cite those edits as coming from her. A block pertains to a person not an account right, well does that block automatically trasfere to anyone using the same computer and their accounts?

<dd>It's a Michael-like situation. Block 1 for personal attacks came to Winnermario. Instead of taking the block, the user created the account of Hollow Wildering. For several weeks, the user edited there, maintaining that the user was a 24 year old teacher in Toronto. The user also had two other accounts. These accounts were used to vote for articles created by HW on FAC. In one case, these false votes were the only ones cast, and the article got promoted. CheckUser showed that three accounts were, indeed, the same IP. The user lied on at least four occasions about that (one is brother/roomate/neighbor and another is neighbor/boyfriend/husband/roommate, depeding on which diff or day you check). That block was for two weeks. Again, the user immediately evaded the block by setting up yet another account (bringing the total to four). That was blocked, since the editor had not yet served a single day of the Winnermario block, much less the Hollow Wiledering block. The user then set up <i>another</i> account (now we're at five) to evade that block. When that was blocked, the user began editing as a series of dynamic IP's. The user has now set up a sixth account. Notice that the user has not served a single 24 hour period of block time. The user has evaded five blocks. The issue is not the edits, it's the mendacity and the complete unwillingness to abide by the rules of the project.

<p>I've never heard of the Michael situation, but I must say that you have to examine all sides of the situation, and the blocking of her talk page is extremely rude/wrong. I think at least we should unblock the talks and give her a chance to defend herself. Also it's quite plausible that she does have a brother, and a roommate that also contribute. Maybe look for differences in their writing styles or a large amount of similarities to see if indeed they are the same person. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 01:04, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well I looked over your links and while I think that her continuous renomination of Hollaback Girl, or whatever the exact spelling is, was uncalled for what I see is that she and her brother both edit from a "family computer" and have tried to avoid controversy by making a joint account, which has been blocked. I do see that she has made excessive accounts (not including the two for her brother, and roommate) to circumvent blockes, but I have no problem believing she did this in a sort of defense. The "empty willow(?)" account clearly stated who she was, and the "solar" one was used <i>here</i> to discuss, neither was hiding anything. I'm not condoning what she's done, but I believe that there should be outside people contributing to this discussion that aren't biased. I suggest we 1) make her list all who contribute on the family computer 2) allow each a seperate account 3) get rid of the infite block prescribing instead I don't know a few weeks, but make it clear that this block is for the whole computer <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 04:32, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your points 1+2: I wish people wouldn't keep suggesting things that are based on the idea of Hollow Wilerding providing reliable information, because tht's pointless. I'd so much rather not keep repeating this, especially since I believe the user to be very young, but since you twist my arm, here goes: HW doesn't have any credibility on wikipedia. Even if you've studied my links thoroughly (and I hardly see how you would have had the time), those links only contain a fraction of the real list of her deceit, misleading statements, and circumstantial tall tales, always, as I've said before, with the words honesty and AGF in her mouth. I don't want her lists.</dd>
<dd>Point 3) I seem to be repeating myself since forever about this aspect too.&#160;:-( <i>The infinite block will disappear automatically when my two-week block expires</i>, which will be Real Soon Now. Please scroll up to where I explain this: "Although Snowspinner — Phil Sandifer — has blocked the User:Hollow Wilerding account indefinitely, it's my earlier two-week block that's the operative one, since shortest block rules. My block will be released on January 15th or 16th — whatever your timezone says — together with any longer block." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=34844604&amp;oldid=34844511" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=34844604&amp;oldid=34844511" rel="nofollow">[153]</a> Geogre thinks the account should then be immediately re-blocked for another couple of weeks, since HW has so notoriously violated and disrespected the present block, and ought to have a block during which she behaves with some decorum (for a change) and demonstrates that she<i>will</i> have some respect for community policies.

<dd>Briefly: The user must fulfill the two week block by actually not editing from any account or IP for that long. It is only <i>after</i> that that we can talk about how good or bad the editor's work is, whether any of the multiple versions of the family romance-family setting the editor has described should be believed or not. Until the penalty for personal attacks and then for vote stacking and then legal threats is served, we should hear no discussion of how good or bad the edits to Gwen Stefani articles are. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:50, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is now <i>after</i> 20:00 Jan 15 UTC. The block has expired. It is time that I make my case.</dd>
<dd>I am not going to fulfill a two-week block because, as stated by me numerous times before, the three of us had not intended to harm Wikipedia. It is <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> who turned the situation into an uproar when it could have easily been prevented. For example, <a href="../../../s/i/b/User%7ESiblings_CW_0ee8.html" title="User:Siblings CW">User:Siblings CW</a> was blocked <i>before</i> User:Hollow Wilerding and Siblings CW was tagged as a sock puppet account when I had confirmed that we attempted to compromise by creating an account for us to share. Out of nowhere, Bishonen "informs" us that public accounts are not allowed. There is no such policy or guideline on Wikipedia, and also, let us say that Hollow Wilerding had been operated by three different people from the start, nobody would have figured, making this "policy" completely useless to Wikipedia. The blocking of User:Siblings CW presents obvious facts that Bishonen did not want us to be capable of compromising and be blocked for "using sock puppet attacks". Furthermore, she has been attempting to continuously enforce my block because she did not like my response(s) at the nominations for <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollaback_Girl_21e4.html" title="Hollaback Girl">Hollaback Girl</a>. Had the two of us never met before, I'm sure this situation would have differed greatly, and an actual discussion would have commenced instead of a ridiculous argument where the admins can only guess at poke at the three of us with fun. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a>'s above comment is solely backing-up Bishonen's comment as they appear to be friends, so of course he would say such a thing. What would be the point of talking about family/friend(s) issues after a block when the family/friend(s) had not meant to cause harm? I should have just asked my brother and roommate to not vote, or have removed their votes from the FAC.</dd>
<dd>Sometimes people are sent to prison, and twenty years later, it is discovered that they did not commit the crime. That person is therefore capable of placing a legal lawsuit. The same situation sort of holds ground here as well, though I don't believe the lawsuit is necessary as that would just be silly. In other words, I do not accept the terms of a block without solid evidence. Once again, assuming is not enough evidence.

<p>The IP campaigning (pretending first not to be the editor) for Hollow Wilerding then says, "I am not going to fulfill a two-week block because, as stated by me numerous times before, the three of us had not intended to harm Wikipedia." That is an admission both that the first statement (that the IP is not the user) is incorrect and offers an admission that, until the user agrees with the block, he or she will not abide by the block and will continue to create accounts. Therefore, I have blocked the account for one week, which is far too little. Please note the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>No user on a block is allowed to create an account</li>
<li>Any account created by a user on a block is <b>supposed to be</b> blocked indefinitely</li>
<li>No one gets to pick and choose which policies apply to him or her</li>
<li>By editing any data at Wikipedia, one is agreeing to abide by its policies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, this block of one week for admitted block evasion and for a promise to continue to evade blocks until the user feels like they are just is, admittedly, too brief. My goal in making it only a week is yet another vain hope that the user will suspend editing until the block expires, then return to the account, at which time his or her behavior can be properly assessed by the arbitration committee. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:14, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not an RFC, Extraordinary Machine.

If the shenanigans continue, either an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">RFAr</a> or a permanent community ban is the obvious next step. And they are continuing: <b>HW has already violated her solemn undertaking not to try to edit for the duration of Geogre's one-week block</b>. The autoblocker just caught her a little while ago using the Solar Serenity IP: "<i>20:44, 16 January 2006, Bishonen (Talk) blocked #82331 (expires 20:44, 17 January 2006) (Unblock) (Autoblocked because your IP address has been recently used by "Solar Serenity".

The timestamps are for my timezone, which is CET (=UTC plus 1) and the reason the autoblocker credits me instead of Geogre is that I reset his block earlier for technical reasons (=stupidity).

<dd>Note: Accounts set up by blocked users must be blocked indefinitely. That is why the Solar Serenity account is blocked. Further, while the HW user asked on Bishonen's page whether that account could be used for her brother Cruz while she sat out the week's block, the HW user says, above, that the brother Cruz has left and will never return and has no desire to ever edit Wikipedia again. Thus, there have been no allowances for a family having multiple accounts with a single IP, as, above, we were assured that there was no longer more than one person wishing to edit. Until the block on that IP has been fulfilled by a week, no one from that IP can be assumed to be a different person.

<dd>I think that we should consider this to be trolling to the same degree as someone who votes "Delete" on all articles up for deletion. In other words - no.

<dd>Yeah. I think its laughable that people even criticise this. I got criticised for voting "keep" on a whopping 40% of articles nominated for deletion, and then criticised for voting "oppose" on about 40% of candidates on RFAs. So did Freestylerappe. Its laughable really. Unless we are supposed to automatically vote delete on every article that's nominated and support on every administrator, it just reeks of an attempt to try to de-individualise people. We are all individuals, and should be allowed to vote outside of the box.

<dd>His voting habits have been (somewhat) explained on his talk page. It's not optimal to <b>oppose</b> without stating a reason within the vote, but it's also not unheard of. A single vote isn't going to topple the process, and skirmishing over it benefits no one.</dd>
<dd>I certainly agree that his voting habits could be <b>seen</b> as trolling, but it becomes Wikipedia to extend the benefit of the doubt in the absence of unambiguous evidence to the contrary. If someone feels that admin standards are too low, it's their right to vote their conscience.</dd>

<dd>Look, when an RfA has a weak, obviously unqualified nominee, with 0/10(S/O) he will support.

<dd>Exactly, "meh". In itself, voting against the tide doesn't hurt anyone. Ignoring it doesn't hurt anyone. As for "maintaining and perfecting the regulations that help make this a fruitful project," they don't help make it fruitful when they're enforced just for their own sake. I don't see how bugging <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasssiveego_09fe.html" title="User:Masssiveego">User:Masssiveego</a> about his RfA votes is going to get any more articles written and improved than leaving him alone would. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 16:00, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course. As I stated on one the many rfa's he made a ridiculous vote on, his trolling will be ignored. I trust our Bcrats, and I'm absolutely positive that his borderline nonsensical "votes" will have no outcome on any of these rfas'. I am curious, however, as to why he votes the way he does and (argubably) disrupts the process, but like the two above: "meh".

I think that the links provided should be presented somewhere and answered by Wikipedians. Whether there is really a restraining order or not, I don't know. But does WP:NLT cover threats against Wikipedia as a whole? Or even bogus notices against Wikimedia? I am not convinced that it does. Even if it is bogus, I don't think its bannable.

<dd>Hello. Thank you very much to unblock me. Hello Gadfium. No, I am not insolved in this case. It is a case between the parents of Boris F. and Wikimedia Foundation, Jimmy Wales. My part here is only to inform or to warn Jimmy and you admins, simple to avoid big damages to Wikipedia. The decision was filed on 14. December 2005 and the Marshal is already on the way to Jimmy Wales, see also my complete report. Thank you very much. --</dd>

<dd><b>Warning: IAAL is a troll</b>. He is not a lawyer, while he likes to make people to believe the opposite. On his use page in the german wikipedia he states "Here i am again as a jurist" but at two other places (in the discussions about the case) he admits that he is not a jurist or lawyer. It is commonly believed that a well known german troll (famous for legal hasslement, harassment and a lot of other ugly actions) is behind that nick, because the actions and posts reflect the normal behaviour of that troll. Before creating a user account under the name IAAL in the german wikipedia, this person trolled by abusing an open proxy in the US. -- <a href="../../../k/j/u/User%7EKju_%28de%29_3206.html" title="User:Kju (de)">Kju (de)</a> 13:21, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

According to the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_law.html" title="German law">german law</a>, filing an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal.html" title="Appeal">appeal</a> will provocate a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearing.html" title="Hearing">hearing</a> in Berlin.

<p>I don't see this as a legal threat but rather notice of an actual temporary restraining order made by a German court against Wikipedia, on the grounds of privacy. On the order itself, I don't see any problem with complying with this temporary order, which seems to be genuine. It may be that Wikipedia can comply by refusing to serve the page to German-allocated IP numbers.

After the cryptic death of Boris F., who was find suspended on a tree in Berlin, the parents and family - with all the pains they have been in deep mourning because of loosing their child - the parents do not want the complete familyname being published anywhere at wikipedia.org. This wish can be respected.</li>
<li>The Wikimedia Foundation, some german admins of wikipedia.org have ignored this wish of the parents. This is the reason why the German Municipal Court of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> was called.</li>

<dd>You are under the misimpression that the german wikipedia changed the page title because of this legal threat. This is not true. We already had long discussions about the subject about half an year ago, and the change of the page title was only meant as a compromise (typical for german wikipedia) to get both sides satisfied. So the impression that german wikipedia is following the injunction is wrong. The opposite is true: The article still holds the full name (and thats what the injunction is about), and was locked by administrators to keep it that way (and prevent the edit war which occured when the article was not locked). And one more thing: Despite what IAAL is trying to make people belive, most german jurists who have commented on the case believe that the injuction is junk and won't stand a trial anyway. -- <a href="../../../k/j/u/User%7EKju_%28de%29_3206.html" title="User:Kju (de)">Kju (de)</a> 13:43, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello Zach. This was an excellent job by you. Nickname is ok, short form Boris F. is also ok - and the complete familyname is locked. Perfect!&#160;:-) The other things in the other languages, that's still awful, because all the articles with his complete familyname (note: The Judge said "<b>no familyname anywhere at WIKIPEDIA.ORG</b>") are still accessable to Germany especially to the German Court via the Internet. Is there a technical solution, to make an entry of "global bad words" into the Wikipedia-software, so, the complete familyname will not appear anywhere in any languages? If not, uh.... aren't there about 170 different languages at wikipedia, and so all articles (existing, non-existing) must be locked? -- <a href="../../../i/a/a/User%7EIAAL_c5e4.html" title="User:IAAL">IAAL</a> 07:26, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, they can certainly pass that law in Germany, but that doesn't mean people in completely different countries with completely different laws have to pay any attention to it. The worst they can do is try to impose fines on us that we won't have any legal obligation to pay. This is a gross overreach of their legal power, and, furthermore, an admin taking it upon himself to delete the page based upon the claims of a lawyer party to the action is a hugely bad precedent that will only lead to more and more censorship. I recommend restoring the page and keeping it there until US law recognizes German authority on this matter (i.e. likely never), or until an AfD or Jimbo says otherwise. Furthermore, why is IAAL still posting here? This is a clear case of a party to a threatened legal action talking here, that's against all policy. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 07:52, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello Zach and Scm83x. You are very correct, this strategy by the german attorney-at-law is very intelligent, because in one side there exist the internationality of wikipedia and in the other side there exist also the internationality of the Internet. This is why you have all national laws of each nation within one pot. A chance to lump together all the laws and to provocate international conflicts especially to abuse it. In the other side, there has never been a reason to publish an article about Boris F., because he has never been a person of the contemporary history. Goethe, Einstein, Schiller, Mozart, no problem, but Boris F.? It is the free editing, that everybody is allowed to create an new article and now the Wikimedia Foundation and Jimmy have a problem.

<p>There is still a minor problem: the recreated page presumably uses content from the original page, but as that has been deleted the authors of the original are not credited as they must be under the licence, <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. This is not an urgent problem; if we take a few days to sort it out I'm sure no one will mind. We could decide to have no article at all on this person; we could rewrite the article entirely; or we may be able to do something clever with selective undeletion of the original so the exact earlier contents are not visible but the article history is. Cutting and pasting the original's history page (without the surname) to the talk page would be the simplest method of preserving the GFDL requirements.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 07:36, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My intent was to nuke the previous article and write it from scratch at the new location, so GFDL concerns will be met.

<p>The discussion page for Boris F should probably be deleted as well. Although there is nothing linking to it, it is using his name on Wikipedia in a manner which would annoy the German judge.

<p>Listen, the point here is, whenever any large group (organization, business, etc.) has a legal threat come in, they don't just let some individual working on his own take it upon himself to do whatever the person making the threat says. That's why there are legal advisors. This action is hugely bad precedent, and the deletion should not be done by admins trying to interpret laws on their own. Furthermore, this is a clear question of censorship, and we can't anyone just come along and make a threat and get some naive but well intentioned person to do whatever they ask. This is nonsense. The article needs to be restored until Wikimedia lawyers, Jimbo, or some official decision is made through some other process. The German law is totally bogus. The same thing happened with the Canadian courts when they tried to gag people on details of various murder trials there, and we never followed their threats, and if Iran comes along and tells us to remove everything for our servers that they feel is objectionable, then China, etc., we won;t have anything left.

<dd><i>The German law is totally bogus.</i> Please don't judge the german law on grounds of a single injunction. Such injuctions are issued without much checking into the legal background of the case. If the argumentes brought before by the plaintiff sounds remotely reasonable, such a injuction is granted. It is up to a court to decide if the injunction will stand. Also the injuction was issued by a so called "Amtsrichter" which is the lowest grade of a judge in germany. More often than not such judges make wrong decisions (often even ignoring general decisions made by the german supreme court) and their decisions get invalidated by the next higher courts. Many german lawyers have commented (in germany) on this case, and most of them believe that, while the topic is fishy, the injuction does not stand on real legal background and is trash. -- <a href="../../../k/j/u/User%7EKju_%28de%29_3206.html" title="User:Kju (de)">Kju (de)</a> 14:00, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this is perfectly unacceptable. You deleted a perfectly good article, replacing it with a stub referring to Wikipedia and Jimmy Wales instead of the actual case, without AfD, just because some user posted legal threats to Talk:Main?? I say, undelete at once, post the threats to the board, and do nothing until board members request deletion.</p>

He is not an attorney-at-law, and i belive there isn't even any attorney-at-law involved in this case, because its not about criminal matters (currently) but about a civil law case. Müller-Maguhn just got some lawyer who went to the court and got a injuction against wikipedia. There is no attorney-at-law involved in this, and it should also be noted that such injunctions are often granted without checking the legal background very deeply.

<p>Hello. It might be, that some wikipedians will not like this decision by the Court (me, too), but the current english version is also accessible in Germany. There would be 1000 arguments with an endless discussion especially emotional arguments ("censorship", etc.). We are American. We are cool. We calm down by a very easy way because of this provocation from the German Court. Fact is, that there is just now - temporary(!), note: it is only temporary - the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restraining_order.html" title="Restraining order">restraining order</a> with the tenor of the German Judge "no complete familyname of Boris F. anywhere at WIKIPEDIA.ORG, or a fine of 250,000,- Euro or up to 6 months jail". And the american admins made a perfect job to realize this as soon as possible as well as possible especially to avoid big damages for Wikipedia and Jimbo. Removing the familyname does not make anybody poor but ignoring. So the final things things must be regulated by the Wikimedia Foundation themselves and Jimmy Wales himself, who are responsible for this case. I am sure, they have phantastic attorney-at-laws, who will help them. I am also sure, they will bring the crazy case to the right one and correct end. It is just now unknown, if Wikimedia Foundation will file an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal.html" title="Appeal">appeal</a> to the Municipal Court of Berlin in Germany or whatever. But after it, everybody here will know what's going on with the familyname of Boris F.. This is only my voluntary advice to the admins. If you will do another thing especially without asking Jimbo, then you will clearly have to stand for the consequences, f.e. <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regress.html" title="Regress">regress</a>, damagefees of regress, etc.. I hope, I could show you a little bit my goodwill to you. Thank you very much. -- <a href="../../../i/a/a/User%7EIAAL_c5e4.html" title="User:IAAL">IAAL</a> 09:08, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you are involved with this threat you should not be discussing the issue here, you should be discussing things direct with out legal counsel. Wikimedia doesn;t have to file an appeal in Germany, as it isn;t in Germany and doesn't have to pay attention to any of its laws, all it has to do is ignore the stupid overreaching and nonsensical ruling by a judge who doesn't respect other countries' rights to govern themselves. If they send a fine, it can be ignored. If they threaten to arrest someone if they ever go to Germany, well, fine, I love the beer and chocolate, but Australia is close enough. This whole thing is idiotic, and if you are involved with the court case you should already be banned. Goodwill has nothing to do with this, it's just scare tactics to trick people into doing what you want them to do. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 09:18, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is a fact that people who used to fight themselves for free information and know the "spirit" of this project did not sue one of several german newspapers or publishers mentioning Tron's real name but Wikipedia. This is one of the main reasons for the irritation and it has caused several critical remarks in german media. Recently, the CCC has reacted and stated that it does not take sides in the case. <a href="http://www.ccc.de/updates/2006/wikipedia-vs-tron?language=de" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccc.de/updates/2006/wikipedia-vs-tron?language=de" rel="nofollow">[169]</a> --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightlike_033c.html" title="User:Lightlike">Lightlike</a> 09:58, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Spiegel</i> speculates that Mueller-Maguhn wants publicity because he thinks Tron was murdered and wants to keep the issue vaguely live. It also says that a recent novel gave Tron's full name; the publisher received a restraining order but refused to endorse it. (Oh, and I don't know if it's been corrected yet, but the restraining order to Wikimedia was initially misaddressed to St Petersburg, Russia.)<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzkultur/0,1518,394374,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzkultur/0,1518,394374,00.html" rel="nofollow">[170]</a> <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 11:16, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It should also noted that Müller-Maguhn is losing his (rather small) supporter base even inside the Chaos Computer Club. Many people nowadays see this a a private business of Müller-Maguhn and the CCC has officially distanced the club from the incident in a recent press release (see url above). So don't see this as a case of CCC against Wikipedia but rather a case of some (probably misguided) people against Wikipedia. Most people in the CCC are of sane mind and do not believe in legal hasslement. (Disclaimer: I was a member of the CCC and left it for a couple of reasons. Some people believe that i'm working against the CCC because of this. This is not true, but you might want to consider that). -- <a href="../../../k/j/u/User%7EKju_%28de%29_3206.html" title="User:Kju (de)">Kju (de)</a> 13:34, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The reason that meta-templates are to be avoided is that when you have a template which calls many other templates that is used on many pages updates to the template can cause significant server load. That isn't the case here. The load from this template is insignificant. The thousands of un-subst'd 'welcome' messages on various talk pages are a bigger deal. The babel templates (yup, those are meta-templates too) are a bigger deal. There is no reason to remove <b>every</b> 'meta template' in Wikipedia.

<dd>&lt;?&gt; I wasn't even <i>talking</i> to you. Which should be obvious if you 'broke nothing'. The template got broken. Some people were saying 'this is a good thing'. It isn't. Yes, there are ways to fix it. Yes, we should look to not use meta-templates (or templates at all) when we don't need to. None of which changes the fact that breaking things and saying, 'Ok now it is <b>your</b> job to clean up the mess I just made' is equally "unnecessary". Most meta-templates can be seemlessly replaced without anyone noticing that something changed (see Template:Journal reference for example). For those which can't a plan to convert them should be announced and the changeover accomplished as quickly / cleanly as possible. We should never be talking about how it is 'good' to make a mess of things and then force people who don't know what is going on to sort it out. That is needlessly disruptive. Which also ought to be obvious. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 13:21, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm sorry, but no - the reason we don't use meta-templates is server load. The policy has been there for a while. And the only pages we are breaking are userpages. The right of userpages to have their pretty userboxes do not trump the server issues under ANY circumstances at all. Simply put, user pages just don't matter enough to keep meta-templates around. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 16:19, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First - "the reason we don't use meta-templates". False statement. We use meta-templates all the time. The <a href="../../../m/a/i/Main_page.html" title="Main page">Main page</a> is chock full of meta-templates. Both of <b>your</b> userpages (Snowspinner &amp; MegamanZero) contain meta-templates. The policy is "AVOID" using meta-templates, not "DON'T" use meta-templates.<br />
Second - only templates which get called by <b>many</b> pages cause significant server load... and then only when they are updated. This template was seldom updated and appeared on less than four hundred pages. The 'server load' issue here is virtually non-existant. Updating the 'Test1' template would be a bigger deal... even though it is not a 'meta' template.<br />
Third - even if the policy <b>were</b> to hunt down and destroy every meta-template no matter how insignificant its impact on server load... it would <b>still</b> be wrong to 'break first and sort it out later'. There is no need for it. Just plan ahead and transition the templates to new methods smoothly.

It's an argument to stop the harm Test1 does. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 18:19, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Heh, if you want to get <i>technical</i> then actually the Main page uses 'meta-templates' (templates "created and used to keep other templates in a standard format") and things like 'Qif' and 'Switch' are the 'nested templates' (templates which call other templates). Either way the root issue is the same (and applies equally to simple templates like Test1)... every page which calls a template (or which calls a template which calls that template, and so forth) must be updated when the template is. This creates server load. Because some of the 'if' and 'boolean' templates get called by MANY other templates, which are in turn called by MANY pages, these sorts of 'nested' templates (technically <b>not</b> meta-templates per the definition on the page) are amongst the most problematic. My point with Test1 and other examples is that we need to establish some degree of sanity here. This 'all meta-templates (widely re-defined as 'nested' templates) are bad' concept results in 'fixing' problems which don't exist while leaving significantly worse 'non-meta' templates in place. We should be seeking to remove templates used on thousands of pages... whether they are simple, nested, meta, or whatever is irrelevant. Once you get down <i>below</i> a thousand pages linked I'd question just how significant the server load is... but if we want to avoid even those minimal drains then people need to understand... we aren't talking about doing away with 'meta-templates'. We are talking about doing away with <b>templates</b>. In my opinion going after relatively harmless things like the main page, babel boxes (not the userboxes, but the actual babel meta-templates which call them), open tasks lists, picture of the day templates, et cetera would be silly. The 'server load' issues are insignificant for those and the <b>hundreds</b> of other nested templates in common use throughout Wikipedia. We should be looking at how many pages the template links to and how frequently it gets updated. Those are the determinants of 'server load'. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 18:46, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is a misconception that templates only cause significant server load when updated.

<dd>Nested (or 'meta') templates take longer to render than straight text, but there was a recent discussion on <a href="../../../a/u/m/WT%7EAUM_1fff.html" title="WT:AUM">WT:AUM</a> about the fact that some 'simple' template implementations can take longer to render than the meta equivalents (e.g. evaluating 50 parameters vs calling one of 50 sub-templates). Longer rendering on frequently viewed pages can slow down response time... but in most cases this 'rendering' issue <b>is</b> fairly minor. Reading over <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> shows that it is the added load when <i>updating</i> heavily linked templates which is the primary concern. If you want to make an issue out of rendering double transclusion templates like the Main page and Babel then we are back to getting rid of virtually <i>all</i> templates... which, again, <b>also</b> take longer to render than straight text, and indeed can even take longer than meta equivalents in some cases. For example, the main page templates and that 'pic of the day' meta-template on your user-page would either have to be updated daily as straight text OR require a large parameter switch which would take much longer to render than the current double-transclusion. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 21:47, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, out of context. "One click" was refering to the 3 stop listing process, as in LISTING it automatically, as in not having to add {{AFD}}, follow the link, list it on the WP page. I am not "new" either. "Vanity" has been used for years to delete nonsense, so mentioning the other deletions is just a red herring.</dd>
<dd>Also, the Google hits only mentioned the name and banjo. I went to the pages and he got less than a line of mentioning, such as noting him a player and moving on to the main topic. I found no articles <i>on</i> him, and nothing that said anything about him, other than being a banjo player who played with more notable people.</dd>
<dd>Oh and I am interested in Policy like the correct (WP:V) assertion of notability. I have argued for Semi-Protection policy, WP:NOR, WP:PP, WP:V and others to be enforced more. Please stop making false strawmen accusations, all of this drama is making my head spin.</dd>

<p>Voice of All, you'd do better to not use "vanity" as your description. It is not a CSD. An nn-bio, or an A7 is. An article not asserting notability is. But vanity is not, and has never been. It's kind of psychologically important too, since, if you are working on "vanity" as a CSD, that's an entirely more liberal version of "nn-bio" than is acceptable. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:44, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Although I think that the comment "Anyone can challenge at deletion review" was taken out of context, I would remind all admins that only 800 of the thousands of editors can <i>see</i> the content of a deleted article, so for most most of us, the speedy deletion of an article is final. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDS1953_dfdb.html" title="User talk:DS1953"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 23:22, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He should at least comply to the requests on his talk page and provide a source. I'd be much more inclined to clean up all these articles if I knew they weren't going to be deleted at any time, but if he doesn't even provide a reference there's no basis for including them in Wikipedia.</dd>

<p>Can we get some permanent relief from this person? The info about the case is here: User:Dijxtra/Sock. This user is either actually demented or a very sophisticated troll. This has gone on for weeks and weeks, one article is really bollixed up, this could go on forEVER, it take's people's time every day, and there is nothing more to be done but block the entire range for a while, please. Just read User:Dijxtra/Sock, I request a 1 or 2 week block on the entire IP range and all the puppets. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 21:52, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Zen-master has reverted the addition of the "rejected" tag on Wikipedia:Title Neutrality (created by him) five times in 16 hours. Three different editors have reverted him. The 3RR violation has been listed <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:Zen-master" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">here</a> at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>, but hasn't yet received comment from an admin. In addition to blocking him for the 3RR violation, I also ask that an admin ban him from editing this page for at least two weeks, per the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Zen-master_0dbe.html#Remedies" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Zen-master">terms of his probation</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 22:04, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Izehar has blocked him for 24 hours. I'm agree with Carbonite that Zen-master should be banned from editing the article. What do other administrators think? -<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregAsche_4f25.html" title="User:GregAsche">Greg Asche</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGregAsche_1ed6.html" title="User talk:GregAsche">(talk)</a> 22:17, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think he should be banned (yet). The talk page of that page has never been used. If he was revert warring with three other users, they should have discussed the reversions on the talk page. The way I see it, they have been just as disruptive (of course I do not know whether what he has been doing has any merit). IMO when the block expires, if the trolling resumes, then ban him. If he takes the hint and walks away, then there is no need to. Izehar 22:22, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That seems fair to me I guess. I don't think the other users are being disruptive though, the proposal has the support of only Zen-master and one other person. Hopefully he does lay off of the reverts. -<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregAsche_4f25.html" title="User:GregAsche">Greg Asche</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGregAsche_1ed6.html" title="User talk:GregAsche">(talk)</a> 22:36, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I'm in favor of banning him from that (and related) policy or proposal pages. "Title Neutrality" is an intentionally misleading name. What it actually is, is a proposal to rename articles to not contain the term "conspiracy theory", which Zen finds offensive. If you read the proposal, it refers only to those kinds of "neutral" titles. This has previously been proposed on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConspiracy_theory_5aa7.html" title="Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory">Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory</a>, and was soundly rejected. Zen has been requested to use <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> to discuss page moves, but prefers to create a policy page to "back" his opinion. He's already using this page in discussion as if it were policy. The guy seriously needs to stop wikilawyering. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 22:56, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>From past interaction, Zen-master has demonstrated that he has an extremely broad definition of "vandalism", expanding to include basically any edits he disputes. He's well aware of what it actually says at <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>, but still continues to label edits he disagrees with as vandalism. I see no reason to unblock him early and rather strong justification to temporarily ban him from editing Wikipedia:Title Neutrality. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 23:44, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>
<ul>
<li>There's really no point in unblocking him to allow him to edit those talk pages. In my experience, he simply repeats the same arguments over and over again, not listening to anybody else (and calling them vandals, cabalists, etc). Not just on this page but on others too, e.g. check the history of <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_prerogatives_78ea.html" title="Wikipedia:User prerogatives">Wikipedia:User prerogatives</a>. Zenny is unable or unwilling to understand, even after repeated explanation, such concepts as consensus, or the fact that policy isn't created by voting on it. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 00:24, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>I think it's time to put a request in the clarification section of RfAr to see if he can be blocked. There is precedent for users just being put on probation and then after multiple violations, a blocking occuring. I think it's time. Just since early December, he has been blocked from I believe 3-4 articles and he's been banned for 24 hours for 3RR violations another 3-4 times. Probation is failing. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 07:45, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Gibraltarian claims that Ecemaml "has had his chance" and that this page "is all [his] now" - which, if I'm not mistaken, is a violation of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>.

<dd>This person hit Usenet a while back; mention of an "international space agency" as a general concept was met with a screed to "correct misinformation" about posts dating back to 1990(!) which had "nothing to do with "the International Space Agency (ISA) Organization, Trademarked &amp; Copyrighted (1986-2005) Name &amp; Public Identity". (See, for example, <a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sci.space.history/browse_frm/thread/164bd300a21ad99f/" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sci.space.history/browse_frm/thread/164bd300a21ad99f/" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>) The organisation appears to exist, according to my research at the time, but the legal noises are fundamentally baseless.
