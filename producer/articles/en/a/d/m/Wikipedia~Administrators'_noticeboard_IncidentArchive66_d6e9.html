It began with FSF taking umbrage with me pointing out a voting pattern. FSF then accused me of "harassment." After a brief exchange, FSF then voted oppose on Eureka (and another) for my and BDAbramson's (percieved) actions. After I (twice) changed the header of FSF's message on my talk page, FSF blocked me, and then for some entirely perplexing reason, let me know on the RfA first (which is hideously innapropriate, not just for the RfA, and especially the nominee, but the community at large who have to be subjected two admins' argument). As you can see, I have unblocked myself because the block (IMHO) is unwarrented (I only changed the header, not the content or substance of her diatribe), and FSFs actions are genuine trolling at this point. Nevertheless, this needs some outside help, and fast. I feel FSF is trolling, FSF feels I changed her comments.

<dd>I think it's bad form to unblock yourself, Jeffrey. Having said that, I think the initial block was patently unjustified. Modifying a user's header on your own talk page is not modification of another user's comments -- IIRC this policy exists only to prevent misattribution of one's comments. I don't think anyone could have confused the headers for being something written by the original commenter. I also think it's bad form to block in a dispute where you may be biased -- it should have been requested that another admin block Jeffrey. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 15:07, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unblocking yourself is grounds for deadminship. There is no circumstance under which an admin may clear a personal block (not IP block, which could just be collateral damage) of him or herself. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 20:52, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That's far from being a blockable offense—indeed, it's common practice for purposes of organization and categorization. I'm concerned that any admin would block someone for such a slight action. Regarding harrassment, Jeffrey's comment might have been somewhat abrupt but I see no pattern of abuse here. I'm not a bureaucrat, but I know that users who oppose all adminship nominations on principle generally do not carry much weight, especially when they do so without articulating the principle. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 15:03, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would agree, and I do not like the principle of a blocked admin unblocking themselves - even when a block has been applied which is not in accordance with Blocking policy. I would also question <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">Freestylefrappe</a>'s decision to cast an oppose vote for the candidate and citing only his dispute with the nominator as the reason. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 15:10, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Calm down there Sam. I agree Jeffrey should not have unblocked himself, but you also aren't supposed to block someone you're in a dispute with!

<dd>Nice to finally be notified of this discussion, which Gustafson should have done, but obviously did not want me seeing this. Why dont all of you actually look at the original header, which was a gentle warning, and his change. Until then, I see no reason to "explain my version of the events". It's all pretty straight forward. It's also already being discussed on the RFA talkpage.

<dd>I disagree. One instance of abruptness does not a series of personal attacks make. We can only block if a user refuses to stop making personal attacks, and I don't think anything Jeffrey has done yet constitutes a series of personal attacks. In addition, please see my comment regarding his ostensible "modification of comments".

<dd>(edit conflict) Thanks Alex, (and good news for Jeremy, too &lt;grin&gt;). I was actually in the process of apologizing for unblocking myself when I got blocked again.

<p><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">Freestylefrappe</a> makes a good point (although the way he expresses it is not so great). It is common in RFA's for every Oppose vote to be questioned repeatedly, often by the nominator. If the opposer gives no reason, a reason is demanded. If the opposer gives a reason, it is belittled. Support votes receive far less scrutiny. This practice does not respect the right of those who choose to oppose candidates. When you nominate someone in an RFA, you are asking for the opinions of the community. Nominators and others who challenge each oppose vote appear petty and lose my respect. Nominators, especially, need to chill out and not take it personally when someone has a different opinion about the nominee. In the case of frequent opposers like Masssiveego and Boothy, I believe that the way people react to their votes is far more disruptive than the actual Oppose votes are. This contentious atmosphere discourages people from participating in RFA, and it winds up representing the opinion of the admin-inclusionists instead of the community.

<dd>While I generally agree with what you say, Freplay, I think you're losing sight of the particular case we're dealing with here. The user in question, <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasssiveego_09fe.html" title="User:Masssiveego">Masssiveego</a>, was pointed out for opposing not just one, but <i>all candidates running for ArbCom and RfAs within a time span of merely hours</i> (with the exception of merely two - strangely enough, one of the users he supported had a total of 117 edits, a flagrant contradiction with his stated high standards), only providing an explanation in two cases. This being said, I think it's natural that at least a request for an ellaboration of the voting conduct is professed by the community. It is in this ugly context that FSF jumped in, and let's just say that his way to express things didn't quite help with the already agitated mood. My question: was it <i>really</i> harassment to question a (seemingly) disruptive conduct?

<dd>Hi Ambi. I can be a bit (very) paranoid, but I think that comment may be directed at me. While I did vote support a particular candidate with the comment "Because if he's elected, Arbcom will be destroyed", it is because the arbcom is such a disaster. And "someone who defends trolls and banned users all the time" is a bit weird, as I've never defended a banned user. Um, ever.

<p>Last year's election had a notice that appeared automatically at the top of every page (in the same way as <i>Jimbo's personal appeal</i>) telling people about its existance.</p>
<p>How many users are there in wikipedia? Its certainly something in the thousands</p>
<p>200 isn't remotely near a quorate, its a small minority of the community. Specifically, the members of the community that always hang about the arb com pages, or know the people in the election. A clique, cabal, call it what you will, it does not represent the community; most editors do not hang around these pages.</p>
<p>Not telling the masses about an election is a very good way of stitching up the result. It's <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerrymandering.html" title="Gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a>. It isn't right, and it looks very much like an attempt to rig the election by choosing the electorate.</p>

<p>When closing an AFD, the closing admin should neutrally consider the outcome, right, not skew it towards their own desire?</p>
<p>For <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Matthew_1%7E5_8e5d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matthew 1:5">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matthew 1:5</a>, Splash declared no consensus. The results were</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> 19</li>
<li><b>Merge or Delete</b> 5</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> 6</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> 14</li>
</ul>
<p>The total voting for delete or merge/delete was 24. This compares to the 14 keep and 6 pure merge votes. As splash pointed out, this makes the delete position the majority. There was 1 abstention. I think this should have been closed as an obvious <b>delete</b> - 24:14 is a clear majority.</p>
<p>Splash also closed <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Matthew_4%7E14_23ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matthew 4:14">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matthew 4:14</a> as no consensus. The results were</p>

<li><b>Merge or Delete</b> 4</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> 1</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> 13</li>
</ul>
<p>This is slightly less obvious an outcome, but the total voting for delete or merge/delete was 19, compared to 13 to keep, and 1 purely to merge.</p>
<p>Splash also closed <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_John_20%7E19_afca.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/John 20:19">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/John 20:19</a> as a delete. This was owing to the unavoidable obviousness of the result</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> 18</li>
<li><b>Merge or Delete</b> 4</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> 1</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>The total for delete or merge/delete here was 22, compared with 6 for keep, and 1 purely to merge. 3 of the delete votes also expressed a desire that the article be allowed to be recreated if it was done more substantively. Splash insisted that these 3 were more important than the other 19, and refused to delete anything other than the article, i.e. explicitely refused to orphan it.</p>
<p>Additionally Ichiro closed <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Matthew_2%7E21_3a19.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matthew 2:21">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matthew 2:21</a> as no consensus. The results being</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> 22</li>
<li><b>Merge or Delete</b> 3</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> 2</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> 15</li>
</ul>
<p>The total for delete or merge/delete here was 25, compared with 15 for keep, and 2 purely to merge. I think this is an obvious <b>delete</b>, 25:15 is a clear majority.</p>
<p>I think the closing admins' own religious prejudices had a say here, particularly in the case of <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> as Splash's closing comments indicate that Splash clearly didn't want to delete John 20:19, but had no choice as the outcome was stunningly clear. And I also think that these articles should clearly be deleted as per AFD consensus, <b>and</b> orphaned.</p>

This is the sort of thing that RFC can be used for with some sort of chance it doesn't explode into a massive choatic mess, as long as we all handle it with the civility displayed thus far.

<dd>I think Splash was right, even by a legalistic reading like "delete at 2/3." My understanding, subject to correction, is if a vote isn't 'delete,' it's keep.

<dd>More to the point, deletion is almost NEVER a vote to salt the earth and forbid all future creation of an article. I do not think that anybody would seriously argue that there are not very, very important bible verses that detailed articles could be written on. Leviticus 18:22 strikes me as a verse that could easily generate a featured article. It is well outside the jurisdiction of AfD to make long-term claims about which verses are which - they ought merely judge whether or not this particular article on this particular verse is an encyclopedia article or not. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 20:32, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is, you'd be wrong. Leviticus 18:22 is repeated somewhere in Leviticus 20 or 21 (I forget the precise location), so the article discussing the content issue would have to deal with both verses, not 18:22 on its own. --<a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">Victim of signature fascism</a> | help remove biblecruft 23:37, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> is currently under several restrictions for 12 months following Apr 7 2005, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/RK_2#Remedies" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/RK_2#Remedies" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/RK_2#Remedies</a> These restrictions include “<i>RK is limited to one revert per twenty-four hour period on material directly or indirectly related to Jews and/or Judaism for a period of twelve months, with violations treated as violations of the three-revert rule and also resetting the twelve-month period. Determing what is directly or indirectly related shall be left to the discretion of the administrators.</i>" Another restriction he is under is "<i>RK is placed on standard personal attack parole for twelve months. If he makes any edits which are judged by an administrator to be personal attacks, then he shall be temp-banned for a short time of up to one week, and the twelve month period shall be reset.</i>".</p>
<p>He has violated these restrictions and has had his 12 month period reset see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive58#User_RK" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive58#User_RK" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive58#User_RK</a></p>

<dd>I'm not willing to count this as two reverts because of the time difference involved (about three weeks between the version he is "reverting" to and the first diff) but I will block for the personal attack. It took me a second to realize why it was an attack; Eliezer is an Orthodox Jew, and accusing him of promoting Messianic Judiasm (i.e., a belief in Jesus) is highly offensive. I am not convinced by RK's subsequent post to Talk:Chabad-Lubavitch that he did not intent his comments to be an attack; he should know better, particularly given that he is on probation, and that his probation is a reduction from his original ban. I'm issuing a block, and since the last one was 48 hours, I'm issuing double, or 96 hours/four days. Also, the 12 month PA parole is reset. -- <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 21:41, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A relatively new user, <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">User:Oldwindybear</a>, believes that a comment I made on his talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOldwindybear&amp;diff=34631431&amp;oldid=34527737" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOldwindybear&amp;diff=34631431&amp;oldid=34527737" rel="nofollow">here</a> (referring to meatpuppets I'd believed he had engaged), could be libelous. Though he has said he has no serious intentions on this score, he continues to reference our past interactions as "libelous." Despite cautions from myself and Dmcdevit about why even not completely serious legal threats are not okay <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOldwindybear&amp;diff=34798797&amp;oldid=34761940" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOldwindybear&amp;diff=34798797&amp;oldid=34761940" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, he has continued to post comments mentioning libel on numerous talk pages <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOldwindybear&amp;diff=34632393&amp;oldid=34631431" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOldwindybear&amp;diff=34632393&amp;oldid=34631431" rel="nofollow">his talk page</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bonnie_and_Clyde&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=34630209" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bonnie_and_Clyde&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=34630209" rel="nofollow">T:Bonnie and Clyde</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bonnie_and_Clyde&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=34633533" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bonnie_and_Clyde&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=34633533" rel="nofollow">T:Bonnie and Clyde</a>.

It's incorrectly formatted, but that's easily enough fixed. It's not that I mind the RFC, in fact I'll help format it properly; but I am afraid that at this point something more needs to be done than just asking him to stop bandying "libel" around the way he has been.

<dd>Blocking for personal attacks is permissible under the disruption clause of the current blocking policy; no revision to policy is required. Egregious personal attacks or continued mild harrassment/incivility both serve to create a hostile environment on Wikipedia and drive away or disrupt the work of positive, useful contributors—hence, such behaviour is blockable. Except in the most severe cases, I support warning the editors in question before blocking, but it is sometimes necessary to use blocks to convey the seriousness of their behaviour. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 14:23, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have blocked this account for a period of one month as a temporary measure based on the information at <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_Cool_Cat_incident_report_5388.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER/Cool Cat incident report">User:Brion VIBBER/Cool Cat incident report</a>. I have taken this action as a temporary measure in order to permit time for a consideration of whether the previous ban on MARMOT should be reinstated. I am unsure of whether this should be a matter for Jimbo, the ArbCom, or the Wikipedia Community at large. Given the accusations of exploiting vulnerabilities in the Mediawiki software to spoof the IP of another contributor, thereby getting that user blocked, and the level of planning involved, as brion sets out on the incident report, I am inclined to refer the matter directly to Jimbo. Taking into account the recent problems with "vandalism bot tests" by MARMOT, I am inclined to believe the matter is similar to users like Wik, who were banned by Jimbo directly.</p>
<p>I have discussed the matter with brion (I was in #wikimedia when he was asked to perform the tests, and was present and participated in the conversation of the results) as well as with Kelly Martin, who performed the checkuser. In boiled down terms (for those like myself who do not always follow the technical details involved) the evidence set out by brion, as confirmed by Kelly Martin's checkuser, is very, very strong evidence that the spoofing was performed by MARMOT, and that he has continued to engage in the same conduct for which he was banned during the terms of his "probation."</p>
<p>I am reporting my actions here to begin the process of considering the appropriate remedy; I will also raise the matter with Jimbo directly, and with the Arbitration Committee if he determines that they should make the decision. I encourage those who have comments either way to make them here, as I will point Jimbo and/or the AC to this thread. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 13:37, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Per the above evidence, I agree that this is probably the best thing to do.

<p>Looking at this from an animal - enviroment standpoint, its obvious MARMOT is getting revenge on Cool Cat for several reasons stated in my thesis below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cool Cat is a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat.html" title="Cat">cat</a>, which are predatory by nature. MARMOT, is of course defined in the rodent category, and this makes the two mortal predator and prey (ie. enemies)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Seeing the decendents of one of his predatory enemies, MARMOT quickly decided to take action - by continually harassing Cool Cat. That would show <i>him</i> to hunt his species.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was really quite simple, and none of you noticed it. Its simple, Cats and rodents will aways be enemies no matter what the enviroment or habbitat. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanZero_5c06.html" title="User:MegamanZero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegamanZero_9677.html" title="User talk:MegamanZero">Talk</a></sup> 16:18, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Honestly, because when we issue a simple block, it is subject to a simple unblock. The probation, while a good idea and a worthwhile effort, (and I commend those who tried for having the patience and good heart to AGF) has not worked, and hardbanning will prevent similar problems in the future. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 16:16, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What a conisidence... I was just coming over here to discuss this very issue. Copperchair may have stopped the edit-warring and breaching of policy he has shown in the past, but now he has stooped to balnking his talkpage to annoy editors 'round the clock. Several administrators and users have inquired him to discuss this issue and/or simply archive his page, but to no avail (I even offered to do it for him). He is simply not to doing it in good faith, (see his rfar and rfc) and some action must be taken. Coutless users have been more patient than they should have. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanZero_5c06.html" title="User:MegamanZero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegamanZero_9677.html" title="User talk:MegamanZero">Talk</a></sup> 15:55, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think so. There is no rule against blanking you talk page. I certainly don't like the practice, but it's none of our business what users do in their userspace (within reasonable limitations of course). I know many users who blank their talk pages - should they all be protected? I don't think making it a rule would make practical sense anyway. It would be impossible to enforce.

<dd>Real simple: They don't. There's nothing to discuss, there's nothing to chat about. Copperchair was just relesed froma month long ban, and looking through his contributions, its saturated with edit wars, vandalism, and actions requiring blocks and rfars. Also take into account the fact he isn;t making any useful contributions as well. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanZero_5c06.html" title="User:MegamanZero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegamanZero_9677.html" title="User talk:MegamanZero">Talk</a></sup> 16:22, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've got to agree with Izehar. Although it's infuriating when people blank their talk pages to hide evidence of wars, unless they blank the history, it's kind of their business. Now, if they are <i>in the process of arbitration</i> or <i>in the process being warning for vandalism,</i> then we will sometimes step in to lock the page. Generally, being a jerk isn't enough, as you can link to the diffs when presenting evidence. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:43, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's exactly the point - he <i>is</i> in the process of arbiration, and furthurmore, there are warnings and constant comments regarding his behavior on the page. Blanking his page is clear violation of these warnings and comments made from adminstrators, and it is considered vandalism to remove them. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanZero_5c06.html" title="User:MegamanZero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegamanZero_9677.html" title="User talk:MegamanZero">Talk</a></sup> 17:04, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you are annoyed and offended by someone blanking their talk page, your best course of action is probably to be less sensitive. If the talk page blanking is the sole issue, there is no issue. Now if he's also ignoring the warnings and messages and continuing with bad behavior, that's actionable, but that's actionable whether he blanks his talk page or not. Either way, this isn't actually a real issue. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:31, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Phil on this one. While most people archive their talk pages, it isn't required, and I can think of at least one prominent admin (RickK) who pointedly did not do so.

I was considering coming back here, but such a ban is abhorrent. What was it for? For daring to support users who were abused? Or what?

<p>I do not know the particulars of Internodeuser's situation or activities, and (my feelings about arbcom aside) do not doubt the veracity of their evidence, but I know for certain that I had encountered Zordrac before Zordrac was Zordrac. I had AfD'd some chat room articles he'd written anonymously, and further interaction with him led to the creation of his account (unfortunately, I guess, now). My early (and rather frustrating) interactions with him did not give the air of one who knew the system, and his earlier contributions as Zordrac were not in conspiracy theory areas, but in areas regarding his chat room articles. --Jeffrey O.

<dd>As far as IP information goes, they were using the same ISP in the same city. That on its own wouldn't be nearly enough, but there was also a great deal of very convincing circumstantial evidence quite conclusively tying the two together. I'm afraid you'll have to take my word (or that of any other present or past arbitrators who drop by) on it, as I don't think it's going to be disclosed, so as not to aid the next Internodeuser in better hiding their sockpuppets. I must admit that I was one of those taken in - I'd assumed Zordrac was a good-faith (if misguided and very irritating) user, and was quite surprised when I woke up this morning to find that he'd been found to be Internodeuser. In hindsight, however, and having seen the evidence, it certainly does explain a lot of things. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 05:43, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You say above that you have "seen the evidence" in this case. I realize that you may have been on the ArbCom during the Internodeuser days, but it was my understanding that you had left the ArbCom in June of last year. If you, as a non-arbiter and someone who does not have Checkuser priviledges, can see the evidence in this case, why can't others? I realize that privacy policy normally prevents it, but if Zordrac has waived that privacy, specifically allowing his IP information to be posted... <i>and</i> if other non-Checkuser editors such as yourself have seen this evidence, wouldn't it be better for everyone's peace of mind to simply reveal what evidence there is? I'm sure I'm missing something obvious here, and will look silly when it's explained.

<dd>The majority of Internode users registered edits were to articles on conspiracy theories about Australian murders, the users was not familiar with Wikipedia policy at all. Before banned though the user particiapted in a heap of random afds, the after being banned made a brief come back as an IP harassing the user that had taken them to arbitration and posting legal threats on Jimbos page.

<dd>Perhaps I have misunderstood. It's late here, excuse my sleepy eyes. Thanks for clearing that up&#160;:) I'm choosing not to get overly involved in this issue this time around, and quickly skimmed over the posts. One thing I'm not sure about however is, why the hell does Internodeuser care about Zordrac at all? Whilst I'm here, I might as well add my piece that most, if not all accusations aimed at myself on that forum are just more of the same Internoderuser style bullshit he was banned for in the first place. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 15:10, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To have another voice here, I've just seen the evidence myself.

<dd>Hm, I was going to second Taxman but Mindspillage beat me to it. Arbcom members have stated that they have convincing evidence which is NOT limited to CheckUser.

<p>New information has been brought to my attention that leads me to have some doubt about the original conclusion made (not by me, by the way) that these two users are the same editor. However, Zordrac is, without a doubt, a vexatious user whose main purpose for editing is to disrupt Wikipedia (he has said as much in several places), so a complete unblock is inappropriate. Therefore, I've shortened the block to three days. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 18:12, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If I can say something: I fully trust the ArbCom, and Kelly, that this decision was correct. The only reason I even brought up the lack of public evidence was because some people won't trust them.

In general I would suspect that users on the receiving end of death threats are probably less likely to reveal personally identifying information such as their CVs to users who make death threats.

<p>While I'm not sure that I agree with Snowspinner's methods, his point is correct: we don't listen enough to the experts, especially in deletion debates.

<dd>I do think there is a debate to be had here. We are dreadful at respecting expertise (see anti-elitism). I've given expert testimony on AfD - with reasons cited, and had it ignored by many 'voters' and the closing admin. It is very frustrating. (In that case I was calling for deletion not retention.) However, what qualifies as an expert? Experts can have very strong POV biases. There might, however, be some benefit in contructing a list of wikipedians who can verify their subject expertise, and instruct WP:DRV to take them very seriously. But we can't give someone a blank cheque, just because they have pubished a book in a closely related area. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 23:46, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree, an AfD with delete consensus is no bar to a <b>different</b> article on the same topic. AfD is for deterining the deletion of an article as it stands. It should and does consider the potential as well as the current status, but it doesn't and really can't consider any possible articel on a topic, because it can't consider evidence not available in articles not yet written. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:39, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hm. Do I think that one good, intelligent argument should overrule fifty people who don't have any idea what they're talking about? Yes. But I don't think that simply claiming you are an expert and it should stay/go on your say-so is sufficient. We can't work that way unless we really want to verify everyone's credentials. I think that any genuine expert should have the knowledge and the tools to make that convincing argument, though.</p>
<p>And furthermore: anyone who dismisses a <i>good</i> argument from an anon or new user simply because it comes from a newbie to WP should be <a href="../../../l/a/r/LART_c186.html" title="LART">LARTed</a> within an inch of his life. But merely taking someone's say-so is not workable: you can't challenge or verify someone's say-so. I'd assume any expert who would argue for the deletion or retention of an article would have some sort of reason to cite for doing so, and it's probably a reason good enough to stake their professional reputation on if they're going to claim expertise. So I don't think it's unreasonable to require it be shared. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 00:16, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By instituting a system where so-called "expert" opinions override the consensus of interested parties, there is a risk of the formation of (as much as I hate the use of the term), a <b>Cabal of Experts</b>, who would detirmine the direction of information that is to be included in the Wikipedia. This seems on the surface to be antithetical to the purpose of the concensus building aspects of WP. Do we defer to these experts prima facie? On their word that they are who they say they are? That their credentials are what they claim them to be? Your word is as good as my word (unless you are a vandal or obvious nut-job POV pusher, that disregards any notion of concensus or NPOV).

<li>A policy of paying more attention to experts might have sem merit. But experts can and often do have hobbyhorses, cortoversial veiws, and biases within their fields.

<li>Read what Phil said - he didn't say "self-proclaimed expert", he said "verifiable expert". So yeah, if someone is able to prove that they have academic publications in Field X, and they are trying to say that, in Field X, subject Y is notable, why <i>wouldn't</i> you defer on an AFD?

<li>I have known several of the generally acknowledged 'experts' in the field of study relating to J.R.R. Tolkien's stories of Middle-earth for many years now (there are even some people who seem to think <i>I'm</i> an 'expert')... and I can tell you that they <b>often</b> completely disagree about what is/is not 'true', 'obvious', or 'likely'. So no, just because someone is verifiably an 'expert' in a field doesn't mean that they should automatically be considered 'accurate'. Verifiability not truth. If references can be supplied proving their position then it ought to be accepted. Otherwise it should carry no more weight than any other. Experts <i>ought</i> to be able to easily come up with verification... they're 'experts' after all. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 01:11, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>And how, exactly, do you propose that they come up with verification that an article adheres to a non-existant definition of notability? In five days time, or else the article is deleted and the earth is salted, such that they have to deal with the wonders that are DRV. This isn't about article content or about their perspective on what is true - it's about whether or not something is, in fact, a major issue in a field.

<li>One of the main problem with experts (and, indeed, enthusiastic amateurs) is that <i>they write whole series of articles without citing sources</i>. The irony is that articles that cite reliable sources are rarely even <i>nominated</i> for deletion, let alone deleted. If the sources indicate that a subject has already been covered in several published books, for example, arguments that it is non-notable are (metaphorically) laughed out of AFD by many editors. Experts who write articles without any cited sources and then gripe when their articles come to AFD really have themselves to blame to a large extent. It's for this reason that I encourage any experts, especially ones new to Wikipedia, to get into the habit of always citing sources <i>right from the start</i>. Experts who repeatedly come up against AFD and who nonetheless persist in not citing sources have not learned. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:26, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have a fair amount of sympathy with that. I have a PhD and a publication in my field, but I have almost given up editing in it. I was being reverted by ignorant 12 year olds – and I thought ‘who needs this?’ I testified that an article was OR on a subject that simply didn’t exist – but the article was kept because of ‘looks interesting to me’ votes. Who needs this either? However, if experts are not going to edit their own field, then wikipedia is the looser. Folk say, experts can win their case by citing and arguing – but how many of the voters in a contentious Afd are actually willing to read more than half a paragraph of testimony on a complex subject? I think there is an argument for saying ‘assume an expert knows what he is talking about’ – but, of course, that assumption must be able to be contested (not least by other experts).--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 00:49, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>There's a difference between deferring to known experts on a case-by-case basis in AfD discussions, and advertising on one's user page that claim of expertise is the ticket to automatic undeletion of anything. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 00:52, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The reason the statement in question is ignorant is that if an expert can't come up with verifiable and reputable references, then she or he isn't very much of an expert. I share Zoe's concerns. While we can all agree that AfD may occasionally reach the "wrong" decision, it has the virtue of being both (a) examinable by the public and (b) undoable, either through deletion review or by a new article being written at a later time. Promoting "editing by wheel war" is exactly what we <i>don't</i> need more of. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 01:02, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Verifiability and cite sources are policies about article content. They work as policies because Wikipedia is not on a deadline, and because we take an eventualist attitude. We can live with an article that's missing something important for a bit, because we're a work in progress. The content will be added and added correctly eventually. Deletion is not like that - there is a five day window to gather a minimum of 33% opposition to something, or else it is deleted, and a complete pain in the ass to undelete. Simply put, if a verifiable subject expert can show me that a mistake was made, there is no reason to drive through a tedious process just so we can say that third base was touched - particularly when so many people are willing to consider a 2/3 consensus on AfD to be a binding commitment to salt the earth so that an article can never be recreated. Why? Because subject experts who want to contribute in their field SHOULD NOT BE OBLIGED to submit to an exhaustive process of citing sources to the satisfaction of a bunch of just to be allowed to have an article to edit.</li>

<dd>Saying a flat 'I will speedy keep on the say-so of the following individuals' seems to be a bit iffy. It's not fair to presume that no other subject matter experts have (or will) participate in the deletion discussion, and I suspect that some of them might find it rather insulting to be told that their expertise is less valuable because they didn't make Phil's list. Further, experts have individual slants and biases–pet theories, pet peeves–and I would hesitate to give free reign to the individual biases of a single individual, expert or otherwise.</dd>
<dd>If you want to lend extra weight to a personally-selected pool of experts, tell them that you trust their judgement on certain topics, and ask them to notify you of deletion debates in which you might be interested. (If necessary, help them to create a shortcut link to the 'create new section' on your talk page.) Two keep votes–combined with the expert's reasoned testimony and Phil's endorsement of the expert's credentials–are sufficient to push many an AfD into 'no consensus' territory. The presentation of clear reasoning may also persuade others to vote in kind, or at least to consider the point in question.</dd>

<dd>This will shock some people, but I agree that the deletion system is broken. But the fact that the deletion system is broken is a symptom of the greater fact that the article cleanup system is broken. Far too many new borderline articles are created that... well, maybe they shouldn't be deleted, but they darn well shouldn't be sitting around on Wikipedia for another six months with a cleanup tag until someone HOPEFULLY gets around to fixing it... or until someone just takes the cleanup tag off and the article disappears into the morass of the nearly 1 million articles we have on Wikipedia. If we had a cleanup system that worked, or was properly staffed... heck, if people took 5 percent of the time to do article cleanup as they spent voting <b>keep</b> or <b>delete</b>, a lot of this would go away. I'm as guilty as anyone, and have been making an effort to at least dig into the Cleanup. There's like 14,000 articles piled up with a Cleanup tag! Until Cleanup is fixed, Deletion will continue to be broken.</dd>

<dd>I understand David and Phil's frustration, I really do, but the problem with such blanket statements of undeletion is on a practical level: It's an invitation to wheel warring on an unprecedented scale. I, too, believe that expert opinions should be given weight, but that weight should be given in a coherent statement. As in, if an expert editor presents a strong argument for keeping an article and the only reasons for deletion from a squillion "votes" are "This sucks," then, because AFD is not a vote, the expert opinion should clearly be upheld by the admin who closes the "Argument for Deletion." However, closing the debate early on a simple "I say so" basis is just not productive. Even clearly crap articles are not generally speedily deleted once put on AfD unless a clear consensus develops to speedily delete. On a larger scale, we need, all of us as a community, to develop a new system for deletion because AFD is clearly not scaling to a Top 20 Web site. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 03:03, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a question here: Did Snowspinner copy my idea? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_experts_f55a.html" title="User:Zordrac/experts">User:Zordrac/experts</a>. If so, well done! Although I don't recall wording it quite like this. 203.122.230.206 07:14, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A lot of sensible comments here. I want to lift out a part of Snowspinner's posting above: <i>Why? Because subject experts who want to contribute in their field SHOULD NOT BE OBLIGED to submit to an exhaustive process of citing sources to the satisfaction of a bunch of just to be allowed to have an article to edit.</i> Now, I <b>couldn't disagree stronger</b> with this. An expert, of all editors in a given field, <i>should</i> cite his sources from the beginning, because (1) he knows what the best sources are for that subject —important knowledge that many of our enthusiastic amateurs sorely miss—, and (2) having academic expertise, he knows how to cite sources. As for eventualism, we are only going to reach our goal if we learn our editors to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">do</a> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">it</a> <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">right</a> from the beginning. It makes no sense at all to 'relieve' the experts of this task, especially not because they are (or should be) used to citing sources. And, just like it was noted above already, citing sources is usually a pretty secure way of keeping an article, thus removing the need to subvert the consensus-making at AfD. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 09:55, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There seem to be two valid points in conflict here. One is that administrators should not simply go about <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignoring rules or process</a> willy-nilly. The other is that our <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">deletion process</a> has serious problems, and that good articles shouldn't be deleted out of ignorance. Add to that a third point - <i><a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">When in doubt, don't delete</a></i> - which has long been a Wikipedia principle - and I think that the answer is clear. Frankly, I think the community should abolish <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> entirely, as it violates "<i>When in doubt, don't delete</i>", and replace it with an explicit rule that an administrator may reinstate deleted articles at his or her discretion. If someone can't find a <i>single</i> admin to undo a deletion, then it's a safe bet to say that the deletion was proper. Anyone can create an article on any topic, so I don't see why undeleting one should be so much harder. If we don't trust an administrator to do that, then maybe we <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFDA_5218.html" title="WP:RFDA">shouldn't trust him/her with admin powers</a> at all. Does <i>anyone</i> think that <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> is really beneficial to the encyclopedia?

<dd>Ah yes the give more powers to admins solution. It fails because a) It makes adminship a big deal b)it means that admins are being encouraged to make subjective judgements and c)breaks the fairly fundimental priciple that anything an admin can do off his/her own back can be undone by another admins (although some people don't think this applies to speedies they are wrong).<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 03:37, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But here's the corollary to your statement, crotalus horridus: As the number of admins continues to grow rapidly, the probability that someone who hunts long enough can find one admin willing to undelete whatever it is they want undeleted approaches one. Every deletion decision ever made will rapidly devolve into <a href="../../../w/h/e/WP%7EWHEEL_fbcc.html" title="WP:WHEEL">wheel warring</a>, blocks and ArbCom cases for all. Furthermore, if any admin can undelete anything, can any admin delete anything? If not, why not? You trust admins to undelete, why not trust them to delete? <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 03:45, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No. I am not proposing that administrators should have greater powers to delete articles. I'm arguing they should have greater powers to <i>undelete</i> them. Someone who wanted an article re-deleted would then have to take it back through the deletion process. Therefore, unless someone acted out of process, there would be no wheel warring as a result. This is more in keeping with the spirit of <i>when in doubt, don't delete</i>. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 03:53, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is in keeping with the spirit of <i>"when an article you liked was deleted, bureaucratise the process so much that, once someone's favourite article is deleted, it can be quickly restored and then never deleted again without consuming lots of repetitive time"</i>. More serisouly, it has almost nothing to do with if in doubt, yadda yadda. It is the reverse "when in doubt, undelete", or in its likely usage, "when in disagreement, undelete". -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 04:00, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>So what you're saying, then, is that if someone didn't like the fact that an article he created was deleted, he could get a sympathetic admin to endlessly recreate the article based on "when in disagreement, undelete" and that each and every single time it was undeleted, that article would have to go through another AfD process? I would suggest that your proposal borders on the patently absurd. One could *never* delete such articles, then, as they would simply go through an infinite number of AfD votes. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 04:11, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd encourage those disparaging WP:DRV to take an active and constructive role in discussions there, where sensible and measured outcomes usually result. If there are specic articles that it is believed DRV has, um, "dropped the ball" on, than those examples would be helpful to this discussion. I also note that many of the regular participants at DRV are not in fact admins. With perhaps the exception of the recent rash of OOP userbox deletions, DRV gives <i>more</i> power to non-admins by providing an open forum for discussion... exactly the opposite of the intent of these templates and cats: making sure "slack jaws" can't screw things up. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 03:51, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is that enough proof that the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Arthur_Massacre_38e0.html" title="Port Arthur Massacre">Port Arthur Massacre</a> article is ridiculous? Or not enough for you? I've been saying that story for years. But now, all that you can do is push hatred and abuse me over it. No, Wikipedia is not the place to talk about such things. It's not the place to get death threats by people who have nothing better to do with their time than to abuse innocent victims. It's not the place to lie about what really happened, or to push everything as a conspiracy theory. And I regret writing that thing. And I didn't come on here for 6 months you know, that's a long time. And the irony is that you were "catching" all of these people who were not me, accusing me of coming back in June and July when it wasn't me, yet you couldn't figure out that it was me in November. Why? Because I was nice? I was always nice. And "Internodeuser" isn't a name I use very often. But Zordrac is. If I was trying to hide, I would have used a name that I don't usually use. And why not just confess to it? Its simple. Because I was doing a lot of good here. I was not here to troll or vandalise or anything like that. I never was. Not as "Internodeuser" and not as "Zordrac". I was here to help people out. I never attacked anyone, and I hated when I was forced to respond to attacks. Its just not nice. But what choice do you have? If you fail to respond, then they just abuse you, and then later on go around saying that it was all your fault.</p>
<p>I didn't come here again to troll. I came here to edit <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Falconio_995b.html" title="Peter Falconio">Peter Falconio</a>. It was just a joke to start with, but I started to enjoy it.</p>
<p>And I am glad that I came for a while, because it showed me all of the nice people here. Okay, so I saw a lot of bad ones when I first used it, as "Internodeuser", and I saw a few bad ones here again this second time as well. But I saw real people. And a lot of good people. And I think that the "real me" finally shone through.</p>
<p>That was what I wanted all along. All that I ever wanted was for people to be honest about me. Not to lie, not to smear my name, but to be honest.</p>
<p>If you want to, you can keep looking through google about me, I don't mind. You'll see that I have basically done nothing but talk about the Port Arthur Massacre and Robert Edwards since 1995. At least 50% of the time, I get around to that. Its because of what a difference it made to my life. Its what I talk about with my friends.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can say oh no I'm some nutcase, but I'm not. I am a normal human being who had something forced upon them and I had no choice, no control over it at all. I didn't choose to have some nutcase come after me, dressing himself up as Rambo and telling me about his whole plan. That wasn't my idea. And I didn't want to hear his whole story.</p>
<p>I just felt obligated to tell people, to warn them. But it didn't work. So for those of you who are saying that I am responsible for the Port Arthur Massacre, you are right. I could have stopped it. But I was a coward. I didn't push hard enough to stop it. Oh sure, I pushed a bit. Sure, I wrote up web pages and sent out fliers to people not to go there, but I didn't do enough. I should have gone on TV over it.</p>
<p>And I should have simply paid the money to go in there that day. I basically knew that was where it was going to start. Okay, so I didn't know 100%, but it was pretty likely.</p>
<p>But you know, I was worried that he might shoot me. I was worried that he might kill me if I went in. And you know what my biggest worry was? I was worried that I'd go in there and catch him and then be arrested over it. I was scared that people would think that I was just attacking a poor innocent person.</p>
<p>All of these years, it has hurt me. I have nightmares over it. Sometimes my very life is a nightmare because of it. I tell people about it and they hate me for it. They ridicule me. They abuse me. They send me death threats. Because they think that I am forcing them to live through it all.</p>
<p>And the guy is dead now. How amusing. He died in a murder/suicide in 2003. So any fears about him suing for libel are ridiculous. He was never going to anyway. If he did, then of course he'd be in huge trouble over it. Its not libel when its true.</p>
<p>And you can all say oh no I am this horrible person. So you can look through everything that's happened. You can look through what LJ Drama did to me over it. Go and look up on their site under "blissyu2" and see how much they abused me over the Port Arthur Massacre thing, how they threatened to kill me over it.</p>
<p>Go and see how badly behaved people can really be.</p>
<p>I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I didn't come here for that. I came here to write an article about an important, encyclopaedic topic, that is extremely noteworthy.</p>
<p>And hopefully one day someone will write that article in here, and it will stay. 203.122.230.206 05:29, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be fair, it is more complicated than that, but not by much. God knows I am partly to blame for getting so frustrated. But I do try to discuss the matter and actually try to re-edit the material in various ways. But essentially this is a defense by an editor of Nobs01's one-side rendition of history in which my text cited to reputable published scholars is simply deleted because it is dubbed off-topic, or a minority viewpoint, or commie propaganda. I do not dispute that I am citing a a minority viewpoint, but I am arguing that some skeptical material from reputable published sources deserves inclusion. Here are some typical comments from <a href="../../../s/i/g/Significance_of_Venona_89f5.html" title="Significance of Venona">Significance of Venona</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Magdoff_and_espionage_5862.html" title="Harry Magdoff and espionage">Harry Magdoff and espionage</a> (and I forgot to mention <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Americans_in_the_Venona_papers_2a2c.html" title="List of Americans in the Venona papers">List of Americans in the Venona papers</a>):</dd>

<dd>So this is basically a POV warrior defending Nobs01's edits. Nobs01 was banned for amazing personal attacks, not the edit war, but my experience during the mediation led me to believe that Nobs01 was not able to get beyond his own highly POV view of reality to allow any critical disagreement or complication of the issues. That's where we are again. Same outcome on the text pages. I dread the thought of going back into mediation over the same pages, but...what else is there?--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 04:18, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I mean absolutely no insult, but I would be inclined to believe, having also edited these articles that your accusations of others having a POV or that THEY are the only ones who are POV warriors, is a big stretch. I think there is a strong polarization there of politics and there was also evidence of suspicious information removal on associated articles that I commented on in the talk pages here:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Americans_in_the_Venona_papers#This_page_originated_as_an_attempt_to_falsely_call_everyone_.22Soviet_spies.22" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Americans_in_the_Venona_papers#This_page_originated_as_an_attempt_to_falsely_call_everyone_.22Soviet_spies.22" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>.

<dd>I am not in any way involved in "suspicious information removal." In a number of instances I have actually edited out of these articles text that I support in an effort to find a compromise. I have tried different wordings. I have added text that supports the other side of the dispute in an attempt to find NPOV. The editor who defends Nobs01's text simply reverts what I write. I do not for a moment claim that I do not have a POV on this dispute, but I really think it is unfair for anyone to imply that I am involved in "suspicious information removal," or that I only am reverting. Both of these claims are false. On all of these pages the overwhelming bulk of text reflects one specific POV. Attempts to edit the relatively small skeptical and critical sections get reverted.</dd>

<dd>Please recall that I spent over one month in a mediation process over these same pages which went in circles and revealed, at least to me, that Nobs01 was probably incapable of constructive collective editing. Despite this, I continued to engage in the mediation, until Nobs01 began an aggressive campaign of personal attacks that resulted in me filing an arbitration that resulted in his being banned for one year. (And there is evidence that Nobs01 briefly reappeared under a different name to edit some of these pages until being booted off).</dd>

<dd>Nobs01 introduced biased and sometimes factually flawed and exaggerated claims on scores of pages. His posting of claims that hundreds of Americans had been identified as "Soviet spies" by the "U.S. Government" was a fantastic hyberbolic exaggeration. Am I going to be cyberstalked across the project by a POV warrior who has pledged to defend Nob01's text--factual or not--fair or not--if I try to edit it to be accurate and NPOV? Do you want an encyclopedia where the majority view gets to stomp on the minority view; and where exaggerated and false claims get defended based on political POV backed by bullying? Or do you want a real encyclopedia that fairly explores disputes cited to reputable published sources? If I ask for mediation again, are admins going to take this issue seriously? Because after three months, including a month-long mediation, and a month-long arbitration, the text on these pages is still POV and exaggerated and sometimes not accurate--and being defended against edits. --<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 15:15, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mr. Berlet, I am not accusing you, (although it may have seemed that way), of removing the information in the articles that can be linked through those one day accounts. It just seemed spurious that Nobs had hardly been banned for a month when all these related articles that he worked on all go through an erasure of virtually every edit he did. I can't say who is biased, who is wrong or who is right with the evidence. I can offer you the opportunity to do a number of things. Your best bet is a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">Request for comment</a>. When I stumbled onto the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Americans_in_the_Venona_papers_2a2c.html" title="List of Americans in the Venona papers">List of Americans in the Venona papers</a> and saw that almost the entire article had been erased <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Americans_in_the_Venona_papers&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32813961" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Americans_in_the_Venona_papers&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32813961" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, so seeing it as vandalism, I reverted that back and returned the page to the earlier state. The other option is to document your findings and once again, draw up an Rfc and if that fails, arbitration. I recognize that you already went through that and obviously feel very exasperated by this new influx of disagreement. But you are editing articles that do have very polarizing viewpoints, and the cases supporting and or denying that these people are spies can be be expected to also have some bias in them either way. Surely you can see this to be true. I did see that you do not just revert and that you do make an effort to adapt or NPOV certain passages that I am sure you have a strong enough disagreement with that your normal human inclination would be to revert, so I applaud that. You may also want to seek out assistance through the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_d8b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates">Advocates</a> who will possibly be able to help you if you do go through mediation.

<dd>As I have stated time and time again, until I am blue in the face, that the material you insist on putting in the article, is simply not relevant and in some cases does not accurately reflect the opinion of the source you have cited. On the Magdoff article, you continue to use a reference who has not specifically spoken about the subject at hand. You justify the inclusion of the material on the basis of it “balancing” the article, but that really does not mean anything, if it is not relevant than it is not appropriate to include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Harry_Magdoff_and_espionage#Misrepresentation_of_Schrecker" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Harry_Magdoff_and_espionage#Misrepresentation_of_Schrecker" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. In another article you have used the same source, comments from Schrecker from 1998, to argue a different point, when as I have illustrated, the source no longer agrees with her 1998 statements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Significance_of_Venona#Misrepresentation_of_Schrecker" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Significance_of_Venona#Misrepresentation_of_Schrecker" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>.

<p>For: Any and all administrators who care to comment</p>
<p>On one of the talk pages, Editor A tracked the IP address of Editor B and sent emails to Editor B's employer to report he was posting from a work p.c. and posted his full name (which he had no disclosed previously...he used a pen name as his signature).</p>
<p>Editor A then posted on the talk page the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"On the contrary, the vandalism is being propagated by the "sliver" breeders, mostly "&lt;removed&gt;" aka &lt;removed&gt; and posting from his WORK computer!!! Dave LastName (&lt;removed&gt;) is the manager at &lt;CompanyName&gt;, and his superiors are being informed about his Vandalism! I highly doubt that he is going to consider this very funny after his system is inspected".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Could you please comment on this. Is this a serious violation? What ramifications (re: Editor A's continued participation in Wiki) would you suggest would be appropriate for actions such as these?

<dd>How would Editor A know the real name of Editor B? I assume you mean Editor B is an unregistered account, in which case, Editor B would not be operating under a pen name but an IP address.
