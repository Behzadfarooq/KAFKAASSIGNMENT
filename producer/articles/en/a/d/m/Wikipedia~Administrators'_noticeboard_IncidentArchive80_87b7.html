<p>The IPs in this list can all be found at one or another of the IP ranges traced by this query to LACNIC: &lt;<a href="http://lacnic.net/cgi-bin/lacnic/whois?lg=SP&amp;query=AR-MIDA2-LACNIC" class="external free" title="http://lacnic.net/cgi-bin/lacnic/whois?lg=SP&amp;query=AR-MIDA2-LACNIC" rel="nofollow">http://lacnic.net/cgi-bin/lacnic/whois?lg=SP&amp;query=AR-MIDA2-LACNIC</a>&gt;. It is practically impossible to deal with vandalism from them with the usual methods, and the editor knows it.</p>

<p>I am a bit concerned over the recent contributions by TheDoctor10. He's been trolling around a lot recently, making personal attacks, personal threats, threats for disruption and general harrassment. Some example of this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>After a dispute with <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s">ed g2s</a>, he decided to change his signature to the following:</li>

<dd>Firstly, this doesn't belong here-it's a content dispute. Secondly, it seems to me that you espressed your disagreement with El C's edits with accusations regarding his political beliefs, which is not only irrelevant, but an <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumption of bad faith</a>. My advice is to discuss the article (not the subject of the editors) on the talk page in a <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civil</a> manner.

<dd>I have not looked at the details of this user's contributions, but my inclination is that Wikipedians are here for the purposes of disseminating information in a neutral and balanced manner. If this editor has shown consistently over a long period that they have no intention of modulating their editing approach in a spirt of cooperation, and that they are not willing to be gracious regarding the factuality or impact of their edits, I see no problem in instituting a prolonged block. Perhaps a week may be too long though. Would 3-4 days suffice instead? I generally advocate for shorter blocks, as long blocks may tend to defer present problems into the future. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 04:44, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Forgot to say that I was one of the mathematicians involved in reverting WAREL, so for that reason I would not attempt a block myself.

<p>I need some assistance with clarifiation of the above RFC and the use of sources banned by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. The question is simple and I ask for a simple clarification. I need to know if message board and mailing list sources can be used as primary or secondary sources. The article listed above uses them extensively, in fact, 85% of the article content originates from LKML, an anonymous mailing list in a biography article and the materials are cited as both primary and secondary sources. Please advise.</p>
<p>Also, the site instructions were somewhat confusing. The Mediation page implies you must first address an RFC and also address the issue with AN\I before attemptin moderation. Waya sahoni 08:31, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There has also been much discussion of the underlying issue on the articles talk page, although even content from a week ago has for some reason been archived. The RFC itself is malformed, with both "positions" written by one author (no bias there then) and a list of individuals which appears to have nothing to do with the underlying issue, other than those being ones who have disagreed with the authors position and seems nothing but an attempt to discredit those editors. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 08:45, 9 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>NOTE: This "admin" is a plant from the SCOX message board here to enforce that article. He's also one of the principal editors of the content. He should refrain from getting involved -- at least as an admin. Waya sahoni 16:17, 9 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Isn't irony wonderful, to quote yourself a few lines down "Also, Wikipedia has a policy about users making allegations...", FWIW to date I haven't made any administrative actions regarding the article, though of course my actions are open to the same scrutiny as any other administrator --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 19:29, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The RfC is indeed bogus since both positions were authored by User:Waya sahoni. There's really nothing to "request." Further, I was involved in the voting beacuse User:Waya sahoni is a sockpuppet of an indefinitely blocked user, which is Mr. Merkey himself. So in effect, Mr. Merkey is editing his own biography (against wikipedia policy) and filing RfC requests on it when he doesn't get his way. It's truly a massive disruption to the entire process, which is why Mr. Merkey was blocked from wikipedia to begin with. --<a href="../../../b/w/d/User%7EBWD_3dd4.html" title="User:BWD">BWD</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/w/d/User_talk%7EBWD_01e2.html" title="User talk:BWD">talk</a>)</sup> 13:02, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also, Wikipedia has a policy about users making allegations and/or attempting to expose or reveal a users identity.

<li>This appears to be a vexatious RFC. It's not certified, the two positions are not exhaustive, and it's badly formatted.

Zero did not.</p>
<p>Zero is filing this request for ban to prevent participating in the dispute reolution process. He does so after I placed the mediation request on his talk page. I would like the opportunity to follow the dispute resolution process. Zero should be reminded that he also must follow Dispute reolution process (per same ArbCom decision) and he should be encouraged to accept mediation. Thank you.

<p>I am not disrupting this article, in fact it was zero who removed sourced content <b>until other editors have jumped in and explained to him that he can not do that</b>.

<p>The contingent of Persian/Iranian editors is strongly nationalist and extremely hostile to any editors who challenge Persian ethnic domination, speak for minority peoples, or challenge a corporatist, ultra-nationalist version of Iranian history that sees the "nation" and the "people" extending far back into prehistory. The current trend in history and archaeology is to challenge this sort of nationalism. See <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historiography_and_nationalism.html" title="Historiography and nationalism">Historiography and nationalism</a>. Challengers should insist that their version be allowed as an alternate view, rather than insisting that it is "the truth"; the nationalists should be willing to allow both versions in the article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 19:27, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have to say, I don`t like jumping on the band wagon, however, it does seem that user Aucaman think the article about [persian people] has anti-semetic words like <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a>, even after I gave him refrences that say it describes the ancestors of Iranians. And user <a href="../../../h/e/j/User%7EHeja_helweda_5867.html" title="User:Heja helweda">User:Heja helweda</a> does not simply write a section in the discussion page, he or she floods the discussion pages with multiple headings and copies and pastes his or her texts in many other discussion pages.

I very much agree with the claims against these three wikipedians. I have seen many of the editing they have done and they are mostly baseless and outrageous claims trying to say many people and Iranians are not the same people as Persians of the past. They edit these articles with out any refrences and most people have repeatedly told them to stop, but they keep on doing it agian.</p>

<dd>Well, since I was invited to this discussion, I basically have to say the following. Our minds work in surprising ways at the subconscious level. We're not even aware of it. Even at the risk of seeming too philosophical, I would request all the editors involved to take some time off and introspect a bit deeper on why do you want those changes made. In what way will it comfort your mind/ego? What if the reality were otherwise? Once you meditate on this, perhaps the whole thing won't look as important to you as it is looking now. Come back to the discussion from that unattached position, and I'm sure the entire issue will be resolved in no time. My personal take: As a person who identifies himself as <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a>, and living in a <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_caste_system.html" title="Indian caste system">social system</a> which kept intermixing impossible for millenia, I'll still be surprised to learn that no intermixing ever occured. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 02:51, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no question that some 'mixings' have happened, however this has happened everywhere in the world. It has not been especially significant enough to mention it in Iranian articles. This is because the arabisation of for example Egypt, have been truely significant, and the original berbers are only a small percentage of population these days, and they have totally lost their culture. On the other hand, in Iran this is not the case, Iranians are so proud of their culture that even over a thousand years of being of mainly muslim population, they still celebrate the pre-historic Zoroastrian festival of Norouz. This is why there is no need to mention 'guess work', 'estimates', or some obsecure studies about possible mixings and inter-marriages, because they will not be useful to the article. These, as you must agree after reviewing the current attacks, are part of a campaign to change Iranian's identity which they have kept for thousands of years. --Kash 10:58, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Kash and others</p>
<p>Some of these editors are extremely racist and anti Iranian. And whenever we try to correct them we are all called extremist nationalist and they are quick to generalize like Zora.</p>
<p>Some of their comments are extremely disturbing like the one who was trying to delete the world Persian by saying that no such race exist and the one who is trying to say that we are a combination of Semitic and Turkic and he wants to prove it to the world!! Obviously they are on a mission to erase the word “Persian” in any way they can. One of them wrote a paragraph basically implying that Persians are Arab by blood because there has been some interracial marriages after Arab invasion of Iran!!!! Totally refusing to mention that many other races, Greek, Turkish, Russian, …etc has also invaded Iran throughout the history. They are politically motivated and they are very biased.</p>

<p>I was asked to weigh in on this. For the record, I am a secular person of Jewish background. I don't think the word "Aryan" smacks of racism <b>when used in the narrow sense related to Persian ethnic heritage</b>. (When it is used to mean "Indo-European", that is another matter.) However, because of its tricky connotations in the Western world, mostly due to its use by the Nazis, the term should be glossed whenever it is used. That is to say, on first mention in an article there should always be at least a specific link and typically a clarifying statement explaining the sense in which the word is used. For the opposite extreme—Nazi use as a seal of approval completely detached from actual ethnic heritage—see <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honorary_Aryan_5462.html" title="Honorary Aryan">honorary Aryan</a>.</p>
<p>As for any suggestion that the Persians are Arabs, it is really hard to imagine something sillier. I don't even know where to begin on such a ridiculous statement. It's as if someone were to point at Romania's one-time Hohenzollern monarchs and at the Transylvanian Saxons and say that therefore Romanians are German. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 16:57, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's even sillier to claim that there exists a group of people that <i>doesn't</i> contain some admixture of genes. We have some Persian editors claiming that "we have no Arab blood, well, only a tiny little bit, not enough to count" -- which goes against common sense and current scientific knowledge. Claiming that were NO Indo-European speaking tribes isn't right, but claiming that all the people who speak an Indo-European language are descendents of IE tribes is dead wrong. Language goes by nurture, not genetics. Both sides in the dispute would do well to do some reading in linguistics and physical anthropology. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 17:23, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
No one is pure Zora and don’t try to say that we claimed that because we did not. Would you like to question how “German” the German people are? After all they can not be 100% German can they? We carry blood of many different races and no one claims that we have NO outside blood. But some editors were questioning the legitimacy of the term Persian by saying that no such race exists!! That we were mixed to a such degree that we should no longer be called Persian!! If that is the case then there is no other race in the world either since on one has stayed pure. how about removing the name of each and every race in the world? These editors are biased and motivated based on personal issues. Britannic says Iranian people are descendants of Aryans and I am sure its writers knew that anyone with common sense would realized that it does not mean all Iranians today are Pure Aryans but that their original ancestors were Aryans. All we want to do is mention exactly what Britannica says.</p>

Moreover, I never would want to support anyone who is biased, and tries to force their personal beliefs on others. I am a student, and only stand on the side of facts. But after seeing quotes like this, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:West_Azarbaijan/Archive3" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:West_Azarbaijan/Archive3" rel="nofollow">this page</a> by user <a href="../../../d/i/y/User_talk%7EDiyako_a83d.html" title="User talk:Diyako">Talk</a>, who unfair personal attack actually says,&#160;: <b>"In fact I am discussing with a racist Qashqai turk pasdar terrorist pro ahmadinejad who even do not recognize UN emblem and think it is PDK's"</b> Diyako, 03:14, 28 December 2005 (UTC)”, and similar quotes from the two other users in question, I am almost convinced now, that these three users [may] have formed some sort of weird alliance or cabal, and do have their own personal politics involved in this. And, I have to tell you from experience, it is almost impossible to compromise with those who have a religious or political agenda. For the past year these three users, <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman">User:Aucaman</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/y/User%7EDiyako_2cfc.html" title="User:Diyako">User:Diyako</a>, and <a href="../../../h/e/j/User%7EHeja_helweda_5867.html" title="User:Heja helweda">User:Heja helweda</a> have systematically reverted articles, flooded discussion pages with repetitive rhetoric without providing authoritative sources, refused to compromise with others, personally attacked others, and put banners on almost every single article which includes, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_people.html" title="Iranian people">Iranian people</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html" title="Persian people">Persian people</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a>, the word <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya.html" title="Arya">Arya</a>, and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Iranian_e152.html" title="Indo-Iranian">Indo-Iranian</a>. I invite the admins to look up the word <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> for themselves, and not just take our word: apparently the use of this word in certain articles is these users` latest problem, even though evidence from encyclopedias was provided to them that shows the word describes an entire ethnic group and culture.

I also think it is necessary for the admins to read some of these articles, and discussion pages for themselves. It seems, there is no compromise with these three users; there [has] to be some sort of ban, so that those who sincerely try to write legitimate articles in an encyclopedia would not throw their hands down and in disgust, and leave Wikipedia because of a few problem users. I just do not know what else we can possibly do, it seems endless, mediation pages, third opinions, warnings; nothing seems to work.

<dd>I <b>strongly agree</b> with this request. These users have proven beyond any doubts, by their extremely anti-Iranian edits, personal accusations, and refusal to accept or even look at scholarly evidence, that they do not have noble intentions in editing pages on Wikipedia. They are simply a number of extremists who are using Wikipedia as a platform to spread falsehoods supporting their political ideologies. They have been treated by the outmost respect by the other editors. Unlike the exclusively-Kurdish, anti-Iranian, anti-Persian, at times even Anti-Azeri stance by these Kurdish editors, the Iranian editors dealing with them have always shown the most of respect for the Kurdish and other ethnic groups of Iranian peoples. The behavior of these anti-Iranian users is unacceptable and dangerous and must be dealt with accordingly. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShervink_07f6.html" title="User:Shervink">Shervink</a> 15:13, 5 March 2006 (UTC)shervink</dd>

<hr />
<p>Aucaman, Diyako, Heja, and also a user named Ahwaz have all been trying to insert minority viewpoints in Iran-related articles, only to be constantly reverted and attacked by a contingent of Persian editors insisting that they are disruptive, anti-Iranian, racist, etc. It would be a gross misuse of Wikipedia administrative process to use it to suppress minority voices. I'm not defending ALL the actions of the above users -- some of them have narrow viewpoints, sometimes they have little in the way of social scientific background, and they've gotten angry and used ill-tempered language themselves. Often, they seem to want to take over articles for their own viewpoints, rather than allowing all POVs to be displayed.</p>
<p>However, if Wikipedia is to be NPOV, it <i>must</i> allow Iranian ethnic minorities their say. If their arguments are specious, then that will be apparent when the arguments are displayed. However, the anti-minority editors want ALL mention of dissent squashed, which is wrong. I've gotten involved in the Khuzestan-related articles and I've been given the same treatment -- verbal abuse, removal of disputed tags, refusal to allow alterate viewpoints.</p>
<p>A whole swathe of articles is at issue, and it is going to some effort by non-Iranian, non-minority editors to enforce some even-handedness. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:30, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
On behalf of all editors who support this action, I would like to say, unfortunately we strongly disagree <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a>. With all due respect, you cannot use Wikipedia as a political platform, nor hide under the notion of a minority group, or as neutral users, when for the [past year and a half], you and the other three users try to insert some enormously controversial political issues, or some hypothesis that is not universally backed by [one] major source like a major encyclopedia, and then refuse to compromise on the issue that the over-whelming consensus agrees with. You four users simultaneously revert articles, put numerous banners on articles, and engage in edit wars, while flooding the discussion pages of these articles with an excessive amount of texts, sucking-in all the other editors, forcing them to defend their writings which are always backed with multiple references. After proving proof to you, you gives responses such as, “Dictionaries and encyclopedias are not reliable guides to contemporary academic standards. They are inevitably behind the times”<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-03-02_Persian_people&amp;diff=42602094&amp;oldid=42597339" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-03-02_Persian_people&amp;diff=42602094&amp;oldid=42597339" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>. The mediators from whom we asked for help, all attest to that. Moreover, that is unfair to label all the editors who edit in articles about <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a> or others, anti-Arabs, “Iranian-Editors”, or even “Iranian-Terrorists”, implying some sort of biasness. I have provided proof of such talk in the above sections already. You and the other three users start a dispute, forcing all the other editors that had agreed to a consensus to come and justify their edits, and provide you with their references, again and again and again. Also, just to be clear, not all of these editors are Iranian themselves, and some of us have keen interest and knowledge about ancient civilizations such as <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>, and <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. While your edits may be fine if you are writing a newspaper article, nevertheless, this is an encyclopedia, and that is not appropriate. You don’t have to be pro or anti anything; rather, only on the side of the facts. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a>, it seems that over 98 percent of [your] edits have to do with some sort of pro-Islamic, pro-Arab articles. And, unfortunately your edits, such as for example, trying to change the heritage of the beloved worldly renowned Sufi poet <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumi.html" title="Rumi">Rumi</a> from Persian to simply Muslim, even though many of these editors have provided you and others with numerous references such as encyclopedias that unanimously state that poet is Persian, reveals some sort of a hidden agenda. Or, better yet, to this date, without discussion, many, many times you erased and keep repetitively erasing an [entire section] in the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_conquest_of_Persia_936d.html" title="Islamic conquest of Persia">Islamic conquest of Persia</a> article<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_conquest_of_Persia&amp;diff=42029127&amp;oldid=41997599" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_conquest_of_Persia&amp;diff=42029127&amp;oldid=41997599" rel="nofollow">[66]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_conquest_of_Persia&amp;diff=42029127&amp;oldid=33519193" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_conquest_of_Persia&amp;diff=42029127&amp;oldid=33519193" rel="nofollow">[67]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_conquest_of_Persia&amp;diff=42029127&amp;oldid=33238790" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_conquest_of_Persia&amp;diff=42029127&amp;oldid=33238790" rel="nofollow">[68]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_conquest_of_Persia&amp;diff=42029127&amp;oldid=33238584" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_conquest_of_Persia&amp;diff=42029127&amp;oldid=33238584" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>, without even discussing it with [anyone], without providing one single source, and even though as a so called “neutral” user, you know well that in order to be fair, we must present both sides of an argument in an article. You then go to that article again, and change some simple words that afterwards make the article sound differently; it makes it into an almost one sided, pro-Islamic propaganda. Such subtle changes of a few words that have an impact on the language of an article are called “<a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a>” in Wikipedia. You inserted some info that the post-Islamic <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a> had been basically “Arabized”, and in so many words you stated, there no longer be a so called <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_culture.html" title="Persian culture">Persian culture</a>. Of course these are just two examples, however, there are records in the history pages of your talk page, as well as the talk pages of the three users in question that show you have repeatedly tried to ask each other for help, and called good intentioned editors (some with academic degrees in history), “Iranian Nationalists”, “terrorists”, etc. As the history of you talk page also shows Zora, you have tried to always back-up the other three users, and even asked these other three users in question to help-you-out on articles you feel that are not going your way. Although there is nothing wrong with users agreeing on a subject, however, in this case clearly the other users like Heja Helweda, and Aucaman did not have any knowledge of the content of some the articles you asked help for, and they simply rushed to your aid. That actually [is] pushing one’s POV, and trying to go against a consensus that was already established by some editors. You, along with these three editors have inserted sections like for example `Genetics Test on Kurds`, that is not backed by [one] major source such as an encyclopedia, into articles about <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranians.html" title="Iranians">Iranians</a>. Not only articles like that should not be put into an encyclopedia like Wikipedia, at least not yet, but also you had made 3/4 of that entire <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_people.html" title="Iranian people">Iranian people</a> article, flooded with some info about the Kurds, and that Genetics Test. When others tried to request that valid references be provided, and/or to kindly move that section to an article about the `Kurds` perhaps, you and these three users teamed-up again, and an edit war ensued on almost [all] articles that have anything to do with <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a>. Despite requests for a third opinion, which we did on many of these articles, despite setting-up a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediation.html" title="Mediation">Mediation</a> <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabal.html" title="Cabal">Cabal</a>, and despite providing numerous references to you Zora, user Aucaman, user Heja Hlwelda, and user Diyako, all of you four users refused to compromise, and instead started almost vandalizing other articles. Please know that, we sincerely believe that these three users and you Zora [are] using Wikipedia to push some political agendas, and are at best abusing your editing privileges. And, while we do not want to have the banning of any user on our conscious, we can now honestly say the only remedy for these misuses of editing privileges here is to block or ban these three users, and again, you as well Zora. Please be aware that users who try so hard to push a POV, cannot work with others, and perhaps may be blinded by their passions, and this regrettably is not an ideal environment to write an encyclopedia in. Users like you just end-up driving away editors who have something legitimate to contribute to these articles.<a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 07:22, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Zmmz's comments. I'd also like to point out that this is not about minorities or minorities' right or anything like that, as I am myself half-Kurdish and half-Azeri and none of the users filing this complaint are homogeneous by ethnicity, that's just Zora's assumption or accusation. We are not at all concerned about minority viewpoints in Iran-related articles, on the contrary we encourage such viewpoints because many of us <i>are</i> Iranian minorities or not even Iranian. Disrupting the Iran-related articles on wikipedia and using wikipedia as a platform to pursue a political agenda, is what we are against. If you take a look at those three individuals' "contributions", you can see a clear pattern of disrupting Wikipedia articles that are about Iran or Iranians. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManiF_8d90.html" title="User:ManiF">ManiF</a> 08:13, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

She continues to make personal attacks, while ignoring the behavior of others who are not Persian or Iranian - when an editor who see views as a minority makes unsourced claims or injects personal opinion into an article, she quickly looks the other way and remains silent. I myself am only half-Persian and yet she has attacked me constantly as a "Persian nationalist."

We just wanted to provide some diffs, in this case reverts and personal attacks by user Heja Helweda, since after apparently a stub in regards to `Turkish-Kurdistan` I believe was asked by some other users to be voted on for deletion, this user who seems to be a Kurdish political activist, now along with articles about <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a>, he or she is actively involved in the political articles about the country of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>.

<dd>There's nothing I hate more than a nazi, but I would see this as a contribution towards NPOV. Nazi contributors would feel less comfortable and we'll see more of their view, which though I don't mind on a personal level, it does have an effect in making many articles potentially less POV. It's also blatant censorship. Hell, I wouldn't mind knowing the person I'm dealing with is a nazi either, if I'm having a debate on a talk page.</dd>

<dd>It is not on censorship again, the issue when I deleted (but not protected) the userbox is that the template was created by a user, then he put it on TFD to get rid of it himself, which pretty much looked like POINT was being performed. So, that is why I performed the second deletion, Zoe did the first. While I welcome Cyde to the admin team, I just think that for the first few days, he should try not to use his admin powers on userboxes, since that is one of the major sticking points in his RFA. However, welcome to the team and as always, delegate when needed. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a> <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">Fair use policy</a></sup></small> 06:27, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You say "blatant censorship" like it's something we should be actively trying to avoid! To Hell with worries about "censorship" or no. We have no policies or norms to discourage censorship (and some, like the treatment of ArbCom-banned users) that actively encourage it. Admins need not constantly look over their shoulder for fear of some do-gooder crying out with the c-word. The typical response to "censorship!" is, and <i>should be</i>, "yes, and?".

<p>What did the box say? If it had said "This user is a Nazi" (i.e. someone claiming it about themselves), what's wrong with that?

<p>I'm okay with this deletion, the box is about as offensive as the pedophile and KKK boxes. Nazism is something which a vast majority of the population consider an outright <i>evil</i> ideology, something which goes beyond the disagreements one has with parties which one merely opposes. In comparison, the "This user is a communist" box is not as offensive, at least not to me, while I certainly don't endorse that ideology either (I'm a social liberal), being a member of communist parties is considered entirely legitimate in most European countries. In my view, being a Nazi means that one endorses racism, intolerance and genocide. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:06, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The actual text at the time of deletion was <span style="color:blue;"><i>"This user was a member of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party_8d44.html" title="National Socialist German Workers Party">National Socialist German Workers Party</a>, and thus is probably really old. <b>Respect your elders!</b>"</i></span> and it wasn't linked anywhere.</li>
<li>Although I can't seem to find the <i>actual</i> statement, there seems to have been some disavowal of all things box-like by Cyde that was crucial to his promotion and I'm deeply uncomfortable with that being tossed aside.</li>
<li>It had actually been to TfD and oddly enough <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_e2bf.html#Template:User_Nazi" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion">survived.</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>These facts make me say that actually, no this wasn't a proper action and no don't do it again. We're meant to be bold in editing, but the best policy with regards to administrative actions is to tread lightly. It would have been far <i>far</i> better simply to send this to TfD again.</dd>

<p>I'm sorry, what? I use AOL, I don't see how anybody is going to be able to show any sort of sockpuppetry even if it were true, which it isn't.

<p>Gateman1997 has sent me an email. Part of it is as follows:</p>
<p><i>The only argument I would state is that, "I'm not a sockpuppet of JohnnyBGood. I never have been. I've interacted with him on a few of the CA highway articles resisting SPUI's changes, but that's it.

<p>As it seems that no administrators are interested in taking action regarding this matter and doing the right thing, I am forced to take action myself. The blocking administrator, David Gerard, has not provided much evidence to the accusation that the users Gateman1997 and JohnnyBGood are sockpuppets. A CheckUser regarding this matter has given negative results, as implied above by David Gerard and deducted by another user whose comment is above as well. It has been difficult for the blocked users to contact him since his "Email this user" link is not enabled (another user had to notify me of the fact that his email is listed on his user page). When the blocked users contacted him via email, they did not receive a prompt response; in fact, they had to wait hours for a response. There is evidence at <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> to the fact that they are not sockpuppets. Also, these contributors were not properly notified of their block with the correct templates. However, the blocking admin subsequently made what can be deemed as "celebratory comments" to user SPUI <a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">User talk:SPUI</a>. Another one of these comments may be found at the top of this section as well.</p>
<p>Now, nearly forty-eight hours after these users were blocked, there has been no sufficient evidence presented to support these blocks. These users are blocked from contributing to Wikipedia and giving input to critical decisions involving nearly all of the hundreds of articles regarding the entire road system of the United States. <b>Therefore, if noone objects to this proposed action by myself by bringing concrete technical evidence to my attention or the attention of those who read this page, I will be unblocking Gateman1997 and JohnnyBGood within sixteen to eighteen hours of this post.</b> I believe that this proposed amount of time is sufficient for the blocking administrator and/or others to gather any evidence that may exist in regards to the supposed sockpuppetry of Gateman1997 and JohnnyBGood. Failure to rectify this unjustice will reflect poorly on Wikipedia and its administrators and will ostracize two extremely important, if not essential, highway contributors from Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>Zero, it is him, even Tony admitted that this user seems to act like Coolcat, I would never accuse someone if there is no enought evidences, Coolcat is lying, and an example is when he tries explaining how come other users use his codes, when Nafriz his other alias has used those codes before anyone in Turkish Wikipedia(an alias he is also denying), Coolcat when he registered in Febuary 2005 brought them with him. Coolcat is denying all of this but just wait and see the evidences I will be presenting and leave you judge by yourself if those are just vague claims. No one can trust Coolcat and it has been already shown how chronically he lies. Let see what he does when I start translating some of Nafriz contributions which clearly document that Nafriz is him. Beside, from someone who did not know Turkish at first, and then basic level 1 he now jumped to level two. Check and see recently how many new users have been registering defending Coolcat and Karabekir. Also, that this log-in was registered soon after the subject of Karabekir(the man) was brought by other logins (Enverpasha and Talaatpasha) is another evidences on how Coolcat this time has gone really far, he can accumulate all the evidences he wants about me, he is doing this to threaten me knowing how much he has to hide, I am not afraid, I have nothing to hide, I respect too much Wikipedia to do what this individual has done. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:59, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On a compromise, would be appropriate for you two to leave the other chap be for awhile and focus on other articles? This may involve becoming neutral in this situation and hopefully assuming good faith. As you're probably aware I have a very, very high opinion of my fellow editors here at wikipedia, and I think it constructive to pool your diverse editting skills on articles around the wiki. I'm trying to remedy this and I hope that we could drop the potential rfar and attempt some more dispute resolution. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaman_Zero_2b31.html" title="User:Megaman Zero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegaman_Zero_f80e.html" title="User talk:Megaman Zero">Talk</a></sup> 15:10, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColignatus_9a9a.html" title="User:Colignatus">User:Colignatus</a> has been making personal attacks and threats against me for reverting his POV, original research contributions in areas where he is personally involved, such as his proposed Borda fixed point voting method. I have asked him twice to stop making threats and warned him that he can be blocked indefinitely for doing so. Tonight, he has made another threat, so he should be blocked.</p>
<p>The threats are that he's going to find an academic superior of mine -- a professor or a dean -- and alert them to my "misconduct" on Wikipedia. Of course, I'm not particularly worried by this threat, but it's still a threat.</p>
<p>I've tried to de-escalate the conflict, by the way; but every time I concede something, he claims it as a victory and uses it as more ammunition for personal attacks. Oh well.</p>
<p>I'm an admin, but it would be inappropriate for me to be the one who blocks him. I'd like someone to block him after looking at his conduct on Talk:Borda fixed point. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">ɹəəds</span><span style="color: #63f;">ɹ</span></a> 04:55, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As soon as someone starts educating another user about the difference in their liability for either slander or libel, I start reaching for my "put user on first train out of here" button. But a return ticket for a week's time is fair enough. Note that Theodore7 has now used up the "last chance saloon" part of his remedy, and that admins are empowered to block him <i>indefinitely</i> for any further violations, without needing to refer to the ArbCom. He has also, in that cited diff, failed to provide an edit summary and used up the first of his 5 such edit summaries on the road to a year-long block for that alone. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:35, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have blocked Theodore7 (conservatively) for one week for making legal threats.

<p>Hi, I'm just writing to report vandalism that seems to occur quite a bit on featured articles. It seems the vandal seems to have fun changing his username every time he vandalizes the article. This usually happens for about 12 posts, then he stops. I'm not sure if the IP Address has been blocked yet or not, but it's something to consider. To see a history of his edits, just look at today's featured article.</p>
<p>Once again I am not sure if he/she has been blocked. If they have been, I am sorry to report it! Thanks again!</p>

<dd>You're currently in the middle of a disagreement with this editor (which of you, if either, is in the right, I have no idea) and so you're pulling up a month-old affront and trying to get him punished for it.

If it didn't piss you off enough a month ago to say something about it, and you continued to engage him in dialogue thereafter, well, basically, that's too bad.

<dd>Actually, two people did tell me not to do that at the time, including a friend of mine and I have not made any other such edits since and have no plans of continuing. Also, I have actually avoided conflict with this user for the most part since then, but I noticed this [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ARJII&amp;diff=43247104&amp;oldid=43156343" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ARJII&amp;diff=43247104&amp;oldid=43156343" rel="nofollow">[121]</a> edit today and brought it to borghunters attention since he/she had blocked RJII from editing the anarchism page recently (And I assumed this was the edit war refered to in the message). I suggested RJII be further blocked due to his/her willingness to continue engaging in the edit war that got him/her blocked in the first place. RJII claimed their girlfriend made the edit, so I am dropping this issue. I am just trying to show why it is RJII is now so intent to block me for something I did a month ago and have since shown regret for. Also, see the talkpages of myself, RJII and BorgHunter for more info. I would also like to mention that RJII has a long history of personal attacks and accussing others of harrasment him/herself (he/she accused me of harrasment months ago for trying to get him/her to apologize for and stop making impolite comments towards other editors and myself on the anarchism talkpage). My inappropriate edit was my one time lashing out in frustration at this user, and I have since committed to never do such things (and have stayed true to this, even though I really wanted to break it during the userbox debates). That is all I have to say about this for now. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 07:54, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think all users with more than X edits (say 1000) should be whitelisted. The only circumstances under which I'd think it shouldn't whitelist a user we genuinely believe not to be a vandal is when that's a specific sanction (a "thou shalt not mass-move") handed down by the Arbcom. I'd guess that if they knew that technical capacity existed, then that un-whitelisting is something they'd reasonably be expected to apply in a few cases. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 22:42, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Considering SPUI is involved in a movewar, and is doing Wik-esque things (listing pages to "fix" after 3RR resets, which is NOT the objective of 3RR), I would campaign against whitelisting him for anything, and I say this as a fan of SPUI. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 22:47, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've explained this to Curps - I go through tabs, paste the reason, go back through the tabs, double click California, hit end, paste " (California)", and hit enter. Please assume good faith. As for the naming conventions, I am simply moving them to fit the current disambiguation conventions, as the name of each route is "State Route X", not "California State Route X". This has nothing to do with the proposed naming conventions, as it is already part of the naming conventions. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a> - <small><a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_SFD_e111.html" title="User:SPUI/SFD">don't use sorted stub templates!</a></small>) 22:56, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

According to him, each one involves a Ctrl-Tab/double-click/Ctrl-V/Enter, all done manually and all four operations taking less than a second in total, and then repeated about seventy times or so non-stop, without any pauses.</dd>

<dd>The bot doesn't assume good faith or bad faith... it just reacts to a number of triggers.

He's destroying it. The charges he's making against me are false. You just accept what he says on face value? This is his tactic.

<p>I would like to hear opinions as to whether this dispute (which includes Neto and Locke, as well as myself to some degree) should be rolled into the current RfAr (which Neto requested), or instead should be its own RfAr. I suspect that many of the same issues will be brought up (behavior of parties involved), but at the core is a fundamentally different issue. Mediation has been attempted, and has failed. I ask not because I want to stir opinion (or yes, Neto, to poison the well), but because I am not familiar enough with the process. It seems to me, also, that it would be a real pain in the ass for all of us involved to be handling two such processes at once.

<p>Irpen continues deleting referenced material from the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodomor.html" title="Holodomor">Holodomor</a> article. Recent deletions:</p>

<p>There are facts, numbers, list of countries that acknowledged Holodomor. The article has been protected several times to avoid revert wars. There is a very long discussion on the talk page, which led to nothing. Referenced facts continue to be deleted by that user. I am out of ideas on how to convince Irpen to stop these deletions.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Alexander_6a64.html" title="User:Andrew Alexander">Andrew Alexander</a> 15:29, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I can see why that discussion went nowhere: it didn't get the result you wanted. Repeatedly re-inserting images with disputed copyright status is hardly constructive, is it? Neither is blanket reverting, losing other material in the process. Irpen seems to me to be acting entirely reasonably, and I note that Irpen's edit history is both broader in scope and apparently contains far fewer edit wars. Perhaps the problem is closer to home? I note that you just reverted again. Stop it. Engage in discussion on the Talk page and stop revert warring. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 16:24, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't insert any disputed copyright images in this article. All the images I inserted there are over 70 years old. I replied to your comment on the discussion page. Deleting referenced material isn't an answer, is it? Yes, I did revert these deletions. I will do this again unless you provide some sort of reason. Please go ahead and ban me for this. Here is my answer:</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, let's go sentence by sentence of what was erased. First you erased a commonly known term from the first paragraph. There is a long debate on this page by the people who refuse to accept it. However, the term passes the definition of a "common term" according to Wikipedia standards (please read WP:NC - "When choosing a name for a page ask yourself: What word would the average user of the Wikipedia put into the search engine?" Is this not neutral?). Second, you erased the sentence "The Holodomor was caused by the seizure of the 1932 crop by the Soviet authorities." It is referenced and seems neutral. Then you erased a referenced sentence "At the height of the famine, while confiscating crops from the starving peasants, the USSR exported 1.70 million tons of grain in 1932 and 1.84 million tons in 1933 (close to a quarter of a ton per each victim in each year).[22]" Again, I don't see anything not neutral here, please correct. Then you deleted "The Soviet authorities also banned travel out of the famine affected areas under the pretext that people travelling for food spread "anti-kolkhoz agitation"." Is this not neutral? If not, please explain why in detail. Then you erased two paragraphs: "The death toll of the famine is estimated at between five and ten million people[23]. The rationale behind the famine as well as the exact number of casualties is unknown because the pertinent archives of the NKVD (later KGB, and today FSB) remain closed to historians in general." and "Ukrainian émigré historians were among the first to argue that the famine was an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people. Today, the governments or parliaments of 26 countries recognized the 1932-1933 famine as an act of genocide. Among them Ukraine, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, United States, and Vatican City. The fourth Saturday of November is the official day of commemoration of the Holodomor victims in Ukraine. Still the Holodomor remains a politically charged topic for many parties, especially in Russia. Some Russian authors continue claiming that the Holodomor was not an act of genocide but a "mere famine".[24]" Both paragraphs are well supported by references. For instance, each country added to the list above was supported by a reference within edit comments. I can't find anything not neutral about this text. Again, my opinion could be subjective, so I need your explanation of why you deleted this material.--Andrew Alexander 02:48, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's hardly a personal attack, although I think somebody should have a word with him about <i>civility</i>. It's a link to a newspaper article which mentions you in the context of an article which you are (in my humble opinion) rather unwisely involved in editing.

<p>(For a taste, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Gang_stalking_4fef.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gang stalking">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gang stalking</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Electronic_Harassment_%28anti-personnel_sense%29_2f1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electronic Harassment (anti-personnel sense)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electronic Harassment (anti-personnel sense)</a>, and <a href="#_Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion.2FUser:Tai_Streets.2FGang_stalking" title=""># Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Tai Streets/Gang stalking</a>, plus <a href="../../../d/r/e/Talk%7EDream_Archive1_6815.html" title="Talk:Dream/Archive1">Talk:Dream/Archive1</a>, where "Wyatt" tried to argue for including his own <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> and numerous links to the website promoting his own vanity-press-published book.)</p>
<p>"Wyatt" is also an aggressive <a href="../../../s/e/o/SEO_d889.html" title="SEO">SEO</a> self-promoter, as a quick stroll through Google for hits for "Wyatt Ehrenfels" will show -- with countless posts on vast numbers of unrelated mailing lists. But Google is a double-edged sword: given Wikipedia's prominence, User:Wyatt Ehrenfels (with its prominent sockpuppet tag) is now the number 5 hit for "Wyatt Ehrenfels" and <a href="../../../d/r/e/Talk%7EDream_Archive1_6815.html" title="Talk:Dream/Archive1">Talk:Dream/Archive1</a> (with its collected evidence of "Wyatt"'s bogosity) number 25.

<p>So far, so what: myself and other editors have consistently reverted his whitewashing attempts and told him to contact the Wikipedia Foundation if he has a problem with this. Since the name is a pseudonym -- his pseudonym -- I'm failing to see the privacy concern, but that's up to the Wikipedia Foundation poobahs.</p>
<p>And speaking of privacy concerns and real names, we (finally) come to the issue that's the point of this post: "Wyatt" has taken to making edits and edit comments that include what he thinks is my real name and background (along with a couple of others he thinks are me -- apparently I'm a USENET poster calling himself "Imperial Leader", based on the fact that the day "Wyatt" made that post, my user page had a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Image%7EForbidden_City_Gate_of_Heaven_3.jpg_3aa9.html" title="Image:Forbidden City Gate of Heaven 3.jpg">picture of Mao</a> on it, who could be said to be an "Imperial Leader": <a href="../../../d/r/e/Talk%7EDream_Archive1_6815.html#Does_Calton_Post_to_Usenet_as_.22Imperial_Leader.22" title="Talk:Dream/Archive1">See his chain of logic for yourself</a>). I'm not threatened, just annoyed on general principle.</p>
<p>So, would some admin mind going through those edits and deleting them from the history? You'll find them at</p>
