<p>He continues to make a test page, removing the {{G2}} I place on his Pradschico page.

Tempted and amusing as that might be, I have strong feelings on blabbing to the media and those that do it, but does Wikipedia have a policy on this? I'm sure I am not the only obe to be singled out <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 07:14, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know whether Wikipedia has a policy already, but I don't see the harm in it and I think that openness can only benefit us. If there's media interest in the ArbCom elections, the best course of action is to be honest and forthcoming, and do what we can to ensure that the coverage is fair. Clamming up makes it more likely that it won't be. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 07:30, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've no idea why they chose me, cos I'm more horrible than you I expect! Is it real station then, I though it may be a hoax? Anyhow, I have enough experience of these things to know than a "nice happy story is no story" They want my "experience of Wikipedia" but I expect it will be all about Kelly Martin's arbcom result and behaviour etc, and the "Giano case" Neither of which are Wikipedia's finest moments. They are hardly going to want to discuss Palladian architecture are they? (Which is what I like talking about) No I shall leave it to others - interesting to see who though! Anyway they want me to phone them, and I'm certainly not spending megabucks on transatlantic phone calls. You lot would never understand my vowels anyway. I'll forward their email to Jimbo and he can tell them how marvellous the place is - especially the architecture section etc etc etc. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 08:51, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Giano, I say go for it, I'm sure they'll call you for the actual interview. And yes, tell them about the architecture and how the articles are getting written. If they try to focus on the drama, just tell them that Wikipedia's internals being more transparent than their company's doesn't mean that we have to discuss our dirty laundry with outside players any more than they do. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 16:20, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No, They would almost certainly want the drama, not the architecture. I shall not be commenting. Eeverything I do is above board and onwiki, that way others have their chance to comment legitimately and a right of redress. It is not my style to talk about others only when I know I am safe from reproach. If asked about certain subjects I would have a problem maintaining my usual kind disposition especially as the "IRCadmin" gang are now travelling on tour in a charabang hectoring voters at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Stewards/elections_2006-2#Lar_.28Larry_Pieniazek.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Stewards/elections_2006-2#Lar_.28Larry_Pieniazek.29" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<dd>I would consider this unsolicited and certainly not what people signing up to wikipedia might expect and it is therefore effectively <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spamming</a>.
<ul>
<li>The research methodology seems catastrophically flawed and any conclusions draw by the study will be dubious - the problem being subjects may partake in the study multiple times, or at least are being invided to do so - I've just ignored the 3rd opportunity to submit, see my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADavidruben&amp;diff=92037700&amp;oldid=91296447" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADavidruben&amp;diff=92037700&amp;oldid=91296447" rel="nofollow">4th December</a>, which was my second time I completed the study (I naively assumed that this would prove to be a different series of questions from that which I had been previously asked) and now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADavidruben&amp;diff=94340812&amp;oldid=94333354" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADavidruben&amp;diff=94340812&amp;oldid=94333354" rel="nofollow">14th December</a>. The mutiple posting to my talk page to contribute is surely sloppy methodology and the survey's front explanatory page states <i>"anonymously recorded"</i> so there can not be any data validation to prevent this problem.</li>
<li>Despite requests to Jeandré to become familiar <i>"with conventions before you add messages to even more users"</i>, postings are still added to user talk pages without section headers which is disruptive. We have of course a policy of <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">not biting newcomers</a>, as a requirement of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> for those who are here to work on the collaborative project, however this survey is not contributing to the project.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In summary I feel the systematic targeting of wikipedians is intrusive/spamming and not the purpose of user talk pages. If people really feel this is a useful study to further undertanding of wikis/wikipedia, then would not a single posting to say the <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLINMED_f8b0.html" title="WP:CLINMED">WP:CLINMED</a> project page be sufficient&#160;? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 02:45, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive67_d4b2.html" title="Edit section: Consensus on vandalism user subpages?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Consensus on vandalism user subpages?</span></h2>
<p>I am trying to build a consensus on vandalism user subpages. I do not think they are acceptable according to Wikipedia's policies, and should thus be done away with accordingly. But first, some background information.</p>
<p>For those of you not aware, a vandalism user subpage is a page created with the sole intent of being vandalized. Typically users will transclude these onto their user pages and leave some text along the lines of, "Vandalize this". To me, these are obviously a bad idea, as they encourage vandalism. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a vandalism warehouse, and I don't think it's an appropriate use of WMF's servers to be hosting places for vandalism.</p>
<p>One major problem with the vandalism subpages is that they create a bit more work for admins. By their very nature, they attract vandalism, and often a <i>bad kind</i> of vandalism. I've seen some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Fredil_Yupigo/VaNdAlIzM%21%3F&amp;diff=93284766&amp;oldid=89878526" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Fredil_Yupigo/VaNdAlIzM%21%3F&amp;diff=93284766&amp;oldid=89878526" rel="nofollow">pretty vicious personal attacks</a> in these subpages, which creates even more work for Wikipedians and admins, who have to patrol these abominations and remove all of the vandalism that is too bad to be displayed (like the aforementioned "He also masturbates while thinking about his mother."). It's a terrible misuse of admin resources to have to patrol pages that are vandalism magnets; it's much better simply to get rid of the magnets themselves.</p>
<p>Let's look at the kind of culture these subpages promote. They encourage the notion that vandalism is acceptable. Per <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>, this is a bad idea. They dilute Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission by saying "Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, but also a graffiti wall." Just look at the risk-to-benefit ratio on vandalism subpages; there's all negatives and no positives. Userspace was not created to give users total freedom to create anything they want on Wikipedia, and I do believe vandalism is beyond the pale. Also, they create the tricky issue of somehow trying to determine when someone has crossed a line; obviously if someone posts "You're a stupid cunt" on a userpage, they can be blocked for a personal attack, but if they post this on a vandalism subpage, they have some measure of defense by rationalization: "Ohh, but they wanted vandalism, I didn't really mean it." I can only see this leading to more problems and friction between users. Personal attacks should never be acceptable, and we shouldn't give the people making them any sort of excuse to try to make them.</p>
<p>If you go look over at <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, you'll see that global criterion for speedy deletion #3 is: "<b>Pure <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a></b>, including redirects created during cleanup of page move vandalism." Thusly, vandalism subpages fall under a criteria for <i>speedy deletion</i>, unless and until we come up with some inane policy that "Vandalism is never acceptable, unless the user wants it." Since I really don't see that happening, I will be deleting all of the vandalism subpages that I come across, and I would encourage all of my fellow admins to do the same. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 14:53, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've had the same position since I first saw one of these: they don't help the encyclopedia and as you point out can cause extra work and/or harm.

<li>So vandalism subpages don't harm anyone, but don't help the encyclopaedia and encourage trolls, therefore should go. Yet subpage galleries of all the pictures on Commons containing nudity don't harm anyone, but don't help the encyclopaedia and encourage trolls, but should stay. I don't get that. Bafflement at double standards aside, any and all "vandalism subpages" should go. Userspace subpages should either help the encyclopaedia, or be deleted.

<li>I think Cyde's policy will create more work for admins (now we have to check all userpages if they have a vandalism section??), and is completely unnecessary. Like most policing of userspace, it creates unnecessary drama in the name of "but this does not help building the encyclopedia" without actually helping to build the encyclopedia. Most of the "vandalize this section" sections I have seen on people's userpages were not used for real vandalism, but by usually vandal-fighting Wikipedians having some fun. Keeping Wikipedians happy builds the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 15:30, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please don't try to turn this on its head and suggest that I am calling for more work. It's clearly less work to simply remove these vandalism subpages than to have to continuously patrol them and clean up the nonsense they inevitably generate. I'm not suggesting that we patrol through every single userspace, looking for these things to delete; merely that we delete them as we run across them. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 15:46, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry, I misunderstood your intentions, and apologize for not thinking more before accusing you of policy creep. Userspace is not a free speech zone, and at the very least vandalism subpages whose owners don't clean up personal attack vandalism there should be deleted (now <i>I</i> am turning this into policy creep). I shouldn't have used Geogre's "good" vandalism section in a way that looks like I encourage "bad" vandalism pages like Fredil Yupigo's free-speech zone. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 11:45, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>(<i>posted after edit conflict</i>) I think these pages should be covered specifically by a mention among the speedy deletion criteria at <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> if they are not already. My feeling is that these are like the blank concrete walls of a highway underpass - taggers will fill any open space with graffiti and there are some who would argue "better there than on the building next door to my home"; the analogous argument here would be "better to provide an out-of-the-way place for scribblers to do their stuff than in article-space". However, I don't agree with that argument - these should be done away with, not necessarily only based on their falling under 'vandalism' but also because they are explicitly (when invitations to vandalize are involved) for social networking through shared contributions aimed at a goal other than improving the encyclopedia and therefore fall under part of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> ("Wikipedia is not a blog, webspace provider, or social networking site"). --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 15:39, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think some social networking "vandalism" can be good for the atmosphere, see the sonnet section of <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">User:Geogre</a>. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 15:41, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Certainly not all social networking involves vandalism and not all social networking is banned from Wikipedia; that networking that facilitates creation of the encyclopedia should be preserved and in moderation encouraged. Let's put it this way - any speedy deletion criterion needs to be applied using common sense and any page that is deleted under CSD can be taken up for undeletion - including 'valid networking exercises' where they can be considered for preservation in the Wikipedia environment. CSD is a broad, fast and crude instrument - which is why it shouldn't be applied letter-of-the-law style and notifications of CSD action need to be put on user talk pages so that remedies for recovery can be applied. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 15:49, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I am. And I would venture to say that the only "bad" thing that <a href="../../../1/2/p/User%7E12ptHelvetica_6de6.html" title="User:12ptHelvetica">12ptHelvetica</a> and I have done is to express opinions that differ from those of <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a>.

<li>Could you specify where that message was left. I don't see it on your talk page.

<li>Yes, of course. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BenBurch&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BenBurch&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BenBurch&amp;action=history</a> Please review the series of edits between 20:33 and 21:12 on 5 December. Ben and I were having a conversation. He knew that I was on his Talk page, editing. He knew that it was a two-way conversation and that I would see that remark immediately. He posted it and, seven minutes later after he was sure that I'd seen it, he deleted it; and at 21:12, he deleted the entire conversation. This isn't the only personal attack I've received; it's simply the most reprehensible. I must admit that in response to Ben's provocations, I have engaged in behavior that was less than amicable. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A.</a> is Ben's tireless defender, supporter and agent in all things Wiki, far more persistently than <a href="../../../1/2/p/User%7E12ptHelvetica_6de6.html" title="User:12ptHelvetica">12ptHelvetica</a> has supported me, and behaving in many respects like a meatpuppet himself -- though I won't make that accusation. The obvious distinction between the Ben/FAAFA relationship and the 12pt/Bryan relationship is that 12pt and I have extensive edit histories spanning 2-1/2 or three years, independent from each other; but they were done from unregistered IP addresses. A review of the archives from Ben's talk pages proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he has a very contentious history here. -- <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanFromPalatine_0d90.html" title="User:BryanFromPalatine">BryanFromPalatine</a> 15:09, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>You started that conversation civilly enough, and BenBurch was not polite in his replies, but you let yourself get dragged into an argument. Ben's comment was definitely out of line but he did remove it himself before anyone spoke to him. As that incident is now ten days old, and you made a point of quoting it in your reply to him after he had removed it from his edit, I'm not inclined to do anything about it now. I do think it would be best if Ben apologized for posting that comment, however briefly it was up, but I think this calls for dispute resolution, not admin intervention. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 16:27, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>That remark isn't the point of this request for admin intervention. What about the meatpuppet accusation? What happens with that? Is it just going to be an open-ended inquisition, with Ben and FAAFA declaring it "proven" the moment I refuse to tolerate their interrogation any further? I'd appreciate an admin stepping in and resolving that matter one way or the other. Bear in mind that the hostile exchange on Ben's talk page started on 5 December; the sockpuppet accusation was made on 10 December. -- <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanFromPalatine_0d90.html" title="User:BryanFromPalatine">BryanFromPalatine</a> 16:43, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd be more than happy to discuss the methods used to support the block, the evidence is square, solid, and the identity of the user as a sock puppet is not in doubt. I appreciate Abe's interest in the matter, and his concern for a fellow editor is both commendable and in the best spirit of Wikipedia. Because of the sensitivity of the issue and the history of the blocked user (Rootology), I invite any administrator who is interested to contact me off-wiki.

<dd>I can't call myself completely uninvolved, because I have commented in the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Seabhcan_919a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Seabhcan">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Seabhcan</a> arbitration case, although I have no experience of editing in the same articles as Seabhcan, MONGO, or XP. I will say, though, that I'm satisfied in this case. Sockpuppetry evidence is never made public, as it would teach people how to avoid detection. In public, I'll say that Rootology was known to be using sockpuppets, and that it was fairly obvious that XP was a sockpuppet of <i>somebody</i>. Regarding the specific evidence that linked the two accounts, let's imagine we had an abusive user who constantly made the same spelling mistake — one of which he was completely unaware — and who was known to use sockpupets. Abe, do you think that it would be a good idea for the administrators who knew about it to post here exactly what that spelling mistake was? Chairboy seems, as far as I can tell, to be completely uninvolved in this case. On his talk page, he has said that administrators who would like to know more may contact him. As one who has dealt with this kind of thing before (detecting sockpuppetry, circulating the evidence privately to other admins and to the ArbCom mailing list, and accepting that uninvolved administrators could carry out the block or not, according to their judgment), and as one who has seen some of the evidence in <i>this</i> case, I'd like to say that I'm completely satisfied. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 19:11, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Having seen the evidence I agree it is a very strong circumstantial case; about as good a match as you're going to get without finding a mistake like mis-signing a talk post. I will say in addition to the private evidence, it is worth noting in the XP's contribution history that he went out of his way to antagonize MONGO on several AfDs even though he had never edited the articles in question. Of course, XP can always appeal to Arbcom. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 00:41, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Currently theres a discussion occuring at <a href="../../../p/i/t/Image_talk%7EPitch_drop_experiment.jpg_9cd8.html" title="Image talk:Pitch drop experiment.jpg">Image talk:Pitch drop experiment.jpg</a> about whether this image can be used on wikipedia under permission with a fair use claim.</p>
<p>The reason behind saying it cant is that the image can be reasonably reproduced, in this case the experiement has been running for 79 years at the time of the photo 73 years had elapsed. The occurance as photographed happens once somewhere between 8 and 12 years based on previous occurances, next occurance will be between 2008 and 2012 from this experiement.</p>
<p>I'm not looking for comment on the image or its use. What I'm doing is using this example to question the current very narrow definition of "reasonably reproduced" that is resulting in editors running around tagging images without thought as to the practicalities of the reproduction.</p>
<p>I believe that there should be some requirement for the editor claiming it can be reproduce to actually demostrate or provide the reproduction. This is opposed to current situation that enables a person to make such a claim without any need to verify that claim. If editors dispute article text we require them to cite from reliable soures all facts yet we dont have the same requirement when applied to implementation of image copyright policies. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 01:43, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We don't get to choose what is or isn't fair use: courts do that. Our fair use policy reflects our current best estimation of what a court will consider fair use. And the burden of proof is always going to be on the uploader (because they're the person legally responsible) not one someone who questions that. You have to understand that Wikipedia already has the most liberal (indeed, foolhardy) idea of what a court will consider fair use. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 02:02, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the pitch drop experiment we have the specific permission from the author (who is the official keeper of the experiment) to use the image on Wikipedia. For some reason the author does not want to release the image under a free license. It is a typical case of the trade off between the quality of encyclopedia and the freeness of its content, the law has nothing related to it, this is simply the matter of our policies and preferences <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 03:07, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In this particular case, there is no legal issue because the copyright holder of the image has granted permission for us to use it. The only issue is one of Wikipedia policy.

Fair use differs from nation to nation and in America is far more liberal than what we allow at wikipedia. Do not treat Wikipedia fair use policy as refecting the law as it does not. Most important, understand most wikipedia talk about fair use is about images while most fair use law concerns text. Also understand that this is not settled law so no one has absolute answers regarding fair use. Even more complicating is that Wikipedia has recently changed from allowing fair use images that help the encyclopedia to not allowing such images if, because of wikipedia's current high profile, we can get the images under a free copyright license like GFDL. This is because Wikipedia is about free as in freedom not just free as in no cost. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 03:55, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The specific example is a trigger only and the current example. What I'm asking is when an unsupported statement is made such as this case an editor has claimed a free image can be produced that the person making such a claim should have some onus to support such a claim. We rightly dont accept unsubstanciated claims in articles why should an unsubstanciated claim be aceptiable when implementing policy. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 04:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As has been mentioned above, if one wants to republish unfreely licensed material on Wikimedia servers, the onus is on you to establish that it meets our criteria for doing so. We're going to be conservative about this. If this seems arbitrary or confusing to you, I'm sorry, but there is really no chance that we are going to ask for a citation from a reliable source when an editor expresses concern that a fair use claim isn't compelling. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 04:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Theres nothing confusing about an abitrary decision I'm sorry you cant see that I'm asking how could a policy be implemented when its based on an individuals unsubstanciated claim. I'm then also aking why such a policy exists. When you consider this is a regular occurance maybe the use of '<i>fair use</i> images should not occur as is the case may other language wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 05:55, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My interpretation is that it is for the party asserting the claim of fair use to present reasonable arguments for why the image is not replaceable (or repeatable), and not the other way around. --<a href="../../../o/d/e/User%7EOden_515b.html" title="User:Oden">Oden</a> 08:49, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which is a fair assertion but once those assertions have been presented continued arguements should also have some burden of proof requirement, here in lies the issue. Image foo.jpg is being used under fair use editor A come along and says that fair use cant be applied because another image can be created. The uploader responds with the reason as to why it cant be yet editor A still maintains that it can be. Uploader again asserts that it cant and provides additional reasonings as to why, editor A still maintains that it can be quotes FU policy. Editor B agrees with the uploader assertions so questions editor A claim who just again quotes FU policy that a free image could be created. this circle continues. End result is a lot of very heated discussion spilling onto pages of AN, RFC, ARBCOM or even worse outside of wikipedia but provided that editor A is willing to continue quoting FU policy the issue is never resolved. Unlike any other content disputes there is no burden on the person making the accusations that the image doesnt comply with FU policy to support that claim. Normal end result is that the uploader gives up, leaves or reduces future contributions, editor A claims a victory image gets deleted and another article becomes abandoned without further improvement.</dd>
<dd>So what we have is policy thats damaging wikipedia either it needs to be changed to include a burden of proof on all parties for continued dispute or alternatively the continuation of fair use needs to be terminated. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 15:43, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Eh? You could make up a silly scenario like this for any policy on Wikipedia. The point is that once the uploader has provided reasons as to why the image would be irreplaceable, "just continuing to quote policy" will do Editor A no good; if they believe the reasons given are invalid, they should explain why. Now, if the reasons for irreplaceability advanced are clearly not compelling, it is possible that the image will be deleted whether or not A responds; if, on the other hand, the reasons are compelling and A fails to respond with counterarguments but instead just quotes policy, the image will likely be kept. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobth_3967.html" title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobth_e82d.html" title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 16:51, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear administrator(s),</p>
<p>A page that I started is no longer there. It was under 'unified performance management'. I have just recreated this page as when I searched for it, it was not found. So I checked the deletion logs and still no trace?</p>
<p>If there is a reason why it was deleted I would appreciate if someone told me why. Also if it was deleted, should it not be coming up in the deletion log?</p>

<p>Recently we have seen MONGO and Seabhcan desysopped, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_ScienceApologist_c8a1.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/ScienceApologist">FeloniousMonk</a> "counselled" and I've seen some other issues here and on the mailing lists which give pause for thought. I wonder, do we need to have some place where admins can let off steam and get support without the whole world looking on? I note that the mediation committee have a private mailing list, I wonder if that might be an idea for admins. This is not to allow <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINC_0d39.html" title="WP:TINC">the cabal</a> to work more effectively in secret, but to give a (hopefully) troll free environment for discussion of issues related to performance of admin duties. Another option is maybe a permanently protected noticeboard. Or maybe it's a crap idea, I don't know. Just thinking out loud, really, mainly because I think we (as admins) should really have been able to stop MONGO going off the rails, and I really feel we failed him. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 17:49, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, if you had a mailing list for admins that wasn't public (and if it were public, it wouldn't be a place for "blowing off steam," because it would be just like doing so here), the folks who howl about the "Admin Cabal" will have even more fuel for the fire than they do now. And we definitely don't need to offer up any more ammunition in that department. I admit, it would be great to give the admins a place where they can go off if they need to - but privacy in a project like this is a bit difficult to call for, I think. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 19:52, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is nothing wrong with a private forum for admins, we already have an IRC channel. It is okay to talk in private as long as our actions are based on publicly disclosed information. The idea of a noticeboard that anyone can read but only admins can edit is a fine idea, with full transparency. I would love it.

<p>(<i>edit conflict</i>) Don't the problems being discussed here affect Admins and non-Admins alike? The distinction is that Admins have additional tools available to them, but the triggers, personalities, experience levels, and consequences for Wikipedia cross the Admin/non-Admin divide. Therefore, shouldn't there be a process for producing private discussions to resolve differences and 'blow off steam' that is accessible to all Wikipedians in some fashion? There isn't any need to create an Admin-only communications channel, because often the circumstances that Admins find themselves in that lead to explosive decompression involve non-Admins as well as Admins and communications that by definition excludes a party to discussion is not part of the solution, it's part of the problem. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 20:04, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The IRC admin channel really isn't that great for what Guy describes anyway... I wouldn't go there for support, for various reasons you'd be more likely to just get frustration and smart remarks. The list would actually have to be active admins only, not friends of admins, people who got de-sysopped, random people the list owners like, etc. However due to the obvious concerns, it might be a good idea to give a few trustworthy non-admins access (or read-only access)... Newyorkbrad, Badlydrawnjeff, Daniel Bryant, I dunno, whoever we could agree upon, to just ensure that the list doesn't get out of hand. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 20:13, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suspect that in principle anybody who asked nicely and is a "known face" would be allowed to subscribe (damn, is Newyorkbrad not an admin?), but only verified admins could write (so like a protected talk page). The difference as I see it it is that on Wikipedia you have to abide by various rules; although we can <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPADE_225b.html" title="WP:SPADE">call a spade a spade</a>, asking openly whether X is a spade could be taken as a civility violation, as would saying X is a spade and then having nine others immediately point out the crucial evidence you missed. I don't know, maybe it's a crap idea, but I have the strong feeling there should be at least one place where those of us who do sysoppery can put our feet up and know we won't be bearded by whichever nest of socks we're currently fighting. I keep coming back to the MONGO case, but also various other ArbCom cases, including WebEx and Min Zhu and more. Somewhere there should be a mechanism for finding out that you're going off the rails before the train crashes. It's a half-formed and possibly half-baked idea, which is why I brought it up for discussion. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:08, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>In my opinion, issues which relate to how Wikipedia is managed need to be transparent, and at least readable by all, so I am opposed to the creation of a truly private admin mailing list. If you need to blow off steam, people should be encouraged to do that with their friends, but not through a global admin mailing list. By friends, I mean here either real world non-Wiki friends, or by emailing other Wikipedians whom they trust. If someone has been involved in Wikipedia long enough to be an administrator, I would hope that they would have found individuals that they felt they could turn to for help and advice. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 21:12, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree completely with Dragons Flight on this matter. I admit that when I do go into the IRC channel it's to blow off steam, and because I know I can find one or two people whose judgement I trust, and who will be willing to listen. I also find that when I'm idling there I'll be approached, now and then, for the same reason (privately, not in the main channel). This is a useful function, but it shouldn't be formalized. As always, of course, this doesn't take the place of official discussion and any action taken on-wiki you should be capable of justifying on-wiki. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 21:17, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Admins are simply people with the extra tools. They're not a social group, nor a legitimate decision-making group inside Wikipedia.

<dd>I'm with Zocky on this one. I'm very much against an admin-only mailing list - admins are just people with access to a couple of extra buttons; we're not any better, nor more special, than every other user on Wikipedia, and we should not have a super secret mailing list that only admins can see. If it were visible to everyone else, but only admins could contribute (and by admins I mean <i>current</i> admins), I would be less opposed but still uneasy. The thought of arbitrary 'approved users' being allowed to contribute but not everyone, is an idea even worse than an admin-only mailing list. Either everyone or no one, don't start making subjective distinctions. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 10:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As someone who has trolled other websites (but <b>not</b> here), been mis-identified as a troll here due to associations elsewhere, and been dealt with in a way that would make a troll weep with joy, maybe my input would be of some help.</p>
<p>I think the problem is the attitude towards trolling: that trolls are "enemies" of Wikipedia. This is something I'm deriving based of one of <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a>'s blog posts. People treat them like enemies instead of just "problems", and this is what happens as a result:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are "informed" - YOU ARE A TROLL. This will only make legit editors pissed, and will only give blatant trolls exactly what they're looking for. Any "subtle" troll is only going to rejoice as well, since if they're being subtle, this is going to cause arguments among the labeller and those who disagree.</li>
<li>People get angry - seems to be the biggest problem discussed in this thread. Trolls should just be prevented from disruption, people shouldn't get all angry over them. They end up taking it out on each other if they do. I've seen it happen here, livejournal, youtube, etc., and it's only because people get angry over it instead of just being apathetic.</li>
<li>People get paranoid about trolls - causing lots of legit editors to get blocked for looking even slightly suspicious. Or if not blocked, yelled at and goaded into getting blocked.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the problem isn't that trolls can see the discussion - as a wiki, that's just unavoidable - the problem is how it's dealt with IMO. I've been in IRC with numerous Wikipedia trolls of varying degrees and they're not discouraged or stopped by the methods Wikipedia admins use - their eyes light up like it's Christmas, in fact. Stop making a big deal out of "FIGHTING" trolling and just prevent them without recognition. <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> looks awesome for this.</p>
<p>And if Newyorkbrad, Daniel.Bryant, and badlydrawnjeff - all people I've seen in situations I've been involved in or IRC - are so "trusted", why not make them sysops? If I wasn't so unpopular I'd nominate Daniel.Bryant right now.

<li>I've never requested access to the admin IRC channel because I think it is inherently a bad idea... largely due to the same issues Zocky predicts for an admin mailing list above. I also agree that Wikipedia's 'standard response' to problems has gone astray... too often people take pride in 'stomping the vandals and trolls' when they should have been trying to get them to be positive contributors and just blocking them dispassionately when it became clear that wasn't going to happen. A 'place to blow off steam' accepts a priori that it is 'ok' to get steamed in the first place... it shouldn't be. That's what leads to 'meltdowns', 'going off the rails', et cetera... and any sort of 'release valve' for that is going to be a minor stopgap at best. Any time things get above the level of mild annoyance ought to be reason to walk away from that particular issue and do something else. Wikipedia is ridiculously huge. I couldn't do everything I would like to here even if I quit my job and worked on it every waking hour. There is <i>always</i> something else people could be doing instead of digging themselves deeper and deeper into a pit of anger. The idea that someone has to 'stand guard' over an article or subject is a poisonous and destructive one... let it go and there will <b>always</b> be someone else to step in and re-assert balance if need be. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:01, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>General comment, although I don't know which subsection it should go in. Please feel free to move it to the appropriate subsection. I <i>don't</i> have a an experienced admin I can turn to for advice. If pressed, I'd probably ask the person who nominated me. I think some mechanism for asking for Admin advice, even if on a "protected" page (so that only Admins could write), although anyone could read, seems like a good idea. I should add that I seem to be on someone's E-mail list for requested admin actions, and, if asking advice on those, I wouldn't necessarily want <b>his</b> comments to be publically available, as it might be a copyright violation to repost E-mail, so some private channel would be appreciated. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 15:58, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agree with Zocky that the idea of further admin segregation from the community is outrageous and all its supporters should be ashamed of themselves. If the project badly needs anything, it's more transparency rather than another closed chatroom. All sorts of secretive communication channels that are basically untraceable represent the very opposite of what Wikipedia stands for. That IRC has been recurrently turned by admins into a crapfest abounding in incivility, is the perfect illustration of self-destructive potential of any attempt to create an elitist establishment within the community of editors. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 16:17, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

All this "you should be our robotic servents" then accusing us of abuse and cabalism and everything else left and right, then we're the incivil ones and should be ashamed of ourselves once we say anything back. Admins are treated by some as a class <i>lower</i> than regular users... expected to just take endless abuse then go "for a walk in the park" if they don't like it. That's just crap. Go to any other site on the internet and see how much the admins bend over backwards to accomodate troublemakers, you won't find it anywhere but here. wp-en is unique in how extreme its expectations of volunteer admins are. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 16:35, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

We don't have to 'bend over backwards', but we DO have to define a clear line between the "troublemakers" and ourselves... and not joining them in swearing, making broad accusations, and heated blowups is a good start. Ideas about dealing with stress are certainly a good thing to discuss - I just don't happen to agree with this one and think the 'don't let it get to you, work on something else, take a walk in the park' approach has considerably better results. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 17:32, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I find this comment remarkably incivil and unkind. A "clear line" between troublemakers and admins is impossible to define, because the worst troublemakers are usually admins. On the other hand, the best editors (such as <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">User:Wetman</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">User:Giano</a>, etc) are usually non-admins. Yes, some admins are getting desysopped, but the process is too slow in my opinion. If more than one thousand admins have got enough energy today, I advise them to deal with an appalling backlog on <a href="../../../t/d/y/T%7ETDYK_93e3.html" title="T:TDYK">T:TDYK</a>, rather than discuss for hours where they could chat when they get tired of IRC and mailing list conversations.

<dd>Case in point... admins are what's wrong with Wikipedia! Down with those people trying to improve the project!

<dd>I find your statement that I'm "blathering tripe" insulting and demand apologies. I don't know anyone who thinks that all admins are abusive. Perhaps you do. Furthermore, your statement above that "all this "you should be our robotic servents" then accusing us of abuse and cabalism and everything else left and right", etc, etc. curiously echo a recent statement on my meta talk page: "my point is that we're editing Wikipedia in our free time, as volunteers, and people really shouldn't be telling us that we have to do anything, taking care of backlogs or not. Nobody pays me to do anything on there, etc". I call this attitude the doctrine of <b>official admin irresponsibility</b>. Since you voluntarily (sic!) assumed the heavy burden of adminship, it is too late to whine that "admins are treated by some as a class <i>lower</i> than regular users". No, they are treated not as "lower" or "higher" (there is no hierarchy in Wikipedia) but as a group of people who <i>volunteered</i> to do more work than mere editors. If you are not up to the task, you should lay down your tools. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 18:41, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>So this discussion started from a suggestion to help alleviate admin stress before messy things happen. Here are a couple of ideas to help reduce admin burn out from me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Forced breaks. Make admins down tools say one day in every 14, or after x amount of edits, or if they have been online for more than 6 hours at a stretch. The actual limits are obviously debatable.</dd>
<dd>A buddy system - assign new admins a mentor who they can confer with, being in the same time zone may help.</dd>
<dd>Don't feel you have to respond to every request. Being an admin doesn't mean you have to have the last word.</dd>
<dd>Thoughts? <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 18:25, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I like the general concepts of admins (and users in general) taking breaks from stressful stuff... especially if they are given options for other things to work on during their 'break'. Admin coordination/partnerting, through 'buddies' or otherwise, would also have several obvious benefits though being susceptible to accusations of 'cabalism'. Right now we tend to be 'lone wolves' until a dispute arises and then we get together to ponder it. Having more developed systems for 'handoff' of issues when there are potential conflicts of interest might be beneficial. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 18:57, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think mentoring would be an interesting idea to explore. But that asks a lot of the mentors. Still, it would have been interesting if an admin I'd respected at the time I became an admin had mentored me... it took me a while to really venture into certain areas of adminship. I notice a lot of new admins are much more bold than I was though. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 19:34, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>How about the idea of stressing to admins that getting the balance right is important. Do boring housekeeping admin tasks when other admin tasks are too stressful. Do self-reviews where you examine your behaviour in a stressful situation and think what to do next time this sort of thing happens. And if things are getting stressful, don't speed up. Instead, slow down and be more thoughtful, not less. Knowing when to stop, when to cancel the comment you've just written, when to sleep on something and deal with it in the morning, is the most helpful attribute an admin can have. Not all admins can be like that, but they can try and learn from what they have done in the past. Some of the contributors to this thread could look back here in a few days time and review how they acted, for example. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:04, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>A little less drama from all sides would be helpful. And Ghirla does have a point - we're all admins because we <i>volunteered</i> to take on the extra tools. With power comes responsibility and, one would hope, maturity. If you can't take the occasional sniping without getting upset, then you probably shouldn't be trusted with the extra tools, let alone fending off legal threats. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 19:22, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page of photos of naked people was deleted from wikipedia, reason: violation of <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> not encyclopedic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=User:Ewlyahoocom/WikiPorn" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=User:Ewlyahoocom/WikiPorn" rel="nofollow">[33]</a></p>

<p>User:BlooWilt wrote: "I haven't checked out the rule but I know this folder is breeaking the rules" User:BlooWilt states himself that he hasn't checked out the rule yet, but he has faith (a belief based on no evidence) that <a href="../../../e/w/l/User%7EEwlyahoocom_WikiPorn_d352.html" title="User:Ewlyahoocom/WikiPorn">User:Ewlyahoocom/WikiPorn</a> is "breeaking" the rules.</p>
<p>So based on the "majority" (2 people) on User:BlooWilt "talk page", he got the user page deleted.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me where <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> says that naked people are not encyclopedic?</p>

<dd>It isn't encyclopedic. A page whose only purpose is to have photos of naked people is different than the page on cum shots. Also, "we allow some pictures of naked people" isn't meant to be taken to mean that we allow user subpages of "WikiPorn"; that applies to articles, not user subpages.

<p>As people may be aware, a recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_PMA_a74c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/PMA">rfc</a> revealed that PMA was blocking good faith editors who apparently simply had a different political point of view than himself on pages he was monitoring. The rfc led PMA to resign his admin capabilities. However, I am still encountering editors who have been blocked in the past as result of this activity. This editor, <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicocvenancio_c2cc.html" title="User:Chicocvenancio"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Chicocvenancio</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChicocvenancio_53eb.html" title="User talk:Chicocvenancio">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chicocvenancio_6beb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chicocvenancio">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Chicocvenancio_0042.html" title="Special:Blockip/Chicocvenancio">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>), was blocked by PMA without any legitimate justification at all, during a period of rampant disruption involving a number of PMA's fellow Australian editors and admins. Where users who simply disagreed with one long term, high profile Australian editor were being attacked and blocked etc en masse.</p>
<p>Since <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicocvenancio_c2cc.html" title="User:Chicocvenancio">User:Chicocvenancio</a> has returned to wikipedia, I spotted the history in the user's block log. And it reveals an unseemly black mark in an innocent editor's record that I don't believe is warranted. Would it be possible for another admin to add a note to the block log of this user, to clarify that the block was in error. Without it, a fellow editor could draw a false conclusion about <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicocvenancio_c2cc.html" title="User:Chicocvenancio">User:Chicocvenancio</a> and assume that the user had been disruptive in the past.

<dd>The block log should not be used as a note pad. The user could always create a user subpage with any diffs to exonerating comments by other respected users, and then could refer anyone who may question his block log history in the future to this page. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature12_b3bf.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature12"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 18:29, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Is</i> there a way to add a note to the block log, anyway? I guess by blocking him again with the exculpatory explanation in the text and then unblocking him, which seems rather convoluted... it's not like it's going to affect his annual salary review... let him consider it a badge of honor. I suggest also that you award him a Purple Star (it's at <a href="../../../p/e/r/Wikipedia%7EPersonal_user_awards_2b20.html#WikiProject_Kindness_Campaign_and_Dispute_Resolution" title="Wikipedia:Personal user awards">Wikipedia:Personal user awards#WikiProject Kindness Campaign and Dispute Resolution</a> and is designed precisely to help take the sting out of this type of situation. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 18:42, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thanks NoSeptember. True. The user could do that, but then most inexperienced users are not aware of what "sub pages", "diffs", etc are. And it seems to be a lot of work for an innocent editor, who likely doesn't even know any other users, to create such an exoneration. I imagined it would be easier if an admin added a futher block with an attached summary "This block was in error". Which would clear the thing up in seconds. I wouldn't consider being blocked and accused of a falsehood a badge of honour, I'd consider it an unsavoury slur.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 18:43, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that admins don't agree as a group any more than any other random grouping of users. So when one admin adds a note to a log, it is not saying anything other than that particular admin believes what he has written. Exonerating notes in block logs is not a path we want to go down. As for the subpages, if the user is inexperienced in subpages, you can help him out. Only a user who is likely to get involved in edit warring in the future even needs to worry about exoneration at this point, you would be surprised how many good users have inappropriate blocks in their logs, but they get along just fine. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature12_b3bf.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature12"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 18:54, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't agree. A false accusation of being a "sockpuppet" and a "POV pusher" that permanently and publicly stays on a users record without any exoneration at all is problematic regardless of whether one "edit wars" or not. If you receieved an accusation of being a "sockpuppet" and a "POV pusher" on your log, would you let it lie?--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 19:15, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would let it lie (or create a subpage while it's fresh in my mind, if it were a complicated situation), and I know other users in that situation who have let it lie. A 6+ month old block is not going to be a heavy factor in an admin's decision to block in the future, only current and a recent pattern of behavior would be. People pass <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">RfAs</a> with negative information in their block logs all the time, a simple straightforward explanation is all it takes.

<p>In February, Giano was blocked by Carnildo for a bunch of things (which was overturned quite rapidly). Later on, another admin instituted a 10-second block to make a note that Carnildo's blcok reason was incorrect. Hbdragon88 21:56, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed, this type of thing is neither uncommon, nor controversial. When a clear breach such this occurs, it is the most effective way of resolving the situation.

<dd>I don't want to initiate the novelty of block note wheel warring more than anybody else does, but a case this clear, where the admin was forced to desysop himself for misuse of the block button, should be corrected. I have made a note in Chicocvenancio's log.

<dd>Good work Bishonen. I think that is wisest. I will return if - and probably when - I discover more of these incidents, which have entered double figures.
