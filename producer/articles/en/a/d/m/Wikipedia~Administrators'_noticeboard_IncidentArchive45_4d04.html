<p><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Lyndon_LaRouche_2_0af4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Lyndon LaRouche 2">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Lyndon LaRouche 2</a> included several "enforcements". One was a ban on <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky">user:Herschelkrustofsky</a> inserting "material which relates to Lyndon LaRouche into any other article". Recently, that editor repeatedly added material into a non-LaRouche article (<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_%28economics%29_67c0.html" title="American System (economics)">American System (economics)</a>) supporting a theory which is apparently unique to LaRouche. (The American System is integral to LaRouche's political theory). When I asked him on his talk page to provide a non-LaRouche source, he called the request vandalism. He hasn't provided any such source on the article talk page either. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_System_%28economics%29&amp;diff=23550051&amp;oldid=23548215" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_System_%28economics%29&amp;diff=23550051&amp;oldid=23548215" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_System_%28economics%29&amp;diff=23865165&amp;oldid=23617535" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_System_%28economics%29&amp;diff=23865165&amp;oldid=23617535" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmerican_System_%28economics%29_7c3f.html" title="Talk:American System (economics)">Talk:American System (economics)</a>, and <a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHerschelkrustofsky_threats_and_insults_b9d9.html" title="User talk:Herschelkrustofsky/threats and insults">User talk:Herschelkrustofsky/threats and insults</a>.</p>
<p>In related incidents, the same editor pushed the LaRouche POV in this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Internal_improvements&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23836553" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Internal_improvements&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23836553" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. And an IP identified by the ArbCom as belonging to the same editor made this edit to a LaRouche-related article, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeremiah_Duggan&amp;diff=23249453&amp;oldid=20188439" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeremiah_Duggan&amp;diff=23249453&amp;oldid=20188439" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which inserted "unsubstantiated derogatory claims" into the article. So the occurence above is not isolated.</p>
<p>I believe that this editor is returning to the behavior which led to the two previous arbitrations, and I think that the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Lyndon_LaRouche_2_0af4.html#Ban_enforcement" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Lyndon LaRouche 2">ban enforcement</a> called for by the ArbCom should be implemented. Namely, he should be blocked for up to a week, and the ban reset. Any thoughts? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 23:06, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please note that as Willmcw was executing his second revert on that article today, I was completing my response to his allegations, which may be seen at <a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmerican_System_%28economics%29_7c3f.html" title="Talk:American System (economics)">Talk:American System (economics)</a>. I would ask that you take a moment to read my response.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Willmcw appears to allege that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeremiah_Duggan&amp;diff=23249453&amp;oldid=20188439" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeremiah_Duggan&amp;diff=23249453&amp;oldid=20188439" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> was made by myself. This allegation is false. If I understand his argument, he may be insinuating that this edit originated from a computer at my workplace, where there are approximately 100 young people, many of whom use Wikipedia. After the last ArbCom ruling, where I was found to be using sockpuppets for the simple reason that I and many others were using the same IP address, I have discontinued using that address. The poor grammar of the edit Willmcw wishes to attribute to me is certainly not my style.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also maintain that Willmcw is carrying out a campaign of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">harassment</a>, with the intention not of improving the article(s) in question, but of making my participation as an editor sufficiently unpleasant that I will will leave the project. Please note that there have been numerous complaints by other editors against Willmcw for carrying out similar activity, complaints which have fueled a debate about the practice of "WikiStalking," and a request for action by Rangerdude that is presently under consideration by the ArbCom. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky">HK</a> 23:29, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Given that there appears to be some debate at the American System article as to whether HK has inserted LaRouche material, and given that Willmcw has a lengthy history of animosity with HK dating back to and including the Arbcom case that is being cited as a basis for the ban but also including numerous other disputes, it would probably be better for this case, and any related blocking penalty, to be reviewed by a more neutral administrator than Willmcw. I state this without taking a position on the merits (or lack thereof) in this case regarding whether the LaRouche block was violated. If it is deemed that the block was violated, however, this judgment should be made in a transparent manner by a party who is NOT simultaneously involved in historical and current ongoing disputes with the editor being accused of violating the Arbcom block. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 05:55, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The purpose of this page is to bring actions to the attention of the community in order for review. As with most all problem editors, the attention of the community is beneficial. This editor has been a serious, long-term problem for Wikipedia and involved in two previous arbitrations. Note that the ArbCom's decision repeatedly says that it may be enforced by "any administrator", not "any uninvolved editor". Enforcements are reviewable by the community. If another administrator feels that <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky">User:Herschelkrustofsky</a> is neither edit warring nor pushing the LaRouche POV then they might say so and clear or alter the enforcement. That's the way everything on Wikipedia works. Cheers, -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 06:39, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your initial post seeking community input was on 9/29 at 23:06 and HK responded about half an hour later. You announced your decision to impose a ban on HK on 9/30 at 05:06, or exactly <b>six hours</b> after the original post. In doing so you cited your rationale as being that you heard "no further objection." A mere six hours is not time for sufficient community consideration of anything on wikipedia, and even if it were a more neutral and mature administrator would recuse himself from ban decisions in a case where he was a long term dispute participant. In the very least the responsible thing to do would be (1) allow time for a greater cross-section of wikipedians to review your request and (2) should you still desire a ban upon the expiration of that time, seek out a neutral third party to do it so as to avoid the appearance of a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a>. It's a simple matter of etiquette and transparency to do these two things, whether you technically have the power to impose a ban unilaterally or not. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 06:54, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In my opinion, <b>any allegation</b> of "wikistalking" a contributor which fails to mention that said contributor is under arbcom parole which requests or invite blocks for violating that parole, is <b>in itself disruptive</b>. I think HK should be banned for 30 days for wasting everyone's time with this frivolous accusation. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 17:01, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi there. My understanding is that with disruptive users who have an Arbcom history, you can request a legitimate IP check from a Checkuser.

<dd>CheckUser is horribly slow at times - querying for IPs for a username is a pretty heavy-duty query, so the system happily times it out if it's taking too long, and this can go on for hours at heavy load times. That said, CheckUser isn't magical pixie dust - NoPuzzleStranger didn't edit from any of the ranges Wik/Gz did, and neither is Rivarez ... but was apparent by his obnoxious behaviour. (And that his name was an anagram of User:Gzornenplatz, which I didn't spot either.) The guy is fiercely dedicated to Wikipedia ... if only he wasn't such a <i><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" class="extiw" title="m:Don't_be_a_dick">dick</a></i> about it, and in such a way that it's <i>obvious</i> it's him.

<p>If there was any kind of logic at work here whatsoever, we'd let him edit and simply penalize him for things such as edit warring while not attempting to inhibit his many good contributions. But alas. The ruling was issued in May 2004 and we still haven't fixed it. Surely having him edit under one account, with plenty of people warily watching him and a certain sense of accountability that comes with being an accepted member of the community, is better than this. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 17:36, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The thing is that penalizing for bad contributions takes the time of administrators and other editors. Dealing with trolling or revert warring takes time and effort, and may scare off new contributors. If lots of people have to 'warily watch' an editor, then that editor probably isn't suited to work here in the first place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If he wants to be an 'accepted member of the community', it's easy: he can start a new account, make positive contributions, and <i>not</i> revisit the bad habits that led to the original bans. ArbCom bans aren't <i>real</i>; anybody can get a clean slate and a new username. The only reason that these editors are banned repeatedly as socks is because they repeat the behaviour that got their original accounts banned. If the new accounts were well-behaved, they wouldn't end up being discussed here on AN/I. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 19:42, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I bet they would, if someone figured it out anyway. There are more clues to a person's identity than just revert warring over certain topics.

<p>Wow. It took me a while to understand what was going on here. So a vandal created an account, User:Uncle Ed's major work 'bot, and operated a bot under that name? Holy crap. I imagine someone with a mind to do it can create an innocent looking account and run a bot with it that made subtle changes to articles (like making changes to dates and factoids and such) that no one would immediately notice as suspicious. Is that possible? Imagine the damage if this was set loose on articles that are not heavily watched (or understood), eg. technical articles. Is this as scary as I think it is, or can it somehow be detected? Is there a way you can tell an account is a bot, if the creator has not specified on the User or talk page that it is (or in the Account name)?—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">enceph</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#666699">alon</font></a> 05:59, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, that's right. Whether it was in fact a bot or a human is hard to tell; the account's creator just duplicated the userpages of <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G%27s_major_work_%27bot_fee3.html" title="User:Uncle G's major work 'bot">User:Uncle G's major work 'bot</a> which does the exact opposite of this 'bot (it moves VfDs to AfDs). Willy on Wheels appears only to have used an automated approach recently for example, but stacking up tabs in Firefox can make it look bot-like. Normally, the only way you can tell if an account is a bot is if it has been flagged as such in software (like admins are) — this is done after a request process and a Steward's intervention and can be checked in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Special%7EListusers_21e7.html" title="Special:Listusers">Special:Listusers</a>. So if someone does run a bot without a flag, you can't tell unless the action rate is above what a human could achieve. A number of people (e.g. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">User:Uncle G</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">User:Who</a>) run legitimate bots that are not bot-flagged yet, which muddies the waters. Normally, vandalbots are spotted by RC patrol because they edit so quickly and badly and can be blocked on sight (as can out-of-control normal bots). But if someone made a slow, sneaky vandalbot it could be a worrying while before anyone noticed what was going on, which is scary. In fact, I'm surprised this hasn't been done yet. <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 14:00, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hey Splash, whatsup. Thanks for this. As it happens there's a discussion on the RFA Talk page right now about old vandals, and so I've been enlightened, so to speak, that these things have actually been done. It seems to me that the main reason serial vandals aren't usually subtle is that damage is not really their goal. It's what they use to get attention—they <i>want</i> everyone to see their handiwork. We'd be in a spot more trouble if they didn't.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">enceph</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#666699">alon</font></a> 14:22, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Willy on Wheels publicly stated on Slashdot at one point that xe used multiple tabs in a tabbed web browser. I can confirm, from personal experience, that using multiple tabs can be mistaken for using a 'bot. At the beginning of 2005, long before I learned how to write 'bots, my use of a tabbed web browser was mistaken for the use of a 'bot at Wiktionary. Given the pattern of edits here, which is not regular enough for automation, it is unlikely that a 'bot was involved, and likely that the vandal was simply using a tabbed web browser. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:45, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Same here! This was the most confusing impersonation in a while, and the second time where I noticed something peculiar with a user name where I didn't take action...the last time was with User:Four Wheels...Anyway, I think everything is cleaned up now. By the way, is there a way to query the list of usernames? The other day I found an account which had the string "WILLY" in it (all in caps), but I can't seem to find it anymore. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 14:55, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

He's in danger of self combusting. Although in many respects he's a decent editor, he seems unable to cope with disagreements (as his Talk page hints at; the real problem lies scattered across article Talk pages. His User page contains the line: "I promise to try and contain myself over lashing out at people on this website", which suggests that he knows that he has a problem, though he clearly hasn't mastered it yet). He's one of a growing class of editors who treat edits they don't like as "vandalism" (see, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Since_U_Been_Gone&amp;diff=24431956&amp;oldid=24430075" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Since_U_Been_Gone&amp;diff=24431956&amp;oldid=24430075" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>), and is descending into more and more hysterical childish abuse (see, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASince_U_Been_Gone&amp;diff=24431860&amp;oldid=24387286" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASince_U_Been_Gone&amp;diff=24431860&amp;oldid=24387286" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. He's also started deleting other people's comments from Talk pages <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThe_Trouble_with_Love_Is&amp;diff=24481714&amp;oldid=23946931" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThe_Trouble_with_Love_Is&amp;diff=24481714&amp;oldid=23946931" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. I originally tried to reason with him and to calm him down, but he's reached the stage where he has tantrums at the mere sight of my name, so if another admin could step in and have a quite, calming word I'd be grateful (and it might defuse what could otherwise become an even more unpleasant situation). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:34, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although no-one's responded to the above, I thought that I'd add another plea of the same kind (I'm editing popular-music articles, which seem to attract this sort of editor): <a href="../../../b/g/c/User%7EBGC_d645.html" title="User:BGC">BGC</a> (<a href="../../../b/g/c/User_talk%7EBGC_52ff.html" title="User talk:BGC">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BGC_6339.html" title="Special:Contributions/BGC">contribs</a>) is mass reverting my attempts to tidy albums-articles, calling the removal of excessive Wikilinking (multiple links to the same year in successive lines, linking to seasons and months) and the conversion of hyphens to dashes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=M.I.U._Album&amp;diff=24473643&amp;oldid=24472523" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=M.I.U._Album&amp;diff=24473643&amp;oldid=24472523" rel="nofollow">"vandalous"</a>.

<dd>I may be naive, but I think an easy-going approach to these kinds of issues would work fine. Unlike factual issues, it really makes no difference if you work to gradually ease opposition instead of simply implementing a change outright. Now, I guess maybe Mel will say he is easy-going about it, but he sure gets a lot of tempers flared about this kind of thing, so it might be useful for him to reconsider his approach. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:48, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem is that there are thousands of pop-music articles that are in need of attention — both in terms of Wikipedia style and in terms of content. Each of them seems to be "owned" by one or more devoted fans, who defend them vigorously from any outside change. I'm not altogether sure what an easy-going approach would be, but I'm pretty sure that it would mean that ordinary house-keeping edits of the sorts I'm trying to engage in would take up all my time, and that it would be years before the work was done.</p>
<p>Incidentally, my first encounter with BGC was when I found him blanking <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetSounds_8a7e.html" title="User:PetSounds">User:PetSounds</a>. He ignored my requests for explanation, simply deleting them from his Talk page. Someone e-mailed me to tell me that PetSounds had been BGC's previous account, and that he'd behaved badly with it, generating ill-will (apparently using his odd notion of vandalism even then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sunflower_%28album%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19543912" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sunflower_%28album%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19543912" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>), and felt that he needed a fresh start. Unfortunately he immediately began acting in the same belligerent way with the new account, so it didn't really get him anywhere. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 16:41, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excuse me, but if we're going to start pointing fingers and labelling people "belligerent", perhaps you need to look at your SELF before throwing baseless accusations. YOU removed my album pics because you "didn't like it", not because it broke policy because that hasn't been established at all. Secondly, after reinserting them, you removed them again, instead of waiting out the decision into the infobox deletion query like a proper Wikipedian is supposed to. And this subjective, indeed belligerent, steamrolling behaviour comes from an admin - someone who is supposed to set an example?? Wow... I have never locked horns with anyone here, except for the obstinate ones who are averse to collaboration, as you clearly are. And from the various remarks I've read about your way of working, I can see I am far from the only one who feels you are WAY over-exerting your preferences because of your admin position. <a href="../../../b/g/c/User%7EBGC_d645.html" title="User:BGC">BGC</a> 21:36, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I thought of having a friendly word with Anittas a while ago, although I'm not an admin, but he got quite upset when I reverted some of his grammatical errors back to Mel's version, and seemed to think that Mel had put me up to it. He also got upset when I (twice) reverted a very childish personal attack that he made against Mel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Anittas&amp;diff=23544607&amp;oldid=23543518" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Anittas&amp;diff=23544607&amp;oldid=23543518" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> on his user page.

<p>Lacking a better place to put this, I thought I would note that I've just speedied about two dozen AfDs and removed the tags from their articles because their sole grounds for deletion were notability. I was relatively lax in this - articles where it seemed clear that notability was being used as a stand-in for verifiability were left - including cases where the verifiability seemed to rest on a single not-highly-ranked webpage, since ephemeral verification is not acceptable. I intend to take a pair of second passes at today's AfD nominations, one to kill things that should have been speedied, and one to kill things that are based on nominations according to policies that are unofficial - deletion policies of wikiprojects (i.e. WP:MUSIC) for example. My guess is that about 1/3 to 1/2 of the AfDs for the day should be removed, either for being slam-dunks that didn't need a vote or for being things that don't actually meet any deletion policy, and the only consensus for their deletion exists among the AfD regulars, not the Wikipedia community at large. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 21:52, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No offence, but the purpose of AfD is to allow members to decide what is notable and what is not notable. It is not up to one member to decide this - even if they are an admin. I realise that you may be trying to cut down the amount of articles, but delisting because the sole reason for listing is due to notability is not the right thing to do. The process allows for debate, and after one or two AfDs where it is decided that the article is notable then it should be kept. On this note, if an article does get removed and you strongly disagree, the article should be taken through articles for undeletion. I strongly disagree with your delistings. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 03:11, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This is unaccetpable behavior, and if it is repeated, should lead to your being desysopped. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:01, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Articles that are being nominated for reasons that do not coincide with any listed deletion policy clog up AfD and contribute to its uselessness. I encourage other admins who see things that are not covered under deletion policy to remove them as well. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 22:16, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Failure to allege notability is, by policy voted upon by consensus, a valid CSD reason for people. By extension, discussion of the failure of the article to establish notability for other things other than people makes that a valid reason. Any unilateral deletion of AfDs, especially those which have had several votes, is bad faith. What's wrong with just letting the vote continue and let an admin who isn't interested in keeping all of the crap make a decision on proper closure based on the voting process? Or are you afraid that some of the crap might get deleted? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:22, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, actually. I am afraid that the AfD regulars (Who show a tendency to ignore deletion policy) will railroad a vote, and that swamped admins will close on votes alone instead of looking to see if a consensus for this kind of deletion exists broadly instead of among the AfD regulars. And failure to establish notability was, I think, a move to block obvious vanity articles and articles with no real content - not articles on minor subjects. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 22:37, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While it is certainly a <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a> standard on which many AFDs are judged. Notability has never really been defined and not really part of the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a>. What the deletion policy does include is an article which "is not suitable for Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>)", but WP:NOT doesn't really delve into notability either (though it does point out we are not "indiscriminate" in producing this encyclopedia). The top of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> says "There is no Wikipedia policy on notability...". Some, like Snowspinner, believe that the lack of explicit reference to notability in deletion policy make it an invalid justification for an AFD. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 22:39, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm a bit more subtle in my criticism. I think notability is one of four things - vanity, a dicdef/permastub, unverifiable, or something I don't know about so want to delete. In the first three cases, we have better means for deletion. In the fourth, we shouldn't delete. I point out also that the very first thing Wikipedia is not is paper - that is, in need of deletion for reasons having to do with space. The overall deletion criteria - the one that should be bent as needed - is that the article harms Wikipedia, as vanity, dicdef/permastubs, and unverifiability do. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 22:44, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

So from the very first line, I cannot reconcile that document with Snowspinner's actions at all. Furthermore, the second section says "don't be reckless" (there are other things you shouldn't be round here, too). Since Snowspinner thought necessary to post something as mundane as an AfD 'closure' here, he must surely have wondered if he had been reckless. I trust he will take this thread as telling him he was. On re-reading <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> (something we should all do more often), I am reminded that it is primarily an editorial, not an administrative, guideline. As the final section of the page exhorts, Snowspinner should familiarise himself with the relevent Wikipedia policies and guidelines for speedy deletion of AfD subpages before he continues in that vein. Once he has done so, perhaps he could post here a link to where this practise received the green light, for it is emphatically not in either <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> or any other document that I am familiar with. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:34, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Snowspinner mentions that some deletions are <i>"slam dunks"</i>. Yes, they are. We just went through a faintly tortuous process of trying to accelerate "slam dunks", but they largely fell short of fuzzy-consensus. In the case of some established editors, they refused to support a single such proposal and, despite these proposals significant support in the community at large, we continue to be unable to "slam dunk" most AfDs (Snowspinner is part of "we"). However, looking through Snowspinner's log, I see only very few instances where he speedied <i>articles</i> to deletion, and then only because they met CSDs rather than that they were "slam dunk" deletes. Even in those cases, he was so casual as to delete the AfD too, rather than taking the, say, 5 seconds it takes to tag an AfD debate properly. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:34, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On a broader point, IMO one of the reasons that standards on RfA are ever rising is that people know that, when an admin behaves in a manner such as this, they can smugly sit behind their adminship safe in the knowledge that it is extraordinarily unlikely they will be properly disciplined for it. The community has little effective recourse to admonish a power-drunk admin in a way they can be expected to promptly listen to. Action such as this merely reinforces that perception, particularly when it is clear that the admin in question shows little sign of accepting any of the criticism. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:50, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This seems WAY out of line. Let the AfD process work. I've only very rarely seen it reach what I would consider a seriously wrong conclusion, no more so than any of our other processes. And if our policies don't make it clear that non-notability is a criterion for deletion, then I'd say that would be a problem with our formal written policies, since it is clearly our <i>de facto</i> practice. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:24, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

And considering the number of articles and editors which are increasing on Wikipedia, the number of articles listed on AfD is not increasing to keep up with the numbers of articles and editors.

<dd>This is faintly ridiculous. I imagine you live somewhere that, if those with power were to turn force on those debating an issue in an effort to silence them, you would decry that action, even if you disagreed with the debaters. You would tell the Those With Power to face down the discussions with better arguments of their own. You would tell them to respect everyone's opinions, not simply to discard them as trash. Apply the same philosophy here — deleting a debate is identical to telling the participant to <i>"shut up, because I say so"</i>. If you think many more articles should be kept then stop bemoaning the fact, and call by AfD. If you can't be bothered to edit like the rest of us, then don't be surprised when we don't hear what you wish you were saying. But don't simply tell us to shut up.

<p>A thought -- It's claimed above that AfD voters "ignore deletion policy". It's always been my interpretation that (outside of "core" policy such as NPOV) Wikipedia policy is supposed to <i>reflect</i> the consensus of editors, rather than <i>dictate</i> what we are all supposed to believe. Therefore, if deletion policy fails to describe what editors actually choose to keep or delete, then this would indicate that deletion policy is <i>inaccurate</i> and needs to be amended to reflect what editors actually support.</p>
<p>Put another way, Wikipedia policy and guideline pages are not statutes, but rather attempts to <i>describe the consensus</i> of editors. (Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy: the fact that, once upon a time, a majority of editors voted for a policy does not prove that it remains binding today if the consensus today is otherwise.) So, if there exists a consensus of editors in favor of policy "x", and "x" is not in violation of core policy (e.g. NPOV), then "x" <i>already is</i> Wikipedia policy; even if it hasn't yet been written up as a policy <i>page</i>.</p>
<p>It's also claimed above that there exists a group of "AfD regulars" whose views differ substantially from those of editors as a whole. If this were the case, then AfD votes would not be indicative of policy consensus on deletion. But is that really the case? Didn't someone do some actual <i>science</i> about this a few weeks ago -- counting up AfD votes of various people -- and find that people who participate more often on AfD <i>don't</i> have a substantially different tendency (in terms of whether they vote "keep" or "delete") than people who don't participate often? I seem to remember something along those lines.</p>
<p>In the cases of most policies, it would be difficult to adjudge whether a policy statement written in the past was out of sync with the consensus of editors today. However, in the case of deletion votes, there is no such difficulty. Insofar as an AfD vote reflects a consensus to delete based on "non-notability", <i>there does exist</i> Wikipedia policy to delete on this basis, at least in some cases -- since policy <i>equals</i> consensus. Therefore, rather than railing against deletions that are out of accord with the current policy statement, the correct thing to do is to amend the statement so that it reflects what policy (i.e. consensus) really is. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 00:01, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <i>completely agree</i>. This is reminding me a little of when GordonWatts was telling everybody who opposed his RFA that because the RFA page said "policy is to make trustworthy people administrators", and he's trustworthy, they're not allowed to oppose him. The point of AFD is not to blindly carry out the deletion policy - it's to <i>discuss whether an article should be deleted</i>. That's why AFD is there in the first place. It's not just to discuss cases on the borderline of the deletion policy either, because <i>there are some things the deletion policy hasn't thought of</i>. AFD is supposed to create <i>flexibility</i> and to enable <i>new consensus</i> to be formed. Snowspinner was 100% out of line, and deleting the AFD pages was even more inappropriate. I hate to say this, but it looks like adminship has really gone to his head this time. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 00:13, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>PS, about "AFD regulars": While the existence of this phenomenon is regrettable, you've got to consider the cause. Not a single experienced Wikipedian exists who doesn't know what AFD is. So why do so few participate? They don't want to. Whatever the reason for this, they know that by not participating they give up their voice in the debate. What's wrong with that? That's <i>how consensus works</i> - you are free to not say anything, and we are free to not take into account an opinion that we can't read your mind to get. (Now, if the AFD atmosphere actually is poisonous and repulsive - and I don't find it such - that should be fixed, but it does not make AFD decisions invalid.) ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 00:18, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think that a number of Wikipedians do "tours of duty" on AfD, RC patrol, and that sort of thing. You get very involved for a few weeks or a month or whatever, and then get a little burned out on it and move on, and then come back to it after a while. There were a couple of weeks recently when I feel like I'd voted on nearly every single AfD in the daily log, and now I don't look in on it often, although I'm sure I'll be back. Hard to tell if there is a true permanent cadre of regulars, more than the 100-day analysis would show. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 21:54, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That would be it! Thanks. So it depends on what one means by "AfD regulars". It would be interesting to see the shape of the "tail" of those below 20 votes in the 100-day period, though. Is the decline in the delete/keep ratio smooth? I would expect that there are a lot of people who vote <i>only once</i> and vote to keep -- because they're the single author of an article that's been nominated for deletion, whose only encounter with AfD is when "their" article got nominated.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I suspect that there are many people whose first encounter with AfD is when an article they've worked on is nominated for deletion. Most of them will vote only on that very nomination, and vote to keep. <i>But</i> -- these folks need to be able to get themselves up to speed to respond to a nomination meaningfully. If they read the deletion policy page and don't see "non-notability" as a criterion, they won't understand what's going on when people vote "delete, non-notable". That's why, if non-notability <i>is</i> a criterion for deletion (in <i>consensus</i> policy), we need to make sure that it's written up as such (in <i>the description of</i> policy). --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 00:47, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Notability per se as a deletion criterion was put to a vote (one not just amongst AFD regulars) to become policy once.

<dd>Thank you. I hope that those reading the RfC against Snowspinner will read it in that light. There is activity on AfD that is in direct contradiction to the current deletion policy (which says that an article whose only problem is that it's on a subject so obscure that it doesn't merit an article is <i>not</i> a deletion candidate, but should be merged). An administrator may sometimes take action necessary to support adherence to policy, for instance in this case removing invalid nominations and removing inappropriately placed tags. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:51, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another thing that it shows is that deletion listings have a remarkably low hit rate. Figures elsewhere show that it only deletes around 75% of all nominations.

If you recall, I said over and over (on Jimbo's page, for example) that Jimbo should either enforce the current policy (policy dictates consensus action) <i>or</i> change the policy (consensus dictates policy), thus giving approval to both of the competing methods (only one of which Nickptar and FOo support). <i>(To quote you again, putting my reply in context)</i> <b>"It's the same category error GordonWatts made..."</b> I made no error in my general theory: If I failed, it was either because (in my case) I was not qualified -or because the voters (in their case) did not follow policy (or both; error on both sides is most likely). We also remember, Calton, how you deleted one small paragraph in the Terri Schiavo article and asserted that it belonged in the legal sub-article -when, in fact, you never really thought this was true (or else you would have moved it there after deleting) -and furthermore, how you deleted that paragraph selectively whilst leaving alone the paragraphs above and below in, also legal paragraphs. Your disruption, according to the edit comments of the FA-editor, Raul654 (Mark) were partly responsible for him deciding to lock the article, and your excuse about "vanity links" was not justified, since I had removed from plain view all questionable links; Anything I left in hidden comments is at my discretion, since that is the proper place to put disputed material -and, certainly that was an issue in dispute.</dd>
<dd>Before you opine on another person, first make sure your behavior is justified and polite: If you were serious about placing legal comments in the sub-article, for example, you would have removed <i>all</i> of the legal paragraphs, and placed them in the article yourself -not merely deleting one section and refusing to move it to the section you said it belonged, which I add so you know I wasn't telling you that you "were wrong" without also suggestion a "proposed correction" in your action.--<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordonWatts_0d94.html" title="User:GordonWatts">GordonWatts</a> 06:06, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>If you wanted to argue that "consensus creates policy" and hence non-notability is a deletion criterion, you would have to demonstrate that there is a demonstrated consensus that notability is a deletion criterion. I don't think you'll manage that.

I agree with FOo. I think a lot of AfDs have gotten me thinking about the process though - even ones that are obvious deletes I think maybe should be userfied more. Often, I think that it is rather harsh to see it get deleted, especially when its in good faith. Also, I would like to point out that the difference in % between regulars (like myself) and non-regulars is obvious - generally non-regulars only vote to keep certain articles, often when petitioned to by someone else. Also, the high % delete thing is really too relative to judge a person on, as often people just vote delete on everything and there are a lot more bad ones (many obvious spam) then good ones. There are some regulars like Kappa who are rather, um, extreme inclusionists that go mainly to VfD to vote keep. Its just a different thought process between those who go to VfD to delete bad articles (like me) and those who go to VfD to save the potentially good ones (like Kappa) - that's why its important that it be a discussion so people can be convinced of an articles worth/uselessness. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 00:46, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not to scapegoat, but this is exactly the problem. Somewhere along the line, people began using the judgment of "usefulness" and, particularly, "worthyness." It sounds like we're picking people to put on the rescue boat - is this article worthy of being saved. And there's no reason to do that. The onus isn't on articles to prove their worthiness. It's on people to show why an article harms the project - to show why it's so bad that we'd be better off just removing it instead of fixing it or letting it stand with a stub tag or a cleanup tag. That so many people have lost sight of that is appalling to me. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 01:21, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Snowspinner, this isn't the place to rehash deletionist/inclusionist debates. Bringing that up is a distraction from the issue here, which is one of a group of consensus discussions .... and an administrator who chose to seize veto power over those discussions and shut them down. Administrators aren't supposed to hold veto power over the consensus of Wikipedia editors, and aren't supposed to shut down discussions because they don't approve of the consensus that is forming. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 02:24, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just looked at CSD A7, and the voting and debate that went with it. I noticed considerable support for it. I noticed that it has been widely used and largely successful in its goal. I see that sometimes it malfunctions, but that to err is human and that to fix is easy. I see non-notability as such a popular deletion criterion that, in extremis, we delete it on sight. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:34, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A7 has worked out well, no doubt.

Someone writes an article about a private boat, clearly that's a non-notable <i>biography</i> and so can be speedied.

<dd>It's my suggestion that being accepted <i>would</i> make it "official policy" -- as official as it gets here, outside of core policies decreed by the folks who own the servers (i.e. Jimbo and the Board).</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There isn't anything else <i>but</i> decree or consensus that can make something "official" here. Wikipedia isn't a democracy, so the act of holding a vote doesn't itself create policy; we use voting to ascertain whether a consensus exists; and the <i>consensus</i> determines policy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Policy emerges by being what people are willing to follow and to defend. We write policy proposals to see if we can gather consensus around new ideas. We make sure that existing consensus gets written up as guidelines so that newcomers and the perplexed can have a chance to understand the rules that other editors are going by. We hold votes to make sure that what we <i>think</i> is consensus actually <i>is</i> consensus. (That last bit is why Tony Sidaway is mostly-right above: a demonstration of consensus <i>is</i> needed. A proposal and vote would be one such demonstration. The facts of what is presently accepted on AfD are a different such demonstration.)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So if everyone (for some value of "everyone" -- consensus doesn't mean unanimity) takes a given AfD vote as binding, then that <i>makes</i> it policy. (Likewise, if everyone thinks that admins shouldn't delete discussions, then that makes <i>that</i> policy, too.) --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 02:46, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's why I asked, official policy comes from a process that attempts to form a consensus via discussion over a period of time (the recent CSD updates for example), and not because somethings been an accepted practice for some amount of time. At least that's how I understand it...I guess I'd be worried if official policy can be created without some community discussion that works toward a consensus before that policy is accepted. <a href="../../../r/x/_/User%7ERx_StrangeLove_2537.html" title="User:Rx StrangeLove">Rx StrangeLove</a> 03:14, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is my view that there is general consensus that a subject must be notable in order for it to have an article on <i>Wikipedia</i>. I point to the recent discussion at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_reform_Brainstorming_ae6d.html#Remove_notable_requirement" title="Wikipedia:Deletion reform/Brainstorming">Wikipedia:Deletion reform/Brainstorming#Remove notable requirement</a> where it was suggested as part of proposed reforms of the deletion process that this requirement be removed. The overwhelming agreement on those who have commented is that notability <b>is</b> now a requirement and that it should remain one. And I note that these discussions, as part of the deletion reform proposal, are likely to be didproportionaly viewed by people who think the entire current deletion process is "broken" -- but of course they are even more disproportionatly likely to be viewed by people who have a significant interest in the deletion process and deletion policy.</p>
<p>I cite additional support for my view that there is a consensus that non-notable subjects should not have articles, even if they are verifiable. There is a general agreement that bands not meeting the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria should not be the subjects of articels, and that such articles, when they are created, should be deleted. Such articles are almost always deleted at AfD, and a proposal to make this a speedy delete criterion got majority supoort (but not consensus, in significant part due to issues about definition and explicit reliance on a non-policy page). Many such bands are verifiable, but the issue of verifibility pretty muich never comes up in AfD debates on such bands, it is always an issue of notability.</p>
<p>The subject of <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> A7 have been discussed elsewhere including on AN/I. it is new, and it has been somewhat contentions, and it IMO needs clearer support standards. But when there have been disputes they have been over what is or is not notable, or over what consitutes a "claim" of notability. No one has been arguing that biographies of non-notable people ought to be retained.</p>
<p>Indeed, does anyone <b>really</b> argue that verifiable but <b>admittedly non-notable</b> subjects should have articles here? To borrow an example recently used on VfU, my <b>left shoe</b> is verifiable, (I can send you a picture if you like) but does anyone really want an article about it? Consider a thunderstom that occured in New Jersey in 2004. It is esily verifiable -- I can produce newspaper reports. But should there be an article on wikipedia on every storm that got newspaper coverage? Or to be a little more reasonable, consider me. I was, earlier this year, an unsuccessful candidate for local elected office. This is verifiable -- there were quite a number of newspaper stories local and regional about the campaign. I have previously been the chair of a professional sub-orgianization (<a href="../../../a/c/m/ACM_0d8f.html" title="ACM">ACM</a>'s SIGAPL) and have published professional papers and edited professional conference proceedings. This is easily verifiable. Still I am probably not notable (I wouldn't meet my own standards on AfD) Should there be David E. Siegel? Would you vote to delete it on AfD? If not, why not?</p>
<p>I would argue that if a subject is not notable, an article about it is <b>not encyclopedic</b>, because an encyclopedia only has articles about notable subjects. It is is certianly policy that wikipedia includes only encyclopedic articles. Notability is really just a shorthand for encyclopediacicty, or more accurately, it is one criterion for encyclopediacicty (verifibility is another, as is a factual tone).</p>
<p>So I think that notability is a current requirement for being the subject of a wikipedia article, and it should be -- even though there is not always clear consensus on what constitutes notability, and like any other critierion of inclusion or deletion, it can be abused. Thus I feel that unilaterally deleting AfD pages where non-notability was cited as a reason for nomination, or ignoring AfD votes that site non-notability as a reason, is against consensus and therefore violates policy. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:37, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That twenty people are violating the deletion policy in concert makes more of a violation, not less of one, and that's time for an admin to step in IMO - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 15:44, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But my arguement is that in nominting articles for deletion on the grounds that the subjects are "not notable", people are upholding policy, not violating it. I refer to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, a <b>policy</b> page, where it says "<i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia.</i>" and "<i>Subjects of encyclopedia articles must have a claim to fame besides being fondly remembered by their friends and relatives.</i>" and "<i>Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame, achievement, or perhaps notoriety.</i>" and <i>When you wonder what should or should not be in an article named "whatever", ask yourself what a reader would expect under "whatever" <b>in an encyclopedia</b>.</i> ". I argue that those statements effectvely support a notability requirement.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, when you say "That twenty people are violating the deletion policy in concert..." it sounds like a conspiricy, not the result of free and open discusion, by many editors in good standing here whose opnions on this issue generally agree on this point. Expressing the opnion that a page ought to be deelted does not violate any policy that I can think of, even if the reason are not in line with the current deletion policy. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:22, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's about it. All of these people with apparent brain damage who cling so desperately to their cruft that they are willing to shout "notability isn't in the policy page, so it has to be kept!" are noxious. 1. "Notability" as a magic word lost out in reaching 80% (or whatever astronomical figure the most petulant want to set for it now) to be "consensus," but this does not mean that an article cannot be nominated for lacking notability. 2. "Notability" is just a word. What that word <i>refers to</i> is a whole set of attributes that could also be called "encyclopedic." It's a vague term and a tautological one (to be notable, one must be worthy of noticing, and to note them in the encyclopedia they should be note-able), so it's no wonder it failed to get consensus. <b>However</b> what most of those nominating on those grounds mean by "notable" is fully and fairly covered by several other parts of the deletion policy. 3. It is no one's right to delete the VfD listings wholesale. Neither Snowspinner nor Kappa nor Taco Deposit nor I gets to say that the nominators have no rights to make the nominations. That is anti-democratic and anti-Wikipedia. They would silence nominators to preserve the rights of bad authors, it seems. They fight for peace, censor for liberty, shout for silence. 4. If the nomination was on the grounds of "not notable," so what? Why be so damned afraid of VfD and the sense of the editors that you have to prevent discussion? That's a sure sign that you don't belong here, if you think that The People will delete what should not be deleted and that they cannot read the policy. 5. Ignore the word used by the nominator. Snowspinner already read and assessed for himself when the wrong word was used and something could be speedied. Why, then, did his reading skills fail him in the other cases? Most of the time, those who use "not notable" are really saying, "Too granular an article" or "Does not meet the standards of WP:MUSIC/BIO/Whatever" or "Unverifiable" or "Ephemera." Reading for the magic word so that you can unlist the nomination is being a jerk. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:34, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Steady on geogre, have you read <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>? On the subject of deletion criteria, not the least problem with "notability" is that it's so unreliable as a factor in nominations. Twenty-five "non-notable" elementary school articles were listed for deletion on 21st of last month. Not one single article was deleted--this set against the general 75% deletion rate of articles listed on AfD. Overall, 89% of school articles listed for deletion, the vast majority of which have been listed on grounds of "non-notability", have been kept this year. Add to this the fact that it's ruled out as a deletion criterion, and that editors still have the option to merge (as the deletion policy says they should) I really don't see what's anti-wiki here. What's more wiki-ish than merging content? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:35, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>George is right, notability is a collective name for a group of article properties. The only reason why the schools are kept is that it's still a big debate whether they deserve articles. Some say schools deserve articles, others say, while education is a noble thing, schools aren't really that remarkable. In this regard I feel too many people vote delete instead of merge with would put the school in context and enhance some Rambot stubs at the same time. Still, the fact notability of schools is contentious doesn't mean it's faulty in itself with regard to websites or people it's often quite accurate. If people where to use their time and craft nominations of more than one line, they could explain why they feel it needs deleted, by citing outside sources and policy instead of just saying "nn, delete" - a useful nomination needs to explain WHY the subject is non-notable according to the nominator. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:28, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, Geogre is absolutely spot on. Snowspinner's actions are anti-Wikipedia because they ignore three basic tenets: that Be Bold relates to article content, not to the overall shape of the project, that consensus for significant steps is required for the project to prosper, and, most important of all, that the primary aim of the project is the creation of an encyclopaedia, not a big book of everything. The recent series of assaults on AfD are nothing more or less than an attempt, conscious or otherwise, to undermine this last goal. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">The kettle's on</a> 09:32, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Further, as we see above, this is <b>all about the schools.</b> That's ridiculous. Stop debating schools by unlisting, undeleting, and destroying the process of deletion debate. Stop using schools as a reason for agreeing or disagreeing with unlisting nominations. MGM is, of course, right that nominators shouldn't be in the habit of "nn, delete" as nominations, but if the brevity and sloppiness of the nomination is really an issue then Snowspinner would have been best by <b>putting a note</b> on the nomination saying that it needs to be <i>improved.</i> I also think that "be bold" should be stricken everywhere it occurs, as it's clear now that it is the excuse used by every vandal, the plea of every abuser of policy, and the credo of every thug on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:00, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Eventually, Wikipedia will become the private playground of smug and self-elected point-scorers.

<p>IMO it iks time to reconsider the legal threat policy. Wikipedia has grown sufficiently mature to deal with such cases in a non-panic way. Cleary, such threats are issued either by legally ignorant nervous people or by trolls. The latter ones must be done as usual, while the former ones must be politely recommended to consult a lawyer. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:59, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree for a couple of reasons. First of all, although Wikipedia has grown and matured, I don't believe the Foundation has a legal defense fund to speak of. So an actual lawsuit could well still hurt a lot. Second of all, many legal threats are not issued against the Foundation, but against individual contributors - they serve as a particularly brutal chill on discussion. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 18:23, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I would say so for legal threats. In general, an editor blocked (solely) for making a legal threat should be able to withdraw the threat and return to being a positive contributor. They can email the blocking admin or make a posting to the mailing list. Editors who repeatedly make and withdraw legal threats should probably be shown the door, however.</dd>
<dd>I don't think I would be as forgiving with threats of physical harm—such situations tend to be rather complicated, however, and I would tend to look at them on a case-by-case basis. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 02:53, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Threats should be instant bans. Why? Because 1) They obviously aren't tests; 2) You have to be suitably intelligent to make them, and therefore know what you are doing; and 3) they have demonstrated a blatant disrespect for Wikipedia by feeling the right to threaten it.

<dd>I checked all 42 edits, and only saw 2 or 3 that could be considered anything but vandalism (other than a couple that were self-reversions). Seems reasonable to me to do a block.

<dd>Yeah, but you might also be seriously inconveniencing good editors. Remember, the vandals generally don't bother to log in, whereas the good editors do, so their edits don't show up in the IP's contributions. I think it'd be more effective to scare the little students some by blocking them when they're vandalising. That way the block can be shorter, plus the added shock factor of it actually being a direct reaction to their vandalism. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 23:08, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well. We can spend all week bickering on whether we should blame Snowspinner, or blame the people who blame Snowspinner, or blame those who blame those... - well, you get the idea.</p>
<p>Or, we could consider that AFD is unwieldy, bureaucratic, factionalizing and generally unpleasant, and find some way to fix that. Looking over AFD it is obvious that the vast majority of nominations don't need the debate - many end up as unanimous deletes; many others get a plethora of keeps because the nominator overlooked something, or the article had a source added; and yet many others are actually nominated for NPOV'izing, merging, or renaming and don't need AFD.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the latter, I would suggest this extremely simple deletion system...</p>
<ol>
<li>If you want some article deleted, for whatever reason, edit it to add {{subst:SomeDeletionTemplate|reason}}.</li>
<li>If someone else disagrees, they can edit the article and remove the template. End of story.</li>
<li>No edit warring - no user is allowed to place that template on the same article twice.</li>
<li>If the template remains in place for some specific period of time, the article may be summarily deleted by any admin.</li>
</ol>
<p>To ensure that this works, the template should add the article to Category:Deletion 4-10-2005, and a bot should update the template each day to point it to the new date. Advantages? Less bureaucracy. Less room for violent debate. Less chance of a cabalistic subculture. Less backlogs. And it requires no software upgrade. Disadvantages? It doesn't work on articles that are sock-supported or controversial, and it may be necessary to have some process to get rid of those. That process should not be invoked until this simple process has been tried and failed a couple of times.</p>
<p>Similar processes have been proposed in the past, but to my knowledge none as simple as this. It makes deletion easier if nobody objects, and makes it harder in case of controversy. Both seem like a good thing to me. I've crossposted this to Snowy's RFC since it seems very relevant there. Anyone who concurs should feel free to turn this into an official proposal on some other page, and discuss and advertise it.</p>

<li>Sock puppets are bad enough in AfD as is, but in a proposal like this it gives them full control to remove the tag. Even if sockpuppets are not allowed then you'll have meaningless editwars with them. At least at AfD they give somewhat entertaining "opinions".</li>
<li>What about the creators of the page? 99% of the AfDed stuff is complete vanity anyway. Or stuff from "organizations" seeking publicity on WP?</li>
<li>In addition it makes it even easier to people to fool others and keep annoying stuff like original research. If that stuff is kept, then at the least it leads to edit wars etc. to get that original research into otherwise good articles.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like I said, I think we should try and address both the over-deleted articles and the ones that get kept for no good reason... I don't know, maybe we can work out the kinks in it, but as is it sounds like it needs a lot of work.... what do you think? <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 22:50, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this should be tried... but will fail utterly. As RN says, you'll get crazy edit wars, and a higher percentage of crap being kept. I can't see how ANY deletion system could possibly avoid the problems of AFD, other than "admins can delete anything they feel like", and it's pretty obvious what's wrong with that.... <b>Any method of getting community consensus requires discussion, and deletion is such a controversial area that discussion will inevitably lead to rancor and hurt feelings.</b> This is why I oppose deletion reform unless it's a <i>really damn good idea</i>. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 23:03, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Like I said above - if a deletion is controversial (as evidenced by edit warring and/or sockpuppetry) then some other system will have to be used. Possibly the current AFD, for lack of a better idea. But this simple system will deal with at least 80% of its load, and remove much of its bickering. For instance, User:A nominates some article stating it's "unverifiable". Then User:B removes the tag and adds a link that verifies it (yes, he could just untag it, but since he knows about the subject it's easy for him to add a line or two). Then A is happy and the article is better. And still no bureaucracy. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 23:16, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, if highly-debated deletions are sent somewhere else this idea could get load of AFD. The only problem I see is vandals and article creators removing tags when no one is keeping an eye on the article. Categories don't allow for a central place to check changes to article nominated for deletion. Vandals would, in some cases, be able to remove tags without being discovered for ages. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:39, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I've been giving some thought to this, and thought I'd come up with something, but I now see that I have been re-inventing the wheel. However, what I was working on was a varient of what Radient has above, with afd relegated to a 'disputed deletions' to deal with cases where tages are removed - that means we get all the unanimous stuff (which not even the creator or Kappa want to keep out of the system). I've set down my thoughts <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_workshop_deletions_6d60.html" title="User:Doc glasgow/workshop/deletions">here</a>, if anyone is interested - but perhaps we need to take this debare elsewhere. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 23:31, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>(after edit conflict with Doc) Personally, I don't think that the above system (referring to the proposal above Doc's comment) will work. When would an admin delete the articles? AfD regulars, in addition, would have to go to each article and spend time removing a tag. Where would discussion go? In addition, what if a vandal just went through every AfD and removed the tag? It would require double the amount of work by someone else to re-add the tag, and the vandal could again remove the tags, claiming that he's doing so in good faith. Instead, I've given this some thought and come up with my own proposal:</li>

<dd>The ease of removing tags with no easy way to stop vandalous removals is my main objection, but <i>"in addition, would have to go to each article and spend time removing a tag."</i> shouldn't be a real problem.

<li>I cannot see the merit in this suggestion, as it replaces such debate as ther now is with uncommented removal of a tag. IMHO, AfD is exactly as "unwieldy, bureaucratic, factionalizing and generally unpleasant" as it needs to be to do what is, of necessity, an unpleasant but vital job. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">The kettle's on</a> 14:04, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I would strongly oppose this or any varient. It doesn't afford the encouragement to ahve the kind of useful discussion thar AFD now often fosters, and in a case at all controversial, it could lead to worse waring than the curreht system. leat us suppose that User puts a delete tag on, or for example, a school article. User A slos list the articel on a sub-page of his user page "Articles i have taged for deletion". User B removes the tag. User C reads A's page and restores the tag. User D removes it. Note that the end result is quite deeltionist -- if there is one more user who wants the articel delted than kept, the tag will wind up staying on -- thus we have an akward system that results in deltion by a simple majority vote, and that also favors organized groups focused on deletion or preservatio far maore than Afd does now.

Yes, edit wars over deletion tags will occur, but edit wars occur every day over everything else, and our dispute-resolution processes somehow manage to resolve them. Why should it be any easier or more difficult to delete an entire article than it is to delete a section of an article? It seems to me that we should use the exact same methods--and, when disputes arise, the exact same dispute-resolution methods--for both. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 01:59, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>1. The current AfD system would be kept, with a subpage for each date.</li>
<li>2. However, once consensus has been reached (i.e. there are 4 or 5 delete votes with no keep votes, or vice versa) an admin can close the AfD and either delete of keep the article. This would relieve the backlog at AfD, as the vast majority of the cases don't need a five day period to reach consensus.</li>
<li>3. Of course, the admin can always leave the debate open.</li>
<li>4. Another radical proposal: once an AfD is closed, the subpage should be removed from the day's log. This would make voting of AfD easier, and would also reduce the gigantic pages we have for AfDs. The disadvantage of this would be that there would be no one place to have the record; however, someone can easily check the history of the page.</li>

<p>I don't think it's reasonable to rapidly close an AfD just because the first few people who vote happen to agree. Many people simply don't check Wikipedia more often than once a day. So there's a statistical likelihood, under that sort of system, that AfDs would be closed before people who know the article and the subject have the chance to weigh in. Likewise, closing an AfD after only a few votes makes it more likely that a clique can create an AfD and fill it up with a few votes, then declare "consensus" and shut down discussion before anyone else has a chance to contribute.</p>
<p>Another major disadvantage of rapidly closing non-<a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD</a> AfDs is that many articles get <i>improved substantially</i> while under AfD. The current five-day course of an AfD gives article contributors a chance to prove that the subject of an article is notable and worthwhile (or, at least <i>exists</i>) by improving the article, adding citations, and so forth. Closing AfDs more quickly means throwing away this chance for improvement on many articles. That would disrupt a process which presently leads to <i>better</i> articles. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a></p>

<dd>I'd amend this proposal to say that AfD which have five(?) delete votes <b>and</b> no keep votes after two(?) days can be deleted. This way, if someone wants to do a rewrite, he can always vote "<b>Keep</b> I will attempt a rewrite -~~~~" or similar, and a bunch of people wouldn't be able to bring down the article in five minutes if they were fast - this is only targeted at stuff noone wants to keep anyway, but which for some reason isn't speedyable. Of course, someone could just go through and vote keep on everything to thwart this, but I'm being naive and assuming that no dickery will be involved. Also, I wouldn't remove the listing from the log if it's closed early, but maybe change ther transclusion to a simple wikilink. --<span style="font-family:monospace">&#160;<a href="../../../g/r/m/User%7EGrm_wnr_b9ae.html" title="User:Grm wnr">grm_wnr</a></span> <a href="../../../g/r/m/User_talk%7EGrm_wnr_e8bc.html" title="User talk:Grm wnr"><span style="border:1px solid;color:black;font-size:9px;padding:2px 1px 0px 1px">Esc</span></a> 17:09, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At the moment, I'm dealing with a difficult new user, User:Readallaboutit. Please read <a href="../../../r/e/a/User_talk%7EReadallaboutit_2390.html" title="User talk:Readallaboutit">User talk:Readallaboutit</a> for a history of my attempts to help them with editing. Unstructured lists instead of sentences, edits to apparently irrelevant articles, adding the same content over and over to multiple articles, copyvios, you name it, they're doing it. They appear to be ignoring all attempts to communicate via their talk page. I am now having difficulties maintaining civility, and beginning to wonder whether their behavior is more like vandalism than there being a mere content dispute.

<dd>I see the newbie has never edited a talk page. It's frustrating to get no response, of course, but at least it leaves room for supposing they're incompetent rather than aggressive, and they don't seem to be reverting your cleanup. The impression isn't of non-native or dyslexia issues, or a child writing, or carelessness either, but simply an adult native speaker in the UK, with, uh, poor writing skills. I guess it doesn't help to ask someone to write grammatically if they aren't able to. I don't think there is any intentional vandalism, but how about a short block just the same, to get their attention? They'd see the block reason when they tried to edit next, right? I'm thinking it could read "Sorry, but you need to reply to the comments on your discussion page before you edit any more articles". (Yes, why do we have tabs called "discussion" which lead to pages we always refer to as "talk"&#160;? It has to be confusing for noobs.) <b>I'll do that in a while, if nobody objects below.</b></dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, my own cruel elitist view is that Wikipedia would lose if competent editors who're cheerfully contributing text of their own right now [hastily: I am, actually!!] should instead spend the time rewriting Readallaboutit's contributions. So you probably need to walk away, The Anome! But might there be editors out there whose creative juices are running low at the moment, who would like to "copyedit" these edits (though it seems a weak word)? UK editors for choice. I appreciate that the misspelled names are a big problem, and it's unfortunate that the new contributor has discovered category pages... but apart from that, it's mostly possible to tell what they <b>mean</b>. --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 15:11, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>Active editors have a responsibility to respond to legitimate enquiries about the edits they're making. It's a fundamental part of how wikipedians work together and collaborate. An editor who makes controversial edits but never responds is causing a problem, even if inadvertently.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, he has to respond. If he doesn't, I would go so far as to say you could block him, with the block message saying something to the effect of "I will unblock you as soon as you post an acknowledgement on [[User talk:Readallaboutit]]". This will clarify whether he's ignoring you or simply clueless. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 04:42, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>He's already been warned once. If he does it again, ask him to communicate on the talk page and notice that he's going against concensus. If he does it again after that, give a final warning. If he still doesn't listen then, I'd be happy about this person being blocked. The current info on his talk page doesn't say why his reverts aren't appreciated. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:42, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
