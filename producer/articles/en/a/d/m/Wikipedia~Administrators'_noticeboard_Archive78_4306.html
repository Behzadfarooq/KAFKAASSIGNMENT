<p>I have little experience in dealing with the controversial nature of a discussion <a href="../../../s/o/u/Talk%7ESouth_Tyrol_225e.html#Requested_move" title="Talk:South Tyrol">such as this</a>, and I wondered if a more experienced hand at dealing with it could take a look. As a summary, most users seem to agree that the name South Tyrol has got to go. However, the conversation has dissolved into discussing and straw polling into creating up to four forks for the article. A move is agreed, but to what name? Miles to go.

I've excluded the latest ones, which at least have comments stating why they are on the list, and added links to show "mainspace" and "all" linksearch. I did not do this with the expectation of anyone but me reviewing it, but it is going to take a looooong time so if anyone else wants to help please do pitch in. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:29, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Splendid idea Guy. I've started reviewing some of the pages. I think a bit of context for the netfirms batch is in order... when the netfirms domain was blacklisted a while back there was consern that the many legitimate sites being referenced or linked to. Since there was a huge number of them it was decided that all the pages currently being linked to from articles on wikipedia would be "grandfathered" in. However, a careful review of those pages isn't a bad idea. Since the blacklisting/whitelisting many of those pages have gone dead or the outbound links have been replaced.</dd>
<dd>As some have noticed Eagle and myself have worked fairly hard to catchup on the backlog on that page. Any help in keeping an eye on the page would be appreciated. It may not be obvious at a glance, but the whitelist is an important tool in our anti-spam efforts. It can help turn the blacklist from a sword into a scalpel. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 06:44, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_d_foy.html" title="Brian d foy">brian d foy</a> (previously at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_D._Foy_019d.html" title="Brian D. Foy">Brian D.

There was the issue that a lot of the support arguments were made by anonymous users and uses with very few edits, but I was sure to take that into account. Now, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">User:Chriscf</a> has come to me saying that my conclusion that there was consensus is incorrect: <a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html#brian_d_foy" title="User talk:Enochlau">User talk:Enochlau#brian_d_foy</a>. I've discussed it a little with him, and I still think that there was consensus, and I respect his disagreement with my decision - but I would like some more feedback. Without commenting on whether the article should be at one title or another, I was wondering if other administrators could comment on whether they think there is consensus to move, or whether it should be "no consensus" or even consensus to keep at the old name. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 02:30, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm going to chip in here, so as not to feel like I'm pressuring Enochlau on their talk page. To cut a long story short, this is my perspective on it:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#Identity" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS#Identity</a> refers to words people use to describe themselves, and the only thing you could derive from it about name is that if someone has a professional alias and prefers to be so referred, we use that (e.g. use of "<a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_John_16de.html" title="Elton John">Elton John</a>" vs "Reg Dwight" - in this case, we include the meaningless "D", as we have for <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_E_Grant_adbb.html" title="Richard E Grant">Richard E Grant</a>).</li>
<li>Mention of <a href="../../../n/c/o/WP%7ENCON_841b.html" title="WP:NCON">WP:NCON</a> is a red herring since semantically the two forms are identical - it is only the rendering in capitals or lower-case that was contested at the move.</li>
<li>The examples that were provided were themselves anomalous (one was even <a href="../../../f/i/r/FIREHOSE_56ad.html" title="FIREHOSE">incorrect</a>), and were cited by supporters of the move as "precedent" - the exception was put forward as being the rule.</li>
<li>With all things considered, the only arguments left were "Support, brian prefers it that way" vs. "Oppose, per the rules of English".</li>
<li>As far as I am aware, judging the consensus position on Wikipedia involves weighing up the <i>arguments</i>, not the <i>numbers</i> (such that 200 turkeys cannot block one person's proposal in favour of Christmas).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>This just about sums it up. I'm also somewhat confused, since I also don't know where we go when a <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> comes out clearly wrong. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 02:49, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The most relevant guideline is <a href="../../../n/c/p/WP%7ENCP_6217.html" title="WP:NCP">WP:NCP</a>, not the MoS. You can boil our naming conventions down to "the most common name of a person or thing that does not conflict with the names of other people or things" (I'm quoting that directly). While not specifically addressing pen names that contravene grammar, it does specify that pen names should be used rather than legal names if that is what the person is better known as, which I think is the case here. At any rate, enochlau asked us to chime in on whether he/she read the consensus correctly, and I believe that it was. With all due respect Chris, the arguments in favor were not invalid, as it appears you believe (?) — in fact, most were directly in line with the naming conventions.

<dd>Well, a deleted page notice appears for that too, it is coded into the interface. I suppose you will need to create the page, and blank it if you really want to avoid the deleted page message.

<dd>That is enough <tt>:)</tt>. Is there an actual need for protection at all then? Why not just delete the page?

<dd>All of these users were created <b>from a single account</b>. If you go from Johnny89 you can get to Jack Odadjian through the creation of other usernames by an account, not an IP.

<li>This seems to demonstrate that updating a block to an IP only block should not be done lightly. I notice the IP in question was blocked via checkuser and had a block message indicating not to unblock without reference to the blocking admins, I would guess if this had been done they would have said not to believe the sob stories from that IP. The second part of this is that the IP only block takes precedence over any auto blocks, hence the ability to perpetuate this without being impacted by autoblocks. Don't think that changing to IP only is a low risk option, it isn't. It also shows another issue, but per <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> I won't reveal that just yet --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 16:30, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Though I am no legal expert, I believe that child pornography is defined in American law as visual depictions of minors in explicit sexual acts (or similar wording). These do not resemble overt sexual depictions, and hence are not legally defined as child porn. I am in no way defending or lawyering on child porn, however. —<sup><a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhysicq210_4b59.html" title="User talk:Physicq210"><font color="#000000">210</font></a></sup><b><a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0" face="Comic Sans MS">physicq</font></a></b> (<i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Physicq210_25e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0">c</font></a></i>) 02:35, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Acording to United States vs. Dost the six qualifiers are.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genital, pubic or anal areas</li>
<li>whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity</li>
<li>whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child</li>
<li>whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude</li>
<li>whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity</li>
<li>whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that qualifiers 1,2,3,4,in my opinion 5, and in my opinion 6. Due to this I belive that It constitues child pornography.

<dd>Geesh, I'm not trying to be rude. It's my view that folks who would view random images of naked kids as objects of sexual interest have issues. It was a general statement, don't blame me that Hesperian decided to jump in after the fact and turn it into something personal with his first comment on the subject. Take a step back and consider what I found here, ... enwikipedia going nuts and talking about urgently calling the office over some 130 year old photographs. You might not agree with me that it's ridiculous, but I hope you can understand why I might see it that way. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 04:58, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Firstly, your original statement was "you'd have to be a quite a pervert to see anything sexual about his pictures of children." That's light years away from "folks who would view random images of naked kids as objects of sexual interest have issues". Its easy to accuse someone of over-reacting if you revise your brutal attack down to a perfectly reasonable statement.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, sometimes I see these discussions and think "Gosh, that user is protesting way too much; maybe has some personal issues there" or whatnot... but that ain't nowhere near publicly declaring folks to be perverts. As for me "turning it into something personal", you don't get to claim the moral high ground just because your attack was originally aimed at anyone and everyone who is worried about these images. All I did was give your target a face by publicly declaring myself to be one of the people you're attacking.</dd>

<dd>I think it would be important to note that these photos are well over 130 years old. That being said, the general purpose of the child pornography laws is to protect the children. These laws were created in the 1990's and given that the subjects of these photos would be at least 135 years old (and thus are long gone), I don't feel that this qualifies as "child pornography". Also since the works could be works of art and in the public domain only compounds the unlikeliness. Per the info above, in my opinion, I feel <s>only</s> maybe number 3 (and obviously number 4) apply, but I still don't think it qualifies. <sub>Disclaimer: I'm no lawyer.</sub> <b>--<a href="../../../m/p/d/User%7EMPD01605_77c2.html" title="User:MPD01605"><font style="color: #000099">M</font><font style="color: #FF0000">PD</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../m/p/d/User_talk%7EMPD01605_0e7e.html" title="User talk:MPD01605">T</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPD01605_89a1.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPD01605">C</a></sup></b> 04:25, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you serious?

<p>I really honestly don't see any big deal here. These pictures are 130 years old.

<p>Per UBeR above, "I believe we are drifting further and further off the issue at hand," let's get back to actual thougths. I really appreciate the citation from <i>United States vs. Dost</i>. Unfortunately, criteria #2, #3, #5 and #6 are rather subjective. Arguably the visual depiction <i>is</i> sexually suggestive, but arguably it is not. Opinions can be tossed back and forth, but how is this defined objectively? Criterion #3 is a bit less subjective; personally, I feel that the children, who seem to be standing in somewhat natural poses, are not necessarily in unnatural poses. I consider criterion #5 kind of as a double standard: the children do seem coy, but not willing to or leading up to engagement in sexual activity. Criterion #6 is also subjective: I personally did not feel a sexual response to the images, but I can see that someone -- for whatever reason, or maybe simply not because of any particular reason -- could feel a sexual response. In general, I think that because these images are important artistically and historically, the Wikimedia Foundation or the uploaders of the photographs should not worry about pending litigation. Arguably the images are child pornography, but arguably they are not. It is inappropriate to enforce one's values on others -- and, as is apparent, some people consider these images pornographic and others do not -- and since these are not as blatant as children engaged in sexual activity, I consider it appropriate not to delete them.

<p>I would like everyone to consider this. I have a content dispute over Politkovskaya article with user Biophys. I have inserted criticism of Politkovskaya which was constantly deleted by Biophys who claims that it violates BLP policies, although the source is respectable Russian newspaper published in English - <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow_News_b33c.html" title="Moscow News">Moscow News</a>. Afterwards, article was rightly protected by Alex Bakharev who wrote that we should reach consensus.</p>
<p>Then, here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Biophys&amp;oldid=114456838#Other_important_edits" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Biophys&amp;oldid=114456838#Other_important_edits" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Biophys&amp;oldid=114456838#Other_important_edits</a>, Biophys wrote that Politkovskaya article "(***) Articles currently vandalized by a wikistalker. Please help!".</p>
<p>Moreover, Biophys has a long history of bad relations with me. His friend Colchicum filed the RfC on me here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Vlad_fedorov" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Vlad_fedorov" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Vlad_fedorov</a>, but it failed, since their third collegue had withdrawn his signature, after administrators wrote comments not supporting their allegations.</p>
<p>Could anyone stop this witchhunt waged by Biophys? When I add something to the article he deletes it and writes it violates BLP policy, or writes it is unreliable source. It's really stupid, my sources are awlays wrong and unreliable, according to Biophys. And everything I do here - he's calling vandalism, just see his edit comments where he adds comments like "rv vandalism by Vlad fedorov" and etc. <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 04:50, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What on earth is your purpose in posting that here? It appears to be someone putting together an Rfc in their namespace, a very good idea, as one can organize, edit, and consider whether or not to proceed while doing so. In many cases editors decide not to file and simply blank or delete these "draft" Rfc's. As it is not yours, you cannot be asking for assistance in how to write an Rfc. I sincerely hope you are not trying to aggravate the situation by drawing attention to this before it is filed.

<p>As you probably know, the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_noticeboard_e3f8.html" title="Wikipedia:Community noticeboard">Wikipedia:Community noticeboard</a> is a reasonably new noticeboard. Its purpose is somewhat unclear; it would seem that most topics there would belong just as easily on the village pump, or the admin board. Several people have pointed this out on the talk page, and suggested it be shut down. Now obviously we need noticeboards with a variety of functions, but it seems to me we should have a good discussion about which boards those should be, before we get a bunch of redundant boards. Having a lot of unclear-purpose boards encourage misposts, crossposts, and divergent discussion, and confuse people and force people to needlessly look in multiple places.</p>
<p>In <s>a fit of insanity</s> an attempt to get people to talk, I've posted a 'temporarily suspended' notice on the board, and protected it because I thought someone would blindly that <small>(indeed, someone did while I was typing the protection summary)</small>. Please let us discuss to create a useful set of noticeboards, for clarity's sake. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 11:55, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rather, there's no consensus for having that board in the first place, as indicated on its talk page. Like I said above, I protected the page to get a good discussion on what boards we need, and to prevent people from having to look in multiple places for topics. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 11:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>This really is bloody silly. The community noticeboard was opened as a place to discuss community sanctions, rather than have them on the admin noticeboard where there is an implication that only admins have suffrage. There have been several productive discussions on there, and ArbCom appears comfortable with the existence of the board and the use to which it is put. I am goign to boldly unprotect it, which will not stop the discussion from proceeding. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 12:33, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The primary function of the community noticeboard is proposing and discussing <b>community bans</b>. This used to be done on ANI, with its crowdedness, vertiginously fast archiving and, as Guy says, it's unfortunate implication that only admins have suffrage. WP:CN is perfect for its purpose, and ensures that the important and sometimes lengthy ban discussions don't get lost in the crowd on the Pump. Don't fix it, it ain't broke.

<p>The board recently went up on <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMFD_9ce3.html" title="WP:MFD">WP:MFD</a> and the result was <i>early and speedy keep</i> plus an apology from the nominator. Unilateral suspension and protection are way out of line, and under these circumstances the action is unseemly. If I weren't arguably involved (by virtue of having proposed the board, although I had no involvement with the MFD discussion or Radiant's dispute) I'd contemplate opening an admin conduct <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 15:09, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What tag? The one saying we are debating the status and purpose? I think that's reasonable. I also think we are very close to a consensus on what that purpose is, and I think there is some merit to reviewing again in a month to see if the scope is creeping or if the thing is still working. There's nothing wrong with having a debate about these things. I think Radiant! was a bit precipitate, but not evil, he has spent a lot of time lately working on cutting back instruction creep, which is a good thing. Debate on the talk page was moderate and civil last time I looked, I don't see any need to get upset about anything at the moment. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 16:33, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure where to post this. For the past two weeks (since <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_28.html" title="February 28">February 28</a> as far as I can tell) an edit war over the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Category%7EAnti-Islam_sentiment_13da.html" title="Category:Anti-Islam sentiment">Category:Anti-Islam sentiment</a> has been ongoing on the <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlaams_Belang_4b54.html" title="Vlaams Belang">Vlaams Belang</a> article. The first few edits declared inclusion of that category was biased (category was nominated for deletion till today, no consensus either way was found) respectively not biased. But now for several days it's simply a game of reversions. No one has yet broken the triple revert rule but the continual reverting seems disruptive. It might even involve other problems (stalking and sock puppetry). I have so far not been involved, just watching from the sidelines (except for placing a vote against deletion in the category vote). yesterday I decided to ask on the <a href="../../../v/l/a/Talk%7EVlaams_Belang_3f23.html" title="Talk:Vlaams Belang">Talk:Vlaams Belang</a> page that the waring parties try and explain why the category would be biased, or why it would not be biased in this particular case. But the article has been reverted six times since then. I have not tried to contact editors as I'd prefer not to get too involved in this issue (I won't claim to be neutral, but I don't feel strongly enough about this particular issue to wish to be drawn into that fight). At this point I don't see what else I could do and hope that maybe an administrator's intervention, or just any editor with more experience could improve matters. As a last resort the page could be fully protected (one of the edit waring parties is an annon, but semi protection would seem like taking sides in this issue) for a time to see whether the issue can be debated on the talk page.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> 15:40, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been doing my best to raise some significant issues proactively and the lack of response is frustrating.

<p>&lt;rant&gt;When this board first opened I started threads both here and at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> requesting discussion and improvement for the header. Nobody paid attention. Finally I dug in and did something myself. It wasn't perfect, but frankly the way this whole situation has been unfolding has me quite disappointed because those threads I started got ignored, then people tried rash and unilateral action <i>because</i> the community hadn't addressed those issues in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>There's a similar <i>propose discussion...ignore...fester...</i> dynamic happening again at this board, at <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EBanning_policy_a1e6.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Banning policy">Wikipedia talk:Banning policy</a>: developing precedents and needed refinements aren't getting discussed and written into <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/_/WP%7EDE_3fff.html" title="WP:DE">WP:DE</a> the way they ought to be. <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html#Arthur_Ellis" title="WP:RFAR">Two</a> <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html#Request_to_review_indefinite_block_of_User:BabyDweezil" title="WP:RFAR">proproposed</a> cases now before ArbCom seek to appeal their community bans in part because the community banned editors were already indef blocked when the community ban discussion opened and weren't notified while the relevant ban discussion was ongoing.

Yet the <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html#Community_ban" title="WP:BAN">current policy language</a> actually instructs sysops to ban first and ask questions later.

<p>Several users are arguing about this issue. My opinion is that if a vandal removes warning from his page, then he is interfering with the process of keeping track of his vandalism so that appropriate warnings or blocks can be made. Thus his removal is vandalism; and we should revert it and give him another warning. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">MrDarcy</a> (<a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MrDarcy_7a2e.html" title="Special:Contributions/MrDarcy">contribs</a>) (who is apparently an administrator), claims that such reversion and additional warning would itself be vandalism by the "enforcer". And he is threatening to give warnings and blocks to those who do that. What is the policy on this matter? Thanks for your help. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 07:12, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Up until recently there were specific warning templates advising vandals that removing legitimate warning templates was also vandalism. I agree that it is necessary for legitimate warnings to stay on vandals' pages, so others on vandal patrol can see the prior offenses without having to dig through the history. It is almost always the worst vandals who promptly remove the warnings, often doubling the workload for those of us trying to stop them. <font face="Georgia"><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna"><span style="color:navy">~ Kathryn NicDhàna</span></a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a></font> 07:26, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those templates were intentionally deleted because many people agree with MrDarcy (though perhaps with weaker language) that reverting vandalism warnings is generally inappropriate. While I understand your concern about tracking the worst vandals, allowing such reversions also encourages harassment of generally good users that simply make mistakes. The amount of problems they were creating was disproportionate to the amount of good a little extra tracking was doing since any admin worth his title ought to already be reviewing histories. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 07:44, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

As <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a>, "removing warnings from one's own talk page is often frowned upon" replaced the statements that removing warnings was vandalism.

<p>It's so easy to solve, just make sure your edit summary reflects the fact you gave them a warning. Then it will not matter if they remove it and the next person will just need to look at the history page and not go though several revisions. <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUse_common_sense_cd4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Use common sense">Wikipedia:Use common sense</a> applies. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 10:47, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just chiming in as another admin <b>strongly</b> against edit-warring in an attempt to force the talk page display of material a user does not want. Talk pages exist to facilitate &gt;communication&lt; with the user. Not to serve as a perpetual 'wall of shame' for every condemnation that any random user chooses to place there. If you want to review past problems check the page history and/or the block log... that is <i>their</i> purpose, not the talk page's. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:04, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with CBD, and would just like to point out that if vandalism comes from an IP, that IP could be used the next day by a completely different person who is adding useful content. If it comes from a registered user, I imagine that in most cases, the account should be blocked indefinitely. I'm basing that on my feeling that there would be <i>very</i> few registered users who add the word "poop" to the article about George W. Bush today and add useful content to the article on contact lenses tomorrow. But surely a user should not be forced to display warnings that annoy or embarrass him. If that were the case, we'd need to change the titles from "user warnings" to "user black marks". When I send a warning, I'm careful to put something like "uw-vandalism2" in the edit summary, so that an admin can look briefly at the history, without checking the diffs, and see that someone has been warned. I'd hope, in any case, that an admin would check for vandalism carried out by the vandal before blocking, rather than warnings issued to the vandal, as I'm sure there are some who might misuse the warning templates if they disagree with an edit or want to harass someone. Just my two cents. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElinorD_4da6.html" title="User:ElinorD">ElinorD</a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EElinorD_6fce.html" title="User talk:ElinorD">(talk)</a> 12:26, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Remember the point in the warnings is to get them to stop vandalising, if they just blank the warning and do nothing then it worked. If they continue just add the next warning if appropriate, most who are intent on vandalising will just continue and It'll get to a blockable level reasonably quickly. If it comes to an AIV report you can note that warnings were removed. The other side to consider is that of attention seeking, some of those involved in this are incapable of gaining attention for positive contributions and would rather gain attention from the negative, edit warring over warnings is just feeding that attention seeking. If they are replacing the warning with taunts, abuse etc. then keep cool and if need be ask for an admin to see about protecting the page/blocking. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 12:44, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think there is definitely some gray area here. Maybe there should be some sort of time period that warnings are expected to remain. If an editor is removing current (24 hours for logged in users, less for IPs) warnings and continuing the actions that led to the warning in the first place, I would consider the removal as an additional act of vandalism. /shrug. --<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnorem_b6c2.html" title="User:Onorem">Onorem</a> 12:54, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If they remove the template, then they have clearly seen it. The purpose of these templates is not to blackmark users, it is to ask (then urge, then tell, then warn) users not to vandalise (be incivil, edit war, etc). If they have seen the message, then the purpose of the template has been achieved. Reapplying such templates if the user has removed them is edit warring; it should not be done. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Neil</span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../n/e/i/User_talk%7ENeil_9072.html" title="User talk:Neil"><span style="text-decoration:none"><small>(not Proto ►)</small></span></a> 14:09, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Perhaps the discussion could be narrowed to focus strictly on anonymous IP users as a starting point. The majority of vandalism comes from anonymous users. Since anonymous users do not generally have the same rights as account holders<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales/Archive_11#Repeated_Administrator_abuses" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales/Archive_11#Repeated_Administrator_abuses" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and user talk pages are a community asset, not personal, it's reasonable that a pattern of vandalism should be required to stand on the talk page for a period of time. The removal of vandalism warnings slows down the enforcement process. I don't look at page history or edit summaries when placing vandalism warnings. It is a waste of time - and often time is valuable when trying to stop a rampant vandal (at least when you have to get the warnings documented before you can report to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>). What about those vandal patrollers who are using tools like VandalProof? They are likely to put a test1 on someone who has been blocked 3 times in the last month just because of a blanked page. If the user can be penalized for blanking the page, it will either act as a deterrent or demonstrate malice on the part of the user. -- <font color="#000080">Mufka</font> <a href="../../../m/u/f/User%7EMufka_9a70.html" title="User:Mufka"><sup>(user)</sup></a> <a href="../../../m/u/f/User_talk%7EMufka_e6f5.html" title="User talk:Mufka"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mufka_3f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mufka"><sup>(contribs)</sup></a> 17:12, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not about penalizing people, it's about preventing disruption, starting wars over user talk content is in itself disruptive.

<dd>Its also about civility. And while on a low-traffic talk page of an IP its easy to check for previous warnings, on a busy talk page of a long-time user (yes they can still make mistakes), it can be near impossible to dig through and find those. Warnings are no different than any other kind of talk. We consider it a civility issue if someone is constantly blanking talk on his talk page without responding to it. So why should valid warnings be any different? They're still communication. There is no reason valid warnings on a talk page should be treated differently than valid communication and they can both be archived as appropriate. We've established that users don't own their talk page, even though they're given some latitude with it, its a place where a record of communication with other users is kept.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 19:17, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If one has to scan the history of a page to find warnings (and talk pages can often have lengthy histories), figuring out who to block becomes a real chore. If the warnings are left on the talk page, it becomes much easier to find out what level the vandal is at, in turn making it easier to escalate the template level when appropriate. Users don't own their talk pages, and vandals, in my opinion, should have more restrictions because of their proven malicious intents (at least persistent vandals should). If a warning is unwarranted, because the user did not perform the edit in question (the warner made a mistake), they are welcome to remove it themselves, but some users (IPs and registered users) have simply blanked their talk pages, regardless of whether or not the warnings previously displayed had been valid or read. As far as I'm concerned, archiving to a page linked from the main page is OK; blanking/deletion is not OK. — <a href="../../../v/o/y/User%7EVoyagerfan5761_88e3.html" title="User:Voyagerfan5761">Tuvok</a>[<sup><a href="../../../v/o/y/User_talk%7EVoyagerfan5761_18dc.html" title="User talk:Voyagerfan5761">T</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voyagerfan5761_7534.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voyagerfan5761">@</a><a href="../../../v/o/y/User_talk%7EVoyagerfan5761_18dc.html" title="User talk:Voyagerfan5761">lk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Voyagerfan5761_7e9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Voyagerfan5761">Improve me</a></sub>] 22:42, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Two additional comments on this; If a user does not have an account and is therefore showing up as an anonymous IP, it should just go with the territory that the user might have vandalism warnings sitting on the talk page from a previous user. The user doesn't own the talk page. We could just have a template that explains the situation very politely to the next user of the ip. On that same idea, the majority of anon ip's don't change from day to day or even month to month. It is reasonable that a user who is vandalizing on that ip will be back on the same ip to do it again (if they do it again). The second, and perhaps more important, is that I don't want to see vandal patrollers getting scolded by an admin who believes that blanking the talk page is not a bad thing. It makes us all look stupid if we can't agree on what the policy is and how it can be enforced. -- <font color="#000080">Mufka</font> <a href="../../../m/u/f/User%7EMufka_9a70.html" title="User:Mufka"><sup>(user)</sup></a> <a href="../../../m/u/f/User_talk%7EMufka_e6f5.html" title="User talk:Mufka"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mufka_3f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mufka"><sup>(contribs)</sup></a> 03:04, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A template would be good. I think several exist, it would be a matter of ensuring that they get on all IP talk pages. I still can't find a "good" reason for blanking warnings when other communication is allowed to stay unless its an attempt to hide it. Thats assuming bad faith, but honestly I just cannot think of a good faith reason to blank valid warnings unless you're consistently blanking your entire talk page (which you shouldn't really be doing anyway).--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 22:42, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If this is an established editor with that much throughput on their talk page that a brief viewing of the page history won't make the issue obvious, I'd say that's all the more reason to not worry about them keeping warnings visible if they don't want them. We should be looking to the bigger picture in such cases not merely counting warnings. The warning templates aren't something to bash people with, if the issue has been resolved and moved on from (i.e. they've read it and "conformed") then we don't need chanting of "unclean". --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 22:51, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually it is. Because its much easier for an established editor to cover up an issue that way. If someone doesn't seen any obvious warnings to this person they might just leave another civil1, and move on and think nothing of it. What they don't notice on this editors busy talk page is maybe he's had a half dozen of those over the last year, but its never involved the same editors, so no one picks up on it. That would be an indication that perhaps it should be taken to another level for input and possible handling of the situation. As I pointed out, there is no good reason to remove warnings if they were valid. Absolutely 100% none. And "feeling like it" isn't a good reason. If I ask you a question and you blank it, its considered uncivil. It should be no different with warnings. Its just communication. There is no reason it can't be archived in 7 days along with everything else, or whatever the regular archiving period is on that particular users talk page.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:59, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We don't blindly assume good faith. And if you can't provide a "good" reason for the removal of the warnings before normal archiving, I'm not violating that. If a single good scenario can't be provided for their removal, yet bad scenarios can easily be though of, AGF doesn't apply. There also wouldn't be any edit warning if we established a policy on their removal. Hence why this discussion is here. We don't block people for being mildly uncivil no. But if someone is consistently uncivil in all dealings he has with a particular subject (Lets say historical figures from a certain state, it doesn't really matter what) If a keen eyed editor notices this while leaving the individual a warning, he may try and intervene and recommend that the editor not edit those kinds of articles or if the editor ignores that and continues to be uncivil in regards to those articles, it may go to a point where the editor is officially banned from editing those kinds of articles. There are also other kinds of sneaky vandalism that long time editors could get away with by being allowed to bury warnings. There is also no assumption of bad faith in my saying that they shouldn't be allowed to wipe the warning right away. I'm simply saying that it is communication and it shouldn't be treated any differently.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:01, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes we do blindly assume good faith, when we have some evidence of bad faith in an action then that assumption evaporates.

<dd>So you're saying if I leave a NPA warning on someone's talk page, they blank and then repeat the behaviour, it is evidence and obviously the blanking of the warning is in bad faith? At that point then, since obviously the person was acting in bad faith by blanking the warning, that warning, and probably all others can be restored? What about future blankings? If those warnings were restored, and they're immediately blanked again, do we restore them since the user has demonstrated they're willing to ignore warnings? Are you willing to keep the tally sheet on which user is allowed to blank warnings because they haven't messed up again? Quite a tangled web.

<dd>I'm not saying you should restore warnings under any circumstances. I'm saying assuming that just removing of a warning is indicative of some "bad intent" goes against <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, if someone does remove a warning and then continues it seems go evidence of disruptive behaviour. Post a further warning for the fresh behaviour, if the disruption continues that's when we block. i.e. If I post a test2 template (or uw- whatever) on someones talk page and they remove it, and repeat the same action then any assumption that their original edit may have been a genuine mistake/test has gone out the window they certainly read the warning, there is no doubt they intend to be disruptive. "Its much easier to simply say that warnings are the same as any other communication and should be treated as such" - yep and I'm free to remove any other message I see fit from my talk page, as is any other editor, it's not vandalism, it's not something to edit war over. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 20:49, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thats not the impression I've gotten from people. A talk page is a record of communication and you don't own your talk page. You're given some latitude with it, but in the end you don't own it. I've seen it mentioned more than once that removing messages on your talk page without responding can be seen as uncivil, and that your talk page should be archived in a useful manner (if blanked, diffs to various versions should be included) or via something like werdnabot. Editing others comments is frowned upon, regardless of the place (unless its formatting the position of the message), and blanking someone's comment, whether its a comment or a warning, would fall under that too. So while it may be your talk page, and I should assume good faith in your wanting to blank the warning right away, you should realize you don't own your talk page, and you shouldn't edit my comments. This isn't a one way street. And in the absence of any good reason for removing warnings right away, I don't see any kind of reason this should lean so heavily towards that side. The middle ground would be to allow an individual to blank warnings until they show bad faith, but I think I just covered what a gong show that would be. You assume that this would be something that would be edit warred over, but an official policy should hopefully nip a lot of that in the bud. As someone pointed out before the only policy was kind of vague.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:06, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So then apply it appropriately? Very simply the scenario should look like this: Regular Joe User notices user X has blanked warnings, they restore them and reminds them that that is against policy and they can archive the warnings with their regular archives. If user X continues, they've been warned about the behaviour. Make a report to AIV, an administrator can restore them, provide a final warning (because honestly if this takes more than 2 warnings to get across, there is a malfunction in the junction) and then lock the talk page. This makes sure all talk is readily available. The warnings should provide links on how to archive a talk page and links to say the village pump if the individual feels a warning is unfair, or they need help understanding it. It can also include information saying "If this warning is patently false you can remove it, but explain why in the edit summary, i.e. I never edited the article in question".--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:11, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I don't see how it can encourage edit warring if the side removing the warnings is violating policy. <small><a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC"><sup>High</sup><sub>InBC</sub></a><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 15:45, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I see that your proposal is specifically for IP addresses, but lots of others have said this should apply to registered talk pages as well. Here's the problem: Say I'm having a dispute with User X. I am being civil and refraining from personal attacks. User X leaves an npa-2 warning on my talk page, even though it is entirely unfounded. Is removing it vandalism? If yes, can others remove it? If so, will we need to set up a noticeboard for requests for independent editors to investigate whether the warning was warranted and if not, to remove it? Obviously this would be a bigger problem with registered user talk pages, but we also have some VERY good IP editors (one in particular, of course, comes to mind). Would this policy apply to him? Why or why not? It's really not that difficult to check the history page, especially if something about the user seems fishy to you. If they are vandalizing and they blank their talk page, block 'em. That's completely in line with present policy, in which blanking warnings can only be considered disruption in the presence of other disruption (such as vandalism).

<dd>If a warning message is placed on a users talk page and its completely unfounded then it can be removed. Removing it wouldn't be vandalism. The burden of proof would be on the individual who placed the warning to provide diffs where they felt the behaviour occurred. If they can't, the warning can be removed. If its patently false, i.e. a copyvio template left about the George bush article and you've never edited that article. Remove it, and indicate that in your edit summary. If the warning template has been left by someone you're in a disagreement with, post to the village pump (this link could be included in the warning templates) or post to the users talk page and ask them to provide diffs.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:42, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Since there is clearly going to be no change in policy on this issue, I guess we are left to simply "frown" heavily on the activity (maybe I'll create a template that says "I frown on what you did" -- sounds completely legit to me based on the policy <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a>).

<dd>Right, there isn't going to be a change in policy because the alternative is the massive <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:Instruction_creep">instruction creep</a> that Crossmr mentions: if someone on vandal patrol posts a warning, he/she needs to monitor the page because if the user removes the warning as unfounded, the vandal patroller has to go back and provide diffs, right? (Otherwise, you're conceding that the warning was false, presumably). And admins and other editors can get harassed: where they remove what they think is a bogus warning, and then get presented a irrelevant diff (say, a revert they did), then what - take it to the village pump?

<dd>Suggestion: If you're given a false warning, respond to it with your side rather than remove it and look like you're trying to hide something. I reverted a user removing 2 {{npa}} warnings given to him on his talk page in the past 24 hrs and added a note that removing warnings was frowned upon. That user is now blocked, and rightfully so, but he would have continued attacking, edit warring, and being disruptive if I had not reverted his warnings and reported him on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>.

<p>If someone erases a warning on their talk page, then before you accuse them of vandalizing Wikipedia you have a responsibility to make sure that the person erased the warning in bad faith. You'd have to double-check their contributions to see whether the warning they erased is valid or not. This easily eats up more time than we save by trying to discourage people from erasing messages. It does happen that people - often new users - are warned inappropriately and then erase the warning. I came across a case recently in which an article was vandalized, someone fixed most of the vandalism, and the vandalism-fixer got blamed for the original vandalism. The person rightly blanked the nonsensical nonsensical warning from his/her talk page, and got for that another vandalism warning. If we are going to warn people who erase warnings, the least we can do is say so politely and not use the word "vandalism." <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 05:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The idea behind this straw poll is that perhaps we have had enough of idea gathering and now it is time to specify the ideas in a yes/no form so a straw poll can tell us where we stand. Perhaps there will be a concensus on some of the proposals. Once the field is narrowed down we can discuss the detals. A week should be long for this straw poll so people can ask and answer questions about each proposal and everyone who wants to can have an informed&#160;!vote. The poll's instructions are to vote yes to any or all that seem similar to what is needed; and no to any or all that that are fundamentally unsound. We are weeding out stuff more than selecting a winner. Identify specific details you like or don't like if you wish. Feel free to change or add a comment to your vote at any time.

Trueblood has been approached about this blanking by at least three people, and has indicated strong anti-nazi feelings with hints that he simply feels that an article about a Nazi should not be so detailed. He spreads these blankings out over several days, trying to hide them and making them appear as "cleaning up" the article of "shortening material" when it is in fact just blatant blanking. He also sometimes pretends to compromise, but in the end just keeps reblanking the same material over and over again. I teach history and think this mateiral absolutely should be in the article. It is well referenced and informative. Someone with anti-nazi feelings should not simply keep reblanking it because they don't like it being in there. As this has been going on for at least a month, and as Trueblood has ignored requests both on the article talk-page and his own talk-page to stop this, I'm asking for admin assistance. -195.229.236.214 11:43, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are two counter issues: (1) You can release works under multiple licenses, which may be incompatible with each other; in that case a recipient may use whichever licenses they received. In case of copyleft licenses like the GPL, if the images are released under GPL and some other license, then anyone can use them under GPL if they choose. (2) It's not 100% clear in case law, but in general you can't "rescind" something you previously properly released under GPL, though what typically happens when a software author wants to use a more restrictive license is they release newer versions under a different license. Here there's no reason to believe that the author has wanted to rescind the GPL anyway, only that he has released it under a vague non-commercial/by-permission-only license in addition to GPL. Conclusion: We're fine, you can use new icons if you want (e.g. since SVG is preferred to non-SVG), but there's no pressing need to delete the old ones. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-03-14 10:08Z</small></i></span></dd>

<p>How can we fix the AMA? It's a noble and probably necessary idea: users who are banned or blocked or just don't get it need people who can hold their hand and help them through the processes of dispute resolution and mediation. Yup. What they don't need is someone who mistakes their role for that of a legal advocate. I have to say that my view of AMA is strongly coloured by the fact that <a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">user:CyclePat</a> is an Advocate. Pat is a lovely guy, passionate about what he does, but has a positive gift for escalating disputes and rubbing people up the wrong way. There are many great uses of Pat's talents but this is not one of them. Other advocates are similarly problematic: I have seen one take a case and do nothing, leaving it there as a cesspit of argument for months, for example. We definitely need a help and support process, but this does not seem to be it. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:02, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We could stop calling it advocacy, for starters.

<dd>I like "advisors" <i>much</i> better, that's much more the role that it should take.

<p>Do we need <i>anything</i> even faintly along these lines? From my own experience I have never seen advocacy, even when well intentioned, do anything good, and when it comes to Arbitration advocacy is, and has consistently been, a walking disaster zone. We certainly don't need any more wikilawyering than we already have: surely just letting the trolls stew in their own juice is a good idea? <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 13:12, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I said above, we don't need advocacy, but there's great benefit in some organised system for dispensing advice. Good advice as to how to make dispute resolution work can make all the difference in helping people resolve issues before they become serious problems. Sure, there are places to bring up queries about the dispute resolution process, but having someone offer advice one-on-one can be particularly valuable in certain circumstances, and there is benefit in organising a group of people who feel qualified and motivated enough to give such advice. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 13:22, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How about Association of Member's Counsellors? I like the idea that your advocate is on "your side," even if that boils down to telling someone, in the nicest possible way: "I'd like to see you keep editing, so cool it so that you don't get banned." "Counsellor" gets the idea that AM? members should be giving <i>advice</i>, not wikilawyering.

<dd>Agreed with Dev: at the moment this organization is a long way off being some benign dispenser of advice. I don't like "Association of Member's Counsellors": "Counsellors" implies some sort of authority.

<dd>Maybe we should create the Information Point (or something like that - sounds better than "advice"), promote it, get it active, and then MfD <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">WP:AMA</a>?

If we could do it with enough precision, the best solution might be to define some clear success metrics for WP:AMA and some of the other controversial projects, and delete them in 6 months if they can't show that they're doing some good.

<dd>The "problem" with the AMA is the cnnotations given by the name. A persistant troll may come to the AMA expecting them to get them off the hook. Likewise, people expect that advocates can help them to win disputes by stepping in and making a decision, which is absolute crap (of course). The best way to resolve this would be to rename the group, look through and check the members list (or abolish it), remove much of the bureaucracy (meetings every month..) and make sure that users requesting the services of the AMA know what they can reasonably get. Personally (as an AMA deputy co-ordinator), I feel that Arbitration advocacy will never work, given the bad reputation the AMA already has, and the fact that an advocate will rarely be able to give more insight into a dispute than a clued up disputant. The job of the AMA should not be to actively fight cases - it should be to clue up these (frequently) new users on the ins and outs of policy. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 18:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I guess what I was thinking, agrees with that to a certain degree. It just strikes me that if an organisation isn't already conscious of its issues and trying to move them forward, it seems unlikely that the ability to do so will magically appear. 6 months however seems a long time in wiki terms, to be actively moving in the right direction shouldn't take that long. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 18:58, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Most of you are aware of the work that was done over the previous 6 months by the user warnings project <a href="../../../u/w/_/WP%7EUW_de83.html" title="WP:UW">WP:UW</a> and then when handed over <a href="../../../u/t/m/WP%7EUTM_f81f.html" title="WP:UTM">WP:UTM</a> to harmonise the multi level warnings.

To achieve this, one of the areas that needs greater community involvement is the redirecting of the old templates to the new ones.

<dd>I can delete your userpage and relevant subpages, but probably not the talk page. Your account cannot be removed forever because you have released edits under the licensing agreement, so we need a paper trail to an account. Plus technical reasons in the software don't allow for account deletion. So, we can make you a redlink, and archive the talk page, and that's about it. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a> <sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 02:29, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>--In view of the fact that I am being harassed here... I would like to appeal to all those concerned editors to broaden or better yet understand the situation before anything should be posted. If what I've done is spamming... Do you really consider it as such upon totally reviewing what had happened. How would we say then that Wikipedia will soon be a realiable source of information when in fact some of its editors and administration are itself biased. How would you say then that it is indeed a fact when the only basis of ones decision pertains to 'I think'. Users and indeed users! editors are indeed editors! administrators are indeed administrators! But what if the situation involves administrators, editors, and users who are trying to despose a contributor. A contributor who does not use his position to promote the sites he/she is handling, as what is being JUDGED, but indeed just using a page of the sites he/she is handling to better give an informative information to the topic and in this issue an internal link is being used inorder to show what the content of the link is. If you judge it as spamming when you provide an information to help wikipedia in providing information to various readers then be it called as such. For those who had already judged it... Have you read, review, and understand the very content, quality, information of the SITES used. have you then used you're sense of Human Understand to read, review, and understand the very content, quality, information of the SITES or you just used your 'I think' sense of judgement or you have totally used the Guidelines to be in control of the situation. Guidelines are just suppose to be GUIDELINES! If you think it is to be removed so because of the fact that the sites have stores on it, have you read the link I posted and where it is being redirected, have you read the page personally? Does it point to a store? NO!!! it points to the RELATED TOPIC I used in adding various contents in the page. Upon seeing that the sites have stores have you seen the thousands of pages containing the meaningful and Informative articles or should I say Informative contents. If none or some of these are true... from where do you belong? <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReader_contributor_ff93.html" title="User:Reader contributor">Reader contributor</a> 06:42, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am sorry, I don't understand some of what you write, but yes, I have looked at the page. That is how I determined it was spam, since it contained an objectionable amount of advertising, and no useful, unique information or content beyond what would be included in the WP article if it reached FA status. At least half of the page space on the site you are promoting is taken up by ads and links the the site's store/shopping cart.

<dd>True, the user has stopped now, but at the time was edit-warring and persistently reinserting the link contrary to consensus.

<li>Andy Mabbett, who is a prodigious editor and a good contributor who has an unfortunate ability to rile people, came off a year-long block in January. He's tried to improve his behaviour but issuing lengthy blocks for a questionable breach of a disputed rule is not going to help him - especially if his past form from more than a year ago is held against him. The block was not only excessive, it's likely to be counterproductive. How about cutting him some slack? How about giving him an even break for once? <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Fys</a>. “<a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Ta</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fys_a016.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fys">fys</a> <a href="../../../f/y/s/User_talk%7EFys_d202.html" title="User talk:Fys">aym</a>”. 16:04, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You say it's a <i>questionable</i> rule, but what you actually mean there is it's a rule <i>you</i> were blocked for breaking. Many (most?) of us find <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> to be an unalloyed good, as it acts as an electric fence of which even seasoned edit warriors fight shy. And Pigs is an edit-warrior, the problem is edit-warring, and edit warring is what he was doing. Jooler seems not to have noticed the bit about "three reverts is a limit, not an entitlement" and "you may be blocked after fewer than three reverts". Efforts to improve? For sure. We can celebrate an alcoholic who turns up every week at AA, but it's still going to be a problem if he falls off the wagon. Carrot, stick. Pigs got the stick.

<li>Don't you cast aspersions on my merely contributing. You're late to this particular party, I was one of the admins who was trying to deal with Andy and there is an entry in his block log from me, so I know more about it than you do. What I do question is a rule where the penalty for not breaking it is worse than the penalty for breaking it. It really is Kafkaesque. If you think someone is reverting excessively then just tell them not to; if they continue, then a block is merited. But at the very least rename the "three revert rule": three is irrelevant, as you have pointed out; the word 'revert' doesn't mean a revert, and it's not a hard and fast rule. <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Fys</a>. “<a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Ta</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fys_a016.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fys">fys</a> <a href="../../../f/y/s/User_talk%7EFys_d202.html" title="User talk:Fys">aym</a>”. 17:16, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>From a very superficial scanning of Pigsonthewing's edits since his return, it appears that he has made some effort to improve. However it is also true that he has a lot of past form. A one-week block might not be incorrect, depending on the circumstances.

<dd>I don't know why people are saying this is a questionable block; I'll take a look at the 3RR report again.

<dd>You have repeated this many times - but the evidence clearly shows that what you called the 2nd and 4th revert were no such thing. Past behaviour is irrelevant, a smokescreen, to the fact that your block was based on faulty evidence. It is beside the point bu as you brought it up I will say here that including this occasion I have been blocked 7 times and on 5 occasions the block has been reversed because the administrator who blocked did so blocked me without valid justification. you can see this clearly from the block log. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 00:43, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're right. In context, it's nothing more than a get-out clause for admins to block users under 3RR when they haven't even breached 3RR if it will put a temporary stop to an edit war.

<dd>This is the worst kind of wikilawyering. Pigsonthewing reverted more than three times in just over an hour against multiple editors. By revert, I mean that he either removed or restored another editor's work. Saying it can't have been a revert if he removed something Jooler had added (or restored something Jooler had removed) is bizarre.

<p>(&lt;- reset) To Natalie: apparently because Tennis expert (TE) was blocked indefinitely as a sockpuppet but then unblocked the next day because it was unfounded.

<dd>Tamilnation is a mixed collection. It is true that the editor of the website was quite involved in the ethnic conflict and I think he now supports the LTTE. But if you leave Sri Lankan politics there are also many reliable materials on the website like this translation of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea by W.H. Schoff<a href="http://www.tamilnation.org/heritage/periplus.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tamilnation.org/heritage/periplus.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> and this paper by R.E. Frykenberg<a href="http://www.tamilnation.org/conferences/cnfMA66/frykenberg.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tamilnation.org/conferences/cnfMA66/frykenberg.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. So I think a blanket blacklisting is wrong, but each item should be examined on its merits on a case-by-case basis. -- <a href="../../../p/o/n/User%7EPonnampalam_c484.html" title="User:Ponnampalam">Ponnampalam</a> 23:32, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If Tamilnation has any scholarly material at all, I am sure we can find other <i>scholarly sources</i> for the same material. Tamilnation is primarily a Tamil and LTTE partisan site. Every single word on that site is written and presented with a blatant Tamil POV. Wikipedia can ill afford such sources. Come on, we cant start citing from a site edited by acknowledged apologists of terror groups simply because they slip in a piece of <i>legitimate scholarly material</i> in some corner of their site. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarvagnya_de49.html" title="User talk:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 23:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then find another online source for Frykenberg's paper and show me. I don't think it is available anywhere else. There are other things like that too. And please note that I said that we should examine each document on a <b>case by case basis</b>. Original content written by them is one thing, and secondary content written by experts is another. -- <a href="../../../p/o/n/User%7EPonnampalam_c484.html" title="User:Ponnampalam">Ponnampalam</a> 23:49, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>If its not available anywhere except on Tamilnation, then we should simply live without it. There are zillions of 'notable' and encyclopedic things out there which are not yet on wikipedia simply because of the lack of notable and verifiable sources talking about them. Nobody is in any hurry. If a fact(especially controversial ones) has to wait for a RS to make it to Wikipedia, then so be it. As for Frykenberg's paper, I am sure there should be many sources other than tamilnation. Sagepub should have it. Or, it certainly should be available in a library. And even if the library is not near you, most libraries have inter library loans. So use it. Just because some info is difficult to find <i>online</i> is not reason to use unreliable sources. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarvagnya_de49.html" title="User talk:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 04:46, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Tamilnation.org is a collection of thousands of books and articles with links to various sources. It is a virtual library on Tamil civilization. By <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blngyuen</a> stating that the site "appears" to be supporting something, he is unsure of the topic in discussion.

Why the sudden interest? Could it be due to the war of the Dravidian topics template? Are those guys trying to get back at me? And Blnguyen, I do not know what your intentions are, but as an administor you are setting a bad example to others by allowing these users to do these things and by taking their side. I have been editing the Bharatanatayam article since October of last year with valid sources. I have even gone to the extent to include page numbers of what I quote. Then all of a sudden these users just hop on and remove my credible references. No, this is not a genuine edit of this particular article on their part, but an immature grudge match. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_Raja_d537.html" title="User:Wiki Raja">Wiki Raja</a> 02:15, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>(unindent) It is true that we need reliable sources. However, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> also has one important sentence, that seems to get overlooked:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are many borderline reliable sources in the Sri Lanka conflict, and discussions of whether they are RS or UnRS have not reached consensus in the past. (Only one reliable news agency - BBC - sends reporters to Sri Lanka, and they can't be everywhere.) However, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> even has a solution for that: Section <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#A_simple_formulation" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#A simple formulation</a> recommends: "Alternatively: <b>assert facts, including facts about opinions — but do not assert the opinions themselves.</b>" (bold in original.)</p>
<p>Tamilnation is notable. According to Alexa.com, (as of January) Tamilnet has a reach of 22/M users. By contrast, defence.lk, the main site for pro-GoSL information about the civil war, has only 6.5. (By comparison, our Sri-Lanka related articles have about 2/M. This is based on the assumptions that we have 400 articles related to the Sri Lanka conflict and thet they are about as visited as the average WP article; both assumptions might rather be a bit high.)</p>
<p>Therefore, we can not simply ignore Tamilnation. One possible solution is as follows:</p>
<p>Based on the recommendation in section <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#A_simple_formulation" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#A simple formulation</a>, the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Sri_Lanka_Reconciliation_394f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Sri Lanka Reconciliation">WikiProject Sri Lanka Reconciliation</a>, a bipartisan effort to improve collaboration on and coverage of the Sri Lankan Civil War, has come up with a recommendation to use references to quote Tamilnet only as their opinion, and with the attribution "pro-rebel". (See <a href="../../../s/l/r/WP%7ESLR_2364.html#Classification_of_sources" title="WP:SLR">WP:SLR#Classification of sources</a>). This is a compromise that has been reached in consensus, which is quite an achievement for two factions who are so utterly at odds!</p>
<p>Anybody who has a better idea how to solve this in a way that can be agreed by both Sinhalese and Tamils, please come forward. We'd love to hear your ideas. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 21:11, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

But quoting verbatim from an apologist's pamphlet and to call it 'presenting fairly' is nonsense. The problem here is this. Both sides have a POV. And in each POV, the other is a 'terrorist'. So if we can get any RS which echoes both these POVs, then both POVs should be presented. If however, Reliable Sources echo only one of the POVs, then <i>only</i> that POV should be presented. The other POV <u>should NOT be presented</u> regardless of how many non reliable sources exist to vouch for it. And Tamilnation, because of its blatantly partisan nature in all matters concerning Tamil <i>and</i> the fact that the site is <i>only</i> about Tamil and nothing else, is NOT a reliable source. Ranking high on Alexa means nothing. It doesnt change the fact that it is a biased and partisan source. Period.</dd>

<dd>So, the solution? Solution is simple.

<dd>So if a source discusses only Tamil then we should not use that as a source??? Thats odd. Is this new rule made on-the-fly will be applicable to every sources? Because I have a long list of sources such as ourkarnataka.com, karnatakavision.com, karnataka blah blah.com. and loads of crappy books written by 'historians' which discusses only karnataka and of partisan nature. Then articles related to some language/region will not have any sources (rather unfortunately).</dd>
<dd>Just to remind: this discussion is regarding edit war caused by (1) removing external links, (2)removing cited materials, (3)adding frivolous tags etc.
<dl>
<dd>(1) The tamilnation.org link was used as <b>External link</b> not <b>reference</b>. And the article linked to was not related to LTTE at all; it was a <b>reproduction of a research</b> paper (with numerable citations).</dd>
<dd>(2) Cited material was removed repeatedly by Sarvagnya <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bharatanatyam&amp;diff=112920756&amp;oldid=112747168" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bharatanatyam&amp;diff=112920756&amp;oldid=112747168" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bharatanatyam&amp;diff=112966406&amp;oldid=112927463" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bharatanatyam&amp;diff=112966406&amp;oldid=112927463" rel="nofollow">here</a> with Sarvagnya's own 'research' edit summaries.</dd>

<dd>first of all, I dont know why we are even discussing the 'edit war on Bharatanatyam' here. The edit war on that article was over the inclusion/removal of an external link from tamilnation.org. this site has been quoted across several articles related to terrorism in srilanka. understandably, this discussion which was supposed to be about the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bharatanatyam.html" title="Bharatanatyam">Bharatanatyam</a> article veered towards discussing the sources used on the srilankan articles. the result of these discussion will surely have a bearing on the Bharatanatyam article too.</dd>

<p>The material from Tamilnation is not original material by anyone associated with Tamilnation. It is paper publshed in a conference where peer reviewed paper are presented by reputable authors of the field. Wiki cite has a way tocite such material that is not directly available.</p>

<p>Forget about the link itself, simply quote from the published paper from the conference. This is more acceptable as long as the material is used for main body of the material.</p>
<p>This is how salvagable material from otherwise non RS sources are used in Wikipedia. So no need to wholesale repudiation of sources based on personal opinion. We have to use common sence.

<dd>The sad thing is, Mike Church is pretty good at creating this chilling effect. At least three administrators who once tried to stop him don't bother anymore. I'm inclined to stop, too, since this is consuming a lot of time and getting me nothing but threats. (In two years of screwing with Wikipedia, Mike hasn't actually followed through on any threats, so I'm not particularly worried, but it's still not fun.) I just want to know that someone -- or better, many people, so that they don't all have to have as much time to waste as Mike does -- is going to continue the job.

<p>I believed that it was not acceptable to do a copy-and-paste merge from a deleted article into another article without attributing the original authors as this violates section 4(B) of the GFDL. However, an administrator has informed me that this is acceptable, because the AfD has closed. Could somebody please clarify this for me.

<dd>It is not acceptable, the authors have to be attributed. Could this just be a language misunderstanding between the two of you?

<dd>If all the previous authors agree to releace thier contributions under the PD then it would be ok... otherwise a copy&amp;paste merge is not acceptable. However, a good solution is to undelete the article and convert it into a redirect. Then you can can make the merge and have the old history to satisfy GFDL. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 16:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I understand it, the section of policy only applies to AFD's in progress. AFD's since deleted can recreate sections of their deleted material into another article. For instance if the article on George W. Bush's dog is deleted, the attribution remains in the first page's history, and the information simply can be added into the G.w.b. article instead. This happens all the time on AFD. Why is this a problem? But anyway, J.Smith brings up a very easy solution, we'll just undelete the article and make it a redirect, problem solved. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 16:30, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) You would have thought correctly. The GFDL doesn't just require us to know who our contributors are, it requires us to attribute those contributions publicly to the right person.

<dd>I disagree this is resolved.

<dd>1) Your merging of the deleted material <i>was</i> a copyvio, whether intentional or not, as as such had to be reverted. The GFDL is not something we can disregard just because an editor isn't aware of its implications. 2) As for the actual merges, excepting <a href="../../../p/a/x/Pax_Calendar_d9fa.html" title="Pax Calendar">Pax Calendar</a>, not one of these articles had a single reliable source to back it up and as such is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. It is not a "trivial calculation" as you claim: the example of a trivial calculation given in <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> is that of calculating percentages for readily available vote tallies. For example, can you please explain the pattern of "abundant years" in the Simple Lunisolar Calendar?

<dd>It should be noted that arbcom member Fred Bauder has admitted that my "editing has substantially improved from that in the earlier arbitration cases. A sampling of edits shows reference to reliable sources..."

<dd>It depends. They might be a user from another Wikipedia who was registering their username to avoid impersonation or for use at a later date and decided to fix their en account up so it functions like their old one. Or they could be the welcome-message vandal from a month or two ago. Wait and see, and assume good faith in the meantime, is my recommendation. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 00:02, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I second the "it depends." Really, I only come across that kind of contribution history by accident and not on RC. I just assume that the user knows what they're doing, and I usually follow the contributions for a couple days and then move on. 99% of the time it's just someone making a new start or some sort of alternate account. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a> <sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 05:30, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, it's quite normal. .js pages only exist for registered accounts. So people who don't edit wikipedia but regularly use it may want to customize the way they view wikipedia. I've set up accounts for other people on their computers before so they can view wikipedia with popups. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 10:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Especially if there's an ongoing pattern, it couldn't hurt to keep a closer eye on that sort of account, I think. But I'd agree, it doesn't necessarily indicate any foul play -- some people may be incoming from other wikis, may finally be registering after a long period of anon editing, or a few other benign explanations. As with kinda "iffy" usernames, it can (and sometimes should) attract our attention, but provided they make good edits, it doesn't seem a pressing problem. Only exception to that, I think, is if they're an abusive sockpuppet. – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 03:27, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm rather new, so I wasn't sure whether I should outright remove an image or report it first. On <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Gipson_9aac.html" title="Simon Gipson">Simon Gipson</a>, there are two photos. One has the caption 'Simon Gipson (left)'. This is ridiculous because the figure on the left of the photo sort of looks like Kermit the Frog. I've never seen a photo of Simon before, but I think that that picture wasn't very clear - if it was him in the suit, it's not a clear picture, so it should be removed? The second picture is a very far away shot of two people, and you can't even see their faces. Please review these and tell me on <a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESeventy_dot_86d0.html" title="User talk:Seventy dot">my talk page</a> whether you've removed them or not. Thank you</p>

<dd>Well, another user mixed up left with right. I changed the caption to <i>Simon Gipson with <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kermit_the_Frog_5361.html" title="Kermit the Frog">Kermit the Frog</a></i>, hoping that users are able to tell who is the frog and who must be the other guy. On the second pic, there is also left and right mixed up (now corrected), this makes me believe someone just swapped the pics without changing the cations. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> | <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a></dd>

<dd>Actually, I'm not too sure whether the man on the right is <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Gipson_9aac.html" title="Simon Gipson">Simon Gipson</a> or not.

<dd>According to WHOIS, the IP used by Soothsayer.03 was coming from Naperville, Illinois and Ed says he's from Chicago which they are relatively close, so the account being compromised is highly unlikely unless the other person who compromised it lives in his general area.

<dd>I don't know if Dpbsmith is being sarcastic about Nesbit's credentials or not, but you can find Nesbit and his web page by searching for the school on google and entering his name in the search window or by going to academic programs, faculty of education, and faculty members and finding him and his web page under associate professors. I couldn't find DeMoines University any where and the medical school has no faculty of education.

<dd>I guess I needed the irony alert, huh? I was being sarcastic about <b>Sue Rangell's</b> credentials. That is the user page that misspells Des Moines University, and claims that Sue Rangell is on the faculty of education of a school that, as I noted, appears not to have any "faculty of education." What I called the "obvious phony" was a link to John C. Nesbit's impressive web page hosted by Simon Fraser University, with his photo and a few scores of publications. So, yes, I thought that the situation was so clear that I could jokingly refer to Nesbit as the phony instead of Rangell. I must remember never ever ever to be ironic in an online venue.

<p>Most of the stuff on her(?) userpage is probably untrue, even the useless stuff like claiming to be a left-handed pascal programmer who is skeptical of MTBI.
