<p>This is one interesting admin, his very controversial moves within the past week includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of administrator powers with respect to a dispute he was engaged in:
<ul>
<li>Blocking me for 48 hours while not assuming good faith of my contributions. This was my first and it was without any prior warnings. The reason given was that for (correctly) changing the place of two pictures in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_McCabe_2f39.html" title="Stan McCabe">Stan McCabe</a>, which also accidentally removed a grammar correction; and that I asked for citations. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGerash77_2994.html#Hello" title="User talk:Gerash77">User_talk:Gerash77#Hello</a></li>
<li>Stating a racist and false accusation that "<i>Iran does not play cricket whatsoever</i>", as to why I shouldn't be editing cricket articles. <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html#Block_review" title="User talk:Blnguyen">User_talk:Blnguyen#Block_review</a></li>

<li>Provide diffs as to accusation No. 1</li>
<li><i>Iran does not play cricket whatsoever</i> is not a racist comment.</li>
<li>Sarvabhaum is a block-evading troll and this is not the first time he has done it.</li>
<li>You were blocked because you were stalking Blnguyen's contributions and editing the articles he had edited. There was no content dispute, you were following his contributions and trying to confront him for one reason or the other.

<ul>
<li>Acc-No#1: Acting in bad faith towards my contributions to the cricket article, and blocking me as a result of my contributions which he did not take kindly of; whereas this dispute should have not been setteled by his use of administrator powers.</li>
<li>It is as racist as saying <b>a Jew shouldn't contribute to Manual Labour article</b>, or <b>Africans shouldn't edit engineering articles</b>.</li>
<li>"Stalking" is following someone around, whereas I went to read the cricket articles from Blnguyen own user page. Editting those articles for improving the imagery and asking for citations that I did not find in the cited refs, is not stalking. Even if Blnguyen thought my edits had not merit, he clearly misused his blocking power.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Saying that Iran doesn't play cricket is not racist, nor is it a literal comment - it is meant to say that it is of a negligible standard with no popular following, as can be seen from the fact that the first cricket organisation was only registered in 2003. I am not placing restrictions on ethnic or religious groups to edit any kind of article whatsoever, I am simply stating that the fact that Gerash has taken an interest in these two articles is out of place with his pattern of only editing Iran and Islam articles, and that the articles he edited were clearly marked GAs on my userpage, of all possible cricket articles. Anybody is free to edit cricket articles, but the fact that you went and picked out my most thorough cricket articles, both GA, properly referenced etc, straight after reverting me on <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> with the charming edit summary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105751927" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105751927" rel="nofollow">"zioattack"</a>, and then undoing my self grammar corrections, referencing, prose polishing on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_McCabe_2f39.html" title="Stan McCabe">Stan McCabe</a> and then tagging things which are already explicitly cited in <a href="../../../i/r/f/Irfan_Pathan_b760.html" title="Irfan Pathan">Irfan Pathan</a> seems to be more than a coincidence. The imagery was not improved. The image is dated 1938, yet you moved it from the 1936 section to the 1934 section, which is even more inaccurate. Besides, it was not an original edit, you simply mechanically undid my edits. Err, no I didn't make any false assumptions about <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/u/Seuna.html" title="Seuna">Seuna</a>, etc, see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Sarvabhaum_9fbf.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Sarvabhaum">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Sarvabhaum</a>, and as for Frater, he clearly bragged to his opponents on-wiki that he was evading his block, which had a technical approval at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Starwood_Workshop_34b8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Starwood/Workshop">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Starwood/Workshop</a>. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 01:50, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is amazing is that you still are defending the assumption of bad faith on your part. You say I <b>only</b> edit Iran and Islam related articles, which is totally false. While surfing wiki I try to improve any article, including those that are so interesting that none dares to edit them out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Esotericism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91738604" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Esotericism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91738604" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Your statements that Iran's <i>[c]ricket is of a negligible standard with no popular following</i> as to why you are assuming bad faith is so outrageous that is not even worthy of a response. Your comments are very controversial and have no basis in Wikipedia's policies, and I believe its in the interest of yourself that you take some time apart from administration, or be given some temporary hold on your blocking previligies, to elevate yourself to standards expected from a Wikipedia administrator. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerash77_a233.html" title="User:Gerash77">Gerash77</a> 03:41, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

He objected to the template because it was the only one in existence at the time, specifically centered around Japan. Firstly, this an example of <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>, which is not grounds for a template deletion, and he incorrectly considered it as a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. He then created numerous similar templates and added them to a number of different articles. If he had created these templates in the thought that they deserve to exist, one has to ask why he does not withdraw the nomination for the original template in question, the one he still maintains should be deleted.

<dd>You don't even understand the issue that <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">User:Ideogram</a> brought up, do you? Neither I or LordAmeth used these templates to invite editors to discuss the deletion of the Japan template, a template that you nominated for deletion, and neither I or LordAmeth voted to delete that template. We created those templates as navigational tools. And I had even asked you to withdraw the nomination after you created these other templates, but you refused. Why did you create these templates if you still think the Japan one ought to be deleted? <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 03:48, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Don't jump to conclusions, HongQiGong. I never said that the template should be unconditionally deleted. I said that if the template cannot be salvaged in an NPOV fasion, it should be deleted. We are still discussing how the template can be salvaged in an NPOV fasion. Why withdraw that TfD request when we are having an ongoing and productive discussion?

<dd>The template is not POV to begin with. It does not comment on the legitimacy of Japan's claims, and it does not state that Japan is the only country ever to have territorial dispute. There is a <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> problem, but that is not grounds for deletion. It's a problem which, by the way, you and LordAmeth have subsequently solved with the creation of those other templates.

<dd>I maintain that HongQiGong's initial creation of a template FOR ONE COUNTRY ONLY (Japan) WAS a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> violation as I also stated in <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETfD_0497.html" title="WP:TfD">WP:TfD</a>. This was in the beginning only, and the situation changed as people got involved and revised the template. Everything was being discussed in a cordial manner, in the TfD discussion.</dd>
<dd>Then I mentioned that the only way I can support this template was to verify there are no complaints when similar templates are created for <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and their rivals <a href="../../../p/r/c/PRC_e01a.html" title="PRC">PRC</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>.

Subsequently, there was a complaint regarding the <a href="../../../p/r/c/PRC_e01a.html" title="PRC">PRC</a> template, mentioning that there should be a template for <a href="../../../p/r/c/PRC_e01a.html" title="PRC">PRC</a>'s rival <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">ROC</a> as well, which I then created.</dd>
<dd>That's when <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">User:Ideogram</a> started this discussion. Anyways, we disagree about the <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation.</dd>
<dd>Will an admin please respond and tell us whether there was any <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation here?</dd>
<dd>If there's no <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation, I'd like to go ahead and apply the templates for <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> as well.

<dd>Isarig should not be complaining about other users "gaming" the 3RR since that is something Isarig does constantly. Nearly every edit of Isarig's is a revert, and he constantly reverts three times a day, and will report anyone who does it a fourth time even when Isarig started the edit war; more than a few times, I have found him reverting a fourth time at exactly 24 hours and ten minutes (I have reported him for this two or three times and been told simply that four reverts are needed to incur a block). While I share Isarig's concern about changing text that is under mediation, I think his reaction to Thucydides, which was extremely hostile, was unnecessarily provocative and disruptive. At one point Isarig refused to respond to extremely legitimate concerns - concerns agreed upon by other parties in the mediation - and simply threatened an AN/I report. I am very concerned that Isarig seems to use AN/I reports to avoid content discussions -- trying to take his opponent out of play rather than responding to his concerns in the discussion. I feel this is an abuse of wikipedia process.<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 05:36, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You are in dire need of reading <a href="../../../t/u/_/Tu_quoque.html" title="Tu quoque">Tu quoque</a>. My reaction to Thucydides's ultimatum was "You are welcome to your personal opinions, but as you can see, they are hotly contested and this issue is currently in mediation. Please don't edit the contorversial sections on theJuan Cole page while this mediation is in progress" - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARequests_for_mediation%2FJuan_Cole&amp;diff=105148613&amp;oldid=105129568" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARequests_for_mediation%2FJuan_Cole&amp;diff=105148613&amp;oldid=105129568" rel="nofollow">this</a>. there was nothing hostile about it - it was a polite request that he not unilaterally edit a page under mediation. You are misrepresenting your true position on editing pages under mediation - you do not share my concern over this, you have encouraged Thucydides to so edit, saying "I don't think there is any harm in removing the entire disputed section until mediation is done". My particpation in the mediation page is well documented, please don't lie about that, too. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 06:15, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please stop accusing me of lying; as I explained on that page, my concern is about changing the page without discussion, but I don't think there is a harm in agreeing to remove the disputed text until it is no longer disputed. Please see <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> rather than assuming people are lying when you encounter opinions that are more complex than black-and-white.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Where is the best place to report a string of sock/meat puppets these days? I've been editing as anon for years now, and am not familiar with the current meta practices on en.</p>
<p>I noticed some <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ugly_Hill_e38e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ugly Hill">serious disruption in an AfD</a>. Somebody with checkuser needs to sort this out. Just as my luck would have it, I happen to get into a passionate AfD right after I leave the IPs behind, and now I can't bring this up in the AfD itself, as it has moved to semiprot (as it should be) to stop the puppetry.</p>

I do not have as much experience with image/copyright stuff as other admins, so I was hoping you might want to take a look at this user's contributions. A vast number of this user's images have no copyright information, let alone source or fair use details, and many others have incorrect tags, in which the user claims to own the copyright.

<p>A number of users have been attacking me, I have asked them to stop but they keep doing it. <a href="../../../x/x/2/User%7EXx236_c238.html" title="User:Xx236">User:Xx236</a> started calling me a "Canadian Prussian" referring to the bad reputation Prussians have in Poland.

As I am the only Canadian wikipedian that they both have been attacking, I assume this is meant about me.</p>
<p>what is even more intolerable despite there personal attacks and going even farther over the line once I ask them to stop, is what Space Cadet did on my user page and talk page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AJadger&amp;diff=106571891&amp;oldid=106495258" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AJadger&amp;diff=106571891&amp;oldid=106495258" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> see <a href="../../../j/a/d/User_talk%7EJadger_c60f.html#Your_note" title="User talk:Jadger">User_talk:Jadger#Your_note</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/d/User_talk%7EJadger_c60f.html#re:jadger" title="User talk:Jadger">User_talk:Jadger#re:jadger</a></p>

<p>thank you, but I must mention that these edits were discussed a while ago on <a href="../../../i/n/v/Talk%7EInvasion_of_Poland_%281939%29_91bb.html" title="Talk:Invasion of Poland (1939)">talk:Invasion of Poland (1939)</a> and consensus supported me that <i>Polish Defensive War</i> is inherently POV and wrong. the only people who supported the term were the two editors who are now calling me a vandal. What is wrong with calling the article by its actual title anyways? Halibutt calls it counter-productive, I don't see how</p>

<dd>I understand, but like I said, it would probably be beneficial to open an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a> on the articles in question and mention the consensus at <a href="../../../i/n/v/Talk%7EInvasion_of_Poland_%281939%29_91bb.html" title="Talk:Invasion of Poland (1939)">talk:Invasion of Poland (1939)</a> to see if a consensus can't form at the other articles. IMO at least it seems silly to mask an article name with another simply to rebrand it, but that is just my opinion.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:19, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note to all involved: I explained why did I label Jadger's actions as vandalism on both his own talk page and the talk page of Isotope23. In short: removing valid sources and then removing relevant information claiming it was unreferenced (while in reality Jadger was the person to delete the reference himself) is exactly what I'd call <i>making wikipedia worse</i>. And making wikipedia worse is... yup, vandalism. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 14:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not masking, it's simply that we've agreed that the naming should be left up to the author (it's silly to suggest Polish Army took part in the Invasion of Poland, isn't it). And all was fine as long as Jadger did not go on his spree to remove the name he doesn't like and promote the one he does. If he has a problem with it - I'm surely be interested in such a mediation, but so far I'm happy with our previous agreement. But this is hardly related to his edits I called vandalism or his unfounded accusations of personal attacks, as this is a serious issue, while his accusations are not.</dd>
<dd>Also, Jadger could have asked for some translation if he didn't understand our personal conversation on our talk pages. The FPS remark I made was directed at Space Cadet's usage of a <i>I got your back</i> remark, which made me think he plays FPS games a lot. Really, no need to create conspiracy theories or suffer from some paranoid delusions, there was nothing cabalistic about our small chatter. And no personal attack there either. Sorry, Jadger, but this seems like your own problem, not mine. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 14:36, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know that now - but at the time I was changing the IP so that I could ask why I was being blocked - I hope you can understand this.87.102.36.25 22:57, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not true. I told you why you were blocked at the outset. The reply is still on my talk page. You then kept using subsequent IP's to argue about it. I had told you how to appeal it a long time before that. It is not my fault you decided to use 6 IP's to evade the block. If you had used your original IP, you would have seen the instructions on how to appeal. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 00:59, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me get this straight: you blocked the User, and when he used anon IP addresses to ask how to appeal, you deleted his questions and blocked the IPs because ... he ... was ... evading ... the ... block?

<dd>Nope it isn't. He's been an anon IP the whole time. First, I replied to his original message on my talk page. (Which is still there). Then, I left a message on his original IP telling him what to do to appeal the block rather than resorting to block evasion, and then left messages on the subsequent ones but he changed IP's so fast he never saw them. The questions were deleted because, 1. - they weren't questions, they were complaints and they were 2 - posted on the ref desk where they don't belong and 3 - not all deleted by me. Then yes, I blocked the subsequent IP's for block evasion. The instructions on what to do were sitting there on his original blocked IP the entire time he ran through 6 IP sockpuppets. I had already told him why he was blocked at the outset and how to seek an appeal, he just didn't like the reason and wanted to keep arguing. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 00:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>There does seem to be a reference desk editor who uses the same general IP range as Light current, and who makes these edits anonymously. This user has been accused of sockpuppetry before, most recently by Hipocrite (see <a href="../../../s/c/z/User_talk%7ESCZenz_5641.html#Light_Current_.28request_from_Hipocrite.29" title="User talk:SCZenz">User talk:SCZenz#Light Current (request from Hipocrite)</a>). As I try to explain in that section, <i>this</i> editor has very different patterns from Light current.</p>
<p>We must be very careful not to block people using Lc's IP range just for editing the reference desk; the editing must be disruptive or clearly in the style of Light current. Although it would save us a bit of headache if this particular user got an account, (s)he is well within his/her rights to keep editing anonymously. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 14:58, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. As pointed out elsewhere, this IP range belongs to a large ISP, so we should take care about collateral damage. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:03, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many of you are well aware of this long-running feud. I ask your indulgence.</p>
<p>On the advice of <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">JzG</a>, for the past couple of days I've been trying to stay away from the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Republic_0fa6.html" title="Free Republic">Free Republic</a> article. It has been the scene of many arguments and a lot of baiting and badgering by <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">FAAFA</a>. JzG also advised the two of them, in the strongest possible terms, to leave me alone. I thought that moving to a different article might make a difference.</p>
<p>They have now abandoned that article and followed me to the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Roskam_8f5d.html" title="Peter Roskam">Peter Roskam</a> article, where their baiting and badgering continues unabated, directed at myself and at others. Review of the article's history proves that I started editing it and then they did. This is not a coincidence. Please take note of the consistent tone of mockery in these diffs, such as the frequent interjection of "LOL!" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106191225" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106191225" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106272026" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106272026" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106381482" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106381482" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106388245" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106388245" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106397361" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106397361" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106459864" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106459864" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106462523" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106462523" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106484174" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106484174" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106486657" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106486657" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106491582" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106491582" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106499981" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106499981" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106517999" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106517999" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106521209" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106521209" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106521924" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106521924" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106525045" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106525045" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106547617" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106547617" rel="nofollow">[33]</a></p>
<p>Here's a case where FAAFA edited another user's post: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106517934" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106517934" rel="nofollow">[34]</a></p>
<p>I informed FAAFA that I did not appreciate his Wikistalking, that he no longer had an excuse for it since I had provided the answer he had repeatedly demanded, and asked him to stop: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106560698" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106560698" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> But the baiting and badgering continued from both of them, unabated: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106563003" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106563003" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106570585" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106570585" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106579975" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106579975" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> I again advised FAAFA that he had his answer, added more material that should have been the end of the matter and gave him a final warning about his Wikistalking: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106589895" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=106589895" rel="nofollow">[39]</a></p>

<p>Would anyone care to do something about this? Or am I on my own? Both of them have archives on their User Talk pages that are wallpapered with warnings and both of them have recently returned from 24-hour blocks: BenBurch for "incivility and misrepresentation," FAAFA for "personal attacks." Is there a solution to be had? Is there a doctor in the house? Here's the <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">relevant Wikipedia policy page</a> for guidance. Notice the incident where a 24-hour block was extended to an indefinite block, because it was a response to a continuous pattern of misconduct.

<p><b>COMMENT&#160;:</b> Dino quit editing the Free Republic article (he claims to be part of Free Republic's 'legal team') because he got banned as a sockpuppet, and one of the provisions he agreed to to get unbanned was that he would not edit that article. His own actions were what got me to visit, then edit the Peter Roskam article. He claimed on the Free Republic talk page that Free Republic members were 'instrumental' in Roskam's victory. I looked at the Roskam article for any mention of this (there isn't any) and immediatly saw POV problems including editors trying to hide and obfuscate Roskam's position on abortion - then DEMANDING that I find ANY Democratic politician whose abortion stance was similarly 'picked apart'. When I found two RIGHT off the bat - Dino changed his 'demand' to any 'Pro-choice Democratic politician'! (I kid you NOT!) I plan on keeping a close eye on Dino's edits as long as he's on Wiki. As an admin correctly observed - he attempts to scrub any and all well-sourced criticism of subjects he supports with 'alphabet soups' of argumentative WP claims. (and prior to that, vieled and not-so-vieled legal threats of libel lawsuits against Wikipedia- until he was ORDERED to curtail the legal threats) - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">FAAFA</a> 23:11, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I remain remarkably calm. I simply seek a resolution of this dispute. I tried to walk away and was followed. That's really all there is to it, and <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> is crystal clear about what to do when someone walks away from a dispute and is followed. Both FAAFA and BB were warned by an administrator to stay away from me. Your respectful suggestions will do no good at all. As I've said, the archives of his Talk page are wallpapered with warnings and he has just returned from a 24-hour block for incivility. The same can be said for BenBurch with the minor distinction that he returned from his 24-hour block for incivility and misrepresentations about ten days ago. At this time, I'm not going to invest the massive amount of time it would take to refute each and every distortion in that "response."

<p><b>Dino 'moves the goalposts'</b> I should have just ignored him and come over here at that moment. Nevertheless, my response was civil.

<p>(outdented again) Dino, to some degree, you are bringing this on yourself because you are editing in a biased manner. That said, I think this situation would be considerably clearer if FAAFA and Ben completely and permanently disengage from you and let others keep an eye on what you're doing. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 00:19, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe there's only one way to convince them to "completely and permanently disengage."

I haven't looked yet, but there are probably even more warnings addressed to them on the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protest_Warrior_6648.html" title="Protest Warrior">Protest Warrior</a> Talk page and its archives. How many more times are they going to be given a final warning? The ArbCom rulings described in <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> are clear about this. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeanHinnen_6a4b.html" title="User:DeanHinnen">Dino</a> 00:22, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This alone should be proof enough of BenBurch's Bad Faith and ill-will to substantiate a block. Beyond that, however, I concur whole-heartedly with GeorgeWilliamHerbert's assessment of the edit style of Dino. He does edit in an agenda oriented way, and his freely admitted close association and pro-bono employment by FreeRepublic make his conservative bias plain as day. This inability to work towards NPOV on so many political pages is no doubt going to continue to provoke editors to engage in tendentious editing with Dino. He's been spoken to about this issue, which is separate from the BB/FAAFA thing, before. I bring it up here agian because it is a sgnificant underlying cause of so much hostility. Further, I think it's likely that the obverse applies to BenBurch and FAAFA, that they edit from a DU based Vista on the world, and their edit style also provokes conflict. I'm not sure how this should be handled.

<dd>I do not edit the Free Republic article. I only recommend edits on its Talk page. I have already remedied my COI problem; and I wish others would be as proactive in dealing with their own. On other articles, I am not attempting to introduce a conservative POV, but trying to remedy a left-wing POV that clearly violates not only <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a>, but also <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. One of the things I said in Unblock-en-l is that I recognize that "our side" has certain warts and blemishes; that I do not want a whitewash, and Free Republic doesn't want a whitewash either; that all I want is a fair and balanced NPOV article; but these two (and others) are putting all the warts and blemishes under a microscope, and seeking to make any article about "our side" all about the warts and blemishes. Go to your printer, print out a copy of the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Roskam_8f5d.html" title="Peter Roskam">Peter Roskam</a> article and a copy of the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melissa_Bean_dcff.html" title="Melissa Bean">Melissa Bean</a> article (using a Roskam version from just before I started editing it), lay them side by side and you'll see what I mean.

<dd>I didn't claim that you're only or merely editing in an entirely biased and nonconstructive way. You do have a clear and evident personal bias in your editing targets and style, however. If you were just being disruptive nobody would be standing up for you at all and you'd have been blocked permanently ages ago by now.</dd>
<dd>That said, I stand by my opinion that you have an agenda and are editing in a biased manner. In many cases, cooperation between opposing biased editors works fine and produced unbiased neutral articles. You, Ben, and FAAFA are obviously not such a cooperative collaborative dynamic tension. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 00:58, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I NEVER said you edit Free Republic, do NOT distract with smoke and mirrors. Do not misrepresent me to create the sense that I am attacking you. You are associated with them by your own free admissions, this was covered in your recent set of problems before, related to FR.</dd>
<dd>Further, your determination that Wikipedia is a battleground between " 'our side' " and " these two and others" (AKA THEIR SIDE) means you are fully aware that your editing is tendentious. NPOV is not determined by YOUR views on the subject, it's determined by accurate sourcing of information. If someone finds significant sources for including criticism, and writes it up with reasonably NPOV language, it's in. Your attitude comes off as that FACTS which are critical are the same as NPOV language which is critical but sources solidly, and so you remove both. This is a problem, and one which antagonizes the other side. Frankly, were I an admin, I'd be sorely tempted to find a way to give both sides a lengthy block for tendentious editing, edit warring, provactive edits in vio of bad faith and inciv. But as with so many of my AN/I edits, I remind all, I am just a user, not an admin. I have no power to act on this stuff, and may lack suitable familiarity with some facets of Wikipolicy. that said, i'ma go get me some sushi for dinner. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 00:59, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

That your instant reaction is to run to those very sections as shields against criticisms of your editing shows me you don't get them, and have never seen the other side, the front of your own shield. Three editors are here for extremely partisan motivations and behaviors, and for the resultant policy violations that their behaviors engendered.

<dd>Were it not for him doing all this I'd be editing articles about narrow gauge railroads and radio phenomena, but this was all so blatant.

<dd>You were told in the previous dispute to do <i>just that</i>: Edit other stuff, like Z gauge and RF Design. Instead, you went <i>right</i> after DeanHinnen. You went out of your way to find a new way to hassle and harrass him. Both GeorgeWilliamHerbert and myself have tried, as reasonable people, to engage the three of you. Instead, each of you is so entrenched in your own position that none of you can see beyond. I will not advocate a ban on you, as you have 'requested' above; I believe you are angry and upset and speaking in haste. However, such tempermental statements <i>certainly</i> support the idea that you need to take a cool off. I've already once said it's time for an ADMIN, I repeat that now. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 03:35, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I did. And I have not been to the FR article since then. And then he went right to an article in my watchlist. So I decided that I could engage even him in a civil fashion and have been very careful to do so. When he made edits I disagreed with I went immediately to talk and tried to engage him in a dialog. However, I will let the Roskam article be what ever it is going to be; Likely a campaign brochure for that esteemed gentleman as long as Dino keeps editing it. However the facts are the Dino escalated into mega-incivility as soon as it was obvious to him that the only means of having his way with this article was to drive everybody else away! You will note that I compromised on a number of edits there, BTW. I cannot think of one point he has ever compromised on. But I'm done with it, and maybe with Wikipedia too. I'm sorry for wasting your time. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 03:44, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I argue that there is only one effective resolution for that, and it's clearly spelled out in the related ArbCom rulings if admins will just follow those precedents.

<p>My purpose is to make Wikipedia better and safer. You may find this hard to believe, but in real life I have a reputation as a Peace Maker. That side of me was shown at Unblock-en-l. Maybe in real life it comes down to my tone of voice and body language. I have always advised the Free Republic legal team to allow me to seek amicable resolutions, and I have always been successful; even in this case, I successfully convinced FAAFA to remove the libelous material from the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Republic_0fa6.html" title="Free Republic">Free Republic</a> article that I was originally concerned about. It is a demonstration of the propensity for needling and harassment by these two editors, and their consummate skill at getting under the skin of otherwise level-headed people, that I am now being accused of incivility. I want NPOV articles. I want to turn bad articles into Featured Articles. And I don't want any more Siegenthaler cases. I have taken steps toward all of those goals and I have been harassed every inch of the way. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeanHinnen_6a4b.html" title="User:DeanHinnen">Dino</a> 01:15, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1)You didn't convince me of anything. 2)The article still documents the death threats (against a sitting president) by Free Republic members. 3) Do you really think you should still be claiming that an article by a notable published author is 'libelous' in light of the numeous admins warnings about legal threats? - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">FAAFA</a> 01:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And I have taken pains to be even more civil towards Mr. Hinnen:</p>
<p><i>"The term "wiki-stalking" has been coined to describe following a contributor around the wiki, editing the same articles as the target, <b>with the intent of causing annoyance or distress to another contributor. This is distinct from following a contributor in order to clear repeated errors."</b></i></p>
<p>I ask any admin who's familiar with politics to look at this contribution from Mr. Hinnen, read the Thomas cite to HR 547, Roskams part in it, and judge if Mr. Hinnen, who once alluded to have worked on Roskam's 06 campaign, has or has not conflated Roskam's TINY involvement with this house bill to appear MUCH more significant that it really is. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106698850" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Roskam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106698850" rel="nofollow">Fuel Bill - Diff</a> In truth, Roskam wasn't even a co-sponsor, and only added a MINOR admendment, like a host of politicians do to EVERY bill. Sure looks good in the article though, 'don't' it? (and people question why I'm keeping an eye on him)</p>
<p>Mr. Hinnen's text:</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_8.html" title="February 8">February 8</a>, Roskam introduced an amendment to pending legislation that advances the development of alternative energy while saving the taxpayers $10 million. It creates three new federal programs to support development of improved methods to transport and store ethanol and biodiesel, taking the money out of previously appropriated EPA funds. Illinois corn produces 40% of the ethanol used in the United States. "Environmental stewardship and fiscal responsibility are not mutually exclusive and I believe strongly in both," said Roskam. "Ethanol and other biofuels mean jobs for Illinois and clean air for our children." The Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act eventually passed by a vote of 400-3. <a href="http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/02/house_committee.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/02/house_committee.html" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR00547:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;" class="external autonumber" title="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR00547:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">FAAFA</a> 12:26, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just had to revert two spambots in quick succession which both posted huge amounts of Italian spam on this talk page, and - looking through the history - it's been happening quite a bit, from a variety of unrelated IPs. Most of the editing to the page in the last few days has been spam reversion, in fact; is semiprotection in order? (IP blocking won't help - this looks like a botnet - and the URLs are too diverse for URL-based blocking to be effective.) <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 02:44, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The issue's actually the talk page, not the article. And, as I mentioned, the URLs are too diverse to block - the most recent run used a bunch of sites from a free Russian webhost (hotmail.ru), but previous runs have included hundreds of randomly generated domains.

<p>This user is repeatedly making changes to a wide variety of pages introducing untrue facts. From their talk page it looks like this has previously been accepted as accidental vadnalism or unsourced comments, but the user is continuing to make these same "mistakes" (some of which could be considered quite humourous if this was Saturday Night TV and not an encyclopedia). This has already been reported as simple vandalism, but apparently is complicated.

<p>It's possible that some individual removals are good, but none of them are done in a good way, and the overall pattern is obviously frustrating for other editors, and hampers work on the articles—compare the talkpages. Note also how the same removals are repeated over and over. (If somebody would like to do some 3RR calculations, good luck—I didn't want to muddy the waters with that at the moment.) BabyDweezil has earned a block, in my opinion, and I regard it as merely deferred. If the ban is ignored, he/she gets it, is the way I see it. I'd really like avoid blocking, though, as I take the user to be editing in good faith and with the intention of improving articles. But it was getting so I had to do <i>something</i>.

However, should you take the time to review some of the history, you will find that I have largely been removing egregious violations of Wiki policy, gross distortions of fact, straight out fabrications and the like, but unfortunately, with the opposition of a pair or so of hard core, POV minded, intransigent editors who often inserted the distorted material in the first place. I have discussed all of my changes, and for what its worth, most changes have received a majority amount of support in the discussions (vs the hard core ideologues). Likewise Ive been faced with this bloc working together to restore flagrantly biased and incorrect material, with no more explanation than they arent happy with it being removed.

<p>I'm one of the involved editors. The problem with the guy is that he invests like 10 seconds to remove something, and then others have to invest a multiple of this to put it back. In some cases, he even agrees that it is properly sourced, but claims it is "out of context". But instead of taking the time to improve the text or write what is missing, he just deleted. Yes, this is frustrating.</p>
<p>So this "selective" ban is a good idea, because it gives him a chance to improve his manners. There are other editors (members of controversial groups) sharing similar viewpoints , but who are able to work things out without "delete first, discuss later". --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 19:45, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm another one of the "hard core, POV minded, intransigent editors." BabyDweezil continually deletes well-sourced pertinent material because he personally finds it to be "POV". He repeatedly asserts that by deleting "POV" material he is removing "distortion" from the articles (there are several articles involved) and thus restoring NPOV. His idea of achieving NPOV, as demonstrated about 25 times by my count, seems to be to delete everything that he disagrees with.</p>
<p>He also inserts OR into the text in order to identify clearly to the reader that a particular element of the article is "POV".</p>
<p>He has ravaged <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_apologist.html" title="Cult apologist">Cult apologist</a> to the point where it had to be protected. There is zero chance of achieving consensus and removing the block there because he is adamant about his edits being justified. Now he is starting in on <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a>. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 20:15, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regarding his statement above that "I have discussed all of my changes, and for what its worth, most changes have received a majority amount of support in the discussions (vs the hard core ideologues)." He <i>doesn't</i> discuss the removal of well-sourced material first. Then when he edit-wars and others don't, Talk discussions are then opened by <i>other</i> editors. He does <i>not</i> achieve majority support in the Talk discussions. He has perhaps two editors who weakly support him. However, on <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a> he has recently inspired a new editor who has declared his intention of removing <i>all</i> of the "POV" material in the article. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 20:26, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Despite the protestations that I spend "10 seconds" obliterating Wikipedia pages, the fact is I have spent a good deal of time and effort correcting extensive errors, falsehoods, and outright nonsense in these articles. the 2 editors above are consistently inable to respond civilly to my edits, nor to justify them within Wikipedia guidelines, so they instead have mounted a campaign to vilify me. The loudness of their complaints I believe is in proprtion to the disappoiuntment they may have in having at least a bit of their POV's toned down in the artciles. I stand by <i>all</i> the edits I have made, and am confident they will stand up to scrutiny. The articles were POV pushing horror shows frought with fabrications when I began, so ban me or not, at least they are now slightly improved. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 21:17, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

I can't believe that I yet again have to urge people to know the difference between a block and a ban. Bishonen is using the term "ban" for something different: an informal revocation of the right to perform a certain type of action. To pick irrelevant details out of WP:BAN off the mark. It's a ban on an action, not a ban on a user.</li>
<li>She's putting a message here to get community input on the new semi-block she's proposing, not to drum up support for a community ban. Administrators <i>block</i> for "I warned you not to do that anymore" altogether too often, and here's Bishonen trying to <i>avoid</i> blocking someone by working out a new alternative. She's saying that she wants input on telling a user, "Don't go around cutting large paths with a lawnmower to fit a point of view." The implied "or else" is "or you'll be blocked." The user is clearly ripe for a block, as Mr Darcy points out, and the user's intransigent response here suggests that he's (Dweazel Zappa is male) dedicated and devoted to repeating this action. He/she is getting a little extra AGF from Bishonen, that's all, and she's asking the rest of the community to comment. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:08, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I understand that the user is not banned from editing Wikipedia. I understand that the user is not banned from editing, or further editing a set of articles, or area. I understand the technical aspect of a block; the difference between block and ban. However, if I understood the message correctly, just banned from performing a certain action. If I have applied the definition of ban inappropriately, then <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">forgive</a> me. I understood the <b>potential</b> for this informal revocation to be enforced by a block, if the ban message was placed by an admin who has the technical ability to place a block. Making it a de facto formal revocation. Although the policy does not deliberately define this action, unless I have missed something, I think I applied it correctly. <a href="../../../n/a/v/User%7ENavou_3499.html" title="User:Navou"><font color="blue"><b>Navou</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/a/v/User_talk%7ENavou_af4c.html" title="User talk:Navou"><b><font color="blue">banter</font></b></a></sup> / <sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Navou2_d347.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Navou2"><b><font color="green">review me</font></b></a></sub> 22:20, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then you are on record as disagreeing with it? If so, are you therefore agreeing with just blocking the user, or would you prefer that no block take place and that this situation go to RFC, then RFM, then RFAR? At some point during all of that, I assume an RFCU would have to be taken, too. I agreed with Bishonen's position, myself, because it minimized the disruption without all of that, but I did want to see what others thought. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:30, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not entirely, I would like to see the user providing positive contributions, and the integrity of the encyclopedia preserved. Hopefully both can be served. I do not at this time, see RfC, or RFAR is necessary (and can probably be avoided) and don't understand how RFCU applies (help me out here). My best recommendation would be to talk to the editor about the behavior. Informal mediation may be of some use. DR should be conducted at the lowest level possible, when possible.

That policy is meant to restrict usernames that have an <i>actual</i> risk of being inflammatory. Our use of "excretory" in that policy is a euphemism for "shitting", pardon my French. If my username were "SweatingMan", would you say that it should be banned because perspiration is an excretory function?

Reed apparently makes a living exposing shady dealing in the real estate world; I don't know if he's legit or not, but his refs show he's notable.</p>
<p>I noted the references on the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_T._Reed_a4d8.html" title="Talk:John T. Reed">article talk page</a> and added the refs to the article itself. The stub also has enough content this time to qualify for retention.</p>

I removed the tag and left a note explaining my reasons on both his talk page and on the article talk page.</p>
<p>He later tagged the article again in spite of this.</p>
<p>I find it unusual that a new user would immediately be familiar with {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-spam_4537.html" title="Template:Db-spam">db-spam</a>}} 6 minutes after creating his account, but perhaps he's learned the ropes as an anon. I note that the vandalism policy <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html#Types_of_vandalism" title="WP:VAND">specifically cites</a> cites "Abuse of tags" as a form of vandalism. I'm reluctant, however, to go so far as accusing <a href="../../../j/s/c/User%7EJscottccre_d3c6.html" title="User:Jscottccre">Jscottccre</a> of vandalism so I've left another, <a href="../../../j/s/c/User_talk%7EJscottccre_5da3.html#Please.2C_do_not_keep_tagging_John_T._Reed_for_speedy_deletion" title="User talk:Jscottccre">longer note</a> explaining the rules in greater detail.</p>

<dd>In principle the reviewing admin should check the talk page before deleting and it should not get speedy deleted.

<dd>(edit conflict) Well, whether an article is spam is defined without reference to whether the subject meets the notability guidelines or not, but the whether the contents of the article are blatant advertising. That being said, this does not taste like spam. It is not an overt ad. In addition, it was created by an established user with diverse contributions, so it is not the usual hit-and-run by someone trying to promote himself. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 13:54, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A bunch of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cada2_9066.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cada2">new pages</a> were just created by a new user, User:Cada2 and it seems like each and every page is a biography with the exact text taken from the web page listed in the external link. I'm a new editor and I don't know if I should be marking all of these Cada2's pages as {db-spam}, {db-copyvio}, or what. Can someone else here give me an opinion? My gut feeling is that Cada2 is the owner of the web page listed in the external links, thus making all of these spam, but I'm not sure and I don't know if I should do anything aside from doing a speedy delete on all the pages (reason: copyvio) Some (most?) of the people in the pages are notable (well known musicians according to google), but the wikipedia articles just don't seem right. <a href="../../../d/z/u/User%7EDzubint_0a90.html" title="User:Dzubint"><font color="#8C8C8C"><b>Thomas Dzubin</b></font></a> <sub><a href="../../../d/z/u/User_talk%7EDzubint_af05.html" title="User talk:Dzubint"><font color="#8C8C8C"><b>Talk</b></font></a></sub> 19:04, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some don't seem to be copyright violations. I'd say that isn't the right choice for all of them. I'd go through and remove the links from all.

<dd>Definitely agreed with Dragons flight. There's one thing to someone saying "I like Stalin". I may not be able to comprehend why you would, but that's your opinion.

<dd>It's more complicated than that. You can be here to help write an encyclopedia. You can't be here to not help write an encyclopedia. As the person who reported this user to AIV (Southern Poverty Law Center is on my watchlist, I rvved a page blanking, and then saw the user page after dropping a bv), it was my perception that this user was of the second type. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 17:09, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That would be a separate issue, and I doubt it would have been brought here and the user would not have been blocked if it had simply said "George W. Bush must be impeached!", and if the user had blanked a page with such a statement he would have been given warnings starting from level 1 to level 4 nonsense.

<dd>And the fact remains that "I support Stalin", "I support the Chinese Communist Party", and "I support the National Democratic Party of Germany" are allowed, while "I support Hitler" is not.

<dd>It's not. In the process of reviewing an AFD I found that myself and someone with diametrically oppposed views on most things both believe that something is an unreliable source. With that piece of info, I excised it as a source from a multitude of articles. A few of those articles were slightly contentious (most were just drive-by external linkings). Only this one was an outrageous flareup as the owner of the article decided my removal of one sentence and one source was me denying the holocaust. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 16:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Quiet until 30 January.

There was already a {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest1_2f2b.html" title="Template:Test1">test1</a>}} and a {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest2_cdb7.html" title="Template:Test2">test2</a>}} since the last block on 24.79.132.118's <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.79.132.118.html" title="User talk:24.79.132.118">talk page</a>, so I added a {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest3_288f.html" title="Template:Test3">test3</a>}} and an <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.79.132.118.html#Your_recent_edits_to_User_talk:Chameleon3322" title="User talk:24.79.132.118">encouraging message</a> expressing many warm fuzzies about how to become a productive Wikipedian. <b>The response was "f**k you all! do you think i care?", followed by more vandalism</b> to my <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillscrlt_ad5a.html#shitface" title="User talk:Willscrlt">talk page</a> and also to <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignatius_of_Loyola_8402.html" title="Ignatius of Loyola">Ignatius of Loyola</a>.

Since the recent round of attacked seemed focused on Chameleon3322 and nobody else (until I intervened), it's possible that this is someone who knows Chameleon3322 in real life, but he doesn't know who it might be.

<p>I've recently been involved in a dispute. Initially the two editors were involved in a lot of name-calling, resorting to ad hominem arguments in order to make their points, and at best using <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original arguments</a> to support their positions. I gave them both some reasoned advice about Wikipedia, and one of them has seemed to adapt to our rules. The other has been, apparently, campaigning on another web site for more editors to come and support his position. Anyone interested in the specifics will not have a hard time digging them up from my talk page, but I think this sums up the relevant points. Obviously, we could block the campaigners but there's been no warning... but on the other hand, the damage may already be done. How should we handle this situation as a general point?

<dd>Am I already involved? To be honest I think the editor in question (and I'm speaking of the one who is campaigning) is rather <a href="../../../t/e/_/WP%7ETE_1869.html" title="WP:TE">WP:TE</a>... I've been pretty close to blocking him for <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> already but I've been trying to be a bit reasonable because I was trying to broker something of an agreement there. IMO, the more long time contributors who get involved the better. We really need some people who are not trying to push a POV there. Beyond that, new contributors are always welcome to participate, but anyone who newly registers and shows up there pushing one side of the debate should be taken with a grain of salt. I also think my expiring protection of the page should be indef'd for the time being.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 02:07, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
