<dd>Based on the above quotes, I'd say that a block was legitimate and justified. I'd also contend that a username like "School inclusionist" is inapropriate as its highly likely to have been created for a single issue and will cause/inflame disputres, and therefore is very unlikely to contribute anything positive to the encylopædia (regardless of whether schools merit inclusion or not, conflict is never desirable). <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 02:01, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've already asked for the sockcheck. To be clear, I did not block School Inclusionist as a GRider sock. I blocked it as a disruptive sock. Creating an account with the explicit purpose of voting a controversial position in deletion debates is disruptive. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 03:18, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Update:I've gotten some outside information (Not a sockcheck) that says that School Inclusionist is not GRider, but that it is a sock of an established user. The sock was also apparently run through a proxy, so as to make a sockcheck pointless. So we have a sock created to be bitchy about the school deletions, maintained by an established user who has gone out of his way to disguise his identity. I'm not unblocking this one. If nothing else, it serves to close out the proxy. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 03:38, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a question about the School Inclusionist issue... there are a number of other recently created socks-to-make-a-point (User:School deletionist and User:GRuder come to mind, and User:Navid whose first edit is VfD'ing a FA). Why is there a policy to allow these people to hide behind anonymity? If one creates a sock that is then blocked for vandalism (as the first two I mentioned), shouldn't the original user be held accountable? If one creates an account for <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> or insulting someone, shouldn't the original user be held responsible?</p>
<dl>
<dd>That sounds like a good idea, though it isn't policy yet. But blocking accounts clearly created for disruption (as these have) is within policy. And School Inclusionist was also pretty clearly created to try to get GRider into trouble. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 10:37, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In a related point, it has been alleged that a certain user has two established accounts, used for double-voting. If true, that sounds unacceptable. If false, it should be possible to clear his name of the accusations. But the anonymity policy makes both impossible. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 10:24, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Usual thing to do is shrug off the accusations. Or ask on their talk page and they answer "no." Then the answer should be accepted in good faith unless there's good evidence otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(I have the power of limited sock-checking, but it's somewhat controversial so I can't use it very much - clear ArbCom purposes, pretty much. I recently used it to check on an apparent sock abuse by Rienzo, which it turns out almost certainly was him. That level of thing. Casually looking people up, I can't really do, and the devs who can generally won't, often 'cos they're too busy.) - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 10:37, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In fact, edits are being made to the relevant (Korea-related) pages mainly by people who aren't logged in, sometimes signing themselves "POofYS".

<dd>One problem is that there's no way to know what a particular person's edit history is; what seems to be an account actually just functions as a shared IP address. The point here, though, is that it doesn't accord with the Wikipedia rules; any discussion, therefore, should take place with regard to a proposed change of rules.</dd>

<p>This account has identified itself in the past as the "Press Office of Yi Seok" (See <a href="../../../y/i/_/Yi_Seok_7e0f.html" title="Yi Seok">Yi Seok</a>), but at last one post from an anon account has been signed "POoYS". It is not a Korean government entity. Yi Seok is a pretender to the Korean "throne", although his cousin Yi Ku seems to have the stronger claim to be head of the Royal House, since his father was the crown prince. A couple of years ago Yi Seok was invited by a Korean city to live on the grounds of a historical site, in the hopes he would enhance tourism. Before that he lived out of his van. And before that he lived in Southern California where he owned a liquor store. These are pretty small-time people living in the glory of their dynastic past. The account is used to make edits to a variety of articles to further Yi Seok's claims and idiosyncratic views about Korean history. "Press Office" is the grandiose term used by one or at most a small number of people associated with him. I was trying to counter all this for a while, but eventually gave up since the POoYS people were a lot more motivated to get their POV into articles than I was to keep it out. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:07, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's true that Yi Seok is only a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretender.html" title="Pretender">pretender</a> to the Korean throne, but then again <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caroline%2C_Princess_of_Hanover_5bc5.html" title="Caroline, Princess of Hanover">Caroline, Princess of Hanover</a> is only a pretender to her title as well (though it's used officially in Monaco, Germany is now a republic). Probably we should rename that article back to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caroline%2C_Princess_of_Hanover_5bc5.html" title="Caroline, Princess of Hanover">Princess Caroline of Monaco</a>, but it seems that in practice we do have a bit of tolerance for royalist pretensions. Anyways, last time I got involved in <a href="../../../y/i/_/Yi_Seok_7e0f.html" title="Yi Seok">Yi Seok</a> the POoYS folks did have a bit of a propensity for edit war. It's quite possible that POoYS is a single person posing as an office to puff up his importance. If they're banned, they'll probably just go back to using multiple anon IPs, so I'd rather unban and keep track of their contributions. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 19:41, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As an aside, your example is bad on two counts. First, Caroline is Princess of Hanover because she married the Prince of Hanover. She is Princess of Monaco in her own right, being the daughter of the late Prince Rainier, the ruler of Monaco. I don't think the Prince of Hanover is a "pretender", anyway, since German titles of nobility are legally held and can be defended in German courts, just as in France, even though, of course, Germany and France are republics. If you go to Germany and call yourself the Prince of Hanover, the "real" Prince can sue to stop you. This is almost the only remaining legal significance of the titles. It is sort of like an Internet domain name. I don't know if there is anything similar in the Korean courts, but I don't think so. Second, Yi Seok is only a pretender to being pretender, because if there is a "pretender" it is Yi Ku, his cousin, whose father was the Crown Prince. There is almost no basis for Yi Seok's pretensions, although he is a grandson of the last Korean Emperor. He tries to make much of the fact that Yi Ku lives in Japan and is a Japanese citizen, as if you need to live in Korea to be the real "pretender". As far as your theory that POoYS is a single person "puffing up his importance": I'd buy that. Puffing up their importance seems to be what these folks are all about. We have at least one other example of Wikipedia being used in this way, but there are probably others. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">User:Tancarville</a> has slanted several of the Wikipedia articles on Maltese nobility to support his father's claim to be a Prince. He runs a pest extermination company in Sydney, Australia. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:04, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Any anon which claims to be a logged in User and is not logged in with that account should be reverted on sight and blocked from editing. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 04:23, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just got an email from POofYS saying: <i>"Does it not make sense that one person is handling this account with research prepared by other people? Is this not the usual practice with a head editor? Thankyou. HEAD EDITOR"</i> So, um, I'm not sure if it's one person or not. If it is one person I wouldn't block it, it was that they <i>said</i> they were multiple people. If anyone feels it's reasonable to unblock, please go ahead and do so. (POV-pushing is not itself a blocking reason, nice as it would be if it was ...) - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 09:40, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That flatly contradicts what it says (or said) on the page itself. In fact, most of the editing was being done by people who weren't signed in, sometimes manually signing as 'POoYS'. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 14:20, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Brian0918 has been revert warring in a content dispute by calling the other user's edits "vandalism". I contend that the opposing user's edits do not constitue an "indisputable bad-faith addition, deletion, or change to content, made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of the encyclopedia". The users, an anon IP with slightly different IPs each time, and Brian0918 have been fighting over
<ul>
<li>what portrait image to use,</li>
<li>the line "what his propaganda called the Third Reich" versus "the Third Reich", and</li>
<li>the line "The military-industrial complex he fostered pulled Germany out of the post-World War I economic crisis and, at its height, controlled the greater part of Europe" versus "The <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military-industrial_complex.html" title="Military-industrial complex">military-industrial complex</a> he fostered dominated most of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> at its zenith."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is clearly a content dispute, and Brian0918 is not correct in reverting the user four times. <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 22:53, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Note that I was talking with at least two other admins on IRC at the exact time that happened, and they agreed that it was vandalism. One of them protected the page (I didn't ask them to, they said it was the best option), and the other admin said he was going to block the IP range for 24 hours (though apparently he never actually did). The anon was repeatedly disconnecting and reconnecting to change his IP every couple minutes, stacking up edits (I guess in the hope that some of his changes wouldn't get rolled back). The anon also made POV additions to other controversial pages (such as <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stalin_46d2.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>) which the other admins I was talking to on IRC proceeded to revert. Also note that the version I was reverting to was the result of a consensus on the talk page and on IRC among myself and at least 3 others who cared to contribute. I left a note on the talk page for the anon to contribute but he has yet to. I didn't realize I had reverted so many times; I considered it vandalism since the user was repeatedly changing his IP. In the future I'll just ask someone to protect the page instead of reverting repeatedly, or leave a note on the talk page and wait for the anon to respond. Sorry about that. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 23:37, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>"Consensus" means "polite discussion and negotiation, in an attempt to develop a consensus regarding proper application of policies and guidelines such as neutral point of view". As you just told me on IRC, you think that consensus is (quote) "whoever feels like being there at the moment". I don't think these are in line. I also disagree that being anonymous gives an editor any illegitimacy. IMO reverting in this content dispute doesn't grant you immunity from the 3RR because you discussed it with a few people, and being an administrator, you shouldn't have edit warred on the page. With regards to the user changing IPs, it was probably because you kept <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Brian0918&amp;page=" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Brian0918&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">blocking him/her to enforce your version</a> while calling them a "vandal". If another admin disagrees that this was a content dispute they can unblock you. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilsor_f92e.html" title="User:Silsor">silsor</a> 23:48, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)

<li>How do the anon's three changes constitute vandalism? I do not see how the anon's choice of image, minor change of wording, and change in scope regarding the effect of his rearmament program are inherently damaging or in bad-faith. <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 23:52, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It was the fact that the anon kept repeatedly changing his IP for no apparent reason that made me think of it as vandalism. Also the fact that he was reverting to an very old, non-consensus version. As for my statement on IRC about what consensus is, I wasn't being serious, and as silsor said, IRC is not Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 23:57, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're kind of side-stepping it by talking about what you thought at the time. What I am asking is, are the anon's edits vandalism, or are they not? <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 00:00, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

This version was edited into the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&amp;oldid=11308248" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&amp;oldid=11308248" rel="nofollow">current version</a>" by brian0918 and saved by <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> after much discussion on the <a href="../../../a/d/o/Talk%7EAdolf_Hitler_3520.html" title="Talk:Adolf Hitler">talk page</a>. Since then, it has remained stable until the above reversion by the anon IP(s). The "stable" version I believe to represent consensus, since it was reached by discussion on the talk page: <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>, brian0918 and <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">myself</a> holding the position for the stronger wording, while Wyss expressed concerns over its POV. However, since Wyss himself saved the "stable" version identified above, and didn't continue the discussion, this is strong evidence to me that a consensus of interested parties was reached.

<p>Wikipedia works because most people want the article to get better, and can agree to a certain extent on how that is done. While there are still a small percentage of people who want the article to get worse (more biased, or less informative), they are drowned out in the flood of good faith editing. The three revert rule exists because sometimes two (or more) people who are trying to make the article better can't decide on how to do it. Because sometimes people resort to force instead of dicussion, the 3RR is a safeguard to prevent edit-warring in place of consensus reaching. This is not disputed by anyone (that I know of). However, there are consequences of this that seem to be missed here:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number three and the time period 24 hours are arbitrary. These constants are used by the people invoking the rule to judge whether a series of reverts constitutes edit-warring. One person can revert innocently, another can re-revert almost as innoncently, but a third revert of an edit is an <b>indication</b> of an edit war. It is not, however, proof.</li>
<li>The rule is not to be applied in cases where it is clear that the reverts were of bad faith editing, such as vandalism, testing, spam, and purposeful PoVication</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we have a jurisprudence, let us analyse the facts to see if the 3RR applies in this case. It appears to me (though I have not the time nor inclination to examine the edit history) that brian's reverts were all revertions of bad faith edits. The anonymous user who was reverted used multipled IP adresses to (re)insert PoV content, or otherwise disrupt the article. If it is considered by anyone that the anonymous user in question had a valid point in his edits, and that discussion of his views needs to be done prior to revertion of his edits, please come right out and say it, because I don't think it actually is.<br />
<b>Conclusion:</b> Brian was trying to maintain the quality of the article by reverting edits made in bad faith. He was not entering into a stale edit war with another well-intending Wikipedian. Therefore, the 3RR does not apply in this case, and brian should not be blocked. The anonymous editor ought to be blocked, but because of his wide IP range, it <s>would</s>might not be possible without disenfranchising many other potential editors.<br />
<b>Action:</b> unblock Brian0918<br />

<dd>I find it remarkable that in all of this, no one has yet demonstrated how this user's edits were vandalism. On the talk page, I see one section by Brian0918 in which he says 83.109.*.* "keeps readding the same content over and over without first consulting or replying on the talk page, and despite repeated reversions." <i>That</i> is not vandalism, Brian0918 is in no better of a position than the anon there--so exactly <i>why</i> is this vandalism as is being casually assumed? I also think it is careless for you to make judicial-like proclamations when you say you have not so much as examined the page history. <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 01:13, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>They certainly weren't vandalism. However, they were all reversions to a previous version of the article that lost important, talk-page-vetted edits by brian0918, myself and Tony Sidaway. I'm not complaining that that the 3RR was misapplied in this case: however, I believe it's incorrect to say "brian0918 is in no better of a position than the anon there." I think a better resolution of this situation would have taken into account both brian0918's violation of 3RR as well as an accurate picture of what was happening with the page content. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 04:37, 2005 Apr 13 (UTC)</li>

Looks like abusing Wikipedia as a free home page provider. It's a case where the same mechanism (copy to user space) is even used across wikis to preserve deleted articles. Note that here on the en: Wikipedia, this user has so far kept a low profile and has not yet (AFAIK) been engaged in any controversies.

<p>There's a problem here. The assumption seems to be that once something is gone, it's gone forever. But when I keep articles in my userspace, I don't just do it so I can gaze lovingly at them from time to time; I do it with the idea that someday it will again have an article, so I'm just preserving the information until opinions about it change to what I feel is the correct decision. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:41, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, some people have massive user pages filled up with all kinds of stuff, and subpages twice as long as that.

<dd>I made my point. The point is always the same: he's too harsh. And he says it on his user page: he will do things at will outside of policy, too, according to his own common sense.

<p>Please see this item on the block log:</p>
<p><b>"03:23, 7 Apr 2005, Neutrality blocked 216.153.214.94 (expires indefinite) (contribs) (Banned user Rex disruptively editing from a (static) IP address. If he wants to make legit edits, he can edit under his username.)"</b>.</p>
<p>Without getting into the details of the many run-ins I've had with Neutrality, I'll just point out that his rationale for blocking me appears to be false. I am not a "banned user".</p>
<p>Also, regardless of whether or not Neutrality thinks I ought to use the "Rex" account of Rex071404, the fact is that the Wiki does not require that I log in. That being the case and since it's clear to various Admins who 216.153.214.94 is, I see no logic of any kind in Neutrality's indefinate block of me.</p>
<p>Also, Neutrality has shown himself to be rather blind to the ramifications of his block against me - as evidenced by his self-contradictory position. One one hand, he blocks my IP address yet, on the other he says "If he wants to make legit edits, he can edit under his username". This is nonsense. Neutrality certainly knows (or at least ought to know) that if .94 is blocked by IP address, I cannot edit from that address, logged in or not.</p>
<p>I am asking that my IP address of 216.153.214.94 be unblocked.</p>
<p>FYI: This log-in and edit performed from alternative IP address because I was unable to log-in via 216.153.214.94</p>

<dd>If he wants to edit constructively, he can do so under his regular username. My IP block has had the desired effect of forcing Rex to use his username. He <i><b>must</b></i> be accountable to the community at large, and especially the Arbitration Committee. And I had no "edit war" with Rex at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a>. Rex vandalized the page, in violation of Arbitration rulings, and many users (including myself) rolled back/reverted his changes. I find it frankly disappointing that an admin would immediately unblock the IP address of a known problem user—the subject of three Arbitration cases—without consulting the blocking admin first. It is especially disheartening that the user in question is able to edit anyway under the Rex username. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a><sup><a href="../../../n/e/u/User_talk%7ENeutrality_6997.html" title="User talk:Neutrality">talk</a></sup> 05:25, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Please notice that Neutrality is missing the point. His blocking rationale was indeed falsely premised and self-contradictory. I edit from 216.153.214.94 and Neutrality certainly knows this. If that IP address is blocked, I cannot edit from it <i><b>regardless</b></i> of whether I log in or not. When one is "blocked" via IP address block, log-in or not, <b>no editing</b> can be done from that IP address. Also, please take notice that at <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">Rex071404</a> and <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.153.214.94.html" title="User:216.153.214.94">216.153.214.94</a> I have left copious details for all editors and admins to make plain how to contact me. I've given up trying to reason with Neutrality. He never replies to any of the talk page comments I leave for him. In fact, those comments which I leave on his personal talk page, he deletes. <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">Rex071404</a> 06:06, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a little confused. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a> stated that <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">Rex071404</a> was banned when he wasn't, but I'm to blame, because I didn't realise that Neutrality didn't mean what he said, and so I should have asked him what he <i>really</i> meant. Have I got that right? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 10:12, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Problem user or not, as long as he is allowed to edit an article he is allowed to edit the article under any IP he wishes. And if the IP is used by him exclusively and has a note who he is, I don't see any reason why that IP should be blocked at all. If he disobeys any remedies from his ArbCom cases though he should of course be penalized for that, regardless under which name or IP he edits. Just my two cents. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 10:44, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This individual is going on a POV rampage in the Ward Churchill article. It is pretty obvious that the two usernames are the same individual. Alas, providing clear diffs is difficult because many of his reverts are done in small batches, one minute apart.

However, he's shifted M.O. slightly, to slapping TotallyDisputed tags on dozens of articles without justification, and making large "NPOV" removals. I think a block of some sort would be in order, but I'm neither an admin nor a neutral party. If not, somebody needs to keep a close eye on his contributions -- I'm fed up with this nonsense and will probably be taking a bit of a wiki-vacation. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 00:35, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He might be a sock, or he might just be kind of trigger-happy with the TotallyDisputed tags. At <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party (United States)</a> (where I encountered him) and other pages, he seems to slap tags on the pages without really being able to fix them, and he tends to just remove material when he thinks it's biased or has some doubt to its veracity – quite annoying wikiquette. If it makes us cite sources and make sure what we have is correct, though, then it might result in a better article. (But man, those tags make the article so ugly!) <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">T<small>IMBO</small></a> <a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimeheadnyc_9f02.html" title="User talk:Limeheadnyc"><font color="black">(<small>T&#160;A&#160;L&#160;K</small>)</font></a> 01:45, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>He's not just slapping tags on articles, or removing material which is uncited. He's also removed well-sourced material (see <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Dean_da7d.html" title="Howard Dean">Howard Dean</a>). IMO, we need to deal strictly with people who are clearly here to cause conflict, rather than contribute encyclopedic material. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 02:51, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>He changed the sortkey on <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_State_Highway_25_0a04.html" title="Ohio State Highway 25">Ohio State Highway 25</a> from 025 to 25, which puts it between 249 and 250. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 04:07, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The problem with using the initial "0", it appears, is that '<i>all</i> such entries (meaning highways 1-99) get lumped under "0" on the Category page (see <a href="../../../o/h/i/Category%7EOhio_state_highways_bf1a.html" title="Category:Ohio state highways">Category:Ohio state highways</a>). The occasional oddity of of "25" between "249" and "250" seems worth the trade-off. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:18, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the case where there are a lot of state highways, it makes sense to put all two-digit routes in 0 to preserve order. When there are few, the three-digit routes can be preceded with the letter A to put them after the two-digit routes. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 05:27, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Two things: 1) This is the administrators's noticeboard, and I don't see how this discussion has anything to do with them. 2) The <a href="../../../o/h/i/Category%7EOhio_state_highways_bf1a.html" title="Category:Ohio state highways">Category:Ohio state highways</a> has 10 highways: of those, <i>6</i> are lumped under "0" because of your classification schema.

<dd>As mentioned earlier, it's probably best to just rename the password instead of blocking, and to leave a note on the user page, such as on User:Faethon. If you're not an admin (and I'm not), mention it here to have an admin reset Iasson's ban. Since Iasson will probably never give up, it might be best to set up some "guidelines" for how to deal with his accounts so we're consistent. This is getting a little ridiculous. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 12:06, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>We should definitely come up with a set of guidelines for this.

<dd>Yeah, that's fine (and thanks, BTW), I'm on a dynamic IP anyway. I'm just thinking that we should probably come up with a few guidelines on what to do with public accounts (such as: log in, change the password, leave a note that it's no longer a public account, make a post to the admin's noticeboard to reset Iasson's block if you're not an admin). That way, we're all on the same page with how to deal with the Faethon Family Smile Time Variety Show. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 18:07, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thryduulf - good idea creating a page to keep track of these; however, you might want to rename it "Iasson sockpuppets" or somesuch in case he changes his MO. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 21:00, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think whatever public account we discover, we have to mark it as ex-Faethon's sockpuppet account, and currently soccpupet account of the person who reverted it, as long as after reverting it it belongs to the person who reverted it. I erased all false references of sockpuppetry from the ex-public accounts, and I put as sockpuppetry suspect the name of the person who reverted the account and confirmed that he did it here. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgesilaus_I_a13d.html" title="User:Agesilaus I">Agesilaus I</a> 15:56, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I do not have control over any user that was a public account.

<dd>Hi David. Of course we come from greek providers, althouth we could use some anonymizers, but thats not what we want, as long as our goal is our public accounts case to be legalized in wikipedia. The point is that you have to make a trial against public accounts or ask consensus about that. The point is that you have to have rules, and follow the rules you define and not doing whatever you like. The decision you took in Iasson's case does not cover our case, and it is unfair to ban us because of Iasson or to consider anyone coming from our country to be Iasson. <b>The Faethon group is not using sockpuppets, and we are not casting peculiar votes in Vfd</b>. So why dont you want us? We are waiting for a trial decision against us, then we are going to stop publishing our password. <b>In the meanwhile, please unblock the accounts you illegally blocked, and give back our ex-accounts and currently abuse sockpuppets to Thryduulf and the others</b>. They tried hard to get them and it is not fair to take them from them. They are now thinking what our plan C is, so , in the meanwhile, we think they are not going to use them to abuse wikipedia.

But what can we do, in case there is a private account which posts copyvio information in his/her userpage? Even worst, what can we do if he/she posts original_research-like information, that is actually copyvio that we cannot spot using a google search?

<dd>That funny!&#160;:) I think you confuse accounts, with persons. I am talking about accounts. I think that any account having in its userspace original research documents has to be proposed for deletion, as suspicious for possible copyright violation. Raving Loony 12:27, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you mean Iasson, yes I am watching his case and I am having fun of it. My username was inspired by a tag someone put in Iasson's userpage. I also helped you to spot the exact list of greeks, in Iasson/Faethon Arbcom. I am from greece, thats why my prose style is familiar to you. Raving Loony 13:05, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, you didn't help anyone with the ArbCom thing. And no, Iasson, I highly doubt all or most Greeks write in your unmistakenly fractured, subliterate style. So unless you take an intensive course in English composition to clean up your syntax over, oh, the next 15 months or so until your ban expires, you'll be spotted in a heartbeat every time you post a full sentence. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 13:24, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've just undertaken a very unscientific survey.

<dd>You've better undertaken a scientific survey instead. You ll find out that my writting patterns are not like the patterns of Iasson. My patterns may are similar, because we are both greeks and we think with a similar grammar syntax, but not identical. Try it. Do you have any scientific tool that is able to investigate such similarities? Raving Loony 14:37, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as policy is concerned no. Personaly I don't see any point. If he can keep to his self imposed block then that would appear to be a pretty good declaration of good faith.

<dd>Since it looks to me like part of the motivation for a self-imposed sentence was to take one at half the length of the likely arbcom imposed sentence, I'd say go ahead and block. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 23:32, Apr 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did he ask you to block him? -&gt; Policy: No; Morally: It's probably alright. If not, then I would say definitely no. You shouldn't use your sysop powers to enforce somebody's <i>self-imposed</i> ban. Like all other users who have gone on a wikibreak or have left completely, Rex should be left to handle this himself. Also, if he later decides to come back, he shouldn't be prevented by technical means. You're effectively forcing him to fulfill this ban on himself. IIRC, sysops aren't even supposed to block themselves, so blocking somebody else would be completely out of line. But all this is IMHO of course. -<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrazzydee_a9f9.html" title="User:Frazzydee">Frazzydee</a>|<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrazzydee_457f.html" title="User talk:Frazzydee">✍</a> 23:48, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unless he has committed a blockable offense, like repeated vandalism or violating an ArbCom ruling that calls for blocking, I don't believe he should be blocked. Certainly not for simply stating he won't be editing for this time. Is there any other reason to block him? Otherwise, Grunt, I think you should unblock him. This block appears to be inappropriate to me. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 00:58, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have unblocked Rex. I believe that it is an inappropriate block and against <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">policy</a>: "self-blocking to enforce a Wikiholiday or departure are specifically prohibited." Although the policy says that <i>self-blocking</i> is prohibited, I think that we can infer that it would also be prohibited for a sysop to block another user. But even if not, the blocking policy also says "Blocking should not be used in any other circumstances, unless there is exceptional widespread community support." AFAIK, blocking other users to enforce a ban is neither sanctioned in the blocking policy nor does it have widespread community support. -<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrazzydee_a9f9.html" title="User:Frazzydee">Frazzydee</a>|<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrazzydee_457f.html" title="User talk:Frazzydee">✍</a> 17:54, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, Grunt should not have blocked him. He did not ask to be blocked, you had no reason to block him, and even if the ArbCom imposed a block they aren't supposed to carry it out themselves (correct me if I'm wrong here). --<a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDuk_3ef6.html" title="User:Duk">Duk</a> 19:10, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A "Copyright statement", whatever that might be, is not required. If he took the pictures, he owns the copyright; if he didn't, then whoever did take them owns it. In this instance, if he chose to sue, I don't think fair use would fly.

<dd>If he requested the accounts to be merged, I don't think he's got any evil intentions. Maybe we can recommend him to link between the accounts.

<p>He seems to have various problems; he's posting from the Wikizap account but manually signing as Mr Tan, and earlier he was manually signing and giving a date seven days in the future... He's also been accusing other editors of writing poor English when his own is sometimes scarcely understandable. He seems not to have felonious intent in this case, though. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:59, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a chap who has been inserting stuff like "666 the number of the beast" into this article for months now. Now he's doing weird big edits--possibly reverts to an earlier version, I honestly don't know. He is using an Earthlink dynamic IP and clearly does not intend to participate in Wikipedia or abide by the decision to block him for earlier vandalism. Might be worth having a look at what he's up to. I expect we'll have to protect soon, but I don't like to cave in so easily. Maybe he can be reasoned with. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:31, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>He is reverting, as many beast vandals do, to an earlier version of the text, probably because it is considered more accurate to beast believers than the current neutral version. In my opinion the old text was full of planted evidences about how Solana is getting too much power in order to convince Christiands who have read elsewhere that Solana is the Beast, a view publicly espoused by User:Cumbey, who was a major editor of the reverted version of the text. See [<a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread65962/pg1" class="external text" title="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread65962/pg1" rel="nofollow">here</a>, --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 02:43, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Concur with SB. I suspect nothing short of a "block on sight" will get rid of this, so perhaps an RfC is the place to start, awkward though that is with "moving target" IPs. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 06:20, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm biased, of course, but I'm glad the ArbCom ruled on this. We had to jump through a lot of hoops to bring this user to book (discussions on Talk pages/IRC/mailing list, an RfC, an arbitration case), and Irate had <i>plenty</i> of chances to reform himself, but he chose to continue behaving badly. Everyking -- have you actually studied this user's behaviour? You'd be wise to do so before hinting about the credibility of the case — it's pretty clear-cut. Moreover, in my opinion, this was a case of Wikipedia being too tolerant of problem users, not too lenient. It would have saved us a lot of hassle if admins could have, from the beginning, been permitted to give Irate a 24 hour block every time he lashed out with personal abuse — this would have solved the problem last month, without wasting everyone's time (so we can get on and write an encyclopedia, you know). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 22:58, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Everyking, I'm an administrator who errs on the side of caution, who tries to discuss often and block infrequently. But have you looked at the RFAr's <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Irate_Evidence_73c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Irate/Evidence">evidence page</a> before you made your comments? Many people tried to reason with him; at best, they were ignored; at worst, he vandalized their user pages. Once during his RFAr he agreed to stop making personal attacks but soon resumed. I'm all for Wikilove, but Wikilove can only go so far. If people cannot modify their behavior to work well with others, then stronger measures may be necessary. Our first goal is to create an encyclopedia, and frankly I believe Irate was hindering that, both directly in his contributions and in his disrespectful dealings with other users. I see nothing about this matter that could be considered "petty politics". I really hope that Irate can reform and learn to work with the community, and perhaps when he returns from his ban you can work with him to act with more civility and respect for other editors, and to respond to messages on his talk page instead of deleting them as "vandalism". Then this won't be a problem in the future. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 04:02, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The way I look at it, a great many people in this world are not calm, cool-headed, or particularly rational. Nevertheless they have a great deal of knowledge to share and there are a great many ways they can contribute to the project. I don't believe banning Irate will help the project. Someone above said Irate has made good contributions. Well, what does that mean? To me, that means a lot; it means this person was not around just to cause us hell, but was interested in contributing to our encyclopedia, and we've banned him just because we couldn't find a way to tolerate him and let personality differences fall by the wayside. I think that represents a real failure of the community. We need to find a way to hold productive discussions with people we don't like without thinking all the while, Hmm, now how will this look in front of the ArbCom?

<dd>Everyking, I realize we disagree on this, but please understand that (I believe) most Wikipedians disagree with you: we should not tolerate this level of personal attacking, just because someone can offer a few good contributions as well. Yes, we're trying to build an encyclopedia. Those who are not calm, cool-headed, or rational will have to learn how to interact with others to be part of this team, a community who is working towards a common goal. <i>Interest</i> to contribute is not sufficient. I understand you believe that the Wikipedia community failed and not the editor, but you must realize that most do not agree. Furthermore, even if such users make some positive contributions, they waste the time of other contributors and even drive them off. <i>I</i> believe the community and the encyclopedia are harmed more by allowing rampantly abusive insults. Also, in the case of Irate, I suggest that you modify your sentence to read: "We need to find a way to hold productive discussions with people we don't like without them instantly reverting our comments as 'vandalism'." — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 05:48, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I, for one, would have greatly preferred Irate to simply have stopped making personal attacks than getting banned for 3 months. I don't know about the others, but that was my goal in the dispute resolution process. But the plain truth is that he simply refused to alter his behaviour; he said outright "<i>I don't give a fuck about Wikquette</i>". What should we have done? Would you prefer that we allow abusive editors to carry on unhindered, completely unsactioned?

<dd>"Because we're trying to build an encyclopedia" -- right. And I'd venture that for every editor like Irate that we tolerate, we drive off two other editors who see no reason to accept public abuse. Think of it in terms of sheer utility. Perhaps you don't get bothered by being called vile names; I venture you're a distinct minority. If I wanted flames, I'd go to usenet. The need for civil cooperation isn't a side-issue; it's at the core of how one puts together a collaborative open encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 05:59, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It isn't that I don't think civil cooperation isn't important. I think it is very important, and should be strongly promoted and encouraged. Of course that's the ideal. The problem is, it appears to me that what we've done to Irate by banning him is more abusive than whatever insults he tossed around, because one is just words while the other has a directly practical effect. I suppose I could be wrong about that, but that's how it looks to me. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:06, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Everyking, a practical suggestion here - maybe you could contact Irate and set up a dialogue with him. You may be able to discuss him returning when his ban expires, and help ensure that, if and when he does, there will be no further problems. Perhaps it might help for you to have a discussion with him about how he communicates with other users, and how he would like us to communicate with him.

<dd>I don't necessarily disagree with this decision, since there is a policy against personal attacks, and Irate violated it repeatedly. Personal attacks are very disruptive. On the other hand, it disturbs me to see Irate characterized as if he were simply a vandal and did nothing but go around outrageously attacking people. He did plenty of that, but he also made thousands of reaonable useful edits over a period of months. He was unable to control his anger, and Wikipedia was an environment which did not help him at all, indeed one which was frequently provocative -- "wiki love" and all that blather to the contrary notwithstanding. Wikipedia failed here, too, and considering its values, it should recognize it. -- <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 11:50, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>When you say "Wikipedia failed here", what do you mean, and what alternative do you suggest? We have two options here: permit both Irate's useful contributions and his endless personal attacks, or permit neither of them. When you suggest that the environment is provocative, I must point out that, if Irate had the capacity to restrain himself, he certainly gave no hint of it in his entire period here; in fact, he recognized his own irateness and gave himself a name which reflects it. Let's not be too hard on ourselves - it's counterproductive. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 15:25, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>While I agree with the need to try and help users and avoid provocation, I don't think this is a fair criticism in this instance. From my point of view, we bent over backwards to get Irate to reform (I was one of those taking him to ArbCom) — as you say, he made positive contributions. However, this user erupted without any provocation -- he was just abusive. He (by his own admission) didn't "give a fuck about Wikiquette". Even if he had been approached by the kindest, most considerate Wikipedians, I don't think it would have made much difference. While we should try our hardest to do "wikilove", we should, at the same time, recognise that a minority of users present an intractable problem. Wikipedia didn't fail here; Irate did. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 17:02, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Being one of those that had the most vitriol from him I feel that "Wikipedia failed here" is actually a little offensive. I tried and tried again to resolve the situation but his refusal to participate in normal talk page discussions and in the eventual RfC show that his attitude was unreasonable. My first encounter with him was many months prior to this decision and I think we've been more than fair in this case. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 18:46, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

While Irate did cause problems with other users, he did contribute to Wikipedia, and was obviously interested in improving it. Treating him like a common vandal or troll is not a very good solution, IMO. Sure it stops the personal attacks, but it also stops the positive attributes of having him here. Our primary goal is to build an encyclopedia. Establishing a community is, and always will be, a consequence of creating an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, there are better options for dealing with cases like this than just banning them (the easy way out), like we do for vandals. Unlike vandals and trolls, Irate <i>did</i> want to help Wikipedia by contributing, he was just more inflammatory than other users. One solution that I think would be more effective and mutually beneficial would be something along the lines of the following. I'll use myself in the example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Irate is banned from editing all talk pages (talk, user_talk, etc.) for <i>n</i> months. If Irate wishes to communicate through other users, he must do it through <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrazzydee_a9f9.html" title="User:Frazzydee">Frazzydee</a>|<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrazzydee_457f.html" title="User talk:Frazzydee">✍</a>, who will act as a proxy between him and the community.</li>
<li>Irate may only describe his edit in his edit summary. He may not use it as a vehicle for personal attacks.</li>
<li>Irate is limited to 1 revert every 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I think that would be a much better solution. Irate could contribute to the 'pedia without not pissing off others; but at the same time, he's still able to communicate with them. Having me (or somebody else) as a proxy will ensure that he can still discuss articles (this is important) while also ensuring that he isn't a detriment to the community. Unless there's other problems besides his lack of concern for wikiquette, wouldn't this be a much more constructive and mutually beneficial solution? -<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrazzydee_a9f9.html" title="User:Frazzydee">Frazzydee</a>|<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrazzydee_457f.html" title="User talk:Frazzydee">✍</a> 20:10, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At some point, the effort is simply not worth it. Ultimately this is a project to produce a great encyclopedia, not a rehabilitation facility for teaching people how to properly interact on Wikis. The amount of time wasted by Irate, and angst generated by his unrelenting hostility and personal attacks, can never be justified by his contributions, which weren't particularly earth-shattering. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:18, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed. As I said above we tried communicating with him and even an RfC, but if he isn't able to work with that simple process, and then went on to violate his temporary injunction, then why would we think that he'd behave under those conditions? <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 20:21, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To be honest, the best thing would be for Irate to curb his behaviour. It seems backwards that we should be wracking our brains to find an elaborate solution to what is, ultimately, Irate's problem. I don't see why we should put so much effort into accomodating users who show zero respect for others. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 20:33, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also agree that the best thing would be for Irate to contribute without being nasty to other editors, but the second best is for Irate to be banned. Frankly, no one's contributions are worth others putting up with constant abuse. There are large elements of society we have trouble getting to participate in Wikipedia because they are not so thick-skinned. I care much more about attracting them than someone who wants to imitate <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Rickles_279c.html" title="Don Rickles">Don Rickles</a>. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:50, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
