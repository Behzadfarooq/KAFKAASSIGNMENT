<h2><span class="mw-headline">Looks good, but...</span></h2>
<p>I removed "Courtesies, such as <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a>, that many editors use as an entitlement, might not apply." The 3RR is not a courtesy -- it is an electric fence. Otherwise, it looks okay, although to be honest I'm not sure if anything beyond the first couple of sentences in the note to admins is worth keeping. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 12:57, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, it's verbose. The 3rr thing, I was just trying to get across that convicted revert warriors shouldn't even be given 3rr. Tangent: IMHO, 3RR needs an edit before and a 4th revert to violate, for five edits in order to get blocked - that's too much for anyone. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 15:50, 20 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not necessarily an edit before; 3RR violations are sometimes to text inserted by someone else; and often to text inserted some months before, while the other portions of the article are rewritten by someone else. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 15:53, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Right to defend</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to propose to add the following clause to the note to administrators to better protect the right to defend, and to avoid actions being taken based on one-sided view: " <i>Action(s) should not be taken within the 168-hour (7-day) period after the relevant user(s) are notified at his/her/their user talk page(s), unless he/she/they has/have responded to the request(s) here, or has/have continued their disruptive behaviour. The period should be extended accordingly if the user(s) is/are blocked for whatever reason(s) within the period, so that his/her/their right to have sufficient time to defend his/her/their position(s) is guaranteed.</i> ". — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 21:52, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This <b>is not</b> another step of dispute resolution. Like 3RR, AN/I, Vandal, etc, notification and discussion aren't required. It's assumed Administrators who wish to enforce will assume good faith on the person under arbcom sanction. If the person has been blocked, they can still appeal with the unblock template. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 22:03, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How could you ensure the person who puts up a request is not abusing, by providing one-sided evidence and not giving the full picture? What would you suggest to compensate the time lost as a result of block? — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 22:10, 5 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is why administrators have brains. It's about user <i>behavior</i>, not content. An admin can see, by the edit histories of the articles and by the user contribs of the person reported, whether or not the <i>behavior</i> being reported has validity. If that behavior is disruptive (or that behavior is what is sanctioned by ArbCom) then a violation has occured. <i>It doesn't matter</i> if they are "right" in a content dispute!</dd>
<dd>Don't start revert games here. None of the abuse reporting pages require notification to the user being reported. It may be a courtesy, but it should not be a requirement. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 22:16, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly. An administrator relies partly on what the person reports to determine how to react. The reporters can't always be trusted. There could be people who deliberately attempts to influence administrators in bad faith, and there are more people who simply make mistakes. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 22:24, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Administrators don't act without investigating a situation.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Please advise about procedure</span></h2>
<p>A user who has been indfinitely banned from editing articles on a particular topic has, for a period of months, demonstrated bad faith and acted disruptively on the article talk pages in the banned subject area. The user has also become active in policy and guideline discussions in a manner that, it appears to me, is an attempt to modify global Wikipedia policy in order to gain advantage in arguments related to the topic from which he was banned as an editor. The user has also stated or implied that the editors who disagree with him (virtually all of the other editors who work in this subject area) are engaged in a malicious, deliberate conspiracy against fair and accurate presentation of information. He makes even larger claims about these editors as a group, implying that they are morally corrupt sociopaths. The behavior I describe above has been consistent and frequent, and it has gone on for months. The user has also recently been found to have violated his editing ban directly, by editing the articles in question under an anonymous IP. It seems to me that it would be appropriate to extend the ban to the article talk pages and the policy/guideline pages. What is the proper place and manner in which to raise this issue? <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 20:12, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. So what does that mean--would a whole new ArbCom have to be applied for and convened? <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 17:32, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You would make a request in the "Requests for clarification of previous cases" section. If the committee takes notice of it, they may ask for more information, reopen the case, or simply file a motion to modify the previous case. Your request should be relatively brief and to the point, with just a few of the most significant diffs. ( The issue of editing while logged out is being dealt with, so focus on alleged disruptive edits to talk or policy pages) If they want more info they will ask. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:47, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
