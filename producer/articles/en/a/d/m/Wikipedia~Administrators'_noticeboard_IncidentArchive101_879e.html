<dd>Frankly, that answer seems to confirm that it is Rob Steadman the indefinitely banned user. I'm willing to be the bad guy and block the account as a suspected sockpuppet of an indefbanned user. Innocuous edits aside, if it is Robsteadman he exhausted at least my personal patience in that last episode. I don't know about the community's patience. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 18:24, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At risk of pointing out the obvious, maybe it's not the Rob Steadman you knew. Perhaps more importantly, does it really matter? If a habitually disruptive person makes a new account after being banned, that account will get banned eventually on its own merits, regardless of whether it's ever linked to a previous account. But if, say, Jason Gatrich decided to come back and be a model citizen, we'd never even think to do a Checkuser. This suggests that indefinite bans are a policy error. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 22:13, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You may well be right. But it <b>is</b> a policy and as such needs to be upheld and be seen to be upheld. Is there no way back from being banned? Apologies? Commitment to changed behaviour? whatever&#160;? If so then it should be offered to Rob/Robert. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrelke_e8a2.html" title="User:Frelke">Frelke</a> 22:20, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here's the link to the previous incident for anyone like me who needed to refresh their memory on the details <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive93#User:Robsteadman" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive93#User:Robsteadman" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The only strange thing that happened during that time that I didn't report is that I was e-mailed by <a href="../../../v/h/j/User%7EVhjh_9342.html" title="User:Vhjh">User:Vhjh</a> (a banned Rob sock) who claimed to be a student in Rob's A'level music class. She also said that she had e-mailed Jayjg as well but I never saw any response to this so I don't know if that's true. Is an automatic ban necessary as the account seems to have been active for a few weeks without problems? If anything this user has been pretty busy in article space which is always good. If Rob's previous account had a stupidly simple password it is possible it was hacked. Even I as an ex system manager only realised a few weeks ago how easy it would be to guess my password from my user page details and rapidly changed it. The telling point will be if the socks or vandal comments were made from his home IP - the check user could confirm this. If so then there is no doubt it was him that did it - but if it was all done from the shared IP (or unrelated IP's) then it is less clear and maybe AGF could be invoked? Perhaps putting the account on probation would be another way of giving them a chance but letting them know that any misbehaving and they're out? Just my 2 penn'th (this all assumes it's too much of a coincidence that two Rob Steadman's live in Matlock). <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 22:50, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a bit of discussion on this at my talk page at the moment. I personally think this account is more likely to be an imposter, but could be from someone who knows Rob or has encountered him on the internet. It could, for example be User:Bakewell Tart. My view is that Rob would <i>not</i> come back under his user name. Rob asked for his account to be deleted, and I explained to him that his user page could be deleted, and also his talk page (if nobody objected), but his contributions would remain. That was on 3 April. On 20 April, the Robsteadman account edited the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Steadman_9c22.html" title="Robert Steadman">Robert Steadman</a> article,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Steadman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49340588" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Steadman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49340588" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> which Rob had always insisted he had never edited. (Three proven sockpuppets of his — <a href="../../../v/h/j/User%7EVhjh_9342.html" title="User:Vhjh">User:Vhjh</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobeaston99_838b.html" title="User:Robeaston99">User:Robeaston99</a>, and <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYummy_mummy_6126.html" title="User:Yummy mummy">User:Yummy mummy</a> — <i>have</i> edited it, and also several British IPs.) On 23 April, the Robsteadman account made what I consider to be a very typical edit, rejoicing in the horrible events that led to the departure of Gator1 and KHM03.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jesus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49719313" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jesus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49719313" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> He then claimed that he had not made those two edits, and that his account had been hacked.</p>
<p>My guess is that he thought his account had been <i>deleted</i> — it seems that he failed to understand that there is <a href="../../../a/c/c/Wikipedia%7EAccount_deletion_7b66.html#Deleting_your_user_account" title="Wikipedia:Account deletion">no such thing as account deletion</a> — and that if he made an edit from his computer it would therefore register as an anonymous edit. He then came back the next day, got completely hysterical, said his account had been used by vandals, accused me of breaking my promise to delete his account (a promise I had never made), and trolled extremely abusively on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Deskana_c4a6.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Deskana">Deskana's RfA</a> (and also on his own talk page, though those edits have been deleted). He was blocked indefinitely, and his talk page protected. He sent e-mails to various people (including me), threatening legal action.</p>
<p>Regarding the "hacking" of his account, it had been suggested that since the account was deleted, someone else might have recreated it. That's not possible, since accounts can't be deleted. The only way someone other than Rob could have made those edits would be through getting hold of his password, or from the computer where he had edited before "leaving", if he had not logged out. The existence of the Yummy mummy sockpuppet (created on 21 April) suggests that Rob <i>had</i> logged out before the spiteful "good-riddance-to-KHM03" comment was made on 23 April, but after the edit to Robert Steadman. Yummy mummy edited <i>only</i> on 21 and 24 April. The "good-riddance-to-KHM03" post was made on 23 April.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jesus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49719313" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jesus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49719313" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> However, that was a Sunday, and it was early in the morning, so it seems likely that the edit was not made from his school IP, and therefore doesn't prove that he hadn't logged out from all the computers he had access to. The timing of the Yummy mummy edits suggests they might have been made from work.</p>
<p>Regarding the account User:Robertsteadman, an RFCU has been made. If I am correct in thinking that Rob made those two edits on 20 and 23 April, thinking that they wouldn't appear under his name because his account had been deleted, it is then <i>most</i> unlikely that he would create a new account with the name Robertsteadman. In my view, it's far more likely to be someone targetting Rob. While his answer to Deskana was far from being cooperative, he didn't splutter that Deskana's question was OUTRAGEOUS, which is what Rob would typically have done. If it is Rob (most unlikely, in my view), then for the block of the new account to be lifted, there would have to be some discussion from admins, particularly the admin who blocked him. There would also have to be some kind of undertaking from Rob himself that he would stop edit warring and making personal attacks. If it is an imposter account (much more likely), then the indefinite block is perfectly appropriate. And if it's an innocent new user who just <i>happened</i> to chose that name, and just <i>happened</i> to edit articles that Rob had edited (<i>most</i> unlikely), I think he should be unblocked so that he can request a name change. However, his refusal to answer Deskana's question reduces the likelihood that it's an innocent newbie and that the whole thing is just an amazing coincidence. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 09:39, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">User:Cyde</a> recently blocked me for "Personal attacks and disruption". You can read it here <a href="../../../m/b/o/User_talk%7EMboverload_d917.html#Blocked" title="User talk:Mboverload">User_talk:Mboverload#Blocked</a>.</p>
<p>I dispute that jokingly saying that someone doesn't like women because he is trying to delete a userbox with a picture of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breasts.html" title="Breasts">breasts</a> in it is a personal attack at all. I also disagree with his assessment of me calling someone a vandal.</p>
<p>In addition, I am in a content dispute over userboxes with Cyde. I used to support his efforts to get rid of junk boxes but then I saw that trying to delete 30 at once was a mistake.</p>
<p>From reading the blocking policy I see no provision for blocking someone for making one personal attack. I will even admit that I have made personal comments in the past, though they hardly rise above a snide comment in response to one of theirs. Although I don't know where to point to, I believe that an important part of the rules when it comes to blocking is to give fair warning and ask that behavior that does not immediately threaten Wikipedia to stop. People can have 4 rounds of vandalism with as many expletives as they want and I'm not allowed leeway on this?</p>

<dd>Well, each of the instances Cyde adduces is relatively mild; even taken together, I can't imagine that they were particularly disruptive, and I probably wouldn't have interpreted them as contravening the letter or spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. Inasmuch as the block is only for three hours, though, I think you'd do well simply to wait it out; even if your comments weren't personal attacks, they surely didn't foster the collegial spirit necessary for the project, and you should likely consider how better to phrase things in the future. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:41, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(edit conflict) I tend to agree that the block was not necessary, but I do feel your comments were quite inappropriate and counterproductive. As it was only a three-hour block, however, I have to think this merely had the intention of making clear that your behavior was unacceptable, which I think it succeeded in. Whether or not that is an appropriate use for a block is questionable, but in the end rather trivial. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 05:52, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mboverload, you could certainly do more to edit harmoniously. Cyde, your digging for additional reasons to justify the block after the fact only serves to show that it wasn't particularly justified. The diffs you provided were inappropriate edits certainly, but why not <i>talk to the editor</i> about it before reaching for that block button? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 06:19, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Some of the diffs do seem marginally incivil, in that they pose allegations of other editors' beliefs as rhetorical questions...but where the speed-limit is 55, and the average speed is 65, you don't ticket someone for travelling 58. <i>Judging only from the evidence presented here</i>, this user is not unusually or unacceptably incivil, and should not have been blocked. "Shocking [someone] out of [their] negative pattern" does not impress me as a well-defined reason for a block.Timothy Usher 06:23, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(conflict with the eminent Fri) While I'd agree that these aren't helpful comments, I'm certainly not seeing enough to warrent a block. There's nothing that looks like a warning on User talk:Mboverload, either. I'm also dead sick of hearing "no harm done" when a little three hour block is dropped on someone outside <s>policy</s> probity. Using adminstrative powers as a slap-stick doesn't appear on the <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">blocking policy</a> page that I see.<br />

<dd>This will probably get me another "high horse" or "holier than thou" tally in my entry in Cyde's personal book, (apparently I've got quite the collection already) but I do think Cyde has an unfortunate tendency to shoot first and ask questions later. I think a warning would have been appropriate in this case before a block and find myself in agreement with Friday, Timothy Usher and Aaron in this case.

<p>Just a note: After seeing the responses I have gotten over my comments I will change how I behave. I didn't realize it was that big of a problem. I am used to message boards where people know that half the stuff you say about them is sarcasm and stupid fun. I now realize that Wikipedians do not assume "playful" banter (I know some of my comments push the edge of it) when reading comments. I am a playful person by nature but I get carried away when it comes to people who do not understand what I'm doing. I know that asking why someone hates deaf people is pretty crude when you say it out of the blue, but it was all in good fun and humor about deleting a spoken-article template. I regret any effects my actions may of had. As you can see in my talk page, I can be extremely understanding and helpful.</p>
<p>I'm still unhappy with having a block on my record and a message on my archives but I'm not going to push it. As brenneman said, using administrative powers outside of their guidelines, however how "small" it may be, is not something to be taken lightly. Perhaps what I'm really upset about is that I would be blocked. I have done my best to better Wikipedia through anti-vandalism and hopelessly mundane spellchecking that I wouldn't wish on my ex. I'm not asking for smypathy, it's just that the mental effect of this is much greater than any record in a database. I will continue helping Wikipedia and I will change how I comment, but I still leave scarred.--<a href="../../../m/b/o/User%7EMboverload_cce2.html" title="User:Mboverload">mboverload</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mboverload_00ae.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mboverload"><font color="red">@</font></a> 07:36, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can say that I have noticed Cyde's blocking in the past. Cyde seems to have no inclination to warn even good faith editors who make mistakes. I would ask Cyde to consider leaving messages on talk pages warning people about inappropriate behavior and blocking only after warnings go unheeded, rather than just blocking on the spot every time he sees misbehavior. The latter action is appropriate for vandal-only accounts or clear sockpuppets of banned users, but is probably inappropriate (no matter how short) for anyone with any good faith edits on their account. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 15:50, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So Cyde, there's been no indication that you've any intention of taking under advisement the suggestions of me, Friday, Timothy Usher, Brenneman, DS1953, Lar, GTBacchus, and Kusma, who've all expressed the opinion that blocking without warning is not a good policy.

<dd>I did not intend for anything I said to be construed as a personal attack against Cyde. I merely wish for him to acknowledge the fact that at least 9 people have weighed in on the issue saying that Cyde was too quick, and that he will consider their opinions. If it seemed like a personal attack, I apologize. In the mean time, I eagerly await some comment from Cyde, even if it is to say "Tony is right and the 9 of you are wrong, I will continue to block on sight." Tony, I think you're being a bit combative. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 20:25, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Two problems with that - (1) unless the contact email is changed, the original user could request a password reset and re-compromise the account and (2) its still a shared account, since the person who changed the password <i>could</i> return to it and use it as a sock account at some time in the future (not that I think they would). Just best security practice to lock it down. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 14:05, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Well, since Tony doesn't feel up to responding to either one of the two messages I left him, I guess I'll just ask people here for thier suggestion on what happened. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe-thing_242c.html" title="User:The-thing">The-thing</a> was tagging users userpages with indefblocked templates, which is fine. (Except for one tiny error he made, which was resolved on his talk page). I noticed later that his contributions started to disappear, Tony was deleting them saying "vandalism only edit". Which it wasn't, it was tagging a users' page as a vandalism account only. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Tony+Sidaway&amp;page=" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Tony+Sidaway&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">Tony's deletion log</a>. I asked Tony about them but he didn't respond. A few minutes later, I noticed Tony had blocked The-thing saying "silly troll". I asked him about this and he was unresponsive again. A few things that need to be reversed are the blocking of The-thing and the undeletion of three of the userpages Tony deleted. The-thing wasn't even warned and still hasn't been given a warning about being blocked. Could someone intervene? <a href="../../../d/g/x/User%7EDGX_7ea7.html" title="User:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">D</font><font color="#000000">G</font></a><a href="../../../d/g/x/User_talk%7EDGX_0a84.html" title="User talk:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">X</font></a> 22:26, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I screwed up hugely here. When I used the block log links on the user contributions pages to check for blocks of those users after he had placed the templates.

I blocked again indefinitely after seeing some fresh vandalism, and then began to get e-mails from other users who were affected by the block. I checked for autoblocks, and undid them, but there would just be another autoblock (and another e-mail) a few days later. Eventually, I unblocked Dickwittington, quite reluctantly, but on the grounds that there was too much collateral damage.</p>
<p>Dickwittington vandalized again today, and was reverted and warned by DakotaKahn, and blocked indefinitely by RexNL. He then posted anonymously to Wikipedia talk:List of banned users.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:List_of_banned_users&amp;curid=708833&amp;diff=54234481&amp;oldid=52804124" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:List_of_banned_users&amp;curid=708833&amp;diff=54234481&amp;oldid=52804124" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> The IP address was very similar to the ones of the affected users who e-mailed me because of the autoblock last month, and also to an IP address that used to abuse Private Butcher before Dickwittington registered his account. The address is one of those AOL addresses (195.93.0.0 – 195.93.127.255) that shouldn't be blocked for more than fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Is there some way that Dickwittington can be blocked indefinitely without dozens of innocent users being affected? Unless RexNL has done something very clever that I wasn't aware of when blocking, I predict that he's going to start getting e-mails from aggrieved Wikipedians within the next few days. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 20:10, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Move warring is a blockable offense, as is any other kind of warring (wheel, revert, edit). My personal preference would be to leave the pages where they are *now* pending whether the parties in that proposed arbitration accept the arbitration. The statement supplied by Freakofnurture with a slightly incivil edit summary can be submitted to the arbitrators as evidence on the side of SPUI et al. Moving them back would just be another salvo in the move war, however objectionable the current naming is to the other side in the dispute. Just my opinion. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 15:32, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reference doesn't strike me as neccessarily relevant. Imagine Nevada's state highways are officially named "Nevada State Route XXX", as opposed to Washington's official "State Route YYY". Wikipedia reasonably might still prefer to use a uniform name scheme for all US state highways, so one of the official nomenclatures would have to be ignored. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 15:52, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No one is arguing that the reference is suspect. The point of dispute is whether "correct" should be the principle to apply in deciding what the article names should be (<a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28CN%29_0829.html" title="WP:NC(CN)">WP:NC(CN)</a> gives several instances in which it is not). Regardless, the facts of the matter are that Freakofnurture is aware that this dispute is taking place, is aware (if he keeps an eye on this page, as all administrators should) that multiple admins have said that move warring on these pages is a blockable offense, yet chose to aggravate the move wars anyway. <span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif">—<a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">phh</a>&#160;(<sup><a href="../../../p/h/e/User_talk%7EPHenry_3f2a.html" title="User talk:PHenry">t</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PHenry_1efd.html" title="Special:Contributions/PHenry">c</a></sub>)</span> 15:59, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree that moving the pages back would be equally bad—if anything, <i>not</i> moving them back is tantamount to rewarding bad behavior. Regardless, if I am being asked to "take the high road" by leaving them where they are for now, then I shall take the high road (a road I seem to be taking a lot these days, with no reciprocation from the other side… but never mind). However, I'd appreciate a clarification of the situation here, because I can only see three possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move-warring over these pages is a blockable offense, and therefore Freakofnurture will be blocked for having done it.</li>
<li>Move-warring over these pages is not a blockable offense, and therefore anyone may move them with impunity, although they shouldn't.</li>
<li>Move-warring over these pages is a blockable offense for PHenry, but not for Freakofnurture.</li>
</ul>
<p>…and I'd really like to know which of these rules I can expect to be subject to today and in the future. <span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif">—<a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">phh</a>&#160;(<sup><a href="../../../p/h/e/User_talk%7EPHenry_3f2a.html" title="User talk:PHenry">t</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PHenry_1efd.html" title="Special:Contributions/PHenry">c</a></sub>)</span> 18:11, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Blocking exists only to prevent offenses, not punish them. If Freakofnurture isn't move warring anymore, then there's no point in blocking him - for the time being. And anyhow, the idea on Wikipedia is to take the high road. Someone has to do it, and it sure as hell won't be the other guy. Also, maintaining the status quo isn't meant to "reward" any kind of behaviour. It's meant to give us time to chill out and talk about the issue rather than bash our heads together repeatedly. The encyclopaedia won't die if people are directed to the wrong article for a day or two. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 18:27, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Moving them back would be equally bad because it would start and/or perpetuate an edit war, and the only way edit wars ever solve content disputes is when one side or the other gets worn out and quits. I express the hope that some kind of dispute resolution process (article RFC, user RFC, a policy debate somewhere, or RFAR) will lead to a settled final answer and the articles can be moved to their final names then. In the meantime, names of the style <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_State_Route_599_cab4.html" title="Washington State Route 599">Washington State Route 599</a> should all redirect to <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Route_599_%28Washington%29_3328.html" title="State Route 599 (Washington)">State Route 599 (Washington)</a>, so ordinary users of the encyclopedia should not be affected.

<dd>Problem is it's been 3 months and neither side has tired.

<dd>Move warring over these pages is a blockable offense, for Freakofnurture and PHenry (and SPUI, and anyone else) IMO. I personally am not inclined to block FoN <b>now</b> because it is after the fact, though I might have blocked him at the time if I (1) had noticed it and (2) I had been cognizant of the RFAr related to such moves. Personally I would haved probably just asked him to stop, but thats me. I think it was a good faith move based on what he felt was compelling support, based on a possibly erroneous assumption (to be decided by the arbcom if all sides agree). I wanted to thank you for your forbearance in taking the high road. As you say, too often people feel that two questionable actions balance out at a reasonable action...when really they are equally questionable. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 18:33, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What's so complicated about this? Most pages linking to individual, state-maintained, numbered highways will be other pages related to the same state. Within the boundaries of each state, such highways are referred to by their proper names, i.e. "State Route 599" or "SR 599". However, since other highways with the <b>exact same name</b> also exist in other states, the parenthetical disambiguation is used. In the infrequent event that these are referenced from an an article pertaining to a different state, then specifying forms "Washington State Route 599" or "Washington's SR 599" can be used for clarification to the reader. Furthermore, User:Atanamir has a letter from the Washington State Department of Transportation supporting this nomenclature.</p>
<p>What more do you need? Demanding that I be blocked and reverted on proceedural grounds is ridiculous, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not a move war.</li>
<li>I moved the pages once each.</li>
<li>They had not been recently moved.</li>
<li>The moves were based on newly presented evidence from WSDOT.</li>
<li>This "moving a bunch of roads at once is a blockable" idea is something Rschen7754 came up with so he could block SPUI and Locke Cole, with whom he was engaged in personal conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggesting that "not moving them back (to the <span style="text-decoration:underline">wrong titles</span>) is tantamount to rewarding bad behavior" is itself tantamount to <b>rules-lawyering</b> of the highest order. — <small>May. 16, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[03:59] &lt;<u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freak</a>|<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a></u>&gt;</b></tt></p>

<dd>Well, I'm someone who doens't dislike you, and I think you made a very poor call, right or wrong, in moving those pages. The issue's been mediated, edit-warred over, and is in an RFAR. Moving those pages did nothing but exacerbate the problem. I do not understand how you can justify your moves by saying "I'm right." Wait until the RFAR is over, then follow the decision.

<dd>I would be happy to provide a rebuttal other than smearing your name. However, to quote what PHenry has already said, "<i>No one is arguing</i> about the facts. The question is about the best way to apply the existing principles and conventions to these articles." <a href="../../../d/_/_/WP%7ED_9a57.html" title="WP:D">WP:D</a> is clear that parentheses is not the only way to disambiguate on Wikipedia, furthermore, it's not even the preferred way. To quote, "When there is another word or <i><b>more complete name</b></i> that is equally clear, that should be used." (emphasis mine). Thus, in these cases, the <i>more complete name</i> (<a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_State_Route_539_eb9f.html" title="Washington State Route 539">Washington State Route 539</a>) should be used.</dd>
<dd>Also, you state in your post: "However, since other highways with the exact same name also exist in other states, the parenthetical disambiguation <i><b>is</b></i> used." (again, emphasis mine) This may have been a grammatical oversight on your part, or you may be referring to your newly imposed standard for Washington. However, in the 28 out of 50 states (30 counting Washington and California), the articles are named with the state name first.</dd>
<dd>(AK, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, IA, KY, LA, MD, MN, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, PA, SC, SD, VT, VA, WV, and WI, plus D.C., Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S.V.I., since I know someone's going to ask.)</dd>
<dd>An additional two are named not with parenthetical disambiguation, but with local common names: Kansas with K-xx and Michigan with M-xx.</dd>
<dd>Now I'm not saying that just because it's 28-18 (leaving out Kansas, Michigan, California, and Washington), that must mean that I'm right and you're wrong, because that's not what it means, and I'm not saying that this constitutes some sort of official naming convention, because it doesn't. What this does mean, though, is that the "State Route X (StateName)" format doesn't follow any sort of naming convention either. To rephrase your statement more accurately, "<i>Even though</i> other highways with the exact same name also exist in other states, the parenthetical disambiguation <i>is not</i> used <i>with any sort of regularity</i>. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish">Northenglish</a> 00:33, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>News media may quite commonly use the phrase "Attorney Jack Thompson" to distinguish him from "Actor Jack Thompson", but these designations are not part of either man's proper name. Given two topics with the same proper name, we disambiguate them using words or phrases in parentheses, ideally something short, and something that best illustrates how they differ from one another, e.g. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Thompson_%28attorney%29_1506.html" title="Jack Thompson (attorney)">Jack Thompson (attorney)</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Thompson_%28actor%29_15da.html" title="Jack Thompson (actor)">Jack Thompson (actor)</a>. If we have two people with the same profession, say, two U.S. Congressmen, we would disambiguate by state, or if they were from the same state, we could go by term of office. Since each state, in and of itself, has its own nomenclature for numbered roads, we should, in the innumerable cases where these names are non-unique, disambiguate by specifying in parentheses, the name of the state where each road is located. For a road with a non-unique name that is not limited to one state, we sometimes disambiguate using a region, e.g. <a href="../../../r/o/u/Route_26_%28New_England%29_6bdb.html" title="Route 26 (New England)">Route 26 (New England)</a>.</dd>
<dd>As for the highways in Michigan named "M-XX", see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_highways_in_Michigan_e64f.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_highways_in_Michigan_e64f.html" rel="nofollow">this clarifying post</a> by <a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECBessert_7fb5.html" title="User:CBessert">User:CBessert</a> (Christopher J.

<dd>For text, it's really very simple--all text should be original. There are certain circumstances in which public domain text can be incorporated, but only if it's explicitly and unquestionably in the public domain, which generally means it was <i>published</i> (not written) before 1923 <i>and</i> its source is stated (we generally take a "better-safe-than-sorry" line on text that might or might not be PD, so it's best to steer clear of it altogether). But for all intents and purposes, you should only put text into Wikipedia if you wrote it yourself.

<dd>I tend to see it differently. As this pertains (among others) to an Administrator and his use of his administrative authority (closing TfDs, making deletions, etc), I think this belongs here. When I asked for informal mediation, the consensus of the mediators was for me to come here, because the issue was of such scope that the mediators felt it should be dealt with here. Even granting the possibility your premise, that this issue may not need the attention of an administrator, I can't see where it clearly doesn't. I hope that the Admin community will consider acting to cool the fire under these deletions which seem only to increase divisiveness by applying unadopted policies &amp; undermining attempts to reach consensus on userboxes.</dd>
<dd>In support, here are three <i>administrators'</i> comments from the discussion showing that this isn't something clearly outside the scope of <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, since they identify policy issues, disruption issues, and adminship issues that this involves:

<dd>How do you reconcile your sense that the Cyde discussion was inappropriate for AN/I with the <i>open informal complaint</i> prescription? To be sure, one doesn't want general discussion to clog a board to which many users otherwise unfamiliar with WP come to report disruptions with which administrators ought to deal; where one wants to solicit opinions apropos of the conduct of an admin, though, it would seem that a noticeboard frequented by other admins, who are likely well able to adjudge whether one would be wholly off-base to question a given action, would be a fine place for the discussion. The point is to solicit the views of the community writ large (especially of admins, who are likely to have experienced situations similar to that about which a complaint is made); an RfC, of course, effects the same result, but we are to look with disfavor upon formalistic and quasi-adversarial proceedings here wherever we can. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:40, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. As I said in my earlier post (which was removed when Tony moved the original post), I do think some of the complaints against cyde have been unjustified or plain trolling, but the fact that so <i>many</i> have been made, some of which seem possibly legitimate, suggest that this issue should be investigated.

<p>I see no reason to object to Tony's actions. PHDrillSergeant was calling for Cyde to be desysoped, which is not something admins (or even bureaucrats) can do. (A key requirement for ANI listings is that they require admin intervention. The only actionable portion of the diatribe was the part pertaining to an alleged sockpuppet of Cyde (whose evidence was not convincing; a checkuser conducted by two different users has confirmed that Cyde and Fake User are not related). People who want an open discussion on an admin's actions ought to open an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a>, not make their diatribes on a noticeboard for actions requiring admin intervention. ANI is not a part of our dispute resolution process. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:27, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, and re the "If you want to make an open informal complaint over the behaviour of an admin, you can do so here" clause at the introduction of ANI, the complaint was not informal. It was calling for Cyde to be desysoped, something which (rightly) is not and cannot be done informally. An RfC or RfAr should have been filed; if all that was wanted was community comment, RfCs will do the job. Having two RfCs open at the same time on the same user would be a bit unprecedented, but not wrong in any sense. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:30, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it's probably time to reconsider the "informal complaint about an admin" clause. We're getting some ridiculously petty complaints and they and their associated trolling are beginning to dwarf and severely degrade this page.</p>
<p>Even so, the existence of the clause does not mean that <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> is the most appropriate place. One section I moved was simply a complaint about TFDs of userboxes. This is already a very high traffic page and we should feel free to keep it uncluttered by removing nonsense and hopeless rubbish. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 13:06, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd say that that clause if working just fine. The completely trivial are mostly ignored, the complaints about proper actions usually get appropiate feedback that the admins is doing a fine job.

<dd>I don't understand why you want to silence complaints about Cyde. OK, it's clear that you think Cyde's actions are acceptable. But why not let the rest of us discuss the matter?

<dd>I think the issue is with this matter being discussed <i>here</i>. It is not at all clear what purpose it could serve. If there is a general issue with Cyde's behavior there should be an RfC. If the RfC has not cleared the air then mediation might be a good idea. If mediation doesn't go anywhere there's arbitration. What is being discussed here that requires the specific attention of administrators? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 17:04, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it's appalling and disappointing that reasonable steps to move discussions to more appropriate locations are being resisted on transparently spurious grounds. Nobody has tried to stop discussion. There is <i>no</i> appropriate place to engage in these little hate-fests against Cyde, in defiance of the dispute resolution policy. However there are legitimate issues that can be discussed at other venues and where such venues exist I have made reasonable attempts to move discussion there. To call this "silencing complaints" is utter rubbish. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 19:36, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

When I attempted to compromise with the editor, he reverted my changes as "vandalism" and then filled the talk page with some very heated remarks and openly stated I was vandalising the article.

<p>Asymmetric key algorithm was moved (and collapsed more than a little) to public key cryptography. There are reasons it shouldn't have been so moved, but that will have to pass for the moment. What didn't happen during this was that auxiliary material (talk, etc) didn't accompany the article.</p>
<p>And the same happened with several articles related to symmetric key algorithms and similar titles (see the list of cryptography articles at WikiProject: Cryptography for xymmetric whatever, most of which have now been subsumed). Auxiliary material has been lost there as well. And for that matter at digital rights management as well. The intent here seems to have been merely to correct some unwanted capitalization in the article title...</p>
<p>Since I have managed successfully to evade any actual knowledge of the behind_the_curains machinery, I am forced to ask for some assistance from someone who does.</p>
<p>Overeager moving and neatening does on occasion go badly awry, as here. Perhaps it's time for a revision of the moving policy embodied in the software? Any ideas or comments on this last point? 71.249.12.89 00:05, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN">PZFUN</a> nominated 36 Judaism-related articles for deletion in what, to be honest, looks like a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> (though I want to AGF), apparently supported by <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">NicholasTurnbull</a>, who also voted to delete, and was on most of them the only person other than PZFUN to do so. Many of the articles seemed to be legitimate, although some could use tidying; for example, there were pages about important rabbis like <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dovber_of_Mezeritch_2861.html" title="Dovber of Mezeritch">Dovber of Mezeritch</a>, one of the most important figures in Hasidic Judaism. This almost certainly has to do with a recent row between PZFUN and <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">User:IZAK</a>, where IZAK objected to PZFUN's AfD nomination of another Jewish article, and the row led to harsh words, which led Nicholas to block IZAK, and a fuss ensued. This seems to be some sort of follow-up. I've closed the AfDs as speedy keeps, which is not to say that there aren't some that might be legitimate noms (I did find one that clearly was, so I didn't close that one), but these bulk deletions coming so soon after an argument seem inappropriate.

<dd>I agree with Slimvirgins Ignore All Rules speedy closure, just to keep the peace for now, but those articles really really need review.

<dd>I too agree. Irrespective of the motivation for a nomination, once an article is AfDed, the discussion belongs not to the original nominator but to the community writ large; where other users have expressed support for <i>delete</i> on legitimate grounds, the debates oughtn't to be closed (to be sure, where all "votes" were keep and where no legitimate reason was given for deletion in the nom, a speedy keep, per <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOWBALL_47ec.html" title="WP:SNOWBALL">WP:SNOWBALL</a> and <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> is in order.

<dd>Many of them were speedy-keep candidates. But regardless, the row between PZFUN and IZAK got pretty nasty, and then Nicholas blocked IZAK for NPA, so it's inappropriate for those two editors to try to delete 36 articles that IZAK probably cares about just a day or so later. I'm assuming good faith here (I don't know PZFUN but I understand he's a good and trustworthy editor, and I know Nicholas is), but you can see why they might look like bad-faith nominations, and the appearance of that should have occurred to them.

<dd>There are some difficulties with these personalities with reference to finding references. Most of the legacy of a particular Rebbe will be various teachings that have been passed down and quoted, and the mythologies of tales told about them. Often they will be collected in a book, but in some cases not. If they are collected in a book, it may well be in Hebrew or Yiddish - their communities are often quite closed and isolated. You will likely find mention of a rabbi (or of their magnum opus, by which they are often known, or of their title ("Kotzker Rebbe", "Skulener Rebbe", "[the first] Bobover Rebbe")) with reference to a particular teaching used in an article. On the other hand, these personalities could be treated like royal families- they are members of dynasties where patrilineal descent plays a major role in heirdom: for some of the more minor personalities, they may only be mentioned in a listing of the chain of Rebbes in a Hasidic group. In this sense, while Wikipedia has articles on even the most obscure members of some royal families, the chain of descendency of Rebbes should definitely be kept, as long as their existence in that chain is verifiable, even if no extensive references on the individual can be found. <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 00:59, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I only said it may be hard to find any verifiable sources. It is clear that these people exist. Even some facts about them may be findable and verifiable. But even those of their teachings or stories that may only be "hearsay" are still noteworthily associated with that person. Wikipedia documents myths in great detail - although their subjects may not be verifiable, the existence of the myth about that subject is highly verifiable. I certainly hope that more accurate and verifiable written information can be found, but I'm not sure where to look. Still these discussions on the difficulties of finding highly verifiable information on these personalities doesn't in any way excuse your nominating 16 of them on the basis of no references, specualativity, sounding like an ad and non-notability, when these factors were often simply untrue: see my arguments below. <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 01:54, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nominating so many articles for deletion at once was a bad disruptive thing obviously, but I think SlimVirgin doing a mass-keep was not a good idea either. That gives the (most likely false) appearance that an administrator is using his/her adminship position/leverage a bit beyond what one should do. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 17:02, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I do have one minor quibble though: maybe it would have been better to close the AfDs by explaining why the bulk nomination was a mistake, rather than by saying "the result was speedy keep" - as that was not where most of the actual deletion debates seemed to be going.

<p>I disagree with the Speedy Keep action. It seems heavy handed, given that there was no consensus, even if you ignore the original parties. Yes, it makes sense that old rabbis are notable, but their articles are not exempt from the same scrutiny and process as all others. If they have verifiable sources, the sources should be cited in the articles - they don't have to be instant Web or google sites. Same goes for the schools and camps, although one would expect those to have a google-space presence. WP rules are there to be followed even if a mass AfD nomination casts doubt on AGF. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:21, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nominating 36 articles like this is disruptive behaviour, which can only cause bad feeling with editors involved in them. The proposing editor should have considered the likely inflammatory effect on others of such a mass proposal deletion and made some attempt at communication with those likely to be affected by it, if only to make the reassurance that there were genuine grounds for making so many all at once. The articles I have checked have nothing at all on their talk pages. This situation can only be interpreted as AGF, if one also assumes that the proposing editor is quite insensitive to others. The mass speedy keep of the articles was not ideal, but it does allow a breathing space, instead of provoking a war. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 19:05, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Nominating for deletion <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_ben_Eliezer_5c9a.html" title="Israel ben Eliezer">Israel ben Eliezer</a>, the founder of Hassidism, was so obviously contrary to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> that no result other than speedy keep could be expected. We already have a precedent when mass AfD nominations by Striver done to prove a point in a discussion on List of Muslim athletes were speedily kept.

This en mass wave of deletion strikes me as rather discourtious, possibly even a provocation. The question arises as to why the user in question did not place pertinent tags, pose querries on article and user talk pages? [Incidentally, I authored 30+ <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Defense_Forces_0099.html" title="Israel Defense Forces">IDF</a>-related articles yesterday, none have any references whatsoever. Damn, I probably shouldn't have said that.] Also, as a secular &amp; atheist, I recognize quite a few of these names, perhaps to the (dis?)credit of the <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_Minister_of_Israel_38c3.html" title="Education Minister of Israel">IBoE</a>. Anyway, what I wish to bring to Kim's attention (why am I picking on him? let's just say I gots my reasons!&#160;:p) is that en mass acts which are likely to involve heated emotions, should best involve a centralized discussion prior. Basically, established editors are entitled to some fair warning when their entries are not viewed as being up to par, and an AfD isn't the first step, it is the <i>last</i>. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 21:51, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>PZFUN: I'm not sure I can take the argument, "what point was that? That there are many articles, regardless of what they pertain to, that merit listing on AfD?" as sufficient. As I noted when voting "strong keep" for many of the articles, you had completely false claims in terms of your reasons for nomination. For instance, you used on many of your nominations "No references, speculative, and reads like an ad. Not notable for Wikipedia" including on the nominations for <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moshe_Zvi_of_Savran_bd14.html" title="Moshe Zvi of Savran">Moshe Zvi of Savran</a>, where there was a clear reference and the article did <i>not</i> read like an ad, and on <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dovber_of_Mezeritch_2861.html" title="Dovber of Mezeritch">Dovber of Mezeritch</a>, which - if you put in any thought before nomination - you should have found that "not notable for Wikipedia" is clearly false as well. It is similarly strange to claim "utterly non-notable" to an <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_Jewish_Students_2785.html" title="Union of Jewish Students">organisation</a> with a membership of 8000 (if we have high schools and small townships included in Wikipedia, surely this should qualify), and others with multiple international branches and an 80-year heritage.

<p>Why was it inappropriate for PZFUN to nominate those articles for deletion, and for me to support his various nominations? There was a disagreement between PZFUN and IZAK over a particular AfD, granted, and I did once block IZAK. I accept that. But I can't see really how that had all that much bearing on my ability to vote on Judaism-related articles, and more importantly how that renders PZFUN's nominations illegitimate. If I was forced to stay away from all subjects which I'd ever been in a dispute with a user over, I would almost not be able to edit Wikipedia, if I counted the various cases I've mediated, and the same goes for PZFUN I believe as a very experienced Wikipedian who has contributed a lot to the project. Really, I think it's awful that standards of Wikipedia article quality are somehow suspended merely because the articles in question fall within a single category, or more importantly a category which has heated connotations I suppose. The amount of bad faith cast against PZFUN is even worse, in my opinion, and is quite at odds with the culture of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> that we inculcate on Wikipedia. Especially since, at the time of writing, PZFUN appears to have decided to leave the project, deleting his userpage - for merely trying to nominate articles that were substandard for deletion, in accordance with both policy and Wikipedia standards of editorial judgement. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 22:32, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Christopher: If an article is below par, and at the same time also has importance to a significant sub-set of editors (and hence readers) who understand its notability, the logical thing to do is to request that that article be IMPROVED but <i>not</i> to rush headlong into rash VfD votes which, as you can tell, enrages people. Articles or stubs that in some instances took years to collect should not be mass speed deleted willy-nilly, a symptom of the "New Deletionism" which needs to be slowed down to a c r a w l (where is everyone rushing to exactly?) Obviously some fairly wise and knowledgeable editors are willing to give these articles time and the benefit of the doubt because they know something about the subject.

After several days of monitoring this discussion, as well as <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN">PZFUN</a>'s contributions, it occurred to me that I should mention <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN">PZFUN</a>'s recent history of nominating Judaica-related articles for deletion ought to be mentioned, viz: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/First_American-Romanian_congregation" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/First_American-Romanian_congregation" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>.

<dd>This doesn't seem to be routine stub-clearing. The timing (and specificity) of the multiple AfDs reflects what is most likely a personal jab at IZAK. Regardless of prior provocation and incivility, passive-agressive editing is inexcusable (not to mention that it contravenes <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>). Additionally, cursory (5 second) research of some of the articles listed for AfD (such as <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_ben_Eliezer_5c9a.html" title="Israel ben Eliezer">Israel ben Eliezer</a>) would show that "<i>No references... and reads like an ad</i>" itself reads like a bad joke.

<p>Re MPerel - It was not a "campaign" - PZFUN merely went through the Judaism categories and found articles that didn't conform to Wikipedia standards of quality - things like copyvios, uncited sources, NPOV issues, lack of notability, etc. all of which are common standards within Wikipedia. That's why I supported his various nominations, because I think there are too many crap articles on Wikipedia. That's all there is to it - I couldn't care less whether the articles were about Judaism, or anything else (vacuum cleaners, road systems, Pokémon, sex toys, etc.), it just happened that PZFUN had found a whole load of bad articles. And besides, PZFUN is of Jewish extraction anyway, so the implication that it the move was ethnically-motivated is frankly ridiculous. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 22:20, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Nicholas: To be repeat: I for one do not believe the issue had anything to do with ethnicity or religion. Let's put that aside. This is a about KNOWLEDGE, FACTS, and LOGIC all of which are essential to function as a respected and honored editor. (People will definitely sense very quickly if one is genuinely knowledgeable about a subject or not as Wikipedia has many experts in many fields and they are quite capable.) Rather I believe the crux of the issues here are about Wikipedians' <i><a href="../../../m/o/d/Modus_operandi.html" title="Modus operandi">modus operandi</a></i> and how Wikipedia functions, how it solicits articles, organizes, digests them, and then finally presents them to the world. <b>I see the creation of Wikipedia articles as a "birthing process" and just as you cannot produce instant humans and expect them to become adults at birth, often what is required is a show of patience and nurturance allowing the material to evolve and grow. This can't be rushed!</b> The way to deal with issues of quality, NPOV, sources, and notability spread out over more than fifty articles is not by seeking the remedy of "The New Deletionism" whereby articles are nominated <i>en masse</i> for deletion. Each article is different and deserves unique attention. The ones about Hasidic Rebbes were written by many Hasidic editors whom we are happy to have, even though they may have a lack of good English writing skills, they bring invaluable information to Wikipedia that cannot be found anywhere else, and we have made great strides. The ones about the Summer Camps are written by more liberal Jews some Reform, Conservative, secular, Zionist writers, basically editors who come from all walk of life, so it's false to label them all as having this or that collective failing when each article needs its own remedies, but does not deserve to be lumped together with all sorts of others not connected to it. You're not being fair when you blithely associate a discussion about Judaism with "sex toys etc" as not all of us are willing to go so far afield. To talk like that is to belittle our seriouness of purpose and challenges our ability to be true Wikipedians always trying to meet the required NPOV standards. It is perfectly correct, logical, and Wikipedian for editors to restrict themselves to areas they feel most comfortable with and not wander all over the place stepping in invisible minefields and causing inevitable disruption when none was necessary. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 05:56, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The claim that none of the articles nominated for an AFD were verifiable is clearly erroneus, as is the claim that an objective opinion was formed for every single article, almost every single nomination summary was the same, it was a clear cut-and-paste operation. Many of the articles had sources, they just weren't on the internet, they were books that were properly cited at the bottom of the article. Even if it was true that they had no references that does not make the subject any less notable, you do not nominate an article that is about the founder of Hasidism for deletion, you request more sources, or possibly a cleanup (although many of the AFDs didn't even need that). Also the idea that being part Jewish makes his actions any more valid is ridiculous.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 22:48, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seemed to me, Nicholas, that you didn't actually evaluate the individual articles and voted on the basis of their nomination by PZFUN. That is not assuming good faith, that is following in blind faith. I had assumed that PZFUN was making the nominations for the sake of Wikipedia, and had thought him sincere, but he didn't seem to put enough care into making his nominations truthful. <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 22:55, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm tough on notability (in my opinion there should not be any articles on summer camps, whether Jewish, Christian or secular) and I would have supported the deletion of many of the articles, but I declined to participate. Nominating several similar articles at once is okay sometimes, but mass nominations are disruptive. People comment on the articles that matter to them and nominating so many articles at once wears them out because they'll want to participate in many or all of the discussions (also they probably have other things on their plate, like creating articles and/or real lives). Most likely, they'll eventually resort to a copied and pasted comment or just say "keep", or they'll assume bad faith never even try to justify the articles on an individual basis. This upsets the nominator and he or she thinks that they are just voting keep because the articles are all about Jewish, Christian or Pokemon topics. Another problem is that some truly notable articles are often nominated along with the cruft, like in this case. This makes the other side think that the nominations were bad faith and makes it even less likely that they will participate in the nominations in a normal manner.</p>
<p>My advice is to not overload AfD participators by nominating too many articles at once. Also, make sure that there is not even one notable article in the group. Don't count on AfD to sort it out. People will probably think that all of your nominations were in bad faith and all of the articles will probably be kept because of that reason. Also, I think that people should assume good faith even if some notable articles get mixed into a mass nomination. Although some nominations may be so blatantly bad faith that this does not apply. If possible, editors should participate in the AfD as if it was a good faith nomination. If there are just too many articles to do this, the nominations should be closed and the truly bad ones should be renominated slowly and carefully. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:03, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That doesn't mean anything, John.

<dd>Perhaps, but as a member of several WikiProjects, I would certainly like to be informed if any of the project's templates were up for deletion (although probably on the project's talk page more than on my talk page).

<p>I have informed members of the Wikiproject-antiwar of votes for deletion of pages covered by the project before not knowing that this was controvercial.</p>
<p>While I appreciate that there is a case against informing people on their talk page about deletion votes because of vote rigging, informing people who have expressed an interest in the topic in question by joining a wikiproject on that topic seems to me to be appropreate. Yes it is true that a message could just be put on a the project talk page but users are often slow to check that page, checking their talk page more often.</p>
<p>I think that we need to have a debate about the issule in general. If such a discusion has allready taken place please point me to it.--<a href="../../../j/k/_/User%7EJK_the_unwise_23f9.html" title="User:JK the unwise">JK the unwise</a> 11:38, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, the recent contributions were not to his credit! I blocked indefinitely, but put in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Crazynas" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Crazynas" rel="nofollow">block log</a> that I might ask for a review. Then, with several browser windows open at the same time, I started typing a message to him, and looking through his previous contributions, which were fine. I was going to post a message here, asking for advice, when I saw his {{unblock}}. The six vandalism edits were completely inconsistent with his previous edits, so I had no problem in accepting his statement that someone else had been using his computer. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 16:04, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A brief review of his previous edits suggests the same taste for silly vandalism. So compromised brain, not compromised account.
