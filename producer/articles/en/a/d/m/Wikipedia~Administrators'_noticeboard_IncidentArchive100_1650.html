He then used the rollback button, an administrator's priviledge, to delete my messages at his talk page. He claimed I was trolling, and blocked me for three hours.

<dd>I know. What a cheek. He was, of course, rewriting it so that sock puppets would be slightly harder to block e.g. he changed that sock puppet accounts <i>may</i> be blocked indefinitely, rather than should be, and that only "uninvolved" admins may do the blocking, and other similar tweaks in his favor.&#160;:-D <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:13, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ashibaka has gone ahead and unprotected without even mentioning it to me, so I've reprotected. I don't want to start a wheel war, but I find that kind of intervention unhelpful. I was actively engaged in editing it only with a view to trying to undo the damage, and in any event, any admin can protect a page against banned users. It's otherwise not a page I've ever paid much attention to; if it had been, I'd have noticed the sockpuppetry earlier.</dd>
<dd>I'd like to keep it protected until we establish which other accounts, if any, might have been Zephram Stark. I'll make a request today and it shouldn't take long. As for which version to revert to, I believe the rewrite was instigated by one of the sockpuppets and it changed key parts of the policy; everyone involved in the rewrite was either a sockpuppet or a newish editor so far as I can tell, and I don't recall seeing any attempts to involve others in the rewrite. As the page is policy, a broader consensus would be needed for any major changes. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:16, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've rolled it back to the pre re-write version, because I don't want to get into trying to judge which edits were okay and which not.

<dd>I requested a check user and the only two Zephram-related accounts are Team Shocker, confirmed, and Dragon's Blood, not confirmed but not ruled out by technical evidence. It was one of them who suggested the rewrite in the first place and both were actively engaged in forming it on various talk pages, so the new version should be regarded as thoroughly tainted.

<p>SlimVirgin resolved an editing dispute between herself and two other editors by calling them sock puppets and banning them without any evidence. That is the only thing that happened here. When people questioned her about her charges, she claimed to have requested a check user. No such check user request exists through the proper channels <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, nor is there anything in her contributions to suggest that she requested a check user anywhere else on Wikipedia in the three and a half hours between when she claims to have made the request and when she claims to have heard the response, "not confirmed but not ruled out by technical evidence."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060515233834&amp;limit=23&amp;target=SlimVirgin" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060515233834&amp;limit=23&amp;target=SlimVirgin" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Because there is no reason for my block, I, <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragon%27s_Blood_8153.html" title="User:Dragon's Blood">User:Dragon's Blood</a>, would like to be reinstated, at which time I intend to launch a full investigation into the misconduct of <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" title="User:Freakofnurture">User:freakofnurture</a> (for deleting the article he mentions without an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">AfD</a>). --4.238.85.76 19:08, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see that the main reason for reverting of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> page is because it was rewritten by a sock puppet. That is not correct. It was rewritten by me: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASock_puppetry&amp;diff=51053913&amp;oldid=51043045" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASock_puppetry&amp;diff=51053913&amp;oldid=51043045" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. And I am not a sock puppet. Or at least nobody ever accused me of being one. Therefore, reverting of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> has no real reason. The change was, BTW, announced on the talk page of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> and discussed for 2 weeks. If you have any objections to new version of the page, please state it. Reverting the effort of several users just because someone falsly accused me of being a sock puppet is <b>not right</b>. I am just asking for somebody to tell me what's wrong with new version of the page and all I get is an edit war. Have I lost my mind?

I've edited out some of the text which I felt was mediation-specific; I initally agreed to help put it in the required format for RfM, but on reading and looking into the surface of the matter, felt it was better handled outside mediation. Since I'm the one handling the mediation side of it, I don't feel quite comfortable undertaking an investigation; could someone, perhaps someone with a better knowledge of the situation, take a look and see what can be done? As I say, OWB is an older gentleman, and has difficulty with some aspects of electronic communication, but is an excellent contributor; he even goes to the Library of Congress regularly to do research for articles.

<ul>
<li>constant unending personal attacks such as the ones on the alleged sock puppet charge, a charge he knows to be false, and yet made it solely to intimidate people from opposing him - which, if you check the other user's page, he has evidently suceeded at - that user will no longer edit in wikipedia due to the barrage of false accusations;</li>
<li>falsely accusing me of sock puppeting;</li>
<li>lying about me to editors;</li>
<li>calling me names on an administers talk page;</li>
<li>edits talk pages and deletes sections as though he is some master of the language - where are his credentials to do such? He has none except his vicious personal agenda against those who disagree with him;</li>
<li>attempting to bully, harass and intimidate every person who dares disagree with him - I have gotten two private emails from other members applauding my refusing to be bullied by his vicious, unending, vile personal, attacks.</li>
<li>why is it that every other user got along fine with the peer review on Bonnie and Clyde except this one? BECAUSE HE COULD NOT GET HIS POV WAY. He asked for a peer review, then whined, cried, moaned, and launched every vicious personal attack he could on me when others did not see things his way;</li>
<li>he should NOT be on wikipedia in any capacity, and I beg the committee, once the check/user on the false sock puppet is done, and an examination of the edits, showing no similarity to my work, to punish him severely for the false accusation, and his unending personal bile;</li>
<li>I am quoting directly from one of the emails: "this person is the most arrogant and meanspirited person on wikipedia, and hopefully after this phony sock puppet charge, they will finally kick him off." I will gladly forward the emails to you! Other people are tired of this vile neverending personal assaults that typify this user.</li>
</ul>
You know from way back that I detest sock puppets, and no more insulting attack coudl have been made on me - and I am just waiting for the committee to run check/user and assess the edits, and then I truly believe the committee should address teh fact that this guy used a wikipedia tool which is supposed to be reserved for real cases, to retaliate, and effectively drove a new user and contributor out of wikipedia by making it so unpleasant, he says he won't be back. As I point out on teh sock puppet page, while of course, I, like anyone, appreciate compliments on my work, the user in question was not even really involved in the peer review - all those folks and I got only great, we identified the issues in question, and except for <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> were all happy in consensus with the result. He then called me names on an admin's talk page, made the charge that AnnH has said has no proof whatsoever, (if making the first comment on someone's talk page was proof, she, an editor, had done so also! - and which I did out of sarcasm after <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> begin hinting I was using puppets in the review - which again, when you examine it, you will see is totally false. Anyway, I am not the first person this user attacked. He needs to be curtailed, and the unending viciousness put to a stop.</blockquote>

<p><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">User:Cyde</a> recently engaged in some use of blocks to further a pattern of personal attacks.</p>
<p>I have been editing <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, and got drawn into an edit-war; a bit hot-headed on my part. I got carried away on reverting some POV-mongering by User:KDRGibby (7RR) and <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">User:Drogo Underburrow</a>. When I realized I made a fourth reversion, I emailed <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">User:MONGO</a> to tell him that in the interest of procedural fairness, he should place a 3RR block on me; later Drogo Underburrow filed a 3RR on me that was actually incorrect, having claimed several unrelated edits as reversions; but if the report had been more accurate, there <i>was</i> a 3RR in there.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter (before MONGO had seen the email), Cyde started at some drastic misbehavior that is a concern to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cyde has previously engaged in aggressive personal attacks on me on unrelated matters, and should recuse himself from this particular block. Moreover, he had not been following 3RR reports in the same timeframe, but simply noticed my name, and saw an opportunity to "get even" for an earlier RfC against him.</li>
<li>Cyde blocked me, <a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">User:Zleitzen</a> and <a href="../../../m/y/c/User%7EMyciconia_58a4.html" title="User:Myciconia">User:Myciconia</a>, all without giving any notice of the block on our talk pages.</li>
<li>Cyde blocked Zleitzen entirely for editing in the same "direction" I had, even though Zleitzen <i>absolutely did not</i> violate 3RR.</li>
<li>Cyde refused to block Drogo Underburrow who <i>had</i> violated 3RR on the same page (but in the opposite direction as Zleitzen, Myciconia and I), even after being notified of the inconsistency.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, it's obvious that Cyde is using blocks out of a vendetta and in contempt of 3RR guidelines. This sort of misuse of administrative powers have been pretty much a uniform M.O. by Cyde. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 07:06, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It might have been reasonable if Cyde's blocks had not, in fact, been purely one-sided. I let Cyde know in email that if he wanted to be consistent, he would need to include Drogo Underburrow (who actually violated 3RR, moreover). I don't think Cyde's actions were even motivated by the underlying politics of the edit matter (my hunch is he'd probably be closer to the NPOV Zleitzen, Myciconia and I were trying to maintain, even if we <i>were</i> too agressive)... I think his actions are pure vendetta at a personal level. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 07:31, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lotus-eaters claim that I violated 3-rr is complete fiction. Cyde is absolutely correct in not blocking me. Lotus-eater has no regard for civilty; he calls other editors contributions as "pov-mongering" as he did here, and he frequently call other editors contributions far worse names. Considering the amount of incivility he displays, he is lucky if he doesn't get blocked further. For examples of his incivility, look at his contributions to the Cuba talk page. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">Drogo Underburrow</a> 07:50, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To reiterate, the reason I reblocked was because MONGO unblocked with the complaint that it was an involved admin, and I felt MONGO had problems with Cyde, making the unblocking more out of spite than anything. I've unblocked with Lulu's assurance that he won't edit the page, but my problem is that MONGO didn't ask for such an assurance. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 06:53, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, MONGO did ask that, and I assured him. But some of it might have been in email rather than on my talk page. I actually requested that MONGO block me yesterday, in the interest of fairness (also probably in email), so I'm not really concerned about the block itself. But the fact that Cyde so unambiguously was blocking out of <i>revenge</i> rather than actual guidelines is a concern... i.e. his failure to notify and his block of <a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">User:Zleitzen</a> who's only sin was editing in the same "direction" as I had on the Cuba article (and absolutely <i>did not</i> violate 3RR), while refusing to block an editor on the other side (<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">User:Drogo Underburrow</a>) for actual 3RR violation. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 07:20, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, I was blocked simply for sorting out the page after a banned user KDRGibby had been deleting paragraphs in frustration and adding duplicate material, as per discussion with administrators of that block. I edited three times on two different paragraphs. One of which was because I was under the impression that KDRGibby had been banned, but he popped up again to revert so I had to act again. I wasn't warned or notified of my block and received no apology from Cyde, who unblocked me after communications with the comment "long enough". I was able to get another administrator to add a disclaimer that my block was in error. Still, it leaves a rather unpleasant taste. And more than anything makes me wonder whether this is the online community for me. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 07:54, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>I won't. And I didn't. Also the report is meaningless; a bogus filing that served to introduce me to the world of 3-rr reporting. I didn't violate the policy then, that report was filed by an editor who doesn't know what reverts are, and thought because I made four edits I had made four reverts. No action was taken against me, because I didn't do anything.</p>
<p>Lulu, on the other hand, had spent the entire day edit-warring, making edit after edit that reverted what other editors were trying to do. That is why he got blocked. Now, he makes up a lie that I violated 3-RR, probably intended to make Cyde look bad. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">Drogo Underburrow</a> 09:00, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Drogo's correct that I don't like gross violations of NPOV by him and some other editors. But in terms of the 3RR issue itself, I reverted <i>exactly</i> four times, not any more than that. Which as I've said, means I earned a block, and which I recognize was wrong of me (and which is why I <i>asked to be blocked</i>). But Drogo's 3RR report, and his complaint above, is just a rambling list of edits to various sections of the article that he didn't like because it didn't advance his editorial position. In any case, the problems with Cyde's actions aren't the fact I was blocked (which was proper), but the fact that <i>he</i> did it, without any notification, and that he blocked non-3RR editors on a selective basis. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 16:39, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Recently Template:User sumofpi was listed on TfD. The <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_e2bf.html#Template:User_sumofpi" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion">outcome</a> was overwhelmingly <b>Keep</b>. The template was then deprecated by subst'ing and deleted anyway. I have just restored it. This same situation with templates being deleted following clear votes to keep has occurred on other templates. I have not restored those others because I think we need to settle this here and now rather than starting another silly war over little rectangles.</p>
<p>Do we have rules and procedures or not?</p>
<p>I don't really care one way or another whether there exists a userbox that lists the value of 'pi'... but if we have a policy which says that we have TfD's on whether or not to keep these then we have to abide by that policy. Not put things on TfD and then delete them anyway regardless of the outcome. Doing so amounts to going out of our way to antagonize the general users by blatantly demonstrating a complete disregard for the concepts of 'consensus' and 'policy' that we are <b>supposed</b> to be upholding.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to delete userboxes at whim then follow process to get a new 'speedy delete all userboxes' criteria added. Or rewrite the policies to 'admins can do anything they want and users just have to accept that'. However, so long as we continue to publically <i>claim</i> to believe in some sort of 'due process' and decisions by 'community consensus' this kind of behaviour cannot stand. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 11:16, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>People can disagree over whether or not they'd have closed the TfD in the same way as Mackensen did here. However, your post to AN/I like this, and your immediate action in undeleting and screaming about Mackensen's supposed abuse of process leads me to assume one of two things: a) you don't have a clue what you're talking about (I <i>know</i> this is not the case), or b) you're making a massive assumption of bad faith on Mackensen's part. <i>Please</i>, this is not appropriate. There's a DRV in progress. If you'd have closed differently, why not just mosey on over there and say "I'd have closed differently"?

<ul>
<li>You're kidding right? You are actually claiming that there was some way to interpret that TfD discussion as a consensus to delete? Really? And to be clear... yes, I think Mackensen was willfully acting in bad faith. Closing a deletion debate you started is not a good thing. Closing it as 'delete' when there is <b>no</b> possible way to see that as the consensus is not a good thing.

<li>Of course not. (My understanding of) The way he interpreted it was that, while everyone wanted the content kept, those arguing for deletion were saying it didn't belong in template namespace, while those arguing for keeping just didn't want the content to go away. I can see how someone, closing in good faith, would say "okay, we'll keep the content <i>and</i> remove it from the template namespace".

<li>Of course; it's one courtesy I always try to extend. You posted a vote count; regardless of how sophisticated it was (and I admit, it's better than the standard "4 delete 3 keep" thing we see from the clueless on AfD) it's meaningless. The comments of each user were not included in your post, but the comments are <i>important</i>. People are better off looking at the TfD and making their own minds up than having you poke vote tallies in their noses. It's one thing to look at the TfD and say "I don't read it the same way Mackensen did", but quite another to look at it and say "I count this many votes for x, y, or z!" <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 11:47, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You believed, and still believe, that policy/process allows the person nominating a template for deletion to be the one who closes the discussion? Really? If so, then my apologies... the problem is not bad faith but lack of understanding of the process. However, I <i>really</i> have to strain the AGF muscles to believe <i>that</i> and that you thought there was a consensus to delete the templates so long as the content was kept. I don't see how you could have reached that conclusion, and obviously (based on the objections) it wasn't the intent of the participants, but if you really <i>thought</i> that was the 'consensus' you are again merely incorrect. I suggest that <i>at best</i> your view of the desired outcome colored your interpretation of the 'consensus'... which is why you shouldn't have been closing it in the first place. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 12:35, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I count 8 keep votes (more if 'as above' votes are interpreted to refer to only the vote above, but I discount that) that specifically refer to the template being harmless/worth retention. I am not commenting on the relative merits of the arguments, but having read them IMO the keep votes have sufficient weight to at least suggest a 'no concensus' result. BTW, it strikes me that we'd all save a bit of time if an official policy re userboxes was reached and supported. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colon</a><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_Esperanza_bb00.html" title="User:Col tom/Esperanza"><font color="green">el</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Tom</a> 12:55, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It was not my intention to make you feel ganged up on. But you have to understand that admins will not block people based on your say so. It would be so much more pleasent if you simply put your argument nicely on the talk page of the article and then let the community decide. The rules are there for one reason alone - to ensure that people cooperate rather than war over articles. You are trying to use the rules as weapons in order to win a war. That's why I accused you of bullying. I've seen plenty of real meatpuppeting to know that your template was wholly unjustified. Try to see it from thier point of view. How would you feel if people started slapping accusatory templates about you all over the place? How would you feel if people tried to get you punished for getting a <i>little</i> upset over being accused of something you didn't do? How would you feel if after removing wholly unjustified templates from your own talk page someone slapped further templates accusing you of vandalism becaused you removed them and then got into an edit war with you over it so that an admin had to protect your talkpage to stop the onslaught? Because you have done all that and more. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 21:52, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am writing to report unsubstantiated deletions by user "moe.RON" regarding legally licensed images that I uploaded while following the Wikiepdia guidelines for image uploading. The first, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janick_Gers_8444.html" title="Janick Gers">Janick Gers</a>, is the VHS cover photo of a foreign concert tape entitled "Dive! DIve! Live!" Video tape covers are listed as a viable option for photo uploads. The second, <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trevor_Horn_b842.html" title="Trevor Horn">Trevor Horn</a>, is the cover of the RECORD PRODUCER magazine dated 16 December 2002. Anyone familiar with RECORD PRODUCER knows that the front cover always is without text; the inside contents contains official text information.</p>
<p>Moe.ron has no proof otherwise and has been annoyingly removing these perfectly legal images. He demands that the user abide by his unsubstantiated image questioning techniques, which is unfair to Wikipedia users. I feel it is very dangerous for users and administrators to consider images "unsourced" without any proper evidence or cause. Thanks - Padgett22</p>

<dd>(After edit conflict, it looks like Moe well encapsulates my views.) Notwithstanding that this likely oughtn't to be at AN/I, <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoeron_c492.html" title="User:Moeron">Moeron</a> appears to have acted appropriately here; with respect to the first photo, the picture is almost certainly not an uncropped version of the VHS cover, and, with respect to the second, Moe's inference that the image wasn't the complete cover was wholly reasonable, and, even as I accept with <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> Padgett's adduction of <i>Record Producer'</i>s having a text-free cover, I'd prefer that we be able to substantiate such contention (Google hasn't been of much help). In any case, Padgett seems to misunderstand our policy with respect to images; images are not presumptively included, they are presumptively excluded and must be accurately tagged with celerity, lest they should be deleted. Whilst each was tagged to provide copyright info, at least one tag appears to have been in error, and it was reasonable to conclude that the other was as well. Moe did not delete the images in question, and his commenting-out was consistent with policy; should proper copyright info be provided, the images can surely be returned to the articles. Finally, Moe wasn't acting as an admin here; he was simply commenting out unsourced images (likely) soon to be deleted, as any editor may and as any good editor should. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:26, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Presumably pushes POV, pushing pro-monarchist moves, pushes a regnal number to a person who just was a pretender of a kingdom.</p>
<p>User Gryffindor made the following move: "14:10, 17 May 2006 Gryffindor m (moved Ernst August Prinz von Hannover Sr to <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Augustus_IV%2C_Prince_of_Hanover_941a.html" title="Ernest Augustus IV, Prince of Hanover">Ernest Augustus IV, Prince of Hanover</a>: what happened here?...."</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29_dca3.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(names_and_titles)</a>: Monarchical titles, rule 6: "Do not apply an ordinal in an article title to a pretender, i.e., someone who has not reigned. For example, use Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou, not Louis XX when referring to the legitimist pretender to the French throne....even though royalists call him so."</p>
<p>Simply saying, Gryffindor moved an article to a name which is clearly against the naming convention and which supports the idea that Ernest was a ruler, not a pretender.</p>
<p>Gryffindor has worked for months and months here in Wikipedia, participating (and pushing) talks about royal and nobility titling, and made a huge number of small edits to royalty articles. It is inconceivable that Gryffindor were unaware of the naming convention, and the correct way to name pretenders.</p>
<p>When doing that move, Gryffindor had already received an invitation to participate in general discussion what to do with Ernests, as evidenced by Gryffindor's user-talkpage's diff <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGryffindor&amp;diff=53663942&amp;oldid=53532066" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGryffindor&amp;diff=53663942&amp;oldid=53532066" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. Gryffindor however went and moved the article page to a location which is against naming rule (forbids ordinals of pretenders).</p>
<p>Gryffindor knows very well that regnal number is forbidden and Gryffindor has repeatedly received admonitions -at least a year now- that royal titles and such paraphernalia should not be bestowed against facts of real life. I believe Gryffindor is a repeater of such POV offenses.</p>
<p>Now Gryffindor has made a move to push a regnal number to a pretender.</p>
<p>I request that Gryffindor be blocked for a couple of weeks' duration, to reflect her/himself the problems caused by overly monarchist POV pushing. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarrtel_9c5d.html" title="User:Marrtel">Marrtel</a> 15:19, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is complete nonsense. Everyone who deals with Gryffindor knows him to be one of the fairest and most objective contributors to WP. Those particular pages are causing problems because a series of individuals all have the same name. Some individual unilaterally moved the pages from their previous location, without consultation or going through requested moves, to ludicrous makey-up non-existent names, breaking MoS rules on name usage. Royalty and nobility never ever use <i>Sr</i> and <i>Jr</i>. Calling Ernst Augustus <i>Sr</i> is a bit like putting George W. Bush at <i>George II</i>. It is absurd and nonsensical. All Gryffindor did was return the pages to their original location (where people can find them and where there links were) to enable a debate to take place on how to diffrentiate between the multiple Ersnt Augustus claimants. He broke no rule, just acted as any professional Wikipedian would act. Marrtel's claim is balderdash from start to finish. Accusing someone like Gryffindor of being a POV pusher is a bit like accusing Jimbo of being a sockpuppet and a vandal. It is nutty. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 15:55, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was no mere vandalism. Changing a message hundreds of people have already chosen for their userpages is <b>megavandalism</b> of hundreds userpages.

<dd>The problem is hundreds of people did't. Can they be vandalized because they never heard of "subst" (like me until very recently) or simply preferred the uncluttered versions of their pages (also like me)?

<p>This reeks of POINT and it certainly isn't civil. Furthermore, I am astounded that someone would actually block for this case of 3RR and not block Cyde and Gmaxwell. You shouldn't get to edit war by virtue of having one more person than the other side and get away with it.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I have to concur here. I thought it was funny too, and I am the one that got blocked over it. However, "funny" is not really appropriate when it is affecting many users on The Project. With regard to InShaneee's comment - subst is not, as far as I know, official policy or even suggested guideline regarding userboxes at this point, so it is unreasonable to expect everyone to have already worked together to come up with that solution to the problem. <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERexmorgan_3f09.html" title="User:Rexmorgan">Rexmorgan</a> 18:50, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It may not have been the best move, but I still wouldn't call it vandalism. First of all, the simple fact is that without transclusion, you're open to whatever happens to the template, like it or not. Secondly, although the gif was a bit over the top, the new text was NPOV, and as silly as it came out, I don't think it's something he should be punished for; rather, he should simply be overruled on the talk page. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 19:06, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are not talking an article page. We are talking a message that multiple users link to their userpages (as userbiox policy allows them to) and some other users (who do not use it) want changed. The outsiders can always create their own template if they want. This is the difference between an article about a person/thing/idea and a template where a dissatisfied user can always create a new one. There is no need of template compromises.

<dd>Although the debate over whether the template should be kept on WP has moved elsewhere I think there is a larger problem that has been glossed over: Cyde and Gmaxwell were irresponsible and created a debate unnecessarily. Their claims that the changes were made to the templates out of "good faith" to preserve NPOV are laughable and I think that as admins they should know better. Can the fact that they seem to be getting out of this unscathed indicate that other admins are endorsing this sort of thing?<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7EReverie_0dde.html" title="User:Reverie">Reverie</a> 07:58, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've got to agree with Reverie here. At DRV/U, some users have pointed out that that page isn't the appropriate place for discussion of Cyde and Gmaxwell's behavior. Although many admins and other users have agreed that the affair was a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation, Gmaxwell is continuing to maintain that his sole intention was a concern for NPOV. I don't think that a heavy sanction is warranted (especially if he has the decency to apologise, as Cyde has done), but perhaps something should be done to show that this sort of thing isn't appropriate behavior. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 08:48, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please show me the edit where I claimed userboxes are sacred. You seem to mix up my (twice) reverting what I deemed (and still deem) a simple vandalism by Cyde &amp; Gmaxwell (please note that arguing an edit is vandalism is explicitely allowed under <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>) and my voice in discussion saying that templates should be treated more lentient than articles under <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> because the persons who don't like a template may create an alternative one. Since when discussing <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> is breaking it? Also, do you mean that arguing that what Cyde and Gmaxwell did was vandalism means breaking <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>? I believe that <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is about accusing about bad intentions, not criticizing past deeds: "<i>This policy does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary.

<dd>I understand Mackensen's objections, but I wonder if a proscription against a user's uploading images (where he/she has continually contravened our policies with respect to tagging and sourcing) is much different from a proscription against a user's editing a specific articles or articles w/r/to a certain topic where the user has been disruptive on such article or topic. I imagine that we'd not want image uploading-specific blocks to be doled out only by the ArbComm, as almost every article- or subject-specific ban is, but I think that, where a user may be productive on the whole but disruptive relative to certain specific articles/categories/actions, it's appropriate that we take action such that the users productive edits may continue whilst the destructive edits cease. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:36, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An anon coming from various dynamic IPs (all starting with 219.64.) is way over 3RR in the article about Dia Mirza, a <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bollywood.html" title="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> actress. He (or she) doesn't want the filmography in a table, for some reason, and insists on including a list of products in whose advertisements the actress has appeared. This strikes me as using Wikipedia for advertising (and it's becoming a problem all across the Bollywood articles -- I think some publicist has discovered us). While it would take a lot of time to do checkuser on all the anons to do a 3RR complaint, semi-protection would either solve the problem, or force the user to register. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:28, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Posting to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> with specifics of what has been happening will also raise its profile and attract the attention of other administrators who can help watch the article.

<p>I feel there is quite a bias against older people on Wikipedia. Many of the administrators on Wikipedia are university students, who are quick to call older Wikipedians insulting names. Older people are not used to these attacks and sometimes respond incorrectly, resulting in a ban. I know personally older people who have been banned, and sometimes for good, and think that it may be a culture issue. Are older people welcome on Wikipedia, or is it mainly the preserve of university students? <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWallie_96b2.html" title="User:Wallie">wallie</a> 19:53, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've always written "old," and now that I am past middle age it just fits. As for "ageism," I keep saying it, and nobody seems to hear me: it is deeds, not persons, that matter in virtual space. As such, there is a very clear age skew among Wikipedia editors, but not in terms of actual agism. Instead, we have overly enthusiastic promotion of webcomics, web forums, pop songs, pop TV phenomena, and "memes" (ugh! anyone incapable of seeing the absurdity of that term is already a victim) and overly enthusiastic persuance of feuds, conspiracies, and campaigns. In other words, these things are the <i>result</i> of the age skew. Yes, there is a big, big bulge in the age curve at Wikipedia in the 25 and under segment, and it's self-limited by literacy requirements on its low end, but all of that <i>could</i> be written by desperate middle age folks. Our articles, our <i>deeds,</i> show the skew. Our articles and our deeds are a young skew. But, since it's always deeds, not persons, I think we can <i>demonstrate</i> the advantages of experience to the younger users or we can <i>demand</i> them. Demanding rarely works. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:21, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, and about the dismissals aimed at the young -- "ageist comments" aimed at the young -- no one knows anyone's age, so I take these as either clueless and stingless or as comments on the quality of the words. In the case of Bishonen, it's obviously absurd to think that she has been writing in an immature way, so I imagine that those insults were just the flailing arms of a drowning (and probably very young) person. Otherwise, if there is anything to them at all, the message is probably, "You are writing in too many generalizations/with too little knowledge of the context/with too much enthusiasm/too breathlessly/with too much self-satisfaction" but said in a hamfisted way as "immature." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:24, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wallie, I'm a university student, and I respect the editors who make great contributions.

<dd>I'm curious what Wallie means by "older". I'm over 50 and said so when I ran for ArbCom; I've never gotten a comment that's indicated any other editors gave a damn one way or another. So maybe if there is a bias against aged editors, I'm still too young to qualify or something. I'll admit that I do sometimes make ageist comments: specifically, if I find myself needing to block a shared school IP for juvenile behavior, my reason for blocking will often be "schoolchild vandalism". It hasn't occurred to me so far to keep an eye out for bad behavior in, say, the 70-plus crowd. Maybe I should. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 04:51, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The "age problem" seems to crop up when an editor appears to conform to one an age-related stereotypes (e.g., the hackneyed "teenager living in his parent's basement", who seems to be at the heart of every USENET flamewar while at the same time having written the entire Linux kernel while skipping all of his classes). I'd guess that this is because there are so few clues from other Wikipedians about their age, forcing us to project our own expectations upon others.</dd>
<dd>I'll confess that there was a time when I thought I was the oldest contributor to Wikipedia, with 15-20 years on everyone else (yes, I am older than Jimbo); after having been to a few Wikimeetups, I was very happy to find that there were at least a couple of Wikipedians in my age group, which made me far more comfortable here.

<p>This Wikipedian has has a long history of antisocial behaviour and abusive and wholesale reverts. As of a few minutes ago he has a) reverted, across several pages, week-old improvements resulting from many past complaints, a month of discussion, weeks of building consensus not to mention all the work to make the changes. What's more, after I cancelled the abusive reverts, the same followed me around page by page to revert <i>again</i>.</p>
<p>This is but the pinnacle of a long list of disruptive behaviour to many of the pages this user contributes to. It seems that this user sees Wiki as a place to concretize his/her knowledge and opinions, and this in spite of the contributions/questions of other contirbutors about/to his/her work. Never partaking in any constructive or preemptive discussion, this user simply reverts any edit not of his or her taste - and at best searches even the most trifling 'error' to 'justify' a wholesale revert - and if there is no error, 'insinuates' one. This behaviour is seen as arrogant, antisocial, and, most of all, discouraging to other contributors.</p>
<p>This is but the 'act' of it, but recent days have but confirmed this user's pollution of many articles with suggestive, selective and omissive informatons that would suggest a reality that is clearly unreferencable and a joke to those who know better. If you would like to see evidence of this please see to the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Talk%7EParis_8a09.html" title="Talk:Paris">Talk:Paris</a> pages - there's tons of archives to this end.

<dd>Amongst vague and general accusations (antisocial behavior?), ThePromenader is refering to a template which he recently created (Template:Major French Cities) and with which he intends to replace the template Template:Large French Cities which has been in existence for more than a year now (see <a href="../../../t/o/u/Template%7EToulouse_infobox_2ef7.html" title="Template:Toulouse infobox">Template:Toulouse infobox</a> or Template:Bordeaux infobox for the original individual versions of the template, before they were standardized into Template:Large French Cities). I have questioned the motives for this new template, and exposed some of the misconceptions of ThePromenader about French cities at <a href="../../../p/a/r/Talk%7EParis_8a09.html" title="Talk:Paris">Talk:Paris</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yet instead of clearly answering the points raised or acknowledging errors when I point them out, all I ever get from this user are baseless accusations and hot blooded messages. I can provide a list of ThePromenader's hot blooded and insulting messages that I have received over the months if an administrator wants to have a look at it. When I say insulting, I mean messages in which I am being called a "wily little creature" and other such niceties. Despite this, I have never filed any complaint against ThePromenader, and I believe the proper place for the strong disagreement between ThePromenader and I is mediation rather than incidents, but if ThePromenader insists on treating this at incidents I can bring clear evidence of his oft violent messages. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 22:11, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's a pity that English Wikipedia's French pages still have so few knowledgable contributors that far-flung "concepts" imposed by one can remain unaltered, uncorrected and unsourced for so long, but this can be in no way an argument against improvement and change. The above insinuates much but says nothing, but the facts are this: Our collective work, discussion and consensus of the past weeks, involving, amongst others, a longtime Wiki administrator, has been singlehandedly reverted by a single opinioned contributor who can offer no clear justification for having reverted - three times - and the third after I took the time to bat down the last round of vague allusions that, under no circumstances could ever merit a total, wholesale and widespread revert. This user didn't even look at the template before reverting (proven), and didn't even read the talk page before reverting (now proven).

<dd>I would like to point out that the infobox proposed by ThePromenader is not a "collective work" as ThePromenader falsely pretends, but is solely his responsability. Other users have participated in the discussion at <a href="../../../p/a/r/Talk%7EParis_8a09.html" title="Talk:Paris">Talk:Paris</a>, but it is ThePromenader alone who designed his infobox and decided what to include in it, and what not to include. In particular, I am sorry if this is becoming a little technical, but ThePromenader insisted on including urban area population figures in his infobox alongside the usual metropolitan area population figure found in most other city infoboxes on Wikipedia. According to ThePromenader, the concept of metropolitan area doesn't accurately describe French cities, whereas the concept of urban area is better suited, says he. Unfortunately this is only personal opinion, and absolutely nothing shows or proves that the concept of metropolitan area is less suited to French cities than it is suited to, say, US or German cities. Absolutely no other user asked for urban area figures to be included in the infobox, yet ThePromenader included them anyway. To call this "collective" work is really stretching the meaning of the word "collective". <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 23:23, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Do comments like "good work" mean nothing? This is not a discussion about the 'merit' of the metropolitan area - which is dumb because the MA info is there. You have absolutely no excuse for your behaviour, and if you are unable to find suitable sources or even build consensus for your unshared and unreferencable theories then tough luck - It wasn't time that was lacking - this has been going on for <i>months</i>!

<p>Silly to put it like that, granted, but yes, I've made an archive of all your abusive reverts - for starters. Hold with the totally unjustified 'stalking' claim destined for once-only readers. Find the mediation link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35378137#Paris" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35378137#Paris" rel="nofollow">here</a> - you of course blanked my message about this from your talk page. In that link you can also find the other forms of aid/mediation I'd initiated previously. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePromenader_3b0e.html" title="User:ThePromenader"><span style="font-family: Times; font-size:12px;"><span style="font-size:16px;">T</span>HE<span style="font-size:16px;">P</span>ROMENADER</span></a> 07:39, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your mediation link shows: a- that you posted that mediation request 5 months ago without leting me know of it (what a nice attitude!), and b- that I didn't turn it down, since I didn't know about it in the first place.

<p>I'm an outsider to all of this (and not an admin). Not to make light of the troubles obviously involved here, but this is reading like a parody of a Wikipedia dispute (albeit highly entertaining and well-written). Hopefully you can find a mediator you both respect to at least advise on your interactions with each other, if not on the details of the content dispute. So much heat on an issue like this is not only unfortunate for those involved, but reflects badly on Wikipedia in general. <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 08:03, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I asked him to stop three times, the last time making it clear that I would block, then having had no response, I blocked him for an hour ~20 minutes ago in the hope of getting his attention.

<p>I am quite tired of MutterErde's manipulations. It may be a shared IP, but MutterErde is the only one using it here, and it is obviously not the usual AOL-style dynamic IP, because he always has the same one. I have blocked it again, albeit for a shorter duration. Please note that as an indefinitely banned user, MutterErde is <i>not</i> permitted to post here or at individual talk pages. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 16:24, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>AOL does seem to provide DSL service in Germany, but 195.93.60.132 seems to resolve as "cache-frr-ae04.proxy.aol.com", so it looks like it may be an AOL caching proxy instead of someone's semi-permanent DSL IP. No way of knowing how many people the proxy might be serving, but there might be at least the possibility of affecting other AOL editors there with a long block. The unsigned comment from 195.93.60.33 resolves to another proxy (cache-frr-ab01.proxy.aol.com), so MutterErde may either be able to access from a number of these by resetting his AOL connection, or have had a friend also on the AOL Germany network make the post. <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 16:56, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh thank you. Do I understand Pathoschild's lines correct? He has created a new category/template (As far as I know MutterErde was banned in September 2005 not in May 2006 - by Jimbo himself, nobody else) but this might involve problems with his new creation and so he has deleted the whole site? Reality bites?

<p>I would like to request clarification and feedback. A user (User:Locke Cole) apparently will be banned soon or plans to leave Wikipedia at some point. I don't believe I have ever encountered him before this matter. He has repeatedly requested his talk page be speedily deleted, citing <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a> as justification. However, it has been restored each time (twice by me, after discussing it above), since it appears to fall outside deletion policy. While I agree that user pages may be deleted at any time, I feel that user talk pages should <i>not</i> be deleted, and this is what I recall from previous discussions as well. In particular, the talk page is one in which others have had the majority of edits. Not only is it inappropriate, I feel, for a user to be able to control deletion in this manner, it removes those edits from the contribution history of others. I think it is important to keep these in the history; they may be relevant for RFA or RFAR (for those users), for instance. Furthermore, I think it's important to retain the history of comments to that user as well, especially since Arbitration Committee bans are not indefinite and users can come back from wikibreaks.</p>
<p>I don't believe <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a> applies. In the first place, I don't believe it is policy, though I have requested clarification there. In the second, it only applies for editors who have left a project; it is inappropriate for those continuing to edit to use it as justification. In the third place, it is intended for the removal of personal information. In the fourth, it applies to user and talk <i>sub</i>pages, not the talk page itself (although Locke Cole has since reworded the statement). In the fifth place, I don't believe it grants users the <i>right</i> to have talk pages deleted, but suggests it as an option.</p>
<p>Deletion of the page clearly falls outside Wikipedia's deletion policy. It does not satisfy any criterion for speedy deletion. In particular, criterion U1 explicitly covers subpages, and G7 is for pages of which the requester is the primary or sole author. Clearly, for a talk page, this is not the case.</p>
<p>Locke took issue with my second undeletion. I considered the discussion at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#Locke_Cole.27s_userpage" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I#Locke Cole's userpage</a> sufficient justification (the beginning is a bit conflated by discussions of user page deletion), but Locke believes I am wheel warring. It is not my intention to wheel war, so I'll reopen the discussion. For now, I have protected Locke's talk page to prevent him from re-adding the {{db|<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a>}} template to his talk page and a random administrator wandering in, unaware of the deletion history or this discussion, re-deleting the talk page without realizing that others have been discussing it or feel it's inappropriate. If someone reads this discussion and decides that deletion is appropriate, he may remove the protection and re-delete the page. I'd ask that anyone doing so mention it here. I don't intend to further delete or un-delete the page, but feel this is an important policy matter and am interested in what others think. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 23:28, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I deleted Locke Cole's user and user talk page once because I had read <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a> in <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Right_to_vanish&amp;diff=351497&amp;oldid=346785" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Right_to_vanish&amp;diff=351497&amp;oldid=346785" rel="nofollow">Locke Cole's version</a>, which is still there. I was unaware of the previous deletions (there is an extension that gives a "page log" button, right? I need to get that) so I was the "random admin wandering in". I should probably not have deleted the talk page, especially since Locke Cole hasn't vanished. I think we should always delete user pages (not only subpages) at the request of the owner, unless they contain {{<a href="../../../i/n/d/Template%7EIndefblockeduser_10ad.html" title="Template:Indefblockeduser">indefblockeduser</a>}} or similar (<a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#U1" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#U1</a> is only about subpages, but <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia:User page</a> allows {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-owner_e6e9.html" title="Template:Db-owner">db-owner</a>}} deletion of userpages). Thinking about it, I agree with keeping the User talk page undeleted (possibly mostly blanked, but keeping the history accessible to non-admins) at least for another couple of months. I apologize for the deletion. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 23:43, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The concept behind 'right to vanish' is that someone should be able to remove all evidence of their participation in the project... change their username, adjust past signatures, and yes... delete all the pages in their userspace. If the user talk page must be retained (which certainly has <i>not</i> been the case in prior 'right to vanish' situations) then the person obviously cannot truly 'vanish'. There is a publically available record of many of their communications with other users. There is also just no <i>need</i> for this - if a 'vanished' user comes back the talk page can be undeleted. Any information needed for a RFAr can be retrieved by any admin. The record of that user's talk page (and indeed, everything they have done) still exists... it is just not available to the general public, does not show up on Google searches, et cetera. The person may then 'vanish' from the public eye... but none of the materials you suggest might be needed in the future are 'lost', we can still retrieve them at any time if need be. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 00:12, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not sure if that is needed. This editor changed his editing-behaviour and even says on his userpage I am his first wikipedia friend. Not a likely action by Merecat, unless we interpret it as a clever trick by Merecat to fool us. But that sounds utterly paranoid to me, so hence my doubts. More importantly, I feel awkward filing a RCU when I am not entirely sure my suspicions are warranted.

<dd>Editing from the same point of view as Merecat is hardly a crime; I would probably look similar if I has the stomach to edit that article. If the editor is not disruptive or obnoxious I would judge him/her based on the quality of the edits and respond accordingly. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:17, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I never suggested it was a crime. The question was out of curiosity, and if you read my comments I already said it probably was not Merecat. As to similar editing. You feel that my objecting to massive deletions is POV. That is your right, others might say that making massive edits to controversial topics is not smart. Beyond that, contrary to a disruptive editor as Merecat, this one is capable of decent discourse.

<dd>While I'm not really sure why SV made those edits or sprotected the page, I think <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> and asking her is probably the first logical step here. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 01:06, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This same anon has also been edit warring in <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_of_attainder.html" title="Bill of attainder">bill of attainder</a>. Someone with more tech savvy than I have should consider how to deal with this...floating...IP?

<dd>Certainly agree with IS and Postdif. SV's edits, on both 16 and 18 May, appear to have been altogether appropriate; in the first instance, she was incorporating Jimbo's mailing list comments, behind which a consensus appears to have developed (notwithstanding that my views apropos of living subjects are probably diametrically opposed to those of Jimbo, inasmuch as I think we should treat living subjects differently only in view of essayed legal challenges), and, in the second, she was removing an overly specific edit--the categories example given was for illustrative purposes, and discussion about the use of that category in specific ought to be undertaken at the category's talk page. Ought SV to have offered an edit summary to that effect? Yes, probably, although I've used popup revision/rollback in similar situations; anyone looking at the edit history would surely have inferred why SV reverted. Ought SV to have semi-protected the page when she was involved in the reversion and when the persistent appending of text was done neither disruptively nor destructively (I AGF here)? Maybe not; I look with disfavor upon semi-protection where disruption isn't profound, but I know there's not a consensus for my views. In short, SV did, well, nothing wrong here. It should be said that the anon is wholly correct apropos of the criminal/civil distinction, and, if the criminals cat is being used to those who've not been convicted in a criminal proceeding, he/she ought surely to explain the situation at the cat's talk page. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 01:19, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The post above, and the edits to <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>, were made by <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmorrow_1f6d.html" title="User:Amorrow">User:Amorrow</a>, who is banned from posting anywhere on this website because of very serious harassment. That's why I protected the page against him, because he tends to come back with different IP addresses, so blocking the IPs was pointless.

<dd>Ah, I see. Is this the same one that prompted your concern about protecting policy pages? How does that IP rapid-fire changing work, and is there no way to block that? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 01:34, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looks like it is part of a pool of IP numbers assigned to SBC (aren't they the ones that just renamed themselves AT&amp;T?). Likely the user is just breaking and restarting their DSL connection and getting assigned a new IP number each time. The current one seems likely to be from a San Francisco area SBC setup. <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 01:59, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I failed to think of Amorrow; in view of that, my comments w/r/to SV's rolling back without summary and SV's semi-protecting weren't accurate (although I thought her actions to have been reasonable in any event).

<dd>No worries, Joe. Regarding the proposal, Postdlf, it wasn't Morrow I had in mind. We can semi-protect against him if we have to, and he hasn't tried to edit the policies or guidelines before that I know of. We can do range blocks of his IPs, but I was worried about blocking too many people. I may try to do one now. If you suddenly hear that North America has been blocked, you'll know why.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:00, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just a simple request, I perfectly see why posts from banned users can and sometimes definitely should be removed but if you do remove it in a case where there is already a discussion (such as this thread) can you please at least link to the post's diff that way people know what your talking about, otherwise you get the equivalent of a hydra with it's heads cut off. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 03:12, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
