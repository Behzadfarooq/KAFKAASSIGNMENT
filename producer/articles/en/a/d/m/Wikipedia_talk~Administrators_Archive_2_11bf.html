<p>Hi, I'm user <a href="../../../g/u/t/User%7EGutza_f973.html" title="User:Gutza">Gutza</a> and I can't log in any more. I'm sorry if I should've complained about this somewhere else, I found no better place to do it. I'm sure I'm typing my credentials right, I use Mozilla and it stores the credentials for all the sites I'm registered with, and I used it before to log in Wikipedia. Also, my user hasn't been deleted because trying to re-create it results in an error message saying a user with the same name already exists, or something to that effect. Does anyone know what happened? Please answer on <a href="../../../g/u/t/User_talk%7EGutza_c3f3.html" title="User talk:Gutza">my user's talk page</a> so we don't load this page with this discussion.

<p><a href="../../../k/k/a/User%7EKkawohl_239a.html" title="User:Kkawohl">User:Kkawohl</a> I have been attempting to post somewhat controversial items relating to 21st Century Spirituality and a reestablishment of Transcendentalism in the 21st Century and how it relates to religious rationality. I was called a nut-case and my postings were considered propaganda and were deleted consistently. Is religious rationality which is not based on superstitions that have survived since the Middle Ages not an item of interest? How much power is too much if administrators can base deletions on their biased religious beliefs?</p>

<p>Just unblocked 216.135.25.129 and 216.135.25.89 (but not 216.135.25.72), since I suppose it's unlikely that e will have the same ip address again, after it's changed...

the important need for such topics to be discussed on this website and at least explained in a more understandable manner

to fill in the topic. If it was essay in form, it is simply because emotions on relationships are not
dictionary materials like words given meaning to.

<p>Theoretically we could enhance security by allowing a petition of sysops to immediately desysop someone. That way the damage caused by a hijacked account would be minimised.

<p>If someone's account is hijacked, and the hijacker goes on a rampage, someone will just act unilaterally to block the account (I'm not naming any names).

<dd>The problem is that a sysop can just unblock themselves if someone blocks them. The inability of sysops to block each other was generally considered to be a good idea, on the mailing list. Perhaps we could use another model. The model I'm thinking of would be equally applicable to banning and desysoping. We need a method of enforcing the consensus model without leading to destructive short-term unilateral bans. Perhaps a sysop should be able to pre-register their support for a given user, and if any sysop (other than themselves) is supporting the user, they cannot be banned or demoted. This "support" would expire shortly after the supporting user logs off, so if the situation changes suddenly, we won't be left with the situation of frantically trying to contact sleeping Wikipedians. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 03:22, Oct 9, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why don't we de-sysop folks who've gone away anyway? It's easy enough for them to re-nominate themselves on requests for adminship, and if they've been away for a while then they might not have a handle on current community norms anyway, so a slight delay would be a good thing.

<dd>It would have the huge potential benefit of declawing the potential (decidedly not imminent) situation where someone were to do the minimum to get sysopped (either as a preface to creating a permanently active account, or in addition to one that they already held, but thought would not pass the hurdle to sysopdom), and keep the sysop power as a sort of pocket sysop ticket, one to be pulled out of the blue, without accountability, or connection to the cause of the user its actions served. -- <a href="../../../c/i/m/User%7ECimon_avaro_23aa.html" title="User:Cimon avaro">Jussi-Ville Heiskanen</a> 19:47, Oct 10, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Right now there are many more sysops than ever before. If one of them goes on a rampage, it might take a Developer to stop them. A developer could unilaterally (but temporarily) de-sysop them. Or even make the whole database read-only.</p>

<dd>I disagree with de-sysoping inactive users. The security benefits of this action are insignificant compared to the costs in terms of alienation of the users involved. Most developers are capable of blocking sysops, that includes Erik, Brion, Ed and myself. Between the four of us, there's someone hanging around pretty much all the time. Most of these inactive sysops have a much better handle on current community norms than any newly-created sysop. Newbie sysops often make mistakes, but that's okay because all sysop actions are reversible.</dd>

<dd>It is not hijacked sysop accounts which worry me. It is anyone with a working knowledge of Perl and a grudge. The most destructive attacks which could be performed on Wikipedia with a bot <i>do not require sysop access</i>. Current controls (i.e. username blocks) would be largely ineffective in the face of a properly-programmed bot. A sysop account would be able to operate more quickly, so the effect would be larger but qualitatively the same. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 01:08, Oct 11, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually it might be worth removing Lee's developer access. Developer accounts are truly dangerous. Lee can easily log in via SSH and give himself back developer access if he needs it. The web interface doesn't have the level of security afforded by SSH. In fact it would probably be a good idea to demote all web-interface developer access accounts (but leave the names in bold-italic). Any developer can turn the flag back on when they need it, and turn it off when they are finished. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 01:30, Oct 11, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deletion without Wiki Due Process</span></h2>
<p>Can anyone delete another contributions without going through the processes set by Wikipedia? Recently I wrote a short addition for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas</a> an article that covers the theories of how indigenous people came to America. The information I added was on subject and written from a neutral point of view. I was surprised to see it was totally removed within hours of its placement. I shortened my comments considerably and re-edited the page. Again, it was quickly and totally removed. That action smacks of censorship. Is censorship not against Wiki-policy? Would an administrator please look into the matter? The copy removed was titled “House of Israel Theory.” The copy removed represented a theory that is over one hundred fifty years old, is upheld by scholarly research and is also supported by millions of people worldwide. To verify the theory is as I say you may want to contact J. Michael Hunter at Brigham Young University. Thank you for helping Wikipedia remain a neutral, reliable online encylopedia as opposed to a forum for particular points of view.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problems</span></h2>
<p>I have concerns with the institution of admins. There is an unstated equivalency made by admins between the real world and cyberspace. We elect our leaders in the real world, so it is just as legitimate to elect them in cyberspace. We resolve differences in arbitration in the real world, so it is just as legitimate to do so in cyberspace. This is a terribly wrong equivalency, for a few reasons:</p>
<p>1. There is no real way of communicating efficiently in cyberspace.</p>
<p>If I have a misunderstanding with another user, we actually have to delete each other's work, talk on the talk page, etc., to resolve differences. If I have a misunderstanding with an admin, he will usually block me straight away without much fuss. Communication across cyberspace is exteremely inefficient compared with the discussions which take place in the real world and which are the basis of our institutions in the real world. Communication with admins is nearly impossible, especially considering the speedy blocks which are given.</p>
<p>The way Jimbo suggests to overcome this is the email list WIKI-En or whatever. The email list is much more efficient; however, there are just so many emails sent over that list that the efficacy of the list is almost nil. Arbitration falls victim to all the same problem of inefficient communication.</p>
<p>2. Anonymity is essential.</p>
<p>I was advised at some point to get a username. Usernames are absolute mistakes, and admins should straightaway stop advising people to get usernames. Every false charge against the username, every smear, sticks, because this is cyberspace. This is because edit wars are almost inevitable if you want to do anything more than minor editing. And it sticks especially because nothing can be deleted. If I tried to deleted some false charge about my username, some admin would ensure that this was reverted and that the charges remained for all to see. Once a charge is made, however false it may be, it invariably sticks. Anonymity aids immensely, especially if your only goal is to edit, because your username page invariably becomes a recepticle for the criticism and anger of others.</p>
<p>3. Admins are insensitive.</p>
<p>They can't be sensitive because you can't communicate with them effectively. You can't take them aside and explain something to them. They will always act insensitively and arbitrarily because they have to; they are working with very limited information.</p>
<p>This is why I believe the adminship system is serially flawed, and the admins should stop being so self-righteous and pretending they are doing a good job. They are doing their best, perhaps, but they are not doing a good job, they are upsetting numerous people more than they'll ever know.</p>

<dd>Strongly concur with that "absolutely not". Look, people sometimes wander off for a while because they need a break, or because of stress in their lives, or whatever. And it can be a long break, too - I was gone for the best part of a year. People were made admins (which is supposed to be "no big deal" anyway, right?) because they <i>demonstrated judgement</i>, and they aren't going to lose that just because they are gone for a while. From personal experience, yes, you have to be careful when re-appearing, because things will have changed subtly in the interim. If there is a security issue with inactive accounts, by all means lets find some way to deal with it. However, if it involves turning off the admin bit on the account, there ought to be some simple way (e.g. contacting a bureacrat and asking) to get it turned back on. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 18:31, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I propose that the term "sysop" be removed from the Wikipedia lexicon. We already have administrator (short admin), and it is kind of confusing to have both.

<dd>Another related peeve is how we have "Talk" pages, yet the link to this is called "Discuss this page." When I give instructions to newbies to "Use the talk page!" I get dozens of emails asking how to get there.

<dd>I agree.

<dd>It's probably a very important point I was trying to make, I just haven't figured out what that point is, yet. I thought sysop meant the person, while admin was the state/setting/whatever. I think sysop sounds a bit better than admin, since admin is too common and ordinary-sounding. I think sysop might be slightly easier to pronounce than admin, too. So if it wasn't possible to add new sections, I would probably have voted for "sysop", "don't care" or both. <a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECyp_f138.html" title="User:Cyp">Κσυπ <i>Cyp</i></a> <a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECyp_Will_this_eventually_appear_on_Special%7EWantedpages__9d0a.html" title="User:Cyp/Will this eventually appear on Special:Wantedpages?"></a> <a href="../../../c/y/p/User_talk%7ECyp_8e83.html" title="User talk:Cyp"> </a> 22:58, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as one of the 107 who have not blocked anyone this year, let me say that I didn't ask to be an admin on Wikipedia to block anyone. I found I had the time to help with the maintenance, &amp; so with these "kewl powerz" I occasionally delete some vandalism, once in a while protect a page, but basically find in the few hours I devote to Wikipedia that there's nothing worthy happening to justify pulling the admin rights out of their bag &amp; using them. And besides, I'd rather work on the content -- which is probably the attitude of most admins. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 01:06, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why the concern over the distribution? Different people are into different things. As long as people are doing <i>something</i> useful in the maintaintence line, and all bases are covered, is it a problem that A specializes in doing X, and B in Y? Not only that, people develop different knowledge-bases as a result - I spend a lot of time on <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERfD_9250.html" title="WP:RfD">WP:RfD</a>, and so know all the rules, precedents, techniques, etc well.

<dd>Even though I make it a policy not to feed the trolls, in this case, I'll make an exception.

Any person can vote there, although sock puppets votes (accounts with only a handful of edits) tend to be ignored. As far as checks and balances - admins do not think in lockstep. We disagree a fair amount of the time, and we talk it out. If you don't like it, tough. As far as not being accountable - that's what we have the abuse of sysop powers page for.

OH gee, 'convention'. we all know how reliable that is. nobody would ever abuse their power because they should be afraid of 'convention'!!! yes, that is a brilliant check and balance. im sure lots of governments use the terrible terrifying power of 'convention' to keep leaders in line. I think thats what kept nixon from assassinating john dean. 'convention'. yeah. good idea guys.</p>
<p>also i am very heartened to learn that administrators can crticizie each other. because we all know that as a group, only admins should be able to criticize each other, after all, they have been the most hard working and care more about wiki than the lowly slimeball users. furthermore, there will obviously be no danger of 'groupthink', because admins are geniuses in the first place, because look how hard they work and how much they care. third off, admins will never ever have their own interests, as a group. nope. there will never be a decision where admins have to decide on something that is between their own interests and the interests of the users. in fact, the interests of the admins are the same as the interests of the users, sort of like Maos argument against democracy in china: the people's interests are represented by the party, therefore the people dont need to have any say over the party.</p>
<p>"If you don't like it, tough. . . . . troll" -- Yes this demonstrates the true democratic spirit of the admins. Obviously someone who thinks like this is very worried about users' interests, and will be protective against the abuse of power as witnessed on just about every other 'community' website on the entire internet, like slashdot, kuro5hin, freerepublic, etc. You sir are truly 'serving the people' and guaranteeting access for all. Nope, no cabalist tendencies here, not at all no siree bob.</p>
<p>Hell, there is nothing to worry about. Why am I even concerned? Yes, the system is perfectly adequate, and nobody will ever be driven off by a bunch of admins deciding their article has no merit or that their opinions are stupid. Or if they did surely they would be able to find the 'admin discussion' where there is guaranteed to be another admin who will take their side against the deleting admin. I dont see why these whiny users want a say in anything, the admins can take care of it all, and if the user cant be bothered to observe this process, too bad for them!</p>
<p>In fact, the discussion pages for administrative decisions are so easy to find, so well thought out, and work so well, that you should be commended for improving on meatspace democracy. Nobody ever goes to the 'deletion list' page and says 'what is this mess'. There are also never any edit conflicts on that page, because it is so short, and there are so few people trying to access it simultaneously. Obviously this whole process of oversight of administrators has been so well thought out and all the issues about overreach of power have been resolved, and nothing really important is going on here.</p>
<p>Nope. System is fine. Full steam ahead. Silence the trolls, for they know nothing of the burden of responsibility!</p>
<hr />
<p>how come when someone edits a page an admin doesnt like, its called 'vandalism'. but when an admin deletes or edits a page, and writes 'this is nonsense', its called 'administration'?</p>

<dl>
<dd>OK, the first time, I gave you the benefit of the doubt, but after that little diatribe, I'm tempted to move a little further towards Raul654's attitude. However, just to put some more basic facts at your disposal in the hope that you will actually find out something about the system you are criticising:</dd>
<dd>The concept of a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a> is largely based around the idea of what I referred to above as "convention", also known as <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SoftSecurity" class="extiw" title="meatball:SoftSecurity">"Soft Security"</a> and <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CommunitySolution" class="extiw" title="meatball:CommunitySolution">"Community Solutions"</a>. The idea is that everyone is accountable to everyone else, and in an ideal world every user would have equal access to the project. Hoever, in a project the size of this one, it could potentially cause a major nuisance if a random user (who need supply no personal details to have the same access rights as a normal logged in user like me) could do things like page deletion at will - let alone the ability to block other users, which is nonetheless sadly necessary on occasion. So a <i>very limited</i> set of abilities is only granted to a subset of the users. But the <i>decisions</i> are not made by these users, only the <i>actions</i>.</dd>
<dd>In fact, this whole conversation rather makes me favour the suggestion that we change the terminology to something more akin to "housekeeper". There is no such thing as "the group of administrators", nor are there pages where things are discussed specifically between administrators; and any user is quite free to call any other user's edits "vandalism" or "nonsense", with the knowledge that any other user can come along and disagree with them. In fact, ways of working out such disagreements fairly are always being suggested and tried, as a more thorough look into onsite politics would reveal.</dd>
<dd>In short, your comments are interesting, but mostly fail to take into account the basic workings of this community. - <a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EIMSoP_6779.html" title="User:IMSoP">IMSoP</a> 17:25, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>look, man, i dont care about how it works, i care about how its going to work. every single last web board on the internet has had instances where the people in power abused it to delete things simply because they didnt like it. power corrupts.</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I can do the condescending thing too: "look, matey boy, if you don't care how it works, shut up and leave us alone"</dd>
</dl>
<p>if there are administrators, and there are more than one, there damn well is a group of administrators. they discuss things on the 'deletion' page, by posting their comments under the suggestions for deletion, suggestions made only by other administrators. if you cant figure out how admins might have a group interest that is different from the users, i feel sorry for you.</p>
<dl>
<dd>the above is factually incorrect. both suggestions and responses on <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">"the deletion page"</a> can be made by any user - yes, that includes you. The only thing the admins/sysops do is implement the final decision. And as for admins/sysops having some kind of "group interest" or "shared opinion", would that arguments were as simple as that around here! At least that way we'd reach some kind of decision sometimes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>the most obvious example would be pages like this. since wiki is itself made by discussions and articles on wiki, and administrators position, abilities, and so forth are come about to by discussions within the wiki system, it kind of stands to reason that eventually some day there will be some fight, wherein the administrators will use their power to further their interests at the expense of the users, on one of these such discussions. any page with discussions about the place of administrators, about admins overstepping, about the way adminning works, etc etc etc, could be a starting point for the armageddon of wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>so, what are you trying to say exactly? admins will use their power of being able to edit a page, just like we're both doing now (just to stress this, I'm not a sysop/admin any more than you are) to... um... discuss things?</dd>
</dl>
<p>if you dont guard against the corruption of power, it will take over. 'new things' will quit being tried out, because those in power will not want to lose their power. why? because its been institutionalized. the rules are in place. the code is like concrete, it is slowly setting in, without any safeguards in place. By the time you need them, it will be too late.</p>
<dl>
<dd>thanks for the warning. we have plenty of safeguards, and are always open to suggestions for new ones. and it's worth mentioning that users become (and, indeed, cease to be) sysops/admins by the agreement of <i>users</i>, not that of existing sysops/admins, so there is no obvious way of anyone "taking over"</dd>
</dl>
<p>really i dont care though. someone will just fork wiki, since it is all copyleft someone will just take all the content over along with them. sometimes we have to learn things the hard way.</p>

<dd>Administrators should not do anything that's not supported by policy. Everyone can participate in creating policy and reprimanding or de-admining. There is a way to undo every admin action, so everything is reversable. Additionally, normal users far outnumber admins, so they could elect better admins and remove bad ones. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/r/User_talk%7EDori_37a5.html" title="User talk:Dori">Talk</a> 00:11, Mar 24, 2004 (UTC) <i>[drafted simultaneously]</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, Dori, maybe this should be explained somewhere. Like in a wikipedia constitution or something. I have read the admin page and other 'meta' pages and none of it mentions 'voting' for administrators. There is no mention of checks and balances. Pretend if you will that an article was written about the US president that somehow failed to mention voting, congress, and the supreme court. That is the situation we have on wikipedia. Furthermore, if the policy is hidden/hard to find/not written, then it is not much different than if users had no voice at all. In fact my problem is not so much the process, it is the geek 'benevolent dictatorship' attitude that goes unchecked in all of cyberspace. This fellow says there are plenty of safeguards but does not mention a single one. You say 'admins shouldnt disregard policy' but how exactly is this enforced?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for genius saying admins have no group interest, i would simply ask him to study basic political science or history. That is like congress or the politburo saying they never agree on anything. To them, they never do. But they sure agree on their pay raises, on pork barrel projects, on stopping campaign finance reform, rejecting anti-lobbying laws, discouraging third parties through ballot access laws and debates, and on a lot of other things that they, as a class, have a common interest in. The very idea that someone could say that people with power have no 'common interest' is like someone decrying evolution as a crackpot theory. Actually it is a basic scientific fact of human organizational behavior. As for 'condescension', i am just so sorry that I fight fire with fire and am not a submissive little coward like the rest of the users who either give up and leave or dont say anything.</dd>

<dd>I guess the key point about admins/sysops having "no group interest" is that you seem to be over-estimating the amount of power they have, and the extent to which they form a coherent group. The famous assertion that "power tends to corrupt; absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely" immediately suggests (to me, anyway) that a small amount of power will only create a small amount of corruption, and if you look at the actual powers granted, they are about as far from absolute as you can get. And since there is (to my knowledge) no part of the site, and no decision-making process, that involves sysops/admins exclusively (unlike, say, the US Congress), they rarely exhibit <i>any</i> characteristics of a "class" - although there may arguably be psychological effects. Essentially, though, I personally think we are a long way from having anything resembling a "sysop/admin agenda", or the ability to realise such an agenda. - <a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EIMSoP_6779.html" title="User:IMSoP">IMSoP</a> 17:13, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Admin powers abuse by Adam Bishop</span></h2>
<p>I am afraid I have to complain about Adam Bishop's unfair behaviour and, what I feel, an extreme abuse of his administrator powers.</p>
<p>On 20 Mar 2004, 22:34 he has blocked my account and unfairly reverted my edits in <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cottbus.html" title="Cottbus">Cottbus</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dresden.html" title="Dresden">Dresden</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leipzig.html" title="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_City_of_Gdansk_e795.html" title="Free City of Gdansk">Free City of Gdansk</a> regarding the usage of alternative language names of various cities.</p>
<p>Despite the Wikipedia rule diplayed on this page <i>Sysops can block and unblock IP addresses. This is meant to be used solely to deal with persistent vandalism. IP banning is not meant to be used against unpopular opinions, non-persistent vandalism, etc.</i> Adam Bishop used this ban againts me to push his presonal POV, and to block me from editing and discussing the issue. His action was done without any discussion or warning.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the alternative language placenames should be allowed on condition that this is aplied equally to all languages. For example if we allow German names for Polish cities, we should also allow Polish names for the German cities.</p>
<p>Adam's opinion seems to be that German names for Polish cities should be allowed and maybe enforces, and at the same time Polish names for German cities should be forbidden.</p>
<p>This subject is already discusssed (and was discussed in time of Adams' actions) in the Wikipedia mediation started at my request:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Adam's action blocked me from participating in these discussions and in the mediation process. Adam should have consulted these pages before makin his action.</p>
<p><b>In these circumstances I demmand:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>a formal apologies from Adam Bishop</li>
<li>some sort of penalty for his unfair and biased behavour</li>
<li>revoking of his administrator rights, as he clearly has broked the basic rules</li>

<p><a name="Kinds_of_users" id="Kinds_of_users"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kinds of users</span></h2>
<p>Wikipedia has different kinds of users, with different kinds of powers.</p>
<ul>
<li>anonymous users</li>
<li>registered users, also called volunteers. Can upload images and rename pages.</li>
<li>sysops/admins, can revert changes, deleted pages &amp; images, and block users.</li>
<li>bureaucrats, stewards : can appoint admins on one or all wikis</li>
<li>developers: have sql access to all dbs, can change sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Admins have extra powers, and thus extra responsibility, but no extra authority. Admins have an 'example function' towards other volunteers. That is: if you are an admin, try to be always polite, friendly, kind, stay out of quarrels, etc.</p>
<p>A admin is not 'more' than other volunteers, but he can do more. All authority rests with the wikipedia community. You can not set the direction of a wiki, act on your own authority, or whatever. This applies even if a community is very small, even new volunteers should have a chance to have their say.</p>
<p>Try to follow procedures strictly - if you as a admin dont do it, dont expect that others will do it. Dont quarrel, and certainly not publicly with other admins. Of course you can have differences of opinion, but keep things civilised.</p>
<p>Dont advertise your being admin. Authority does not derive from this, but is carried by your arguments and deeds.</p>
<p>Listing your real name and email address is not obligatory, but it works easier if other admins know these.</p>
<p><a name="Confidential" id="Confidential"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Confidential</span></h2>
<p>If confidential information comes your way, handle it with care.</p>
<p>Protect wikipedia by being carefull with your password. Dont choose an easy-to-guess password such as your name, yopur userid, or words like 'secret'.</p>
<p>Dont forget to logout when using wiki from a public compueter susch as a university</p>
<p><a name="Using_your_power" id="Using_your_power"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Using your power</span></h2>
<p>You <i>can</i></p>
<ul>
<li>block an IP-address: do this only if the user keeps vandalizing pages after having been warned, and for a limited time.</li>
<li>block a user: do this only after conscent (sic) from other users.</li>
<li>protect a page: this is antii-wiki. Avoid it when possible. If you do it, state why.</li>
<li>remove a page or image: do this only after having listed the page for two weeks. If the page contains just obscenities, you can delete it immediatly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always use you common sense, and act in the interest of wikipedia.</p>

<dd>The difference is that some admins use it in revert wars over matters of opinion. Sad, but true.

<dd>I don't have any problem with the proposed revision, and would cheerfully follow it if it were adopted by <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rough_consensus.html" title="Rough consensus">rough consensus</a>. However, I personally would rather not do it, and here's why. Many (most?) admins are also <i>principally</i> article editors, and frankly, the article editing is a lot more interesting. I do a certain amount of janitor work, as my contribution to keeping the hallways clean (I try and take care of <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERfD_9250.html" title="WP:RfD">WP:RfD</a>), but really I'd rather spend my time editing. Time spent doing maintainence is time not spent editing, so I try and save time where I can, and using the revert button in an edit war with a problematic user (i.e. the ones who say "my way, or no way"), as others have pointed out, is to produce a <i>result</i> which is nothing we couldn't do as ordinary users, just done a little more expeditiously. Yes, the message is uninformative (alas), and that is a problem, but judgement can come into play - if it's not obvious what the issue is, a message <b>should</b> be left on the talk page. After all, a normal user is under no obligation to do a good job filling in the edit summary - and as we all know, there are plenty who <i>don't</i>. So again, the info-less revert message is nothing that an ordinary user can't <i>also</i> do. The <i>only</i> difference is time, and frankly I think that's a fair trade for the janitor work that many admins spend a lot of their time on. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:55, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Now that I've thought about it some more, I'm going to reverse course, and agree we should formally make it only for vandalism. My reasoning is that I think it's worth the minor extra work (click on History, click on the rev you want, click Edit, click Save - 4 clicks instead of 1) to prevent <b>any</b> appearance that admins are using their power to 'win' disputes. If we aren't doing <b>anything</b> a normal user can't do, there can be no possible substance to such a charge. I don't mind a couple of extra key-clicks to make it completely obvious that admins are normal users when it comes to disputes over content. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 01:19, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As stated, the revert button does not give admins greater editorial powers, and even though they don't have a revert button, anyone can (and many often do) revert without much difficulty at all; non-admin trolls, vandals, and POV-pushers do this all the time. And admins are typically experienced enough to be able to tell when users are not making edits of substance but are merely trolling or editing/reverting for personal reasons or POV reasons. Of course, the trolls/POV pushers/vandals in question often (and quite unsurprisingly) vehemently deny this. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 22:42, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have gone ahead and edited the page to state that one-click revert should not be used on edits other than vandalism; there seems to be widespread support for it otherwise. (<a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Wikipedia:Revert</a> already contained some language from brion advising not to use it in editing disputes, which I explained further.) It seems that this is an unwritten rule if not stronger, and it's probably best to treat exceptions as exceptions rather than accepted practice. One-click revert is something of a slap in the face to a good-faith editor; you should be very sure that's not what you're dealing with before you use it. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 16:57, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added it, not Andrevan. I have been editing since before there were admins on Wikipedia. At that time all users were expected to act as if they were admins. Those who "act as if they are an administrator" can be recognised by their willingness to revert vandalism, to uphold the NPOV, to tidy up articles, to work with other editors and otherwise to behave responsibly whether or not they have the admin-privs. This is rather different from "impersonating an administrator" which implies that you are lying to other editors. If "the only differences in my actions since becoming an admin have been the use of admin-privs" then you have been acting as if you were an administrator all along. If you hadn't, you wouldn't have been made an administrator. The point that I was trying to make is that there is no difference between the behaviour of a good editor and that of an admin -- a point which you evidently agree with. The mark of a good admin candidate is a support vote which says "I thought that he already was one". -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 05:03, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Current text on this page says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Revert pages quickly. Any user (logged-in or not) can revert a page to an earlier version. Administrators have a faster, automated reversion tool to help them revert vandalism by anonymous editors. When looking at a user's contributions, a link that looks like: [rollback] – appears next to edits that are at the top of the edit history. Clicking on the link reverts to the last edit not authored by that user, with edit summary (Reverted edits by X to last version by Y) and marks it as a minor change. In a fairly recent change, admins can also rapidly revert changes when viewing a diff.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Every once in a while, I could swear that it works as described. However, more often than not, clicking Rollback simply reverts to the previous version, NO MATTER whether it was the same user and NO MATTER whether I was viewing a diff to an earlier, correct version (e.g., see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Old_English_Sheepdog&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Old_English_Sheepdog&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, where I was viewing a 2-back revision by Grutness and the latest version by an anon, and it simply rolled back to the previous edit by same anon--oops, I lied, I see that the IP is off by 1. But it did NOT roll back to grutness). What does rollback *really* do? What is it really *supposed* to do? I'd really like it to rollback to the previous version that I'm viewing on the comparison page.

<dd>It rolls back <i>all contiguous edits</i> by the <i>most recent</i> editor.

<p>Can I ask why Radical Bender removed an external link from the Manga page to a site I frequent called Manga Life? This site has been in existence since May and already has more manga reviews than any other site I can find on the net, it's kept up to date with new stuff at least every other day, and - frankly - has more detailed and informative reviews than a couple of the other sites already linked. So wikipedia really should be linking here, yet when I add the link this guy deleted it? Surely against the ethos of wikipedia?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Brief history of Cuban espionage and related extraterritorial activity</span></h2>
<p>Apparently a very young Administrator Splash I believe from Bath England feels it incumbent to block, a piece I have on the history of Cuban espionage. Not alter it, not challenge it but simply block it.</p>
<p>What he/she writes is:</p>
<p>“Please take the request to: Wikipedia:Deletion review. If you recreate the article again, anywhere, under any title without doing so, I will block you from editing Wikipedia. -Splashtalk 18:24, 23 October 2005 (UTC)”</p>
<p>While I don’t know Splash’s background nor her/his credentials to do this. Here are some of mine, my family is part Taíno (Siboney), and has been prominent, even famous, through out known Cuban history. I fought in Castro’s forces for almost a year in 1958; during that time I participate in a number of military actions, but never executed anybody. It was the executions that made me break with Castro, in 1961 I was later jailed by Castro and was released through diplomatic intervention. Then I was coerced to leave the country. Having remade my life as an academic, and I am now a full professor in the sciences looking towards retirement. In my field I have almost a hundred refereed scientific publications, and have published (hard copy) probably more than ten publications on Cuba history and associated topics.</p>
<p>I am using the pseudonym (El Jigüe) because of my academic position and because as compromise is reached in each section, I wish merely to contribute and not to be responsible for the final product.</p>
<p><br />
It is my opinion that “Splash” might well be reminded that rather than deleting an article, and insisting on blocking it (and anything else I submit), a far more productive attitude would be to challenge specific parts of the article and attempt a compromise.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Cuban espionage and related extraterritorial activity revised</span></h3>
<p>I have continuously added new material, new citations, etc etc., under the 1title of Cuban espionage and related extraterritorial activity revised. Yet I find this important material constantly deleted. When I address what ever complaints are presented and replace these deleted sections; then the authors of these deletions (critics) then level accusations of multiple postings. From the fervor of these critics and their comments one could readily infer that deletions may well carry an ideological bias. A second now more common procedure (when continual direct deletion fails) seems be to lodge a spurious and often mendacious complaint, which is accepted by a like thinking editor who removes the article soon as possible e.g. Talk:Cuban espionage and related extraterritorial activity revised. El Jigüe 1/27/2005</p>
<p><br />
It is now my contention, that the Wikipedia revision process has systematic errors that freely allow serious abuses of this nature; and that that these abuses become a form of ideological censorship. Furthermore I infer from these critics’ behaviors that such abuses have potential far wider use by totalitarian governments to censor criticism by this means. I do not expect any remedies, nor do I anticipate that this article to be restored. However, I do expect to prepare, present in scholarly forum, and then publish a paper on this matter sometime next year. El Jigüe 1/27/2005</p>

<p>This admin is deletion happy - he deleted my brand new Wikiracist article within 5 minutes of creation, violating several wikipedia policies in the process - "Don't bite the newbies", "Assume good faith" and in deleting it as 'utter crap' making a "Personal attack". He also failed to let the deletion process take it's course. If this is the sort of behaviour an admin thinks is appropropiate, why should I bother trying to contribute? 84.68.19.88 14:06, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The fact that you wrote an inflammatory article on a prima facie POV word applied only by Wikipedia trolls makes it hard for me to believe you're a newbie. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 16:10, 5 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're making an awful lot of assumptions there. And because you summarily deleted the article, now everyone else has to depend on your word that the article was "inflammatory prima facie POV flamebait". Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, but you're not even letting the community decide. If the article had been listed for deletion and the consensus was that it should be deleted, I would not have a problem. Oh and this quote from your profile "Proudly Playing With My Deletion Button Since July 1, 2005" makes me question your impartiality in dealing with deletion issues. If I understand Wikipedia correctly admins are supposed to be no more or less than any other user, just having extra tools to do certain admin tasks, rather than arbitarily using them to enforce their own personal agendas. And also, so much for the exhortation to "Be Bold!", when it gets you absolutely nowhere. 84.68.19.88 16:59, 5 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Assumptions? No. Google "Wikiracist." The only context it's ever used in is with regards to an admin, Fennec, who was apparently called it. Furthermore, the article itself was POV, implying that anyone who was ever called a "Wikiracist" was, in fact, racist. That's absurd. As for my "deletion button," it's obvious that your sense of humor is lacking. Yes, you were "bold" in creating that article. I was equally "bold" in speedily deleting it. "Be Bold!" works both ways. If you wish to recreate the article, be my guest - I will immediately put it through the AfD process. But that would be a waste of everyone's time, including yours. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 17:24, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't have any problem with the proposed revision, and would cheerfully follow it if it were adopted by <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rough_consensus.html" title="Rough consensus">rough consensus</a>. However, I personally would rather not do it, and here's why. Many (most?) admins are also <i>principally</i> article editors, and frankly, the article editing is a lot more interesting. I do a certain amount of janitor work, as my contribution to keeping the hallways clean (I try and take care of <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERfD_9250.html" title="WP:RfD">WP:RfD</a>), but really I'd rather spend my time editing. Time spent doing maintainence is time not spent editing, so I try and save time where I can, and using the revert button in an edit war with a problematic user (i.e. the ones who say "my way, or no way"), as others have pointed out, is to produce a <i>result</i> which is nothing we couldn't do as ordinary users, just done a little more expeditiously. Yes, the message is uninformative (alas), and that is a problem, but judgement can come into play - if it's not obvious what the issue is, a message <b>should</b> be left on the talk page. After all, a normal user is under no obligation to do a good job filling in the edit summary - and as we all know, there are plenty who <i>don't</i>. So again, the info-less revert message is nothing that an ordinary user can't <i>also</i> do. The <i>only</i> difference is time, and frankly I think that's a fair trade for the janitor work that many admins spend a lot of their time on. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:55, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Now that I've thought about it some more, I'm going to reverse course, and agree we should formally make it only for vandalism. My reasoning is that I think it's worth the minor extra work (click on History, click on the rev you want, click Edit, click Save - 4 clicks instead of 1) to prevent <b>any</b> appearance that admins are using their power to 'win' disputes. If we aren't doing <b>anything</b> a normal user can't do, there can be no possible substance to such a charge. I don't mind a couple of extra key-clicks to make it completely obvious that admins are normal users when it comes to disputes over content. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 01:19, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

And admins are typically experienced enough to be able to tell when users are not making edits of substance but are merely trolling or editing/reverting for personal reasons or POV reasons. Of course, the trolls/POV pushers/vandals in question often (and quite unsurprisingly) vehemently deny this. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 22:42, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

You are much more likely to revert things if it is easier to do. No, this feature should stay with the administrators.

<p>I have gone ahead and edited the page to state that one-click revert should not be used on edits other than vandalism; there seems to be widespread support for it otherwise. (<a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">Wikipedia:Revert</a> already contained some language from brion advising not to use it in editing disputes, which I explained further.) It seems that this is an unwritten rule if not stronger, and it's probably best to treat exceptions as exceptions rather than accepted practice. One-click revert is something of a slap in the face to a good-faith editor; you should be very sure that's not what you're dealing with before you use it. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 16:57, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added it, not Andrevan. I have been editing since before there were admins on Wikipedia. At that time all users were expected to act as if they were admins. Those who "act as if they are an administrator" can be recognised by their willingness to revert vandalism, to uphold the NPOV, to tidy up articles, to work with other editors and otherwise to behave responsibly whether or not they have the admin-privs. This is rather different from "impersonating an administrator" which implies that you are lying to other editors. If "the only differences in my actions since becoming an admin have been the use of admin-privs" then you have been acting as if you were an administrator all along. If you hadn't, you wouldn't have been made an administrator. The point that I was trying to make is that there is no difference between the behaviour of a good editor and that of an admin -- a point which you evidently agree with. The mark of a good admin candidate is a support vote which says "I thought that he already was one". -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 05:03, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reverts don't work?</span></h2>
<p>Current text on this page says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Revert pages quickly. Any user (logged-in or not) can revert a page to an earlier version. Administrators have a faster, automated reversion tool to help them revert vandalism by anonymous editors. When looking at a user's contributions, a link that looks like: [rollback] – appears next to edits that are at the top of the edit history. Clicking on the link reverts to the last edit not authored by that user, with edit summary (Reverted edits by X to last version by Y) and marks it as a minor change. In a fairly recent change, admins can also rapidly revert changes when viewing a diff.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Every once in a while, I could swear that it works as described. However, more often than not, clicking Rollback simply reverts to the previous version, NO MATTER whether it was the same user and NO MATTER whether I was viewing a diff to an earlier, correct version (e.g., see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Old_English_Sheepdog&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Old_English_Sheepdog&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, where I was viewing a 2-back revision by Grutness and the latest version by an anon, and it simply rolled back to the previous edit by same anon--oops, I lied, I see that the IP is off by 1. But it did NOT roll back to grutness). What does rollback *really* do? What is it really *supposed* to do? I'd really like it to rollback to the previous version that I'm viewing on the comparison page. I don't think that even half of the rollbacks that I need to do go back only one revision. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 22:34, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It rolls back <i>all contiguous edits</i> by the <i>most recent</i> editor. If the most recent editor made five edits in a row, and you only want to roll back the last one, you're out of luck, it rolls them all back.

<p>Can I ask why Radical Bender removed an external link from the Manga page to a site I frequent called Manga Life? This site has been in existence since May and already has more manga reviews than any other site I can find on the net, it's kept up to date with new stuff at least every other day, and - frankly - has more detailed and informative reviews than a couple of the other sites already linked.

<p>Forgive me if this has been rehashed over and over, but I'm curious whether there's been any discussion recently of means of expiring sysop privileges. What if, for example, appointments to sysop had a 6 or 12 month term, after which consensus would again determine whether the editor retained adminship? I found <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConfirmation_of_sysophood_9305.html" title="Wikipedia:Confirmation of sysophood">Wikipedia:Confirmation_of_sysophood</a> but this is from a while back, so I'm curious what current thoughts are on this. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 02:46, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I don’t know Splash’s background nor her/his credentials to do this. Here are some of mine, my family is part Taíno (Siboney), and has been prominent, even famous, through out known Cuban history. I fought in Castro’s forces for almost a year in 1958; during that time I participate in a number of military actions, but never executed anybody. It was the executions that made me break with Castro, in 1961 I was later jailed by Castro and was released through diplomatic intervention. Then I was coerced to leave the country. Having remade my life as an academic, and I am now a full professor in the sciences looking towards retirement. In my field I have almost a hundred refereed scientific publications, and have published (hard copy) probably more than ten publications on Cuba history and associated topics.</p>
<p>I am using the pseudonym (El Jigüe) because of my academic position and because as compromise is reached in each section, I wish merely to contribute and not to be responsible for the final product.</p>
<p><br />
It is my opinion that “Splash” might well be reminded that rather than deleting an article, and insisting on blocking it (and anything else I submit), a far more productive attitude would be to challenge specific parts of the article and attempt a compromise.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Cuban espionage and related extraterritorial activity revised</span></h3>
<p>I have continuously added new material, new citations, etc etc., under the 1title of Cuban espionage and related extraterritorial activity revised. Yet I find this important material constantly deleted. When I address what ever complaints are presented and replace these deleted sections; then the authors of these deletions (critics) then level accusations of multiple postings. From the fervor of these critics and their comments one could readily infer that deletions may well carry an ideological bias. A second now more common procedure (when continual direct deletion fails) seems be to lodge a spurious and often mendacious complaint, which is accepted by a like thinking editor who removes the article soon as possible e.g. Talk:Cuban espionage and related extraterritorial activity revised. El Jigüe 1/27/2005</p>
<p><br />
It is now my contention, that the Wikipedia revision process has systematic errors that freely allow serious abuses of this nature; and that that these abuses become a form of ideological censorship. Furthermore I infer from these critics’ behaviors that such abuses have potential far wider use by totalitarian governments to censor criticism by this means. I do not expect any remedies, nor do I anticipate that this article to be restored. However, I do expect to prepare, present in scholarly forum, and then publish a paper on this matter sometime next year. El Jigüe 1/27/2005</p>

<p>This admin is deletion happy - he deleted my brand new Wikiracist article within 5 minutes of creation, violating several wikipedia policies in the process - "Don't bite the newbies", "Assume good faith" and in deleting it as 'utter crap' making a "Personal attack". He also failed to let the deletion process take it's course.

<li>The fact that you wrote an inflammatory article on a prima facie POV word applied only by Wikipedia trolls makes it hard for me to believe you're a newbie. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 16:10, 5 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're making an awful lot of assumptions there. And because you summarily deleted the article, now everyone else has to depend on your word that the article was "inflammatory prima facie POV flamebait". Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, but you're not even letting the community decide. If the article had been listed for deletion and the consensus was that it should be deleted, I would not have a problem. Oh and this quote from your profile "Proudly Playing With My Deletion Button Since July 1, 2005" makes me question your impartiality in dealing with deletion issues. If I understand Wikipedia correctly admins are supposed to be no more or less than any other user, just having extra tools to do certain admin tasks, rather than arbitarily using them to enforce their own personal agendas. And also, so much for the exhortation to "Be Bold!", when it gets you absolutely nowhere. 84.68.19.88 16:59, 5 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Assumptions? No. Google "Wikiracist." The only context it's ever used in is with regards to an admin, Fennec, who was apparently called it. Furthermore, the article itself was POV, implying that anyone who was ever called a "Wikiracist" was, in fact, racist. That's absurd. As for my "deletion button," it's obvious that your sense of humor is lacking. Yes, you were "bold" in creating that article. I was equally "bold" in speedily deleting it. "Be Bold!" works both ways. If you wish to recreate the article, be my guest - I will immediately put it through the AfD process.
