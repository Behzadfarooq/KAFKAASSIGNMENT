<dd>On the contrary, there was no consensus to delete this article (which was speedy deleted outside the bounds of process).

<li>It isn't clear to me whether the complaint was genuine or not. I've shared my reservations about it since I acted upon it. I have asked the author of the complaint to substantiate their identity and they have not yet done so to my satisfaction. Whether or not the complaint is genuine, the fact remains that the content once again at Brian Peppers is an unlawful invasion of privacy even if factual. I have forwarded the original emails and a summary of the matter to the board for legal review, since a community consensus to delete appears elusive. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 02:56, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's an AfD. It didn't form a consensus to delete, so you guys acted unilaterally, "fucked process" and killed the article. You want the discussion in DRV so that you can ignore that you had no consensus to delete and can't get one, but when we discussed it in DRV, there was a fairly even split. The presumption is to keep, not delete articles. Well, I mean Wikipedia's presumption is. Clearly, YMMV. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:47, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is much that I agree with in both your opinions (ie. your's &amp; Travis'). The purpose of Deletion Review is to review decisions about the status of a page with an eye to ensuring that the preceding xFD discussion on that page arrived at a decision consistent with article policy. The threshold for re-examining an issue at the relevant xFD is deliberately set very low, so that any fair objection held by a reasonable number of people has an excellent chance of being acted on: even if just 50% of participants feel that the original decision was in some way inappropriate, the close is stayed and the page sent back to xFD for re-examination. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;oldid=39422366#Brian_Peppers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;oldid=39422366#Brian_Peppers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;oldid=39422366#Brian_Peppers</a> Brian Peppers review, 22 users asked for a relist; however, 27 didn't—hence Aaron's close. Nevertheless, I understand your view, and indeed agree with you that claiming a delete consensus in this case is certainly out of the question: it simply doesn't exist. The article ended up at the Review not because it had been been deleted following a consensus, but because someone disagreed with UC's speedy deletion of the page over legal concerns. I happen to share that legal concern, and I think the page should not stay on WP, but I would not say that there is a consensus for the article's deletion. The corollary of course is that I think legal questions should not be decided via xFD style discussions; the day that we send copyright infringements and other legal concerns to an xFD style discussion for a decision is the day WP will be in deep shit. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;cursor:crosshair;">ENCEPHALON</span></a> <i>04:30, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>It's interesting how "there's an AfD" is a great reason for keeping it, but that somehow wasn't a great reason for not having it the last four times it was deleted, so it kept getting re-created. Or is it only the re-creation of articles which can go against consensus? <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 14:08, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did not delete this out of process. The last existing consensus decision was to keep this article deleted. Despite the facts that this decision may have been wrong <i>and</i> I agreed with it, I would have acted in the same way had I felt the opposite. One person doesn't get to decide for everyone.<br />

<li>What process did you follow again? It seems like we're making up the rules as we go along here, can you please cite something so we can all be aware of what the new deletion policies are? From what I read, there was a near consensus to keep the article during the fifth AFD (with 2:1 in favor of keeping), it was deleted due to a hoax, then brought to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> where it was split down the middle with no consensus either way. IMHO, Hall Monitor did the right thing by reposting it to AFD in an attempt to establish a true consensus. Show me right now where "the last existing consensus decision was to keep this article deleted.", because I'm just not seeing it. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 06:27, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Any lawyer worth his/her J.D. would NEVER contact a random editor directly and demand that changes to be made to Wikipedia, they would contact Jimbo Wales or the board directly. Unless someone here is intimately familiar enough with the law to back up any claims of wrong-doing, and based on the lack of anyone citing exact statutes being broken I would say no one involved does; please don't play lawyer.

<dd>Attorney here, as requested. Although I am not licensed in Ohio where this gentleman is located, I can tell you that there is a better than fair chance that any suit would be brought in federal court under its diversity jurisdiction and this could be brought in any number of states. One person wrote in the last AfD that "No one is deriding him. They are simply having fun at his expense." I pointed out to the writer that "having fun at his expense" is typically rephrased in the legal community as "intentional infliction of emotional distress."</dd>
<dd>Let's look at what a sympathetic jury might think: Here's a guy convicted of a misdemeanor and sentenced to a brief jail term, with literally tens of thousands of others who have been convicted of worse. Unlike most of those tens of thousands of others, he has a Wikipedia article. Why? Because he looks like a freak. One exhibit I would be sure to enter would be the above-referenced AfD discussion where the real reason for why there is a Wikipedia article: "No one is deriding him. They are simply having fun at his expense."</dd>
<dd>This gentleman is famous because he's a freak. He looks bizarre, something over which he has absolutely no control. And he is on a sex offender registry which, as mentioned in the AfD, has disclaimers up the proverbiall wazoo about not using or trusting the information.</dd>
<dd>Let me be blunt: if someone burns this guy's house down, I would not hesitate to sue Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 19:46, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's an (apparently) common misconception that anyone thinks he should have a Wikipedia article based on his appearance. The only reason people believe he should have a Wikipedia article is because he is the subject of a notable internet meme. If it were a perfectly regular looking person as the subject of the meme, we would feel the same way. Also, for the record, he lives in a nursing home, not a house.&#160;;) <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 01:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I feel that everyone who has participated on both sides have acted in good faith, the issue boils down to the fact that the two sides on this issue have different ideas of what should be included in Wikipedia, as there is no policy on internet memes. I think we need a policy on this before the issue will be settled. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 07:52, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see good faith in this. I see a lot of rules-lawyering and weak excuses for deleting a disturbing, but factual article on a notable person. But I agree with you on the need for a policy on Internet memes. There are articles on Wikipedia about people of much less "fame" than Brian Peppers, and it's revolting how certain individuals <i>including</i> Jim Wales, have attempted to delete articles on the false premise that a subject is not notble when they are (as was the case in the Ashida Kim article AfD). That's explicit bad faith as far as I'm concerned. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhrost_6b8d.html" title="User:Phrost">Phrost</a> 13:50, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is it with this unhealthy obsession with deleting and undeleting sex offenders? As far as I can see, it was deleted for a bad reason, but <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">DRV</a> decided not to relist it anyway. Surely that's their call to make?

<dd>Um, the point is that there was clearly no consensus to keep <i>or</i> delete the article. In cases like this, the default is normally to keep the article (with a <i>no consensus</i> result on the AfD). I don't see why the unilateral actions of a single admin should, in this case, change the default <i>no consensus</i> result to "keep deleted". --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> 11:57, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because - and please correct me if I'm getting the chronology out of order here - the last forum to consider the case was <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, and there was sufficient consensus there to keep it deleted. Fine, so it shouldn't have been speedy deleted. But that's not what DRV considered; DRV considered whether it was worth recreating the article and sending it back to AfD. They decided not to, and that decision is of the sort they are there to make. Who do you want to overturn their decision? It certainly can't be sent back to AfD because DRV reviews decisions made by AfD (and others), not vice versa. And hopefully not an admin acting unilaterally. Only person I can think of who has the authority to overturn the DRV consensus is Jimbo, and I can't imagine he'd want to spend time on this. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a><small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 13:19, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Consider a hypothetical controversial article. 50 people want it deleted, and 40 people don't. The AfD would close with <i>no consensus (keep)</i> (yes, I know Wikipedia is not a democracy. Imagine that both the pro and con people had good arguments for keeping/deleting the article).</dd>
<dd>Now, let's say that there's an admin among the 50 people wanting it deleted, who feels frustrated by the <i>no consensus (keep)</i> result. So he deletes the article. It is subsequentlz listed on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. Predictably, 50 people that wanted it deleted in the first place want to keep it deleted, and the 40 people who wanted it to remain argue for undeleting it. The debate is closed with <i>endorse deletion</i>.</dd>
<dd>Do you not feel that this is a perversion of process? Despite the fact that <i>no one changed their minds</i>, the actions of one admin changed the entire fate of the article. I believe this is unacceptable, and I fail to see how anyone could feel that this is an equitable way of doing things. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> 15:44, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you'd researched the issue you would know that he was convicted of a technical offence following inappropriate contact with his nurse/carer. You would also know that the first four AfDs resulted in delete, so the insistence on process is a tad hollow, what with it having been re-created against consensus several times already. So we come back to the fundamental principle: do no harm. A disabled man living in a nursing home is not a public figure, poses little or no threat to the wider community and frankly we would not even be having this conversation if it wasn't for the fact that the poor bastard was born with a congenital deformity.

<dd>I agree this should never have been speedied... Speedy deletion for recreation is for identical "cut &amp; paste" restarts, not for rewrites or we'd have to speedy half the 'pedia. The article as deleted established notability and had references (which is more than I can say for 40% of the 'pedia). The fact that it was deleted under false pretenses means it should never have needed to go through DRV it should have simply been undeleted. DRV also came to the wrong conclusion since it TOO was hoaxed. There is no allen peppers, and as such Hall Monitor's actions were completely reasonable, Undelete it and re-afd it... Aaron should never have speedy closed the AFD. I say undelete it, re-afd (that would be #7 I think?) and let it run its due process. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 20:37, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Based on some new information, I am reasonably satisfied that the takedown request is genuine at this time.

<dd>They are saying that the article originally had a 67% keep on AfD, where the rules say keep if there is no consensus. Someone circumvented that process, forcing it to be brought to DRV, where you only need 51% to have a decision made, apparently. The article would still be on Wikipedia if it had gone through due process, as 51% delete isn't good enough to get an article deleted on AfD (the actual vote was 25-22-2 in DRV, a similar vote in AfD would have resulted in the article being kept via no consensus). <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 01:35, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What part of "Based on some new information, I am reasonably satisfied that the takedown request is genuine at this time" do you not understand? This is not subject to a "vote."

<dd>I think the main point was that people are still slinging words over this. Perhaps a better question would be, what's it going to take to get everyone to let it go? But then again, people still have concerns that likely need addressing. Perhaps another forum would be better for the continued discussion, which seems likely to continue in spite of any ruling/decision/vote. I don't really care, I'm just trying to help out, and will shut up if you guys think this isn't helpful. Such active discussion obviously says some unfinished business remains whether we like it or not, and if it was speedied into deletion in the face of such discussion, it should be reopened. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 22:32, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't see how the takedown request is at all relevant. Wikipedia contains <i>lots</i> of information that many people would want to censor.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive75_8b7a.html" title="Edit section: User:Leifern Thimerosal and MMR">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">User:Leifern</a> <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thimerosal.html" title="Thimerosal">Thimerosal</a> and <a href="../../../m/m/r/MMR_da27.html" title="MMR">MMR</a></span></h2>
<p>Leifern has declared a very personal interest in some aspects of this, and became extremely hangry when I made a (large) move of material from <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thimerosal.html" title="Thimerosal">Thimerosal</a> to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccinationist.html" title="Anti-vaccinationist">Anti-vaccinationist</a> whence it then moved to a new page at <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thimerosal_controversy.html" title="Thimerosal controversy">Thimerosal controversy</a> The two pages with Thimerosal in their names are quite good - the former was improved by my edit, and nothing more than quiet discussion was needed in order to start the latter.</p>
<p>Immediately after that Leifern called for deletion of the anti-vaccinationist page, asserting that a google search found no mention of anti-vaccinationist (another editor found several thousand hits). The result, after a vile argument was a strong keep. Leifern continues to be uncivil there - although that doesn't stand out, and he is by some distance not the rudest person to see in the talk page.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MMR_vaccine&amp;diff=39832388&amp;oldid=39820858" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MMR_vaccine&amp;diff=39832388&amp;oldid=39820858" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MMR_vaccine&amp;diff=39832388&amp;oldid=39820858</a> is a huge revert, with an untrue description. I'm not sure I analysed the log completely, but it looks as though other people's work has also been discarded. It looks impatient, poorly judged, and does not improve the page, although no doubt edits oculd be made that would have.</p>
<p>An example of an edit described as POV is replacing "people aged over 45" with "people born before" whoch looked to me like a WP policy - oterwhise it'd need editing each year. Still in that first paragraph, I noted that "...are assumed to have had Measles in the past" means the same as "...are assumed to have had Measles." and changed it. That isn't POV, and it is better English.</p>
<p>I would be grateful for other admins views on that edit and on whether Leifern is succesful in distinguishing his personal grief, rage and sense of injury about his child and the assumed cause, from edits toward improving pages around that group. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 14:03, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the record, <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> did not extend the courtesy of notifying me that he had lodged this complaint. Beyond that, it appears that he is simply upset that I disagree with him. Even though an admin brought the AFD on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccinationists.html" title="Anti-vaccinationists">Anti-vaccinationists</a> was prematurely and aborted, I have respected its outcome. Most recently, I made an effort at improving the article and pointing out assertions that need references <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=40053350&amp;oldid=40042182" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=40053350&amp;oldid=40042182" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-vaccinationists&amp;diff=40053350&amp;oldid=40042182</a>. As far as the MMR vaccine is concerned, I reverted a number of edits that I found were tendentious, and I still believe they were. Midgley and I have disagreements about the standards for objectivity and fairness in WP. I'd rather not get into characterizing him beyond that, but I find it reprehensible to say the least that he brings my son's sad situation into this discussion, especially since he bills himself as a medical doctor. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 20:30, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>I appreciate the "friendly advice."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>I did use the term "dipshit" out of frustration. I acknowledge, but I do not apologize. I believe that an article about someone who has a stated goal of propounding a certain political viewpoint (left or right) should have at least some small mention of her own political views. After an initial characterization of Janeane Garofalo's views as "socialist," some unnamed person helpfully removed that edit. Then, when I moderated my language in a subsequent edit, this, too, was removed.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>If Garofalo were just another ill-informed celebrity who gave the occasional rant regarding the state of American politics, e.g., Julia Roberts or George Clooney, I would not give a thought to some inclusion of her political beliefs; they would be irrelevant. But Garofalo is co-host of a national political talk show. As such, she possesses certain strongly held beliefs. The original article neglected to describe those beliefs. It only mentioned that she was using her status and her talk show to combat the "threat" of conservatism. While her intent may have been implied by the language used, I believed that her position on the political spectrum should have been more overtly stated.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Forgive my presumptuousness, but perhaps Wikipedia's users would be better served by administrators who actually investigate a situation before issuing editing blocks. After this experience, I am now under the impression that an administrator's primary task is to scan only the edit comments and then issue haughty admonitions from on high, without ever showing simple courtesy by, for example, requesting an explanation from the "heretic" user/editor. I had hoped that this was not the case, but, alas, events have proved otherwise.</i></dd>

This situation isn't at the phase where extreme action needs to be taken, but this editor appears to have all of the hallmarks of a profoundly disruptive personality.

<li>Um, not to be nitpicky, but the second one is not a diff--I take it the photo was deleted? Even so, an indefinite block is harsh.

<li>The first diff shows that Alex756 edited the picture to remove the Hitler stuff.

<p>This bot is currently going through every article replacing a star-rating image (almost universally used for the review section of album articles) with a text version. The justification for this rests wholly on a discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Albums_a2c7.html#Stars_to_text" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Albums">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Albums#Stars_to_text</a> — a discussion in which no attempt was made to ascertain consensus even among thos concerned, much less among editors more generally, and in which those editors who (most properly) suggested that at the very least the bot should give an explanatory edit summary, and that preferable wider consultation should be made, were simply ignored without comment.</p>
<p>I personally would oppose the changes, and I suspect that <i>many</i> other editors would too — but we weren't given the option. Is it acceptable to block the bot (which is chugging away at an alarming rate) until proper consensus has been reached, or would that be against either policy or accepted practice? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 13:58, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would be far easier, and less painful for all involved, to just put a message on the bot's talk page, which will stop the bot, and then discuss with Tawker, who is online (as the bot is running). Given that he's in IRC at the moment, I'll ask him to pause it and come here to discuss. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 14:03, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Notwithstanding the above, it is within policy to block unsanctioned bots, or indeed any bot that seems to be acting outside accepted practice.

<dd>3RR or not, I think his edits are clearly disruptive - they're preventing you from making an entirely legitimate edit, and they don't seem to be contributing anything in return. You've done the right thing in trying to talk to them first before coming here. If the editor continues I think a short (maybe 20 mins) block under the disruption clause is in order, which will hopefully either make them stop or make them enter into a discussion. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 15:47, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've removted it as uncited, but have a look on the talk page - someone left a note six months ago asking "Will someone include the part about Inman, SC where you can shoot someone and get elected mayor in the same year?". Nothing shows up on the web, other than anecdotes about the mayor evicting the Chamber of Commerce, but I wonder if there's an actual story involved.

<dd>The information that the anon is adding is actually true. According to four articles in the Spartanburg Herald Journal, the current mayor of Inman, Carl Shults, shot a 13 year old in the face in 2000. The teen was throwing rocks at Shults's house and the shooting happened at 3:00 AM. Shults was not charged with any wrongdoing. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 16:19, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>KDRGibby: can you please unprotect my user page. There is nothing present on the page that can be deleted that constitutes vandalism. For example, there are no warnings or no sockpuppet tags that can be deleted. Thank you.</p>
<p>Me: You seem to have been blocked for personal attacks. Your userpages have apparently been blocked for continuing with your attacks there.</p>
<p>If you disagree, you should take it up with Jpgordon and show some good faith, for example by offering to remove the "list of wiki bullies".</p>
<p>KDRGibby: No he blocked my user page because he considered the changing of the section title on the issue of personal attacks to "Generalized making fun of other peoples intelligence" which I felt was a more appropriate topic. My edit tagline merely stated that the editor I was in dispute with was either a jerk or an idiot for deleting cited material on the grounds that it was blog material...when in fact none of it was blog material but news sources, articles, columns, and research from a research institute,and historical material from hnn and florida international.</p>
<p>Please unblock my user page. There is no legal reason it should be blocked. I am not removing any warning, or sockpuppet tags, as there are no warnings or sockpuppet tags in place! I'm just asking that wiki rules be followed...actually followed by the admins, not applied when they want how they want.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Due to KDRGibby's arbcom decision (KDRGibby is now on probation and personal attack parole), JPGordon decided to give KDRGibby a "clean slate". JPGordon has already unblocked KDRGibby and unprotected his user talk page, so no further administrative action is required. I'm a party to his arbitration case, and I agree that he should be given another chance. However he should realize that continued personal attacks will result in a long-term ban from Wikipedia, so I urge him to exercise restraint in dealing with other users. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 21:15, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Way back in December, <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBob_cf29.html" title="User:DrBob">Bob Mellish</a> noticed a flood of material relating to the sf author Robert Stanek, and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive21_8ce7.html#Beware_the_Stanek" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive21">flagged it up here</a>.

So, some back-and-forth on page blanking, he started leaving comments but deleting screeds of text with it, claiming that everyone who'd reverted him was a sockpuppet... the usual stuff.

How... something. Would a Checkuser request be amiss here? It's nothing beyond a talk page spat as yet (god knows, I never touched it until this evening), but it does smell somewhat off.

<dd>Danny handles the incoming business to the Foundation; I have no clue about the reasons in this given instance, but generally when Danny does something like this, it is because there are very serious consquences (i.e., legal action) that will result if the action is not taken. I've seen him do enough of this to know that when he says "I can't talk about it" he is serious. In general, we like to have open and transparent discussions about these issues, but if there are serious legal issues involved (which would be my guess, probably libel), then open and transparent discussion may not be an option. I say we trust Jimbo and the Foundation (for whom Danny works) to know when Wikipedia needs to be protected, and to do it. If you're really, really concerned, contact Brad Patrick, the Foundation's attorney, and ask him; if there is legal trouble afoot, he'll know about it, and be able to say "We aren't able to comment at this time." <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 07:10, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This censor who would like to squelch the disputes on the Talk Page of that article, is trying to hold me responsible for the complaints of others. It is plainly clear that he wants to use strong-arm tactics, when all I did was give a disputed tag so others would see the talk page and hopefully resolve it amongst themselves.

<dd>Oh, let's cool it down a bit everyone, mmkay? It's OK to add a "totally disputed" tag when you see other editors questioning an article's merit on its talk page, even if you are not personally involved.

<p>As many editors have mentioned on Talk:Criticisms of sexual behavior, the article <i>is</i> largely crap. I completely understand the anon's insistence on adding {{<a href="../../../t/o/t/Template%7ETotallydisputed_3989.html" title="Template:Totallydisputed">totallydisputed</a>}}. The opinions expressed on the talk page seem to support its use. However, rather than revert-warring over a silly tag, those involved should instead look for ways to <i>improve</i> the article. Finding references and removing POV language would be a good start. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 00:37, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that the article is total crap. This request wasn't about an edit war over a tag or the quality of the article, but about 68.110.9.62's total unwillingess to help get it changed for the better (have a look at our talk pages to see how that attempt went). Instead, s/he just added the tag again and again and refused to give any reason why (if you look on Talk:Criticisms of sexual behavior, there isn't much in the way of current discussion, and the complaints sort of run across the board). If <i>you</i> have comments on how to improve the article, by all means leave them on the page's talk! -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 00:45, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, all the Scottish county articles used the anglified names until Mais oui! decided to unilaterally move Morayshire with no discussion and then edit the redirect page so that it couldn't easily be moved back! Surely the policy on the English-language wikipedia is to use "anglified" names for articles? I have no problem with the other name, but the redirect should be the other way around with Morayshire being the real article name. <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/w/a/User_talk%7EOwain_57ea.html" title="User talk:Owain">talk</a>)</small> 17:47, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What templates were they? I looked at some of the templates that are on DRV, and I could see why they got speedied. IMHO, if we cannot keep templates that say I support/dislike GWB, then similar templates refering to a different leader, like Blair, Chavez, Putin, etc, should also not be kept in order to be fair and to be consistant. Though, the wording of T1 of the CSD sounds pretty odd. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a> <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">Fair use policy</a></sup></small> 03:08, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At the moment we have a serious problem with T1. It is being used as a battering ram by those who dislike userboxes with a passion to speedy delete too many things. The problem with T1 is not particularly the concept it represents. There are userboxes that are divisive and need to go. However T1 is written in such a way that it is broad in extent, vague in application and open to many different interpretations. Until those are fixed I don't believe that it should be a valid speedy deletion criterion. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 01:06, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There were several people who spent a great deal of time and effort working through the hundreds of emails sent to the Help Desk mailing list every day, solely because of our interest in helping Wikipedia. Then out of the blue, without a SINGLE warning, it was decided by someone who was NOT involved in the mailing list, that the list would be discontinued. Thanks for the slap in the face to those of us who were regular participants. And then we're told, "If you're interested in working on the other list" whatever other list that is, "please contact sannse or Mindspillage by email". So I did both, and got not a single response until I posted on their Talk pages, at which point I am told, "no thanks, we don't want you."

<p>Can I set the record absolutely clear on this? For one thing, the failure of helpdesk-l to meet its intended goals has been discussed on wikipedia-l and foundation-l several times. I sent one notice to helpdesk-l roughly a week before it was scheduled to close, and got no complaints, and one more a day before, to which Zoe responded and someone else answered. No, I hadn't participated in the helpdesk-l list; I did, however, subscribe to it as did several people who were discussing it. Where I do participate (and where I have answered well over 2000 messages) is on OTRS, which was intended to be the venue for confidential and delicate requests.</p>
<p>We took several people from the old helpdesk-l who had been actively giving helpful answers and then decided not to accept any further requests. Yes, it is limited access, because this is mail coming from an official @wikimedia.org address and handling things poorly would be detrimental. The two of us decided it would be best to take only a few new people at a time (yes, some were from helpdesk-l) so that we could keep watch over things, and expand only as needed. The mail desk is not the wiki. It's the official address for private complaints and requests that people cannot ask on the wiki (though a <i>lot</i> of misdirected requests do end up there); people send sensitive and confidential information, including notices of potential legal action, and I'd rather be too cautious than too hasty. Yes, any further requests now will be hung on to until we decide if anyone else is needed, but people do burn out, so we do draw from that list.</p>
<p>It's not a slap in the face: we simply cannot take everyone who asks, and I'm sorry if anyone feels insulted by it. It's in no way intended to slight the work that people did do (and thanks to everyone for that), simply a recognition that that way it was done wasn't working. (Why it wasn't working is another post, a long one, and not really a topic for AN:I; I'll dig up the links to the mailing list posts about it if it's wanted, though.) If you'd like to help others still, there are plenty of places on the wiki where that's wanted and needed. Zoe, my response to you was intended to be courteous, and I'm sorry that I didn't get to it immediately; my statement that I have been somewhat backlogged is a truthful one, and I'm sorry if you took that as a slight. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 05:09, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't subscribe to foundation-l, and I avoid wikipedia-l as a cesspool. A discussion, a very BRIEF discussion even, on helpdesk-l would have been the appropriate place. One <i>fait accompli</i> announcement that helpdesk-l was being dropped without input from those participating, and then rejection to those who were doing the work there because we're not good enough to sully your little fiefdom is definitely a slap in the face. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:29, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It has almost always come from some person who had their own personal axe to grind. They leave threats that if I don't stop criticising them that I will be blocked. Those threats have been deleted as quickly as I have been able to, because I don't need to listen to whining, and I definitely don't stand for being threatened or bullied for simply having an opinion.</dd>

<dd>Now that that's aside, hutch, why don't you explain why you're really here - which is apparently payback for my participation in the RFC on your buddy Mark Sweep? --<a href="../../../d/t/a/User%7EDtasripin_8a3e.html" title="User:Dtasripin">Daniel</a> 20:39, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>i don't have any problem with you other than you repeatedly calling me and other admins "honcho". I asked you nicely several times not to do that, and then you went and did it again. I am not trying to get revenge on you, I'm not trying to silence you. I welcome you voicing your opinion. I think that it's important that you voice your opinion in a way that is not rude or incivil. I stood up for MarkSweep because I felt that he was being unnecessarily and wrongly accused, and I would do it again. If you were being wrongly accused of something, I would stand up for you too. The present matter has nothing to do with that. I am not holding a grudge against you. I am simply asking you to try not to be rude to other users, including calling people "honcho".

<p>THe only edit from the above which is out of line is the last (re: Kelly Martin). And even that pales in comparison to some of the attacks that have come from other users. This is not blockable.

<dd>I'm not advocating a block, either, I just want him to understand that requests for him to be more civil and assume good faith aren't merely coming from those who disagree with him in a specific debate in which he appears to have a lot invested.

This IP address is shared by about 50 schools in London, Ontario. One user has requested unblocking citing the inability of teachers to make good edits. What should be done? A look at the talk page shows what a problem it has been in terms of persistent vandalism. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 15:50, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would appear from the history there that the teachers need to supervise what their students are doing - that is part of their job. As there is obviously a lack of supervision, leave it blocked. I speak as a teacher who has dealt with minor vandalism from my school IP. If the teachers want to contribute then they must control their students, it's quite as simple as that. <a href="../../../v/s/m/User%7EVsmith_d492.html" title="User:Vsmith">Vsmith</a> 16:08, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How do you propose a teacher supervise the children in the other 49 schools that share their IP?
<dl>
<dd>The students at all the affected schools should be supervised well enough that vandalism is nearly nonexistant. Yes, I realize that's a very naive position to take, but if students and teachers want unfettered access to Wikipedia editing, they need better controls in place, which should probably include a more sensible network proxy scheme, but I digress. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 22:18, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

At least that should help in making all the teachers they claim are editing aware of the problem. Though, if the blocking admin starts geting mails from good users now being blocked I would reconsider and unblock, and put a note about it on the talk page. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 16:16, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yea, I don't see a need for people to edit during school time. If kids need to research, they can research.

<p>Every school will have unruly students. Every ISP that uses proxies will have some vandal users.

<p>I tried contacting <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeruvianllama_baf8.html" title="User:Peruvianllama">Peruvianllama</a> about this matter a little while earlier since he had dealt with this user in the past, and his contributions show him as not being around here recently. A little background info:</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/y/t/User%7EPyterTaravitch_a076.html" title="User:PyterTaravitch">User:PyterTaravitch</a> was a troll account created by an unknown user. Evidence I cited in this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=38007416&amp;oldid=38006461" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=38007416&amp;oldid=38006461" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=38007416&amp;oldid=38006461</a> showed why I believed that the account was a sockpuppet of Chadbryant.

Peruvianllama then came along and posted a compromised version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=39070886&amp;oldid=39004825" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=39070886&amp;oldid=39004825" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=39070886&amp;oldid=39004825</a> which stayed in place for a whole 9 days before Chadbryant deleted the part that was against him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=40347848&amp;oldid=39070886" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=40347848&amp;oldid=39070886" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=40347848&amp;oldid=39070886</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than get into a whole new edit war with Chadbryant, on <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeruvianllama_bd23.html#Chadbryant.27s_return" title="User talk:Peruvianllama">User talk:Peruvianllama#Chadbryant's return</a> I tried to bring the matter to Peruvianllama's attention, and in the middle of that Chadbryant showed up and threw out a personal attack <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Peruvianllama&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40461859" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Peruvianllama&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40461859" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Peruvianllama&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40461859</a>.

This isn't the first time Chadbryant has acted like this. His contributions showcase dozens, if not hundreds, of examples of personal attacks and trolling tactics.</p>
<p>Also, Chadbryant has been calling <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">User:TruthCrusader</a> by a name which he believes is TruthCrusader's. The name he is calling him is Stephen Signorelli <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:PyterTaravitch&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40456134" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:PyterTaravitch&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40456134" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:PyterTaravitch&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40456134</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=38843122&amp;oldid=38840494" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=38843122&amp;oldid=38840494" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=38843122&amp;oldid=38840494</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=38065577&amp;oldid=38060269" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=38065577&amp;oldid=38060269" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3APyterTaravitch&amp;diff=38065577&amp;oldid=38060269</a>. TruthCrusader has said that Stephen Signorelli is not his name and has asked Chadbryant to stop calling him by that name. Chadbryant has refused and still persists in doing so. This violates <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHAR_a671.html" title="WP:HAR">WP:HAR</a>, which states, <b>""Posting another person's personal information (legal name, home or workplace address, telephone number, email address, or other contact information, regardless of whether the information is actually correct) is almost always harassment.

To add to the above, the discussion on <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeruvianllama_bd23.html" title="User talk:Peruvianllama">User talk:Peruvianllama</a> was moving along and Chadbryant just resorted to making more personal attacks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APeruvianllama&amp;diff=40488558&amp;oldid=40486857" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APeruvianllama&amp;diff=40488558&amp;oldid=40486857" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APeruvianllama&amp;diff=40488558&amp;oldid=40486857</a>. He attacked me for what I chose as my username and insulted my credibility as a person worthy enough to debate him. He claims that he's here to contribute in a positive manner, but then he goes and personally attacks people and tries to discredit their views and attempt to make them look inferior. My response to him on Peruvianllama's talk page was civil and non hostile. He proceeded to reply and break the <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> policy, among others. He then resorts to a common troll tactic of saying I'm obsessed with him and are harassing him for pointing out why I disagree with his views. <a href="../../../t/v/3/User%7ETv316_cbb8.html" title="User:Tv316">tv316</a> 23:20, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I wish to add that Mr. Bryant has been throwing the 'Stephen Signorelli' name around at me since I arrived to Wikiepdia and quite frankly, I am amazed NO ONE has done a thing about what appears to be one of the worst kinds of harrassment you can commit on this site. I have asked him dozens of times to stop calling me this, several admins have told him to stop this, and he resues to do so. I have tried to be civil with him, I even reverted vandalism to his user page on occasion. I will be prefectly honest, I feel personally that he should be banned from Wikipedia, if not forever, than for a minimum of at least 6 months. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a> 23:29, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Chadbryant himself has been the target of a relentless campaign of personal attacks from various sockpuppets over many months.

<dl>
<dd>You seem to take the attitude that a serious case of harrassment is no more important than some wrestling storyline. Noted. I am trying to avoid arbitration for several reasons. I wish to try and settle this maturely (which Chad doesn't seem capable of), I do not wish to open up Wiki to more sockpuppet attacks from Chad detractors/supporters, and to be honest I sincerely doubt that Mr. Bryant would agree to arbitration in any event.</dd>

<dd>Is it really Arbitration Committee material if it's just a bunch of blatant personal attacks and revert wars for obvious reasons? I have never targeted and stalked Chadbryant relentlessly with sockpuppets or personal attacks, yet he feels the need to continually make personal attacks against me for of all things, my username. Also, whenever I make a point in the argument, he changes the subject and finds a new way to insult me. I was never a part of his newsgroup war and my first encounter with him was on the <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_Undisputed_Championship_49a4.html" title="WWE Undisputed Championship">WWE Undisputed Championship</a> page. There's a small part of me that would understand the attacks against people who may have trolled against him in the past, but I never have. Just because I had an content dispute with him, I guess he had some sort of flashback and viewed me as a new troll just because I didn't agree with him. That type of behaviour should not be allowed. If Sean and John don't like each other and John sprays Sean with a water gun, can Sean then go to the mall and spray random people with a water gun just because he once was a victim of a water gun attack? It's absurd.</dd>

<dd>Also, I'm not trying to have some sort of wrestling feud with Chadbryant. I'm trying to help with this project and false information about whose sock it is takes away from it. I admit that there's a small chance that the <a href="../../../p/y/t/User%7EPyterTaravitch_a076.html" title="User:PyterTaravitch">User:PyterTaravitch</a> sock isn't Chad's, but we don't know if it's Chad's, Truth's, Cain's, mine, yours, etc. Evidence points to Chad and his evidence points to Cain. We should leave it with both. So, when he goes and changes it, I have to go in and find a way to stop him from spreading falsehood.</dd>

<li>Repeatedly empty Cat:People shot by standing Vice Presidents, which has been on CfD for six days and will presumably be closed soon.

<dd>Part of me applauds him for getting rid of so much BS.

Have you seen what people have posted there lately? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMarkSweep&amp;diff=39213347&amp;oldid=39178090" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMarkSweep&amp;diff=39213347&amp;oldid=39178090" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMarkSweep&amp;diff=39213347&amp;oldid=39178090</a> Where did I systematically change Babel boxes??? I like the regular Babel boxes, they're very useful. However, some of them (no more than a dozen) have crossed over into the realm of the polemical, adopting an ill-informed and condescending stance towards various dialects. Those need to be changed. And regarding Cat:People shot by standing Vice Presidents, if you check the history of those articles, you'll see that I'm not the only one who thinks they shouldn't be so categorized. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 20:27, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I see no evidence of discussion of such a proposal anywhere, including the talk page of the templates.</li>
<li>Emptying a category on CfD is improper; any admin should know better. Some users have been removing from one or the other of the articles in the cat; only MarkSweep has been systematically emptying it AFAICS.</li>

<p>I hate to bring it up, but he did start his Wikipedia career with some minor vandalism, and admitted as much in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Jobe6_fb61.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Jobe6">his failed RfAdm</a> six months ago.

<dd>That recent vandalism was after he "left."

<dd><i>How is *initiating* the talk doing an end-run around collaboration?</i> Look at the top of this page: this is NOT the Kaiser Permanente talk page. This is the page to report incidents requiring administrator action, and your (mis)characterization of other editors's actions as "cheating" -- especially after the discussion you barely attempted on the talk page -- tells me that you're attempting an end-run around the messy step of actually having to discuss your edits. You're not "inititating" any talk, you're throwing around accusations -- and again, it appears no one in any official capacity is buying it. This is a content dispute: go to the Kaiser Permanente talk page and make an actual case if you want your edits included. As it says at the top:</dd>

Doesn't the fact there is no public evidence of conversation between <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">User:FCYTravis</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">User:Physchim62</a> EXCEPT for <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">User:Physchim62</a>'s admission that <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">User:FCYTravis</a> made the request on the Protected page suggest they discussed this by IM or offline? As for the content, there is a request by a Kaiser employee on <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">User:FCYTravis</a>'s Talk page (Justen) to make the changes. I plan to deal with this through the normal way: by editing the article and working it out on the talk page. It's <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">User:FCYTravis</a>'s request for Protection to make his reverts stick that has gone against the spirit of collaboration. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPansophia_6cf6.html" title="User:Pansophia">Pansophia</a> 08:38, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reasoning is that they all edited the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_Wikipedia_565c.html" title="Criticisms of Wikipedia">Criticisms of Wikipedia</a> article in quick succession: none of them (at the time of writing) have edited user pages and yet they have been on the site for ages and thus bypass the sprotect.

Times like these make me glad I have hundreds of old accounts". There is a greater than average likelihood that they were created by the same person for the purpose of disruption.

I've placed a formal warning on Cool Cat's talk page, warning that I will ban him from editing the article and talk page if he persists in his antagonistic behavior and inappropriate edits on the talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Overall, Cool Cat has responded well to the mentorship system set up late last year, and I am very satisfied with his progress and his many excellent contributions to Wikipedia. I have only banned him from editing a page once, for a week in early December, and since then things have been quiet and productive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, the community should provide input on this situation. I suggest that those able to spare the time, and willing to do so, monitor (as provided under the decision) and take action if necessary. Any such action would be subject to review by the three mentors, but we would not reverse actions without good reason and a formal justification here. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 19:55, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thompson is, beyond doubt, a buffoon and an all-around weasel, notable mostly for behaving like a jackass in public places and spaces. But something ought to be done about the pages and subpages devoted to him, which seem to be larger than all the other Wikipedia pages on lawyers combined -- OK, that's a bit overstated, but more space than all of the current Supreme Court justices, combined, and we can throw in the Attorneys General of recent memory. Thompson may be the Paris Hilton of the legal world, but that's no excuse for the obsessive, almost day-by-day chronicling of his weird activities. At the rate the articles are growing, there'll be more coverage of this guy than of the Holocaust by midsummer. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 05:24, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You keep on bringing up this four days ago thing as if there is some kind of a conspiracy. There's not. One hour ago was simply the first time anyone picked up on it and brought it to admins' attention. Just as someone who has committed burglary last year can still be tried and convicted, someone who has issued legal threats four days ago can still be punished.

<dd>The first edit done by this person at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jack_Thompson&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40142795" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jack_Thompson&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40142795" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jack_Thompson&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40142795</a> and he was saying that this is "my favorite Internet site" and that the information about Jack Thompson "him" was inaccurate, such as pointing out the dates of his birth are wrong. He also began to list a bunch of things "he done" relating to academic degrees and what he done to someone after a 60 Minutes interview relating to the video game situations that he is currently involved in. He, again, repeats the statement that information about him was wrong at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Help_desk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40187027" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Help_desk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40187027" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Help_desk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40187027</a>.

He always signed as Jack Thompson, and I feel that what he done was disruptive. And, in accordance to the username policy, if a user has created a username that is similar to a public figure that is alive and makes disruptive edits in their name (such as this case), I and other any other admin can issue a username block and ask the blocked user to pick a new name and continue editing under that name. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a> <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">Fair use policy</a></sup></small> 06:35, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But what if it really <i>is</i> Mr. Thompson? This guy has said and done numerous similarly-provocative things, on- and offline, for real, so it's plausible that this user is the real thing. Then again, it <i>could</i> be a hoax, too; he's got lots of enemies and anti-Thompson pranksters online. How does one prove this one way or the other? The issue of users here claiming to be notable people is a frequently-occurring one; we've had several alleged <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilary_Duff_20dd.html" title="Hilary Duff">Hilary Duffs</a>, for instance. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 15:46, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Really, there are <i>two</i> good reasons for an indefinite block. One is the legal threat(s)—per WP:NLT we block people who make legal threats on-wiki until those threats are withdrawn. Two is the username—the account should stay blocked until the account holder can verifiably demonstrate that he is Jack Thompson. (That can be demonstrated in a number of ways.) Until <i>both</i> issues are resolved, the account should stay blocked. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 18:12, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedbug.html" title="Bedbug">Bedbug</a> article keeps getting spammed with a spammer from live-pest-free.com.
