<p>It seems unlikely that one week after KyndFellow is banned and then spotted recruiting meatpuppets, a user behaving in so similar a fashion would arise.</p>
<p>I was a participant in the dispute.</p>
<p>I'd wait longer to gather evidence, but he's also really <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASex_tourism&amp;diff=99171535&amp;oldid=99137493" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASex_tourism&amp;diff=99171535&amp;oldid=99137493" rel="nofollow">unpleasant</a> (scroll to the bold-lettered "lay bare" on that one) to work with. And the aggressive, repetitive Talk page argument just <i>pours</i> out of him.</p>

<dd>Eh. Maybe not. I was expecting Mattjs to do something he hasn't yet done, so he's probably not who I thought he was. How do I withdraw this request? Whatever problems I have with him will be dealt with some other way. /&#160;<a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgarde_393d.html" title="User:Edgarde">edgarde</a> 15:42, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it doesn't hurt to let people know that the article has been the subject of an arbitration case; at the very least, a bit more caution is a good idea. This report will get archived in a couple of days and if you think there is a new or ongoing problem you can report it then. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:45, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At <a href="../../../r/a/c/Talk%7ERachel_Marsden_9363.html" title="Talk:Rachel Marsden">Talk:Rachel Marsden</a> Fred Bauder has noted that the IP is also used by an innocent bystander. Generally Arthur Ellis edits from short-term IP addresses that he can reset if he wants to, so the most we can do is a 24 hour block anyway. He certainly has contempt for the ban, and for the whole arbitration process in general. There are ways to address his concerns besides editing the article himself, but is is unwilling to avail himself. Other than resetting the 1 month ban timer and reverting his edits, there is not much that can be practically done.

<li>Much of the trouble-making can be settled by a semi-protect, as you suggest, and yes, the clock should be reset for each block.

<p>Great, had no clue this was against your policies, as Ian's response was not derogatory or what have you, I found it entirely appropriate to add his response to the discussion. Had his response been derogatory or inappropriate, I certainly would not have added it to the talk page on that basis alone. Also, I understood that Ian was banned from editing the ARTICLE, I did not see and did not understand why he was banned from editing the talk page, or for that matter, why he was really banned at all. The reasons made for the ban where very unspecific and his recent ban appears to have been triggered more from frustration of listening to our unresolved complaints against SA than anything else. It will be interesting to see the action taken against me for this, as I had no clue I was breaking any of your rules. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 01:39, 6 January 2007 (UTC) p.s. Ah, I am reading above now and see- "and their talk pages." Didn't notice that before, oops. Why don't you simply just go in and erase the response I pasted there, rather than make this into a bigger ordeal than it needs to be? Fact is I figured it was a mistake that he was banned from the talkpage, as I understood bans to be on articles not talkpages, just as is the case for one Mr. Eric Lerner. The only thing I thought I was circumventing was an apparent mistake, and assumed it would be corrected. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 01:41, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Meat puppet? You enjoy this don't you? I act on my own grounds, I happen to agree with Ian's statement that the information itself is not banned. How does this make me a Meat Puppet? Regardless, as stated above, I stand by my decision, with no malice intended. Think of it what you will, I am not acting as a meat puppet, as this is a single incident, and reasoning was stated for my actions. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 02:54, 6 January 2007 (UTC) p.s., after reading about 'meat puppets', I don't see how you are able to claim I am one. I am my individual self, I am not Ian posing as someone else. I am exactly who my user page says I am. If the admins check my IP and compare to Ian's, you will find that we live in entirely different countries, as I am in the usa and I believe Ian is somewhere in Europe. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 02:56, 6 January 2007 (UTC) p.s. perhaps that meant sock puppet.

<p><b>Response</b> Posting information on behalf of a banned user is a blockable offense, see <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html#Dealings_with_banned_users" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN#Dealings_with_banned_users</a>. Although this policy deals with permanently banned users, I think it is reasonable to extend the policy to bans under probation. Where a user has been banned from a page because his contributions have been deemed disruptive, it makes sense to broadly interpret the ban to prohibit the user from continuing to contribute through a proxy or third party. The appropriate response would not be to block the third party, but to apply the same page bans to the proxy as to the original account (and then to block if the third party ignore the page ban). Reposting verbatim comments of a banned user is clearly prohibited. Taking a person's "suggestions" or "information" and making the edits yourself could certainly be interpreted as acting as a proxy for a banned user. It would be a judgement call on the part of the admin reviewing the situation. I decline to consider that judgement at this time, since I'm giving you a free pass on this first incident for not being aware of the rules. The best way to avoid being caught in a ban not of your own making would be to ignore Ian's "information" until his ban expires and he is free to edit in his own name. If you decide to edit the article as he suggested, you leave yourself open to an undesirable outcome.</p>
<p>Ian, you were banned from the article and talk page for disruption. You say you do not condone anyone circumventing your ban, but it looks to me like you are clearly trying to influence or even direct the editing of the article during your ban, which in your case is a blockable offense. Again, it's a judgement call. If you don't want to leave yourself open to the possibility of a block, keep your information to yourself until your ban expires. Go edit somewhere else. If you persist in trying to influence the article while you are banned from it, you may be blocked per your probation.

<dd>I made a response on my talk page. I would like to state here that I doubt Ian was really trying to influence me, but his reasoning did make sense to me so I acted according to my own judgment of the matter. To further punish Ian for an apparent mistake that I made, seems inappropriate, especially considering that ScienceApologist is now in agreement with us over what we where debating in the first place (keeping the title of the article as <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">Plasma_cosmology</a>). This is an 'after the fact' attack, apparent malice intended against myself and Ian. However I am willing to let this go if the other parties are as well, it seems more reasonable to move on to improving the article now that some consensus was reached by SA concerning the article title. My principles disallow me from removing what I added to the talk page, especially considering the entire situation as having been already resolved and moved past. Again, thanks for your more unbiased and cool headed response Thatcher. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 04:16, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Second response</b> After further thought (and see the KyndFellow case above) I'm not sure the issue is as obvious. Certainly if Ian's ban for disruption arose from a particular argument, and another editor jumped in an continued the same argument, I would want to apply the same article ban for the same reason. But if Ian wants to provide information on another topic, and another editor can add it without being disruptive, maybe it should be allowed. The third party editor would obviously take responsibility for anything he posted. If the edits were disruptive and confrontational, the third party editor would get blocked or banned. If the edits were reasonable, other editors would have to deal with their content in the normal way without regard to their source (no automatic reversion). I think both views are logically supportable, I don't know what the arbitrators have in mind. I have asked for clarification at WP:RFAR. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:06, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>For what? Your disruption? Look at the thread in <a href="../../../w/o/l/Talk%7EWolf_effect_eec7.html" title="Talk:Wolf effect">Talk:Wolf effect</a> - how many times did I invite you to come up with compromise wording? The closest you got was to say that SA would not accept a compromise. How do you know? You never offered one. I spent quite a lot of time trying to get some kind of agreement there, on the basis that you assured me that you were not trying to push a fringe theory, but since the only form of words you would accept is the one the proponents of that frnige theory explicitly rely on, and which is therefore the core of the problem, I could see why SA was unhappy about it. SA has no particular reason to want to fix the fact that your edit was not made. I don't care either way. You're the one who wants the change, but after many rounds of verbal ping-pong your final answer appears to be a refusal to compromise. Which is pretty much the canonical definition of disruption. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 20:35, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>With respect, not offering a compromise of some text, is not disrupting. I gave good reasons of my actions throughout.</li>
<li>I disagree with your assessment about "pushing fringe theories" (again, this is not disruption). The description of the Wolf effect as a redshift (or blueshift) is NOT fringe. It is verifiable in peer reviewed papers, by the experts and in textbooks. That is how it is described, and Wikipedia should reflect that. However, you would be correct that this new redshift mechanism has been suggested as a redshift in astronomy by a smaller number of people. Again, this is verifiable and attributable (as I had it in the article originally). SA's view that the Wolf effect is criticised in astronomy is not supported by ANY references whatsoever; we have only SA's word for it.</li>
<li>Refusal to compromise is not disruption; it may be non-constructive (which is not the opposite of disruptive). SA has also "refused to compromise", and yet he's not even criticized, let alone asked. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">Iantresman</a> 21:41, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is if you sit there insisting on having your way, on an article where you've been told by ArbCom that insisting on your way is disruptive. Why do you have such a problem with suggesting a compromise form of words? I've said before, SA has no reason to want to think of one, he's happy with the article as-is, <i>you</i> want it changed, you've been told that what you want is not acceptable (for credible reasosns, whether you like them or not) and in the end it's <i>you</i> who needs to come up with an idea, since you are the one who cares.

<li>Indeed, the article arleady does precisely that. Frequency shift, we observe as red due to relative position, accounts for some discordant redshifts. Yup, fine. The only thing we don't do is help with the plasma crowd's quote-mining. So, what, precisely, do you want to say, bearing in mind that baldly calling it a "new redshift mechanism" is rejected due to the misuse of this text by quote-mining POV pushers? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:23, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The article on <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Velikovsky_1537.html" title="Immanuel Velikovsky">Immanuel Velikovsky</a> is known to be very controversial. Despite <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> reminding us that ".. updating pages" does not mean that you should make large changes or deletions to long articles on complex, controversial subjects with long histories", I believe ScienceApologist has done just that under the IP address 216.125.49.252.</li>
<li>While this is probably not a major problem in itself, it still ignores the guidelines, and more importantly includes several statement which clearly contravene NPOV "<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Fairness_of_tone" title="WP:NPOV">Fairness of tone</a>" with unsubstantiated statement that fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Immanuel_Velikovsky&amp;diff=100103892&amp;oldid=100099195" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Immanuel_Velikovsky&amp;diff=100103892&amp;oldid=100099195" rel="nofollow">described here</a>)</li>
<li>Rather than discuss these issues, ScienceApologist accuses me of:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Velikovskian POV-pushing" (unfounded)</li>
<li>"conflict of interest" on the grounds that I publish a CD-Rom on catastrophism (that would be like me suggesting that someone had a conflict of interest because they had an interest in the subject)</li>

<li>The last two are ad hominems (they address the person, not the edits).</li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> I believe this needs a relook. No party has volunteered to make comments in the discussion page with regards to the existance of a certain destination, but there are comments in the edit history by all parties. I have since brought this up in the relevant talkpage (even as you yourself reverted the article without commenting in the talkpage either). As for the mediation case, I am quite obviously not the only one who is disputing the way the mediation process was conducted. Is the voicing out of such objections a probation violation? Meanwhile, I would greatly appreciate if a notification be placed in my talkpage concerning such notifications, as clearly required above.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 15:42, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I disagree with <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> handling this since he has demonstrated bias towards my user in recent conversations.

<dd>I have no objection to another administrator reviewing this situation. Such other administrator should consider the matter independently and should feel free to take whatever action, whether less or more severe than indicated above, he or she feels appropriate. For the record, I do not believe I demonstrated any bias against 67.177.149.119 in the discussion on AIV that is being referred to, but simply indicated that the user's personal attacks are unacceptable. I did make a negative remark about banned User:ParalelUni, a subject of the referenced arbitration case, and would like to ask 67.177.149.119 if you are the same person as ParalelUni. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 02:49, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

TDC should not have made the second revert. However, James is banned from <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depleted_Uranium_39fb.html" title="Depleted Uranium">Depleted Uranium</a> and associated articles, and by making a link to that article, it could be argued that he was creating an association between the page that he was editing and the depleted uranium page, thereby accidentally violating his own parole. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 06:33, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>James S. is not prohibited from editing the talk pages of DU-related articles. I would say that listing the articles as "accuracy disputes" is within the range of permitted activities, since it would allow him to call attention to his complaints on the talk page. I think TDC was wrong to revert James at all, much less twice, but it is an understandable difference in interpretation of the ruling. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:00, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Even if the edit was relevant to Sathya Sai Baba (which, because the article does not even mention Sathya Sai Baba, it wasn't), then I fail to see how an edit made on 9 January 2006 could be worthy of any action in relation to an arbitration finding made on 5 September 2006. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 18:51, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>This is only a sample of the general incivility and veiled personal insults towards other editors of the article by this user. This also includes bad faith assumptions on the article's recent AfD page where I was called a troll, ignorant, and arrogant. I have been a participant in the AfD, article, and talk page, but have decided not to improve this article for now in light of the abuse I have been taking there.</p>

<p>Not sure what this is doing here as my arbcom is related to Zapatero, nor why this user has chosen to harrass me. What he fails to point out tis that a number of editoprs feel the same way as me and are unhapy at Ju's aggressive approach, of which this is clearly a part. He claims that because I criticise the article I am criticising him wherreas the only critixcisms of him have concernecd his personal behavious. He says <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=102530700&amp;oldid=102513363" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=102530700&amp;oldid=102513363" rel="nofollow">here</a> he is reporting me becasue he has lost his temper and then claims he is making a better wikipedia and I am not.

Since he decided he will not even attempt to discuss his position, it was noted and we moved on. Arthur can you explain how all those reverts were against you? Are you honestly attempting to revert war then come here to have some penalty enacted? Sounds like trying to game the system since your next revert would have been a 3RR violation. Arbcom enforcement isnt for revenge, or for going around 3RR. I would like to point out the only people supporting Arthur Rubin is Tom Harrison, which as an admin has been edit warring on the page as well. Myself, Lovelight, Bov and Fiddle Faddle all support a change to alternate theories. Arthur Rubin and Tom Harrison keep revert warring to change it, oddly enough Arthur Rubin has voted to have the template deleted, so I am afraid of the intent of his edits as well, but I have continued to AGF and not accuse him of anything. Just to point out if its wondered why I have so many mentions here, they are all from members of the former GabrielF Noticeboard which I contributed to having moved, which they arent happy about. Tom Harrison, Mongo, TBeatty, Morton Devonshire, Arthur Rubin, Derex, rogerd, etc. So do not be surprised if MONGO interjects to give an "outside opinion" or Tom for that matter. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 11:25, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Also this is a content dispute, note him pushing his content based points, of if they should be called "researchers, since they research, or members etc. This is not the place for content based issues Arthur Rubin. I told you Thatcher131, the Arbcom enforcement page is a way for people who do not agree to just push their weight instead of discuss, notice Arthur did not attempt to discuss this with me on the talk page, just reverted constantly then ran here. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 11:27, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As for the members arguement, let me explain. The 9/11 Truth Movement is a group of people. Much like the Civil Rights Movement was a group of people. For a person to say "Civil Rights Movement preached the complete destruction of anyone that cannot trace their heritage back to Africa in 2 generations" would be a lie, even if you could find 1 person that had some involvement that did say it. The problem is that the majority of people involved in this movement, I call them members, much like Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. are members of the civil rights movement. No they are not members in the sense that they signed a piece of paper granting them super secret access and secret decoder rings. They are members because they are frequently mentioned in step with the movement. Some people want to argue that there are no prominent "members" since noone signed a charter, or keeps a list of who is "in" and who is "out". In seeing that arguement I changed membership to researchers, its a neutral terms and their appearance on the template basically showed their common thinking. So Arthur if you would ask me, instead of reverting, you could have had an answer. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 14:26, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"This is why people use talk pages." Yes, why don't you do so before deleting information from templates, either by reversion, or by a direct edit.

<dd>It is good you admit you have never assumed good faith in any of this, unfortunatly I have and it is perhaps why I kept discussing while you kept reverting, very sad. Perhaps you should read up on Arbcom hearings, they arent meant to be used as weapons against people you do not agree with, seeing as you never assumed good faith, which is probably why you reverted without discussion says alot. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 20:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What negative information about Sathya Sai Baba was being added to the article? There is none that I can see. I think Andries is advancing a ludicrous interpretation here, and I'd like to demonstrate that with a hypothetical example. Suppose a British MP were, in the course of a speech in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, to make some remark attacking Sathya Sai Baba. That would be transcribed and reported in <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hansard.html" title="Hansard">Hansard</a> and then appear on the Parliament website. According to Andries' interpretation, all links to the Parliament website would then have to be removed from all articles. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 22:17, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From 5Q5 14:59, 29 January 2007 (UTC): I included the link on the JREF article because of the prize money and I thought I was being helpful. This "Sathya Sai Baba" person is of no interest to me. I live in the U.S. Wiki user "Andries" left the following message in my Wiki account suggesting I might be banned for my edit. I took it as a threat that I should not be involved with anything negative about this "Sathya Sai Baba" person ever again directly or indirectly. This is a ridiculous complaint and a waste of Wikipedia's disk space. "Hi 5Q5, I filed a complaint about your editing behavior at Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Arbitration_enforcement#5Q5_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29_on_James_Randi_Educational_Foundation_possible_violation_of_Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration.2FSathya_Sai_Baba.23Removal_of_poorly_sourced_information for your possible violation of Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Sathya_Sai_Baba#Removal_of_poorly_sourced_information Here is the possibly problematic edit that you made edit by 5Q5 made on 19:26, 26 January 2007 that links to the website of the Indian Skeptic containing possibly poorly sourced critical information about Sathya Sai Baba.

<dd>From 5Q5 19:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC). I did not submit an external link on the article of James Randi or Sathya Sai Baba.

That's all I did. I did not see any mention on the article that it is subject to censorship and no external link even remotely associated with this Sathya Sai Baba person is not allowed. I could care less if you undid all my small amount of editing on the article. If <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a>'s goal is censorship of Wikipedia, then, you have won in my case, as I will never attempt an edit of the JREF article ever again!

<dd>I've banned the IP for 48 hours. However, he seems to be able to use a lot of IP addresses. In the future, try reporting him at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> for a faster response, although you will have to link to the arbitration case and the previous report here so that the blocking admin will know this is a violation rather than decline the report as a content dispute.

<dd>I'm not going to get involved in these conspiracy theories. The only other run-in I've ever had with Messhermit is when he was violating the terms of his arbitration and was blocked for five days, but that was months and months ago. The bottom line is that 1) Messhermit has violated the terms of his arbitration multiple times 2) Messhermit is currently on probation 3) Messhermit is creating a problem on a bunch of articles that are similar to ones he is banned from editing. Again, I do not know if it would be appropriate to ban Messhermit from editing pages related to the war between Peru and Chile, but someone might want to look into it. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 20:02, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can not involve myself in this case as an administrator because I know both of these editors. However, as an editor and member of the Peru Wikiproject I will say that I am disappointed by the amount of edit warring that has gone on in articles related to the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Pacific_ca2d.html" title="War of the Pacific">War of the Pacific</a>. With regards to the actual content, I actually agree somewhat with Messhermit in that the recent events should not be as highlighted as they are in these articles but his edit warring is causing more harm then good and it has caused that page and the <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacna_Region_c3df.html" title="Tacna Region">Tacana</a> page to be protected. And both of those page's talk pages have long drawn out disputes between this user and <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdean1963_fc4c.html" title="User:Bdean1963">User:Bdean1963</a> which contain vast amounts of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> from both sides.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 04:02, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have already been blocked by an Administrator for a certain period of time, and I'm willing to avoid getting into this kind of situations as long as its necessary. In this case, I have already exposed the necessary documentation in both articles that demonstrate that I was acting in good faith and with reasonable arguments the exclusion of certain paragraphs. I will revert no more, and I'm fact I'm still waiting for the other party involved in the dispute to respond in a civilized way and settle this problem once and for all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thus, I'm asking to any Administrator to mediate for us in this dispute and help us to solve this problem.

<dd>I expect that most of the comments sources to DTN can be tracked back to their original sources; they look like a news and comment aggregator. No matter what the politics of an aggregator or blog like this is, it is always best practice to find the original source of the comment, rather than rely on an intermediary. Unfortunately, they do not provide these bibliographic details themselves, and for some comments it may take a college student/teacher with access to Lexis/Nexis where a basic google search fails. In the meantime, whether to remove the cited material entirely, or leave the comments and replace the citation with {{fact}}, is a matter of editorial judgement. Insisting on either extreme (remove all now or leave all for now) is likely to be unwise. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:30, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many have suspected this, though today it was found Rumplestiltskin was using an anonymous IP to provide citations to content Hkelkar added some time ago. Understand that many users have been alleging the two were the same person before this. Because the sources were books published in the 50s and 60s, no longer in print, and Rumplestiltskin knew the exact locations of the related content, I argue it's impossible that Rumplestiltskin ,now given other mentioned similarities that,is anyone other than Hkelkar.</p>

<p>Hello. Please accept the possibility that there is another interpretation possible. As SlimVirgin informed me, the ArbCom ruled/s on 'behaviour' not content. The version that was edit warred pro for by user Crum375 et al did in established fact contain clear blatant violations of WP:BLP that I argued against and subsequently were deleted as such BLP violations by SlimVirgin at my insistance. This is all verifiable (by looking at the record and SlimVirgin's Admin intervention and comments). There are still serious WP:BLP issues with the current entry. I wont take up space here repeating what I have detailed on other BLP pages. <i>I am requesting other editors/Admin deal with this BLP issue</i>. Crum375 follows me around and creates a discussion wherever I post a request for help/intervention - this is not my doing. It's as simple as that. I have not attempted to edit the page - I am keeping to the ArbCom decision; even though I strongly disagree with it.

<dd>Thank you for addressing most of my concerns. However, Richard not only was banned from editing the article, he was banned from the article talk page. Yes, he may raise concerns about the article on other fora and others in good standing with the article/topic may reply to those concerns. However, can Richard, who is not in good standing with the article/topic, then respond in kind? In other words, although Richard was banned from the article talk page, can Richard engage in the same kind of response talk banter that could have appeared on the Yoshiaki Omura/BDORT talk page but for Richardmalter's ban from those pages? For example, post ArbCom, Richard responds a first time to Crum375 (who is editing the BDORT article) on SlimVirgin's talk page about Yoshiaki Omura/BDORT <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=106024542&amp;oldid=105970591" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=106024542&amp;oldid=105970591" rel="nofollow">[114]</a>, Richard continues the talk and responds a second time to Crum375 on SlimVirgin's talk page about Yoshiaki Omura/BDORT <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=106260611&amp;oldid=106025634" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=106260611&amp;oldid=106025634" rel="nofollow">[115]</a>. Richard then incorporates Talk:Yoshiaki_Omura talk page information into the SlimVirgin's talk page discussion by providing Diffs 6 and 7. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=106277474&amp;oldid=106272307" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=106277474&amp;oldid=106272307" rel="nofollow">[116]</a>. Also post ArbCom, on the BLPN page, Richard responds to Crum375 about Yoshiaki Omura/BDORT <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABiographies_of_living_persons%2FNoticeboard&amp;diff=106754962&amp;oldid=106729221" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABiographies_of_living_persons%2FNoticeboard&amp;diff=106754962&amp;oldid=106729221" rel="nofollow">[117]</a> and responds to GenghizRat's post <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABiographies_of_living_persons%2FNoticeboard&amp;diff=106760437&amp;oldid=106760102" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABiographies_of_living_persons%2FNoticeboard&amp;diff=106760437&amp;oldid=106760102" rel="nofollow">[118]</a> with statements about Yoshiaki Omura/BDORT content here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABiographies_of_living_persons%2FNoticeboard&amp;diff=107004193&amp;oldid=106973159" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABiographies_of_living_persons%2FNoticeboard&amp;diff=107004193&amp;oldid=106973159" rel="nofollow">[119]</a>. I think it's important to note that Crum375, GenghizRat, and Philosophus were Involved parties in the ArbCom case with Richardmalter and a request for Arbitration is the last step of dispute resolution. -- by original requestor <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 18:31, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You raise a complicated issue. First, regarding SlimVirgin's talk page, it's her page and she is quite capable of deciding if Richard is abusing it. If she is interested in discussing the article with him, that is her choice, and Crum and the other's don't even have to involve themselves if they would rather not. Regarding the BLP noticeboard or other areas where Richard might raise concerns, I would think a case by case evaluation would be needed. Arbcom did not ban him from ever mentioning Dr. Omura or BDORT, so some level of engagement is potentially tolerable. Suppose Richard raises an issue at the BLP noticeboard and it is discussed and either acted on or not, and Richard drops it. No problem. Suppose on the other hand he becomes disruptive over it, or posts the same complaint over and over again no matter how many times it has been considered and dismissed. That certainly would be grounds to extend his topical ban to cover other areas of wikipedia. Admin judgement and discretion is usually required when enforcing arbitration rulings. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ed, you and I both know that once you're on probation it's the case that you've already had plenty of warnings leading up that and that no further warnings are necessary. The fact that you are continuing to disrupt <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming_controversy.html" title="Global warming controversy">Global_warming_controversy</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/o/Talk%7EGlobal_warming_controversy_cca2.html#Temperature_in_the_intro" title="Talk:Global warming controversy">Talk:Global_warming_controversy#Temperature in the intro</a> after yesterday's warning is sufficient grounds for immediate blocking. I do wish you'd move along and leave alone the articles where you earned your probation and find a quiet little uncontroversial corner of Wikipedia to contribute to quietly.

<dd>Regarding the page move, in my opinion Ed's apologies are rather meaningless since he knew full well there were significant objections to moving the page. He participated in a discussion about such a move which began 30 July 2006 (<a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_scientists_opposing_the_global_warming_consensus_3ea1.html#Mv.3F" title="Talk:List of scientists opposing the global warming consensus">see discussion</a>) as well as another discussion on whether there exists a consensus, in response to Ed's POV edits, on 3 August 2006 (<a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_scientists_opposing_the_global_warming_consensus_3ea1.html#Reverted_Ed_Poor.27s_changes" title="Talk:List of scientists opposing the global warming consensus">see discussion</a>). In addition to the page move, he has also continued to put his POV in the article itself (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_scientists_opposing_global_warming_consensus&amp;diff=108886517&amp;oldid=108885755" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_scientists_opposing_global_warming_consensus&amp;diff=108886517&amp;oldid=108885755" rel="nofollow">diff</a>).</dd>

<dd>That said, I'm not really offended by the "Temperature in the intro" discussion referenced above. Adding redlinks is a bit annoying but I wouldn't call it disruptive (unless this was a big issue in the past?).</dd>

<dd>A minor note: <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> seems to have stated it backwards above but his point is correct.

<dd>I appreciate your offer. I do not really want to have that power, and would prefer to leave it up to the ArbCom or administrators. As a personal suggestion I think you would do fine if you just discuss changes on the talk page first, and think critically about your edits and make sure that statements (or implications) that you add are backed up by reliable sources which you cite. --<a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENethgirb_2a07.html" title="User:Nethgirb">Nethgirb</a> 12:06, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree mostly with <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENethgirb_2a07.html" title="User:Nethgirb">Nethgirb</a>. Ed, I think you're sincere about wanting to do better. But your repeat offenses across a long period of time and a broad range of article space -- global warming, intelligent design, etc. -- suggest that you just can't help yourself. A very wise man once said "Lead us not into temptation." Maybe you could find some uncontroversial topics related to, say, music, hobbies, and so on where you could contribute without being tempted to go overboard. You're obviously a smart guy and can make useful contributions to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 03:47, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd suggest you avoid it altogether moving forward considering you were falling over yourself apologizing here with one hand while making the clearly biased edits at the Wells article with the other. Again, arbcom probation is not let's make a deal. And your faux naif questions while arguing for elevating the views ID proponents to being on par with that of the scientific community which outright rejects ID at Wells article over the last few days is precisely one of the activities named as evidence of tendentious editing in your RFAR that eventually landed you here. Now if you think you can with a few strategically-placed apologies (while still making blatantly biased edits) game the system to side-step your probation, I don't think you'll get too far with that. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 05:18, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>I in particular draw your attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AChina-geo-stub&amp;diff=104076170&amp;oldid=103921276" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AChina-geo-stub&amp;diff=104076170&amp;oldid=103921276" rel="nofollow">Huaiwei rescopes and recategorises "Mainland China" stub template to "People's Republic of China"</a>, ignoring (lack of) outcome of earlier discussion at <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a> on the scope of this stub type.</li>
<li>Instantnood reverts this three times in total, including twice in two hours (on these occasions with another editor not under such probation) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AChina-geo-stub&amp;diff=110142388&amp;oldid=109384396" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AChina-geo-stub&amp;diff=110142388&amp;oldid=109384396" rel="nofollow">[138]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:China-geo-stub&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=110165869" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:China-geo-stub&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=110165869" rel="nofollow">[139]</a>, despite an AC enforcement item by an admin claiming to limit him to 1RR. Given that each of these edits recategorises and rescopes about 900 different articles, I'd say all of this constitutes "disruption".</li>
<li>Instantnood rescopes {{<a href="../../../c/h/i/Template%7EChina-road-stub_edf1.html" title="Template:China-road-stub">China-road-stub</a>}} from "People's Republic of China" to "Mainland China", without any prior participation in the discussion of this at <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_P_67de.html" title="WP:WSS/P">WP:WSS/P</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>(The potential for significant disruption, and not to say pointless server load, by editing stub templates is precisely <i>why</i> we have <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_P_67de.html" title="WP:WSS/P">WP:WSS/P</a> and <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a> for discussing these naming and scoping issues, and while they're not technically obligatory, editors under probation would be well-advised to pay them some heed.)</p>
<dl>
<dt>Summation</dt>
</dl>
<p>I propose to institute page-bans on both at {{<a href="../../../c/h/i/Template%7EChina-geo-stub_0058.html" title="Template:China-geo-stub">China-geo-stub</a>}}, and at Instantnood {{<a href="../../../c/h/i/Template%7EChina-road-stub_edf1.html" title="Template:China-road-stub">China-road-stub</a>}}, with a view to extending this to any other stub templates and stub categories similar disruption occurs on. (I mention this in advance here only in the interests of full disclosure.) I invite discussion of whether either (or both) should be site-banned for a period for edit-warring over the totality of their behaviour as manifest over this series of articles, templates and categories.</p>

<dd>Thanks for the reminder. Yes, on both, per -geo-. (H. first, and IN sustainedly.) Other editors weighing in too. I'd protect that as an "HRT", but I'd rather not be accused (again) of improperly favouring a particular version. I suggest we take the scoping issue back to <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a>, and if that doesn't produce a clear consensus, to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 05:49, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The scope of {{China-geo-stub}} as decided by consensus was mainland China. The same is the case for {{China-struct-stub}}. It would have been fine if user:Huaiwei were willing to propose and seek consensus from the community first, before going straight to edit according to his preference. User:SchmuckyTheCat, although no longer under probation (as he tactically stayed himself away from problematic edits during the course of the third case), knows very well too about what has been going on. Since I was not the person creating trouble to {{China-geo-stub}} and {{China-struct-stub}}, and I was merely trying to halt attempts to avoid discussion and consensus building, I don't think it is necessary to ban me from editing the templates. I don't even edit the templates (cf. edit history records of the two templates) unless there is attempt to not following consensus established. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 07:55, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for {{China-road-stub}}, I've explained in details to user:Alai on why I have rescoped it. To repeat briefly, i) user:Alai said " <i>upmerged</i> " in the edit summary when he recreated the template, and I supposed it was recreation of the previously deleted template bearing the same title, therefore following the original scope of the old template, ii) the template applied (and applies, and will apply) only to roads in mainland China, and iii) the scope user:Alai had chosen did not go in line with what was decided for similar stub types, namely {{China-geo-stub}} and {{China-struct-stub}}, by consensus.
<p>Since user:Alai has insisted to have his preference prevails, and since the template is still at proposal stage at WP:WSS/P, I'll leave it as it is until a clear decision is made through consensus at WP:WSS/P. Meanwhile I'd also like to take this opportunity to urge wikipedians to decide scopes of stub types according to structures of comparable existing stub types. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 07:55, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not about content, it's about behavior. You will not stop reverting and you do not discuss and that pattern has continued for 2½ years now. You also say "I'll leave it as it is until a clear decision is made" and your very next edit is to change the scope of one of the mentioned stubs AGAIN. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 15:16, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Whose responsibility is it to start a discussion at the talk page? The one who modifies an entry while knowing such modifications are controversial at the time of the edit, or the users who revert such edits with reference to an official guideline? Well yes those who revert do have the responsibility to tell what's wrong, yet would that be neccessary to tell such users who have persistently making controversial edits, and and who have been spreading their drive to more and more entries? — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 11:52, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>ArbCom has placed you under probation for making disruptive edits, POV re-orgs, etc. As the one who shouldn't be making such edits, I'd say the onus is on you. As you make the same edit hundreds of times it is unreasonable to hold hundreds of simultaneous discussions.

Remedies for his behavior include time based bans from all of Wikipedia, article based bans, and, any three administrators may agree to impose a permanent ban from all of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Disputed behaviour did not cease when asked to stop without using dispute resolution <a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html#Revert.2C_hello.3F" title="User talk:Instantnood">User_talk:Instantnood#Revert.2C_hello.3F</a>, and other messages left by other users. An extension to his ArbCom penalties was requested. The reverts did not stop during, or now immediately after: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=110866750#Instantnood_4" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=110866750#Instantnood_4" rel="nofollow">Requests for arbitration/Instantnood 4</a>. ArbCom declined to create a new sanction and prefers the remedies of article bans and site bans, potentially including an indefinite site ban with the support of any three administrators.</p>
<p>In order to understand the seriousness and ArbCom sanctions him you have to understand Instantnood. He games the system to stay under any revert limit but he carries on the same revert war for <i><b>years</b></i> which is what makes ignoring him disruptive to those trying to maintain consistency. He makes a few reverts to an article once a week or once a month to what he prefers then leaves it for a bit and returns after the disruption has died down to do it again. His edits singularly enforce his POV and his edits are usually minor changes to categories, templates, intro, etc that change the presentation of articles. Changes to templates and categories can affect hundreds of articles at a time. He often makes changes to two templates/categories, each individually looks like a minor content change but together he has re-classified something entirely the opposite of what it was.</p>
<p>In every ArbCom case, and every excuse for enforcement, he always argues about why his content is right, and he seemingly ignores or is entirely oblivious to his behavior. It is his behavior that is sanctioned. Time base blocks on Instantnood <i>do not work</i>, as soon as the block is over he will return to reverting. Given his method of making disruptive reverts, then leaving the article alone, the time based block is ineffective - he would have left it alone anyways. He needs to be blocked from editing these articles using the {{userarticleban}}.</p>

<dt>The following list of articles contain general revert warring, generally without discussion, anywhere from 2 to 10 reverts in a few days. Alternatively, they contain particularly egregious examples of POV re-organization which his ArbCom sanction also prohibits. This is only a list from the last <i>week</i> and is incomplete.

<p>Instantnood has edit warred at all the articles and categories listed above, including many violations of his 1 revert per day parole imposed by admin <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle 101</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a>) on 8 December 2006, see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Instantnood_3_68ef.html#Log_of_blocks_and_bans" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Instantnood 3">here</a>. Many of these edit wars involve categorization of articles and categories. Instantnood specifically targets category changes made by Huaiwei, even if they were days or weeks earlier, showing that Instantnood is specifically tracking and reverting Huaiwei.</p>
<p>Huaiwei has edit warred. The changes he makes may or may not be in good faith. However, when Instantnood reverts, Huaiwei edit wars rather than seeking other forms of assistance.</p>

<dd>I blocked the IP, but it's probably dynamic.

<dd>The problem was that you were taking the advantage of my absense and have tried to speedy two stub categories which you wanted them disappeared.

<dd>Classic case of 'two wrongs make... two wrongs'. Schmucky's depopulations and speedy-taggings were quite inappropriate, given this was known by him to be a disputed matter. There's a venue (or several) for discussing these matters. Amd IN's hangons were besides the point: one of them was deleted anyway; the other I removed becaused I was going to that page anyway to take the matter to <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a>. (The other I didn't notice it unless after it'd been speedied.) Accordingly, I'd caution IN to respect his ban, and StC to desist from behaviour essentially similar to what got IN and H. sanctioned in the first place. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 18:19, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Admin response</b> There is a technical violation by Elsanaturk and no violation that I can see by Azerbijani. However there is a lack of productive discussion, so whether you revert once a day or once a week you're still not making progress. I tend to think that if someone made a dramatic speech on VoA you could find a newspaper or something that talked about it, or a book or other source on the history of the region. If there is no real dispute about authenticity the speeech might go in the external link section and some reference found to describe the speech's content in the article body. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:23, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One can easily look at the talk pages for all the articles and clearly see that I showed plenty of good faith initially even though it was obvious that user AdilBaguirov was merely disrupting the articles with pov intepretations of various literature. All of his pov pushing has been rebuffed on each of the talk pages of the articles not only by myself and user TigrantheGreat but also by third party editors such as user Aldux and Ali among others. Read the talk pages and make your own judgement. Good faith was thrown out of the window after a month or two of discussions. Notice that not even Adil's allies have supported him in these attempts of disruption. Since registration this user has made no positive contibutions to wikipedia. None whatsoever. Created no articles. Reverted no vandalism. Helped no users. He has concentrated all his efforts to one goal, that is the disruption of various unrelated Armenian historical articles. After almost a year, nothing has changed. I could have easily turned each of those articles into an FA article like I did with <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tiridates_I_of_Armenia_2604.html" title="Tiridates I of Armenia">Tiridates I of Armenia</a> from scratch had Adil ceased his disruption. --<big><b><a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator"><font color="#00N510">Ευπάτωρ</font></a></b></big> <sup><small><a href="../../../e/u/p/User_talk%7EEupator_d1d3.html" title="User talk:Eupator"><font color="#974423">Talk!!</font></a></small></sup> 19:33, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Response</b> Unless there has been a violation of the revert parole imposed in the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Armenia-Azerbaijan_2091.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Armenia-Azerbaijan">arbitration case</a> to which Eupator is a party, there is no action that can be taken here.

<dd><b>Response</b> fundamentally this is a content dispute. Normally your first step would be RFC, then mediation, and finally arbitration. Since you are both already parties to the ongoing arbitration, deal with this there.

Effective Oct. 21, 2006, the user is under revert parole and probation for one year for edit warring at the <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_Massacre_eb1f.html" title="Srebrenica Massacre">Srebrenica Massacre</a> article. The final decision in his case is here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Kosovo#Involved_parties" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Kosovo#Involved_parties" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Kosovo#Involved_parties</a></p>
<p>After his being sanctioned, the user continued aggressive edit warring at the Srebrenica Massacre article under the sockpuppet KarlXII. After checkuser exposed KarlXII as a sockpuppet, the account was blocked indefinitely and Osli73 was blocked for one week. Once re-instated, Osli73 continued to violate the terms of his parole which states that the user is "limited to one revert per article per week". His violations were reported here and he was again blocked for 2 weeks ending March 14. Upon re-instatement, he has again continued to violate his parole making the exact same multiple reverts as before.</p>
<p>The following diffs show recent examples of the offending behavior (multiple reverts) concerning one sentence in the Srebrenica Massacre introduction. These reverts occurred between March 19 and March 22:</p>

<dd>Unfortunately the form of article probation put in place by the Arbitration Committee does not allow direct action against disruptive editors (other than the banned 195 editor).

<dd><b>Admin note</b> Just to clarify, Ombudsman may be banned from any medically-related article he disrupts. Violations of the article ban may be enforced by blocking.

<dd>Ombudsman has also edit warred over a redirect at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">Autism epidemic</a>, and I think this comes close to going against the sense of his probation. At times he has simply removed the redirect, leaving a blank article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_epidemic&amp;diff=113515856&amp;oldid=108485875" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_epidemic&amp;diff=113515856&amp;oldid=108485875" rel="nofollow">[207]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_epidemic&amp;diff=113523229&amp;oldid=113518468" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_epidemic&amp;diff=113523229&amp;oldid=113518468" rel="nofollow">[208]</a>. He then edit warred over whether to place a rfd or afd tag to discuss deletion of that redirect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_epidemic&amp;diff=113940453&amp;oldid=113646178" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_epidemic&amp;diff=113940453&amp;oldid=113646178" rel="nofollow">[209]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_epidemic&amp;diff=113974405&amp;oldid=113967424" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_epidemic&amp;diff=113974405&amp;oldid=113967424" rel="nofollow">[210]</a>. His justification for this edit warring is "misleading link", which given that the redirect target is <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_%28incidence%29.html" title="Autism (incidence)">Autism (incidence)</a>, could justifiably be described as tendentious. A ban from that redirect/article, which he is certainly disrupting, might be in order. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 18:38, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Tony. I agree with your comments. At this time, however, the dispute over the redirect seems to have settled down. If it flares up again this can be reconsidered. It's not necessary to wait for a full blown edit war before applying an article ban to a user on probation. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:04, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
