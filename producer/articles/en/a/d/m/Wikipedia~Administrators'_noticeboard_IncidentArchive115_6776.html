<p>I've been trying for some while to keep a lid on a series of articles about <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_rapid_transit.html" title="Personal rapid transit">personal rapid transit</a> (PRT), where there is a tendency among the small community of editors to let their enthusiasm for the technology overcome what I view as the appropriate scpeticism of a technology which, after forty years, has zero installed base.</p>
<p>As part of this a cartoonist called Ken Avidor made some edits a while back as <a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvidor_6e12.html" title="User:Avidor">User:Avidor</a> in respect of the camnpaign for PRT in his town. There was apparently some good old fashioned pork-barrel politics there. Thisgs are often heated but usually civil, however at least one editor has it in for Avidor, representing him as an extremist (in the way that creators of huge articles<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UniModal&amp;oldid=57664644" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UniModal&amp;oldid=57664644" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> on <a href="../../../u/n/i/UniModal_ee4c.html" title="UniModal">non-existent products</a> are not). Apparently because I am sceptical of the claims of PRT as a widespread urban mode <i>despite its approval byu the German government</i> (which nonetheless never actually built it), I am a POV-pusher like Avidor. Ah well, I'm an evil rouge admin and I can take it.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of things in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersonal_rapid_transit_fa1d.html" title="Talk:Personal rapid transit">Talk:Personal rapid transit</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUniModal_2628.html" title="Talk:UniModal">Talk:UniModal</a> and <a href="../../../u/l/t/Talk%7EULTra_%28PRT%29_2091.html" title="Talk:ULTra (PRT)">Talk:ULTra (PRT)</a> which might be construed as attacks on <a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvidor_6e12.html" title="User:Avidor">User:Avidor</a>, who is no longer active here. He has posted to my Talk page asking if this is reasonable, I'm inclined to think not. Since I am not considered neutral by these guys (in a he who is not for me is agin me kind of way) I'd appreciate someone having a look at the comments made about Avidor on those pages.

<dd>I skimmed the pages quickly. Mostly the conflict is about figuring out what weight to give the companies' claims regarding PRT compared with independent analyses and analyses by other parties with varying degrees of involvement. I did find a number of comments (mostly on <a href="../../../u/l/t/Talk%7EULTra_%28PRT%29_2091.html" title="Talk:ULTra (PRT)">Talk:ULTra (PRT)</a>) that could be construed as personal in nature, such as <i>Avidor's positions are conspiracy theories with absolutely no verifiable basis.</i> There is a certain amount of discussion of individual editors' motives (on both sides) that doesn't have any direct bearing on article content and could probably be deleted without harming the article's development. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 19:53, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I removed some comments from <a href="../../../u/l/t/Talk%7EULTra_%28PRT%29_2091.html" title="Talk:ULTra (PRT)">Talk:ULTra (PRT)</a> that might be broadly construed as personal attacks on Avidor. Since he has not edited PRT articles since April, I think it is unfair to him to have other editors talking <i>about</i> him and comparing their conduct to his (especially when the comparison is negative to Avidor). (He is not mentioned in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUniModal_2628.html" title="Talk:UniModal">Talk:UniModal</a>, and on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersonal_rapid_transit_fa1d.html" title="Talk:Personal rapid transit">Talk:Personal rapid transit</a> he was present at the time to defend himself.) Of course, in general I think that discussing the person rather than the content of his or her edits is generally unproductive, but at least the current participants can defend themselves. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:06, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have no issue with anything you removed (and I appreciate your dispassionate assistance in this matter), but I do feel we are being a little reactionary here. When Avidor was active he regularly referred to us as "wackos", "con-artists", "cultists", and "crackpots". Nothing in what was just removed remotely approaches that. Does this have anything to do with the fact that Avidor has publicly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:WikedpediaRKB.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:WikedpediaRKB.jpg" rel="nofollow">criticized</a> Wikipedia and has joined <a href="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showuser=276" class="external text" title="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showuser=276" rel="nofollow">this forum</a>? <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 04:09, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've never heard of Avidor before today, much less his new associations. I also did not remove any comments directed to him or about him that dated to times when he was contributing and thus able to respond for himself. I just think it's poor form to make (arguably) negative comments about a user who has chosen to leave, because it forces him to either let the characterizations stand or to return against his wishes to defend himself, and I would have the same view about anyone else who has left the project. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:48, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>These personal attacks on me in the Wikipedia Talk pages appear on Google searches of my name. Wikipedia is supposed to be an Encyclopedia, not an attack-blog. If A.T.E and Freshenneez want to keep writing about me, I suggest they create a Wikipedia page on Ken Avidor that accurately presents my views. If they want to attack me, I suggest they get a free blog at Blogger like David Gow did <a href="http://innovative-transit.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://innovative-transit.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvidor_6e12.html" title="User:Avidor">Avidor</a> 04:20, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now that's just silly. Google just indexes the web; unless you propose that google not index wikipedia at all, obviously wikipedia is responsible for its own content. I think anything said about Avidor while he was an active participant should remain but it is just bad manners to badmouth someone behind their back, even in real life. If Fresheneesz had allowed the comments to remain deleted, they would have disappeared from Google the next time it indexed the site. You could try archiving all the old discussions and tagging the archive page with &lt;nofollow&gt;; I don't know for sure that will work, but it might keep google from scanning the talk archives. Short of a mutual agreement to "censor" the old discussions (in Fresheneesz' terms) I suppose the only other option is to persuade an uninvolved admin to actually delete the comments from the history. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 13:47, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My point was, the content <i>had been removed</i> (by you) and if Google still had the old content indexed then there was nothing that Wikipedia could do. <i>I was not aware</i> that Fresheneesz had re-inserted the comments.</dd>
<dd>But let me also make two additional points:
<ol>
<li>None of us could possibly know that Avidor had decided to stop editing. All we knew was that he hadn't participated in a while, and the fight that he had started was still raging between us and JzG. How were we to know he had left for good?</li>
<li>Almost everything that you removed referred to Avidor's well-documented <i>views</i> and <i>claims</i>. How is that considered a <i>personal</i> attack? We and JzG were debating Avidor's <i>positions</i>, which, by the way, are almost completely unfounded in reality. That's not a personal attack, that's stating what is verifiably <i>true</i> -- many of Avidor's claims have been shown to be innacurate or just plain false, including his most oft-repeated claim that PRT is nothing but a hoax, and its promoters, cultists and con-artists. Am I to be accused of hurling attacks for attacking someone's <i>viewpoint</i> that I'm a con-artist? <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 14:43, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I respect Kim Bruning as one of the few users left who manages to keep sane when all hell breaks loose, but I wonder quite how things are developing here. The last I was aware of the situation, the user in question was not quite able to grok the informal nature of the mediation cabal, and I (and several other users) suggested he go beat the mediation committee into shape. I saw no evidence to suggest he was a poor mediator at that time.</p>
<p>Now I see he's branded a troll and various other names under the sun, and I'm confused as to what snapped, and when. Let's all step back for a minute and remember that this is a person who's putting their patience and own sanity on the line to help resolve disputes with other users, and who now faces his peers, but is unable to proceed as would be logical for a bunch of mediators to do so. I don't want to accuse people of taking sides, but there's a hell of a lot of rapid throwing about of words here.</p>

JBolden's interactions with other users sometimes leave a lot to be desired, but the same can be said of myself, a number of trusted users on Wikipedia, and even Kim himself.

<p>Folks, an AfD nomination is not part of evidence. This is very important. If a well established article is nominated, it's going to pass. We must never block and <i>never</i> make listing AfD's as part of evidence. The fellow in question is definitely abusive and inappropriate, but when you're blocking someone you can't take their response as evidence, either. If we start demanding that the people we block be nice in return, we're essentially asking people to apologize. We are not in power here. Administrators are <i>not in charge.</i> Administrators are the executive of policy, so we don't get to demand that nasty users apologize. Is HE worth blocking? Sure. Is he disruptive? Sure. I agree with moving to a second week's block, as the user is still fighting, but then go to ArbCom. Seriously. The insulted getting revenge with blocks just leads to more and it justifies every user who claims that "administrators" are the problem. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:34, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"The insulted getting revenge with blocks just leads to more and it justifies every user who claims that 'administrators' are the problem." You are reading into my motives. I really don't appreciate that. I did the 1 week block BEFORE he called me a moron. I didn't do the indefinite block. Nor would I have. I'm ok with a 1 week block or an indefinite block.

<li>Geogre, that's nonsense. Nominating articles spuriously for AfD, when one should know better, is certainly disruptive, and just like any other act, it's something that can be used to suggest a block should occur. Responding inappropriately is similarly unacceptable. He merits a long block, and I don't think an indefinite block would be out of place. I understand there are people who have issues with authority who are out digging for things to be upset about them, but we shouldn't be afraid to do what's right for the encyclopedia just to keep such people happy. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 14:43, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Nominating spuriously for an AfD can be part of a general pattern, but one when presented in evidence at ArbCom. However, I take a very strong line on this: an AfD nomination is not evidence by itself of disruption. First, it doesn't disrupt anything, as the AfD will go away automatically. Second, "spurious" is way too open to interpretation. I've seen many people want to hang people for nominating for deletion, especially during the moronic "all schools must be kept, no matter the content of the article, and all who nominate schools for deletion are trolls who should be blocked." Secondly, though, an inappropriate response is just nastiness. This user is nasty, but an indefinite block? No. That's ArbCom territory. Personal attacks being justification? <b>Absolutely not.</b> Finally, having the offended hand out the block is simply not done. This is not according to our procedures in any way. The advantages to handing off the block are numerous. The disadvantage is one: you don't get revenge. The long history of this user makes for a compelling ArbCom case, but not solo action. There is no divine right of admins. Insulting someone else vs. one of us is alike a hand-off to someone else for handling. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:45, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think admins have divine right, nor do I think that insulting them is any more meaningful than anyone else. However, AfD for a topic that is completely within the bounds of an encyclopedia and clearly must be covered (unlike schools, which are contentious), purely for the reason that he does not like the content, is problem behaviour. The AfD was for the wrong reason, and was indeed spurious and a misuse of process. I think maybe the reasoning for an indefinite block would be a bit loose though (at least, provided the user has positive edits -- I have not checked), thanks to this discussion. Arbcom cases are generally reserved for when there is significant contention over a user's behaviour, or when the user has a long (and at least partly positive) history with the project. Admins should act, so much as possible, act as if they had no ego, thinking only of the good of the project. If Woohookitty was one of those insulted, then it probably would've been better if (s?)he had asked someone else to review the situation, blocking as appropriate. It is, however, inappropriate to assume that everytime admins make a judgement call, they must be on a power trip. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 17:45, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Improv, you and I are <i>generally</i> in agreement, but I think that ArbCom is the proper court for very long blocks and hard bans. Short of that, we're being fickle and personal. If the argument is that ArbCom is slow and creaky, then we need to find a way to speed it, but if we unilaterally act and impose anything more than a week, we're turning Wikipedia into "I think you're bad." Because I don't trust any one, I trust everyone. I am often wrong, and so are you, but together we will be wrong much less of the time. This particular user is despicable, in my opinion. I think he probably is now irredeemable. However, I don't want any one of us making that call, as it should <i>require</i> many of us together to make it. If it isn't via ArbCom, it has to be via something beyond the individual administrator. I agree that admins have to act within their judgment in the interest of the project, but that judgment ought to be "Wow, this person needs to be examined by the community so that the community can speak." Traditionally, that has been via RFaR. If ArbCom is broken, we need a new fix, but when water flows around an obstruction in the stream, the result isn't always the <i>best</i> one. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:50, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I think most of all it's the indefinite (which should be rare, handed out by ArbCom, and done <i>after</i> consensus, not before) and then the reasoning -- that he was nasty. NPA is not policy, and blocking for it should never short circuit all our rules, as it makes admins the lords and masters of the personalities on Wikipedia. We don't get to do that. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:45, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wrong on all counts. Admins <i>do</i> have the power to block people indefinitely, and they do so every day. If every single disruptive editor went before the ArbCom, we would need perhaps ten times as many arbitrators as we have now. <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> is a <i>policy</i>, not a guideline; it's unbelievable that you, Geogre, keep claiming that it's a guideline even after it was demonstrated to you during the discussion of the previous indefinite block of His excellency that it was a policy. His excellency seems to have concluded from his previous indefinite block by Tom Harrison and the subsequent unblock by Bishonen that he has a blank check to do what he pleases; this case will only reinforce his conviction.

<li>You are misreading a vast amount. It is not a policy in blocking. Read it again. Its policy force is, "It is our policy not to insult people." If indefinite blocks are going on every day, and if they're going on for personal attacks, then every one of those is out of process. In fact, if you read carefully, you'll see that they are <i>not</i> handed out individually for insults, and people are broadening, inappropriately, the "community patience" blocks. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:50, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>George, NPA is indeed policy. If you don't think it should be, maybe you should try to change it. Woohookitty blocked for a week, which you seem to agree (now) is appropriate. Jeffrey O. Gustafson extended the block to indefinite. Woohookitty took it back to one week. So in a week he can come back. I think an indefinite block is appropriate; that's what I gave him before. Based on past experience, when he comes back he'll spew more vitriol. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 17:30, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no objection to a week. I agree that he's awful, and I think that he should be RFaR'd. What I don't agree with it indefinite blocking for insulting language. NPA is a policy that says it is our policy not to attack. Note that there are no sanctions there. Note also that the proper course of action specified is the <i>removal of the insult to an archived location</i> with a placeholder saying where it went. Not blocking forever. I think this user should be gone, but not by unilateral action. It should be a slam dunk, fast ArbCom case, if ArbCom is meeting quickly. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:50, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is my take... nobody is claiming that a single AfD in and of itself is disruption. But in combination with all his other disruption, and his clearly bad-faith misreading of AfD policy, it's a large strike against him. And as of yet I've seen only marginal evidence that H.E. is attempting to make productive edits. Within the past week to <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> alone he has blanked material against consensus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dhimmi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60844343" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dhimmi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60844343" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, quote-dumped against <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> policy (with no references to boot) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dhimmi&amp;diff=60669448&amp;oldid=60317754" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dhimmi&amp;diff=60669448&amp;oldid=60317754" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, added material using blatantly unreliable sources <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dhimmi&amp;diff=60794185&amp;oldid=60754560" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dhimmi&amp;diff=60794185&amp;oldid=60754560" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, and repeatedly re-restored examples of such after being reverted and chastised by other editors. Is he capable of contributing? Who knows. Combined with his dozens of personal attacks, racist statements, etc., I would say he's clearly exhausted the community's patience.

<dd>That's all I've been saying. I even think that you're right that this AfD was not the action, but rather the continuation of an action, that is evidentiary. However, I don't want any hint of a rumor of a whisper of a precedent set for blocking anyone for making an AfD, no matter how absurd or peevish it is.

Point is, I can see no comparison to the edit you linked with the one in which Brooklyn reverts polite messages I post on his talk page and uses the edit summary of "delete garbage written by sick fuck".--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 13:14, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Guys, calm down. The fact is, MONGO came here instead of unilaterally blocking CB Brooklyn. Let's not used this demonstration of <i>responsibility</i> on MONGO's part as an opportunity to criticize him. It's a bit odd, frankly, that a side conversation about a completely uninvolved editor is being brought into this discussion. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 15:34, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree strongly with JD. MONGO was asked not to impliment even obvious blocks against these users. Instead of using his tools in this instance, he did EXACTLY what he was told to do by his RFC - he was told to come here and present his case. He did. As such, he deserves praise for his appropriately changed behavior, not CBD going back to edits from just after the RFC was filed. If you, CBD, had wanted to block him for his edit on the 26th, you would have. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 21:22, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Without commenting on this specifically, if we could as admins, all begin to <i>demonstrate</i> civil behavior it would be easier for us to <i>enforce</i> civil behavior. Any time we use words like "troll" or "idiot" we're mostly doing so out of laziness. It's simply not helpful, is not required, and almost always results in pointless discussion. Use polite and precise language wherever possible, things will go smoother.,<br />

<dd>For whatever my opinion as a non-admin is worth, everybody who has posted in this section has made a valid point. It probably deserves bearing in mind that everyone here has been engaged in a necessary, but very unpleasant excercise over the last couple of days. Therefore it is only natural that not everyone behaves the way they would like themselves to. I agree with the block, and I agree with Mongo referring it first. I also agree that comments on the block should not be made in the same nature as the reason for the block in the first place. In Mongo's defense, it would be hard for me not to be upset if edit summaries such the ones mentioned were directed at me. I'm taking an interest here because I would like it if we could edit articles without having to fight each other all the time. In my opinion, the articles would improve a lot better and faster if we didn't have to spend so much energy on conflict or resolution. I know that there are real issues involved in what should legitimately be included in the 9/11 articles, which naturally make for disagreements to arise, but please let's not try to be provocative with each other about it. I say that to all parties involved. I like to try and improve articles with whatever I might be able to contribute. I find it fun, educating, and challenging, but this kind of stuff makes it a lot harder for all of us when we spend our time on fisticuffs and what not instead of some nice writing or research or even just sharing some good information with each other. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeenaR_f426.html" title="User:SkeenaR">SkeenaR</a> 06:32, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no problem with a little name calling as I do on occasion have a sense of humor, and CB Brooklyns edit summaries are less offensive than some I have seen. I am familiar with his other posts from elsewhere, and they show a similar temperment, but saw no reason to drag all that out...I wasn't even asking for a block if he would abstain from this manner of conversation, so all I was doing was requesting a neutral third party to step in, since his responses to my requests were simply becoming worse, not better. I do agree with the block, however. I also agree that all of us involved in the disagreements on the 9/11 articles, myself included, could tone things down a lot.

<dd>GNAA Folk, as Lapinmies is just another in a long list of those who have or had a presence on Wikipedia, have a habit of intentionally inflammatory and bizarre userpages that have frequently shown, at the very least, a lack of interest in harmonious participation in the project. This is a matter of fact, holding from the various incarnations of SPUI (an otherwise good editor in modern times who, apart from some current disputes, does not push things *too* far) to GNAA Timecop and the various other now permabanned members of the club.

<dd>Because the quotation was from over two weeks ago and the discussion here ended three days ago. There's a time factor here. The point of this board is to spot ongoing incidents so that they can be dealt with and the project of writing an encyclopedia can commence. If JzG posted a fifteen-day-old link to you saying you were going to <a href="../../../n/c/r/WP%7ENCR_b989.html" title="WP:NCR">climb the Reichstag while dressed like Spider-Man</a>, I'd probably wonder why he was bringing up an old issue. Hypothetically, if in the future he says not-nice things to you, I'd suggest you ask him about it on his talk page, and if he is still rude to you, then at that point, bringing it here would be more warranted. My apologies for using the term "mudslinging"; it was poorly chosen. Again, my comments are about the timing, and not the content, of your grievance here. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 06:30, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How easy it has to claim that somebody "has been <b>systematically</b> changing Persian to something else". Please check my contribution history. I've edited the articles which the above editor/admin considers as Persian only once. The above post also reflects the obsession of some editors to label or insert Persian into as many articles as possible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=ManiF" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=ManiF" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Tajik" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Tajik" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, which is quite problematic, especially when one edits articles with such nationalistic views that creates biases. 24.211.192.250 10:17, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User RandomCritic has posted a request for arbitration with respect to his claims that I have harassed him and revealed personal information about him. He has failed to substantiate these allegations in a convincing manner and I note that his request for arbitration looks as though it will be rejected. I would therefore like to bring the following selection of recent comments made by user RandomCritic to administrator attention on account of their incivility, defamatory nature and other infringments of Wikipedia policy. (I am sorry I have to quote all these verbatim as I am not sure how to make short-cut links to them.)</p>
<p>Posted to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnatta_e505.html" title="Talk:Anatta">Talk:Anatta</a>: With reference to another user:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>I have no doubt and no hesitation in saying that you are completely unqualified as a Pali translator</i>". RandomCritic 03:47, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>and</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>And you advertise yourself as a Pali scholar? Or any sort of scholar?"</i> RandomCritic 06:30, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>and</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>You consistently use bad translations, because you don't know enough Pali to tell a good translation from a bad. ...... You could try learning Pali if you don't want to face continued embarrassment."</i> [RandomCritic] 06:30, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>and</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>I have no doubt and no hesitation in saying that you are completely unqualified as a Pali translator. There is a special word for someone who claims qualifications he utterly lacks, but I believe it would be impolitic of me to use it here</i>". RandomCritic 06:30, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then, with reference to myself:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>If you do not know Pali, then you had no grounds for endorsing his "translations", and my linguistic explanations will make no sense to you. I can only suggest that you study the language for yourself, in that case .... I appreciate your offer to rewrite the page, however, I have concerns about your ability to present a neutral point of view, as I understand you are not a disinterested party. I don't think there is any reason for you to rush</i>". RandomCritic 21:11, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>and</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Hodge: I cannot and do not estimate any person based on their own claims of their talents or abilities: only by what they themselves exhibit and what I can myself double-check. .... But I ask you, assuming some small dose of knowledge on your part</i>" RandomCritic 10:59, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Additionally in the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Talk%7EBuddhism_ef41.html" title="Talk:Buddhism">Talk:Buddhism</a> page, <a href="../../../v/a/p/User%7EVapour_251e.html" title="User:Vapour">Vapour</a> claims, sometime prior to the 19th June 2006:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Dr Tony Page, aka TonyMPNS run a website in corraboration with Stephen Hodge</i>".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To which user TonyMPNS replied later that day,</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Stephen Hodge does not run the "Nirvana Sutra" website with me - I do</i>."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>And I also replied,</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Of course, I know Dr Page personally, value his friendship and have produced translations for him on a professional, contractual basis, that he has reproduced on his website -- a website in which I have no direct involvement whatsoever."</i> Stephen Hodge 16:46, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Nevertheless, RandomCritic persists in claiming in a posting to user <a href="../../../v/a/p/Vapour.html" title="Vapour">Vapour</a>'s UserTalk, with the intention of implying that there is some form of cabal in play, that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>both Page and Hodge are co-creators of the Parinirvana Sutra site listed in the External Links list.</i> " RandomCritic 05:27, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I then posted a message to this RandomCritic's UserTalk page, beginning:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>You said in a message to User Vapour's talk page, that "both Page and Hodge are co-creators of the Parinirvana Sutra site". I am categorically not a co-creator and I have nothing whatsoever to do with it, beyond the fact that Dr Page uses material he has paid me to translate for him. Would you please retract that statement</i>&#160;?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I followed, unwisely in retrospect, this with what was intended as a humourous riposte, alluding to a certain user of a children's art website which I never assumed or believed was actually this user RandomCritic, who has indeed also subsequently confirmed is not connected with he/she/it.</p>
<p>However, I received this message on my Usertalk from RandomCritic:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>I pity whatever poor person you have me confused with when you start sending her (or him) hatemail. You really don't have it together, Hodge. I recommend a vacation."</i> RandomCritic 12:15, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This allegation is repeated by implication is RandomCritic's request for arbitration, <b>with absolutely no corroborative or substantiating evidence</b>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>I am concerned that User:Stephen Hodge's message may lead, or may have already led, to harassment of the person he has incorrectly identified as me.</i> RandomCritic 14:49, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The above two sets of remarks are vicious, defamatory and obviously more serious in nature than any supposed actions on my part with respect to RandomCritic, given that my real-life identity is transparent.</p>
<p>I request that RandomCritic be urged to withdraw these statements and apologize.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 22:38, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>About a week ago or so, I had a debate with <a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">User:Wiarthurhu</a> about whether the <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Premier_6b3b.html" title="Eagle Premier">Eagle Premier</a> was the successor to the <a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Matador_f13f.html" title="AMC Matador">AMC Matador</a>. He got angry with me and claimed that I was intentionally removing information, when in fact I was removing his claims because they were unsourced. I told him to show his sources, and the sources he gave didn't say anything about his claims. I then brought the issue up to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Automobiles_13cd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Automobiles">WikiProject:Automobiles</a>, where the debate was ended in my favor. During the dispute, however, he used two IP addresses to revert my changes and used one of them to attack me, calling me a "menace" and a "nuisance". He also accused me and User:Bravada of vandalism on the <a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Eagle_100a.html" title="AMC Eagle">AMC Eagle</a> page, when we had no such intent. Recently, he left me some nasty comments on my talk page, which I removed, but he still won't back down on personally attacking me. He also claims that I "damaged" the AMC Matador article after I performed some requested cleanup work from <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">User:SteveBaker</a>.</p>
<p>The same user was also involved in a dispute with <a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">User:Mmx1</a> about the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-14_Tomcat_c28a.html" title="F-14 Tomcat">F-14 Tomcat</a> article, in which Wiathurhu exhibted similar behavior. He's also used his own user page and the requests for meditation board to launch personal attacks against Mmx1. Me and Mmx1 have tried reporting him to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_alerts_4982.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts">Wikiquette alerts</a>, but we have not gotten a response yet.

(If my block was unjustified please say so.)</p>
<p>On anotehr note the user pastes large chunks of texts from other sites and his response to me says it's okay because other sites paste chunks of Wikipedia. I am not sure if he is saying that Wikipedia was the original source for the other articles online or what... but, in any case they aren't neutral and add nothing. He has also uploaded images with {{book cover}} that clearly aren't book covers. I just want to know how admins think I should procede with this... block for longer if he continues? undo the block now? revert all of the bint -&gt; binte? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 06:49, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems fine to me. As for other sites copying content that he wrote, that is unlikely if it was discovered quickly. If I understand correctly and assuming the potential copyvio was found throught Google, Wikipedia's database dump has to be updated to include the edit, then the site has to update their copy of Wikipedia and then they have to wait for Google to come around and index their site again. Depending how frequently we update our database (it has not been updated since mid-May) and when Google last indexed their site (and whether it is one of the sites they index frequently or not), it might take several days or up to several months for this to happen. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:22, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I support the block. Copying large blocks of text from other web sites isn't acceptable; if he's had that explained to him and continues to do it, yeah, he should be blocked for it. Similarly, if he's using the wrong tags on uploaded images, especially clearly copyrighted ones, he needs to have the policy explained and potentially be blocked. I would revert all the bint/binte changes and encourage him to start a discussion on a relevant page or relevant pages to try to build clear consensus for the moves. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 16:47, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it possible to remove a vandalism warning from my account - I'll be honest it irks me to know that people with vandal proof will see that I have a warning for what I consider 1)acting in good faith and 2) in line with Wikipedia guidelines.</p>
<p>I removed a Vandalproof logo from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Abdelkweli" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Abdelkweli" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Abdelkweli</a> . This was after it came to my attention that his page contained mainly fictional awards and seemed to be copied wholesale from another user. I left a message on his userpage asking if he required assistance setting up his userpage and also suggesting that he removed both the Vandalproof logo and one that said he had 2,500 edits (he had about 100 mostly to his own userpage). After no response I then removed the vandalproof logo with a clear edit reason to explain why. In return he placed a vandalism warning on my userpage. As I mentioned I feel I acted both in good faith and inline with Wikipedia guidance. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 09:52, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The answer is "of course," at least from my point of view. If you had been accused of an article vandalism, the matter would need to rest for longer. Since it's a questionable author's questionable page that you changed, it seems kosher to me to remove the warning. New and bad users like to use the word "vandal," and this one used the template. No difference. (At the same time, I did see, on your talk page, some (inadvertent, I hope?) overly tight vandal locks on some pages. I assume that you're living and learning and not intentionally locking down pages. (Syd could have played <i>both,</i> of course.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:08, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes - in getting the hang of vandalproof I have been a bit on the tight side - in that incident, I want straight to the user's page and explained that I HAD been overly tight and that he should re-write the text as he felt fit (I also left a welcome and suggested that he got a user-id because it would make future conversation easier). --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 13:38, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can further see the mess they have created on the talk page. First they challenged the foundation of everything in the template. When given reasons, they in a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> broadly attempted to rework the entire page, changing events to actions so they can list everything they feel belongs in the template without discussing with anyone.

The template listed only events and leaders.

<p>How is referring to the articles and their references not providing evidence? Clearly what this user wants is that I go to these articles copyedit the txt and refernces and place it on the talk page. However, he is old and wise enough to do that himself. His elaborate writings prove he is capable of reading himself and does not need me to copyedit the relevant text. <font color="green"><a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a></font><sup><i><font color="blue"><small><a href="../../../n/e/s/User_talk%7ENescio_071f.html" title="User talk:Nescio">Gnothi seauton</a></small></font></i></sup> 13:22, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is not an incident requiring administrator intervention. This is an ongoing content dispute and personal conflict requiring mediation, patience, and hot tea.
