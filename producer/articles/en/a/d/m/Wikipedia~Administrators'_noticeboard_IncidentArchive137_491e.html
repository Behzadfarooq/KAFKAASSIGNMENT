<dd>What am I supposed to have done now. Despite being warned to stay off my talk page, Askolnick has immediately posted a bogus warning threatening me with a block for edit-warring when all I did was perform a serious piece of editing on an article I have worked on far longer, and harder, than he has. The previous block was for abuse that was the result of the constant abuse I have had to suffer at askolnick's hands (i.e., having my sobriety questioned and being called a liar on numerous occassions, attacks which you, Bishonen, refused to acknowledge existed even though I provided links). I have served my ban and I take it I am now allowed to continue editing Wiki. If you look at my edits since the ban you will see that I have made several excellent contributions to a number of featured articles - if askolnick has not engaged in any more wikistalking they might even still be there now. I regard the constant posting of warnings on my talk page by askolnick, and the constant claims that I am merely being disruptive rather than (for the majority of time before snapping under the harrassment, stalking and abuse) genuinely trying to improve the articles on Wiki.</dd>
<dd>The fact is that Askolnick is abusing almost everyone who disgrees with him on almost every page he is editing, and you seem to be doing little more than simply backing him up.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavkal_758b.html" title="User:Davkal">Davkal</a> 20:19, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So, would somebody like to click on the links and evaluate my claims and those of Davkal? The claim that Askolnick is "abusing almost everyone who disagrees with him on almost every page he is editing" ought to be easy, for instance--<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Askolnick" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Askolnick" rel="nofollow">here</a> are Askolnick's contributions. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 20:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Davkal says, "Askolnick has immediately posted a bogus warning threatening me with a block for edit-warring when all I did was perform a serious piece of editing on <a href="../../../c/s/i/CSICOP_c20d.html" title="CSICOP">CSICOP</a>..." All Davkal did was to resume the edit war he was conducting before his week-long block. After he reverted the same material he disagrees with two or three times in the same day, I posted a warning on his talk page. That so-called "bogus" warning apparently worked: He stopped before making a fourth reversion and getting himself blocked again. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 14:24, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You should probably also note that the outcome of one of my outrageous, edit-warring, disruptive edits on the CSICOP page (I only made two changes) has been retained by Askolnick virtually intact. Perhaps Bishonen could also explain why she felt it was OK for Askolnick to say:</p>
<p>"Lincoln implied that the whisky Gen. Grant drank gave him a winning general. Perhaps it will also improve Davkal's arguments. I doubt it could make them much worse. How could any sober person read what I've written above and claim that…", and</p>
<p>“In this statement, Davkal crosses the bondary [sic] between mistatement and outright lie.”</p>
<p>The NPA rules stating clearly that comments should be on content rather than the editor. Perhaps if askolnick had been told to desist or tone down, or at least not encouraged to continue, making such comments then the whole business could have been averted.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavkal_758b.html" title="User:Davkal">Davkal</a> 21:24, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Davkal, please show where Bishonen said she "felt it was OK for Askolnick to say" that. I never saw such a statement from her. Are you making this up, or did I miss it? BTW, you keep quoting this out of context. That was my reply to your announcement that you were "off to the pub" for the evening. You brought your going drinking into the discussion. Even if my attempt at humor was over the line, you can hardly use it to justify your own frequent and egregious misconduct - such as calling editors and administrators "Fuckos, "pricks and prickesses," calling an administrator someone's "meatpuppet" and suggesting that she get herself sexually serviced for her meatpuppeting. Nor can you use it to justify your repeated edit wars. You have been blocked three times for violating 3RR. And if you hadn't heeded my "bogus warning" on your talk page, it would likely be four blocks now.<a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 14:24, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>She made it clear she thought it was OK by first claiming the warnings were bogus and unsubstantiated. When I provided the direct quotes (above) and others, she asked for context, and when context was provided she said "feel free to remove" the warnings. The simple fact is that you implied I was a drunk and stated clearly that no sober person could think what I thought (this is abuse) and you called me a liar on several occassions (that is also abuse). The fact that despite knowing all this, Bishonen simply said you could remove the warnings, in that respect she is clearly supporting what you said. That is what led me to claim that in some respects she is your administrative meatpuppet.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavkal_758b.html" title="User:Davkal">Davkal</a> 17:16, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Davkal. I knew you couldn't show where Bishonen said she "felt it was OK for Askolnick to say" personal attacks. I knew you made up that accusation. Thanks for the confirmation. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 03:43, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just have shown it clearly. The fact that you are inserting quotation marks and asking me to find just those words (the quotation marks are yours and yours alone!) is neither here nor there. It is a perfectly straightforward point that in saying "feel free to remove the warnings" Bishonen is saying that you are entitled to call me a drunk and a liar - she is wrong, you are not! <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavkal_758b.html" title="User:Davkal">Davkal</a> 11:45, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you claiming that the cultural reference "yuppie" is equivalent to a race, religion, nationality, gender, or other group that should be protected from discrimination? I think your comparison is an unfair distortion. Also, I find it hard to believe that there's a plot cooking here to do something nasty to yuppies - like rip off all the alligators from their sport shirts - let alone murder them. BTW, the verb "die" does not mean "kill." People who tell others to die may not be nice people, but they aren't making death threats. While I wouldn't care to defend this username against charges of bad taste, I don't think it is overly offensive or a threat. I know it may kill some people here to know that not every reference to killing or dying is meant to be taking literally. I'm deadly serious about this.

<dd>Ok, I was missing the fact that he's been editing for days. The block log doesn't show any unblocks - the two indefinite blocks must have conflicted. Yes, it's an obviously inappropriate username, and he should be blocked if he doesn't request a username change within 48 hours.

<p>As I am not an administrator, I have no ability to review the contents of the now-former user page to see if they were inappropriate. I would like to request independent administrator review of the former contents of the userpage, which I cannot see, and comments on whether an indef block without warning was appropriate response for this user.</p>

<dd>I replied on the mailing list. As Kelly Martin indicated on Tao Ching's talk page, the user has been here for two years but his only edits are to his User page. In fact, he has made one edit to a User's Talk page, two vandalistic edits, and one addition of an external link to articles in those two years. But in the meantime, he's made over 500 edits to his User page. I think the block and blanking are appropriate. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 23:43, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The blanking may be appropriate, although the ban could be lifted if the user expresses an interest in contributing, and a warning certainly wouldn't have done any harm (I can't see the deleted material either so I have no idea whether one was given or not). However, as I understand it the deleted material is available to administrators, so perhaps it should be restored for a couple of days or otherwise made available to the user so that he has an opportunity to print it out or copy it before he loses a large quantity of work, whether for articles here or anything else. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:48, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If the deleted material is at all reasonable (of course I haven't seen it), that might be coupled with an offer to lift the ban if the user committed to doing some work on the encyclopedia, which I agree 100% is what the project is about. I also suggest that if this situation arises in the future, a warning be given -- if only to give the user an opportunity to download or print out the material himself or herself, thus saving an admin the trouble of doing so. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 00:00, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Having looked at the deleted material, it didn't strike me as remotely bloglike. Most of it seemed to be the common sort of stuff one finds on most user pages: quotes, opinions, links, a self-description, a list of articles to edit and/or read. The only possibly objectionable aspect is simply that there's so much of it, far more than would be found on most user pages. It's a bit of a toss-up whether this violates user page policy or not (as I said, it's essentially typical user page stuff, just in greater quantity), but in any case I don't think it warrants a block. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 01:39, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is presently a dispute over this page (and a few related ones) between a group of people who think voting is inappropriate on Wikipedia and, well, evil, and a group who believe voting is an essential part of our community and a prime way of gauging consensus.</p>
<p>Being part of the former group, I believe we should make very clear that voting is not a good way to resolve (most) things (e.g. AFD/RFA is not vote). A good way to do that seems to be to mark <a href="../../../v/i/e/WP%7EVIE_cf5b.html" title="WP:VIE">WP:VIE</a> as {{<a href="../../../g/u/i/Template%7EGuideline_29bd.html" title="Template:Guideline">guideline</a>}} or even {{<a href="../../../p/o/l/Template%7EPolicy_c4c2.html" title="Template:Policy">policy</a>}} and possibly making it less tongue-in-cheek; in my experience novice editors are not generally swayed by pages not perceived as "official" (which is another can of worms, but anyway).</p>
<p>The "other" party appears to be pushing for votes on a variety of proposed guidelines, and seems to be under the impression that AFD is in fact a vote - but I may be misunderstanding them, of course. I'm mentioning this here because this seems the best way of reaching a group of experienced users familiar with "the wiki way". I would appreciate reactions on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVoting_is_evil_cfc3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Voting is evil">Wikipedia talk:Voting is evil</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 16:29, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At least rename it... calling concepts you don't like (and by extension, the people who support them) evil as a <b>policy</b> is horrible. Though personally I think voting scales a lot better than the vague concept of whoever wins the discussion is right, since that often just comes down to who has more political leverage and friends in high places. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 17:46, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem with converting <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVoting_is_evil_8af3.html" title="Wikipedia:Voting is evil">Wikipedia:Voting is evil</a> into a guideline is that this essay doesn't actually reflect consensus -- it promotes the fairly uncommon view that votes are almost always a bad idea in nearly every situation, and that the number of editors endorsing various views should almost never be a consideration in determining the existence of consensus. Actually, we have enacted policies as a result of votes -- see <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_ratification_vote_b5a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy ratification vote">Wikipedia:Arbitration policy ratification vote</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_enforcement_20b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule enforcement">Wikipedia:Three revert rule enforcement</a>. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_385d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship">Requests for adminship</a> may not be votes in a formal sense; however, the RFA page does state that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The numbers of people supporting, opposing, or expressing another opinion on a candidacy are a significant factor in determining consensus (few RFAs succeed with less than 75% support)...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>XFD discussions are almost always votes in practice -- very rarely are pages deleted against the wishes of a majority of established editors who recommend keeping them. Instead of adopting blanket pronouncements like "voting is evil" as guidelines or policy, we should rely on the more nuanced, more balanced description of consensus in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> to define consensus. One important consideration that is missing from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a>, however, is that to the extent that supermajority opinion is used as a measure of consensus, we are only concerned with the opinions of established editors -- considering comments by new and unregistered users in determining a supermajority would create an unacceptable risk of sockpuppetry. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 18:19, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not know if we'll be able to come to an agreement on whether decisions should be made, by voting, consensus, determining the best argument or any other method. The main problem with voting is that a position that is clearly wrong by those who are informed about the issue and/or wrong according to policy/guidelines can come out on top. Other problems are the use of sockpuppets, meatpuppets and vote stacking.</p>
<p>Consensus is no better, as we often do not come to consensus, so either nothing gets done or someone (or a couple of people) forces the issue without a consensus. Sometimes it does not matter much if anything gets decided, but sometimes it is an important issue that needs to be settled. I think the things that are the greatest causes of the failure to gain consensus are editors' perfectionism (they will not agree to a plan that is not perfect) and inability to compromise. Finally, there is the problem with determining a consensus, which in practice is usually voting with reasoning given, like AfD, RM, RfA and arbitrator elections. This gives consensus the same problems as voting. On talk pages, it is even worse. A few people have an argument, often not coming to a consensus despite claims to the contrary, and the policy, article or whatever gets changed on the basis of a few people who did not even agree on a course of action.</p>
<p>Determining the best argument is also problematic, as it is not always clear which one is the best and their are other factors that are important. A bigger problem is that the closer often has a bias, sometimes an extreme one. This is a big problem for all forms of decision making, but it is devastating when using the best argument method. Some admins have such strong feelings on how things should be, and inabilities to put them aside, that they should not be closing any discussions. Good admins go against consensus or act when there is no consensus when necessary, but these admins do it frequently. Also, they get into frequent, heated arguments on their talk page, the talk pages of other users, the Administrators Noticeboard and this page. Finally, you'll find uncivil remarks and sometimes even swearing in their comments and especially in their edit summaries. Unfortunately, some of the worst admins have been around for a long time, making the amount of damage they've done and the high-placed supporters they have greater. Perhaps RfA was less rigorous than in the last 18 months or so or they have gotten frustrated and/or crazy over the years, although some bad ones still slip through these days (many long-time admins are exemplary, too). Some new and old ones may have just behaved themselves until they became admins, as well.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to consider everything that you can. Use a poll with reasoning given for votes, check out the relevant policies and guidelines, read any discussions that have taken place, weigh the arguments on each side and do additional research if necessary. Then, put your own feelings aside and make the best decision that you can. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:59, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It appears that the primacy of their edits are to <b>each other's user talk page</b>. I can say that there are some problems in this. Clinevol98's last article edit was in August and BigT27 has only made one article space edit in September; and before that it was only in July. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 21:30, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I find it odd that one can have only 1000 edits, nearly 600 of which are solely user talk space edits (Clinevol98), while the other has nearly 900 user talk edits out of 2500, all of which are to each other. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 23:11, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looks like they found each other after an editor noticed a good article on a subject he's interested in and contacted the other editor to congratulate. Is there anything weird about that?

<dd>I'm not sure, but I note that there is only one time one of them has edited the other's talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKomdori&amp;diff=64590077&amp;oldid=64575588" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKomdori&amp;diff=64590077&amp;oldid=64575588" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This might make it seem like sockpuppeting is going on and they neglected to realize that two independent editors who had this much similarity would talk to each other more often. On the other hand, that one dif shows that if they are socks they realized that at minimum in which case that would mean the user realized they would need to talk to each other but only did it with precisely one dif?

<p><a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront_%28website%29.html" title="Stormfront (website)">Stormfront</a> is an article about a neo-nazi hate iste. We have an admin who is enforcing a absolute ban on referencing the site in question. It's not a question of reliability, the text and the reference aren't themselves being disputed by anyone. Instead, the references are being commented out, so that Wikipedia doesn't inadvertantly promote the hate-site or increase its Google pagerank.</p>
<p>This troubles me for a couple of reasons. For one, it seems like we're only doing this because we on Wikipedia don't like the content of the speech that is contained on the hate cite. For two, it seems like this is a tad beyond the powers of an admin-- even if commenting out controversial references SHOULD be policy, as of now, it ISN'T policy. The admin doesn't cite any precedent for this sort of "accept the validity of the reference, but insisting on commenting it out" policy. In contrast, it seems to contradict <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Partisan.2C_religious_and_extremist_websites" title="WP:RS">the section of Reliable Sources</a> which explicitly allows citing hate groups in some cases, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a> also seems to imply we shouldn't comment out citations, so long as we don't have any reliability or other concerns about the citation.</p>
<p>The discussions on-going about this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stormfront_%28website%29#Massive_Removal_of_Citations" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stormfront_%28website%29#Massive_Removal_of_Citations" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29#Should_we_have_a_blanket_prohibition_against_referencing_hate_sites.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29#Should_we_have_a_blanket_prohibition_against_referencing_hate_sites.3F" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> tend to be generally disapproving of this policy, but since most of the commentors aren't admins, perhaps our opinions carry less weight. What do people think? Is it currently / should it be Wikipedia policy to accept hate site citations but comment them out? --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 04:09, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm confused. If the problem is pagerank inflation, why not just leave the URLs in the references as plain text? <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 04:33, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An excellent question. But more than that-- since when do we care what effect our articles have on pageranks? Obviously, we should guard against the intentional manipulation of articles explicitly for the purpose of pagerank inflation, but we shouldn't prohibit references when they are valid. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 05:23, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kdbuffalo has been removing content from the article. The content that is contested could use a little work in a few areas, but it is not too biased or obviously nonsensical. The only significant problem I see is a lack of sources other than Bible verses. However, some things are just common sense or clear from the Bible passage and citing them would clog the article. For example, we do not need a source to tell us that California is part of the United States. However, only things that are universally believed, with the exception of crackpots, should be uncited. I think that people should stop reverting and take it to the talk page. Also, reliable sources should be found for the controversial stuff. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 13:38, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd be a little worried about the effect on longstanding non-admins reverting page move vandalism. Semi-protection, however, IMHO, would be a great idea.

<p>This <i>Goldenlines anon</i> (apparently geolocated somewhere in Israel) dropped by my <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">user talk page</a> apparently to repeat his claim at <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_desk_5342.html" title="Wikipedia:Help desk">Wikipedia:Help desk</a> that he has inserted the word "p***s" in (apparently ) Hebrew into a "technical term" in an (un-named) article on philosophy which he boasts has gone unreverted for months. At least that is how I interpret this, since he has pointedly refused to name the article in question and now he explicitly refuses to revert this silly vandalism, saying that he wants to see how long it takes the WP community to find it! Sorry I can't tell you more, just thought you all should know. I've asked this anon (vandal?) not to return to my user talk pages and would appreciate some help if he should ignore this request.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 19:34, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Careful examination of user contributions says you are a liar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> At no point did I claim that <b>I</b> had inserted the word 'penis' in any article, contrary to your assertions. And to say that I repeated this claim is a double lie.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>2.</b> By using the word 'boast' you imply that I am the vandal. That is a lie - I am not the vandal and I did not boast.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>3.</b> Since when refusal to edit an article is a crime? Does it go against any rules?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>4.</b> You have wrongly interpreted my refusal to name the article in question. The real reason is clear - you would immediately edit the article and spoil my watching it for a natural correction span.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, to sum it up - your report is abusive (there is nothing to report), insultive (you actually called me a vandal by saying that I made claims of inserting an obscenity in unknown article) and hysterical (you call for help in defending your user page <b>before</b> anything bad was done to it. I respect your wish to ban me from your talk page. I hope you will excuse me for placing one last notice on it pointing to this answer. 212.199.22.28 04:57, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One user is trying to insert the notion that Orkney has a special identity separate from the Scottish one and has been adding information regarding that to relevant articles. The user has also created stubs, categories and a portal to deal with Orkney subjects. The other user is asserting that Orkney is not any more different from the rest of Scotland than any other part of Scotland and has been removing such information from relevant articles and requesting the stub-templates and so on to be deleted. I think that is the core of this problem. In the process both users may have stepped over the line. The hows, ifs and whens need to be determined, proper guidance need to be given to the users and a permanent solution to the core dispute needs to be found. The articles involved are so low profile that it seems to be very difficult for the few users involved to get there on their own. <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EInge_1e43.html" title="User:Inge">Inge</a> 13:07, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the Orcadian users are claiming that Orkney is not a part of Scotland, but that the people who live there share an identity as Orcadians and that that identity is more or less considered separate from being Scottish. I don't think I am quite able to convey that situation acurately, but I would like to inform that I have the personal opinion that Orkney (and Shetland) claims of being different does have some creedence. They are not just another area of Scotland (allthough they are very much politically and legally part of that country) and history, geneaology and (former) linguistics back that up. But that really isn't the issue right now&#160;:) <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EInge_1e43.html" title="User:Inge">Inge</a> 22:48, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comming back to the immediate issue, rather than the underlying problem...</p>
<p>One thing that needs to stop is the constant reverting an readding of Orkadian's comment on various talk pages. While the comment is not about the articles themself it's not worth getting into an edit war about. However the comment needs to be kept out of the article and category namespace and Orkadian has not readded them since I pointed this out. I'll pass on commenting on the comment itself...</p>
<p>I'm disappointed that Orkadian/Maillimak are not making any constructive edits. After this is an encyclopedia - and writting it is our goal, if you're just here to dick around with turf wars then...</p>
<p>I'm not convinced Orkadian and Maillimak are a single person, but if it is two people they're acting in close cooperation. I'll keep an eye on things, but i'm as busy as ever and back travelling tomorrow...

<dd>I think the user(s) were initially trying to make constructive edits, but were over-enthusiastic and were then frustrated by Mais Oui!'s uncharacteristic objection to petty regionalism.

Orkney does have a quite different history to the rest of Scotland, and Mais Oui!'s "just a council area" stance really doesn't do that justice. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 14:49, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mallimak is not blocked, I am at a looss to understand why he would use sockpuppets, but there is not much doubt in my mind that Orkadian and Gruelliebelkie are either sockpuppets or meatpuppets. That said, Mais Oui! is unquestionably prone to strong opinions and there is not a great deal of evidence of these disputants making any real attempt to find common ground. Any RfC should be a joint one, and should be called something like "Orkneys islands" rather than singling out one side or the other, there being evident fault on both. On the practical level I don't see that there are so many articles on the Orkneys as to make a separate portal necessary or desirable, but if people want to have one and link it from the Scotland portal then I don't really see how that would violate policy, since Orkadians unquestionably do have a separate identity at some level. Not that we are here to Right Great Wrongs, but I don't see any neutrality issue in dealing with the Orkneys as thematic set of articles. This is, of course, a superficial view. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 12:11, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am glad to see that there are some people here who have recognised what is going on. At the beginning I had so much to offer Wikipedia, and I made a start on contributing Orkney-related articles, an area of knowledge I know a great deal about. But then I encountered <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a></p>
<p>I think it all started with his objection to the use of the term “Orcadian”, and he started replacing it everywhere with “Scottish”. Now let’s get this straight once and for all, “Orcadian” is an accepted term used to describe somebody from Orkney, and it is widely used – and for good reason, it pin-points the origin and culture of the person so described much more precisely than the term “Scottish”. (Furthermore, there are many in Orkney (and indeed Shetland) who object to being described as “Scottish”.) I have never claimed that “Orcadian” is a nationality, but neither, note, is “Scottish” a nationality. If Wikipedia is going to be consistent, the correct nationality is “British”! (I’ve not looked into it, but there must be analogous situations like Frankish/Bavarian/German or Frisian/Dutch.) I have never claimed that Orkney is a “sovereign state”, but note, Scotland is also not a “sovereign state”.</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems that I had inadvertently strayed into a territory that Mais oui! claims for his own. For example, it was he that set up the Portal:Scotland – but would he allow me to set up a Portal:Orkney – oh no! Incidentally, there is a <a href="../../../c/o/r/Portal%7ECornwall_502d.html" title="Portal:Cornwall">Portal:Cornwall</a>, and nobody seems to object to that.</p>
<p>Everything on Orkney that I contributed to Wikipedia had to be part of Mais oui’s domain, and he edited my articles in such a way to make sure that they were. Talk about <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>.</p>
<p>I have plenty of encyclopaedic Orkney-related articles to contribute to Wikipedia, but what’s the point when Mais oui twists them and uses them as fodder to feed his own POV agenda. Personally, I feel Mais oui! should be banned from Wikipedia – he is distorting the project and putting off other contributors. He violently attacks users who disagree with him – sockpuppet allegations seeming to be his favourite form of attack. (Yes, shortly after <a href="../../../o/r/k/User%7EOrkadian_b921.html" title="User:Orkadian">Orkadian</a> came onto the scene I did get in touch with him, and yes I am now in regular contact with him - but <b>he is not me</b>.) Out of frustration I have tried to retaliate against Mais oui!, but as accurately observed by <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EInge_1e43.html" title="User:Inge">Inge</a> “one user is good at utilising wiki rules and the other is not”, and I am the one who is not - and why should I be? I didn’t come here to have my time and effort wasted by this kind of nonsense.</p>
<p>I have given up in despair. Until Mais oui! is banned (or at least banned from editing any article I contribute), there is absolutely no point in my contributing any further articles to Wikipedia. If you want to read NPOV encyclopaedic articles about Orkney, written by people who live here or have a close association with the islands and therefore know what they are talking about, I suggest you look out for our independent site.</p>
<p>Writing <b>is</b> my goal, not (as <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangi_79ab.html" title="User:Wangi">wangi</a> puts it) “to dick around with turf wars“ – that’s <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a>’s specialism.</p>

<p>It appears to me that there is something appears a bit odd about this article. According to the WIF website, it claims to have dozens of Nobel laureates as members, and is planning to build the "ORE Complex", a multi-billion dollar global centre for scientific research: "the World's Largest Open Research Establishment. Equipped and Operational for 20,000 leading-edge scientists, engineers, technologists and innovators", as well as 1000 local research centres around the world. <a href="http://www.thewif.org.uk/articles/article.php?art=a2&amp;xy=1920&amp;pl=linux%20i686" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thewif.org.uk/articles/article.php?art=a2&amp;xy=1920&amp;pl=linux%20i686" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></p>
<p>It also claims to have been founded by Glenn Seaborg, with its current president being Jerome Karle: pretty impressive people. Indeed, many Nobel laureates are listed as "honorary consulting members" of the WIF on Wikipedia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=H._Robert_Horvitz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76133283" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=H._Robert_Horvitz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76133283" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></p>

<p>And yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>I cannot find any mention of the WIF, or its claimed predecessor the Institute of National Economic Enrichment and Development, in any mainstream news sources</li>
<li>I cannot find any mention of the WIF or its predecessor "I.N.E.E.D." on <a href="http://isswprod.lbl.gov/Seaborg/start.asp" class="external text" title="http://isswprod.lbl.gov/Seaborg/start.asp" rel="nofollow">Glenn Seaborg's biographical memorial site</a>, or in his entry on the Nobel site <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1951/seaborg-bio.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1951/seaborg-bio.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></li>
<li>the WIF appears to be run from a P.O. box in Huddersfield <a href="http://www.thewif.org.uk/articles/article.php?art=a4&amp;xy=1920&amp;pl=linux%20i686" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thewif.org.uk/articles/article.php?art=a4&amp;xy=1920&amp;pl=linux%20i686" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></li>
<li>I cannot find any reports of it in mainstream media</li>
<li>and the "letters" section of its website appears mostly to be people writing back politely to letters inviting them to become honorary members</li>
<li>most of the mentions of these notable people being members of the WIF appear to have been entered into Wikipedia on the 16th and 17th of this month by User:Drdavidhill, who is listed as the WIF's contact on its own website -- this user has been blocked for adding their website to many articles all at once, and appears to have repeatedly E-mailed Zoe to be unblocked, and has now escalated to petitioning Jimbo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Anome&amp;diff=76683482&amp;oldid=76091324" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Anome&amp;diff=76683482&amp;oldid=76091324" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></li>
<li>and the remainder seem to be press releases by academics gladly accepting invitations to become honorary fellows of the WIF</li>
</ul>
<p>And yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>"INEED" appears to have used an Easynet E-mail account <a href="http://www.thewif.org.uk/version2/nlett/4/page4.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thewif.org.uk/version2/nlett/4/page4.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a></li>
<li>the WIF also appears to run a website at <a href="http://www.ineed.easynet.co.uk/" class="external free" title="http://www.ineed.easynet.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ineed.easynet.co.uk/</a>, and <a href="http://www.ineed.easynet.co.uk/wif/joinb.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ineed.easynet.co.uk/wif/joinb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ineed.easynet.co.uk/wif/joinb.html</a> asks for cheques to be made payable to "The Institute of Sub-contractors", which is described as "the corporate trading company of the W.I.F." at "The W.I.F., P.O. Box A60, Huddersfield, HD1 1XJ, ENGLAND." -- which is the same address as given at <a href="http://www.thewif.org.uk/contact.php?xy=1920&amp;pl=linux%20i686" class="external free" title="http://www.thewif.org.uk/contact.php?xy=1920&amp;pl=linux%20i686" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewif.org.uk/contact.php?xy=1920&amp;pl=linux%20i686</a></li>
<li>which is odd, because you might expect them to at least have a bank account in their own name, particularly since the article claims that their main organization is a Swiss charity.</li>
<li>and I can't find any mention of "The Institute of Sub-contractors" on Google, or on several sites containng lists of limited companies (Companies House search goes down overnight, so I can't yet give an authoritative answer to this), or on the Charity Commission's website</li>
</ul>
<p>And yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>the phone number (01484) 300 606 and fax number (01484) 300 606 given for the WIF are also the same as that displayed for "Geo-Design Associates" of Huddersfield <a href="http://www.virtualhuddersfield.com/l-fitz-s.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.virtualhuddersfield.com/l-fitz-s.htm" rel="nofollow">[22]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, of course, I sure that there are perfectly good reasons for a global think-tank planning billion-dollar projects to share phone numbers and to have a mailing address in the same town as a business run from a shop. But it would be interesting to have a little bit more in the way of verifiable confirmation from mainstream sources about the WIF before we go any further. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 01:45, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just wonder, if you sent a letter out to a hundred academics asking them to become honorary fellows of an organization set up by Glenn Seaborg and featuring a host of Nobel laureates, what fraction of them might (a) write a nice letter back, accepting your kind offer and offering to help in any way they can, and (b) put out a release announcing their membership of this august group? -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 12:24, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've done a LexisNexis seach on this and what I've found is even more mysterious. While the article and the site claim <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Seaborg_89f4.html" title="Glenn Seaborg">Glenn Seaborg</a> as the founder, an article I found in The Yorkshire Post from 2003 tells the story of Dr. David Hill, who after "his construction company went bust" created the Foundation, whose "boldest idea is the creation of Open Research Establishments, so-called People's Creative Thought Incubators, where individuals would have their ideas and inventions analysed and developed." When one of these incubators, described as a "£50-billion scientific super city" was proposed to be built in North Lincolnshire in 2005, the local media at first reacted with breathless excitement, but in a later story said "... since speaking to one of the organisation's founder members, Dr David Hill, the Telegraph has contacted a number of organisations which claim they know nothing about the project." After that date I can find no more articles about the Foundation. There is definitely something amiss here, and the fact that so many scholars have accepted membership, yet no major news source has explained what this group actually does, is bizarre. I really am at a loss as to how to proceed. —<a href="../../../n/s/c/User%7ENscheffey_0fe4.html" title="User:Nscheffey">Nate Scheffey</a> 08:15, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, I've now done a company search, and found a company, WORLD INNOVATION FOUNDATION (FOR ECONOMIC ENRICHMENT &amp; DEVELOPMENT), company number 03539608. It's listed as a "non-trading company", and its most recent set of accounts are marked "dormant". There is no "World Innovation Foundation", or anything with a similar name, listed in the Charity Commissions register of charities.</p>
<p>I cannot find a Companies House listing for any company called "The Institute of Sub-Contractors", nor does there appear to be any charity of that, or a similar name.</p>

<dd>Does a .org.uk need to be registered in the UK as a charity? This can become quite a search if this "group" can be technically registered anywhere as a charity. Another problem is, it doesn't have to be a charity, meaning no-profit, it seems to be more of a think tank then anything else. Kind of like if Einstein and his buddies got together and made a group, are they required to make it a formal company/charity? I do not know enough about domain registration requirements, but I am almost sure a .org doesnt mean the group has to be registered as a charity. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 12:45, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are no restrictions on registering .org or .org.uk (I have domains in both groups). I suspect <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a>'s explanation above is the correct one, I've known academics who will join almost any organisation with a couple of big names on board which offers to make them a Distinguished Research Fellow or something equally grand-sounding.

<dd>I understand, I just wish there was a way to verify this, outside our own research which may be possibly flawed. As I said, if its a think tank I do not believe they are required to register anything at all. Is it possible to contact some of these professors and ask them if they have indeed even heard of anything from WIF since their joining? Or is this outside our scope? --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 12:56, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed: anyone can get together, and call themselves anything. There's no requirement for a .org.uk to be a charity, either: anyone can apply for a .org.uk domain. However, so many of the details about this organization feel peculiar to me -- most notably the gap between their presentation of themselves as a huge organization of thousands of distinguished scientists, run by Swiss charitable foundation, and planning to build a science city for 20,000 researchers, and their being run out of a P.O. box in Huddersfield, apparently sharing their phone lines with a small business being run from a shop. It seems to me that extraordiary claims require extraordiary proof, and there's very little of that, other than that a number of scientists, when offered honorary fellowships, appear to have accepted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps the WIF could help us validate its claims -- for example by providing details of:
<ul>
<li>The name, address, registration date and registration number of the Swiss charity that is claimed to be the umbrella organization for the WIF</li>
<li>A (verifiable) list of the members of its Board of Directors</li>
<li>Where and when its Nobel-prizewinning members, and its other 3000 members, have met to transact WIF business</li>

Looking at the WIF website, I recall the picture of the "Open Research Establishment" from a few years ago, and I thought it smelled funny then.

<p>I'll admit I'm the newbie here..but geez, there seems to be a huge rush to get rid of an article when there really is no evidence that it ISN'T true. Seems to me that if the World Federation of Engineering Organizations has the president of the WIF speaking at their 2003 symposium (it's ref #60 above), there is evidence that this organization really does exist. There are ways to do research that don't directly involve the internet...like a telephone call to ask anyone of these august individuals if they could provide some documentary evidence of the organization and its accomplishments. And no, that is NOT original research, it is seeking supportive documentation. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 15:38, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I got mixed up in all this mess when I responded to the good Doctor on the unblock-l mailing list, explaining to him that several users had protested his spamming on Wikipedia, and that he had been blocked for repeatedly having continued to spam. He immediately went on attack mode (in private emails, no longer on the mailing list), saying that I was blocking his legitimate right to discuss his charity with over 3000 members. When I finally got tired of repeating that he had not addressed the spamming, I stopped responding. At that point, he said that he was going to petition Jimbo. I at that point explained that he might want to address the users who had actually contacted and blocked him, not me, since I hadn't been involved until he posted to the mailing list. At that point, he accused me of "dishonesty" for not having told him from the very beginning that *I* hadn't been the one to block him. I didn't know that he didn't know who had blocked him, since it's pretty obvious in the block message who had done the blocking. He is now claiming that he is going to sue Wikipedia and post on his website how evil Wikipedia is, and will contact all of the other people we have wronged to get them to add such information. Since he's threatening lawsuits, he should not be unblocked. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 01:51, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually, Askolnik has violated the 3RR rule on that article, not me, and joins with KarlBunker in reverting that page to technically avoid the 3RR rule. This behavior should be adressed. Askolnik seems to think that every edit is a reversion. Please check the facts--Askolnik is going out of his way to push POV and to be disruptive of Wikipedia.

<p>Actually, KarlBunker and Askolnick have taken it upon themselves to revert any changes I have made in articles in trying to remove POV.

See <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natasha_Demkina_9971.html" title="Natasha Demkina">Natasha Demkina</a> for an example, which KarlBunker deliberately fails to mention.

<p>Hi, I believe that I've been the victim of a Wikibullying (for lack of a better word). To make a long story short: Somehow, within the span of 10 minutes after I had posted a comment on <a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">user:Konstable</a>'s talk page and deleted his comments from my talk page, three separate users singled out my talk page (out of a few hundred thousand talk pages and 1.3 million articles on WP, somehow all three users just happened to hone in on mine), reverted my edits, and aggresively threatened to assess various penalties against me, barely explaining themselves, if at all.</p>
<p>For the long story (necessary to understand what I'm talking about), featuring the names of those involved, relevant links -- <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Requests_for_Assistance_Requests_September_2006_J.R._Hercules_ab85.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance/Requests/September 2006/J.R. Hercules">my AMA request for assistance talks about it in detail</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to bring the case to the attention of other Wiki admins, get their feedback on the matter, their opinions, etc. Tell me if I'm wrong, if the other people are wrong, if both of us are wrong, etc. <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.R._Hercules_fd8f.html" title="User:J.R.

<dd>I do not understand why people come here complaining about talk page removal. The person obviously got your message if they deleted it, especially since they replied, so what is their to complain about? The issue was the Lenin article, which they acknowledged that post, deleted it, and responded on the Lenin article over. To keep adding tags when the person has already removed one seems like unnecessary escalation of the issue. Adding tags so they get removed so more tags can be added really serves no point. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 08:42, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>People come here to complain about it because it is routinely used to harass them. There is a line in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> which says that users are not allowed to remove "valid warnings" from their talk pages. It was added without consensus about nine months ago, has been removed repeatedly ever since, but just as frequently restored. It's a wonderful practice ostensibly intended to make it easier to see past warnings (because page histories are just too darned tricky) whose sole actual purpose seems to be to facilitate harassment of users. In the above case, Konstable placed a message (regular discussion) on Hercules's talk page and Hercules removed it. Konstable then restored the message with a new one warning him that people aren't supposed to remove things from their talk page - which was of course not true, it is sometimes seen as incivil but not prohibitted. Hercules removed it again, Chacor restored and added a warning against removing warnings (which was also invalid since Hercules had done nothing against policy in the first place), Hercules removed again, Glen S restored again with another stern warning, Hercules complained, Konstable added a new warning against being incivil in complaining about their actions, et cetera. Blatant harassment and I'm gonna block the lot of them if they don't cut it out. That 'no removing warnings' concept is bad enough when it is applied 'correctly', but when it is used as a pretext to enforce false warnings it is atrocious and nothing short of deliberate harassment. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:18, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it is possible that this is just 'overinterpretation of policy'... but in application that is <i>still</i> harassment. And it gets used <i>this</i> way far more often than 'against standard IP vandalism' in my experience. IP vandals rarely <i>bother</i> to remove warnings... and when they do it is easily visible in the page history. This is a practice which routinely serves to aggravate contributors and provides no benefit except saving the need to click on 'page history' to see if an IP vandal has been warned before. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:56, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Umm hello. <b>I have never removed any content from Herucle's talk page</b>. I have put a note asking him to respond to them rather than just remove them, but that was not even a "warning", they were my own words asking him for collaboration. Neither have I <i>ever</i> collaborated with the other people who are also "harrassing" him. Enough accusations? Let's look at the page history before throwing words? I think I assumed enough good faith when I tried to talk to him after he called a bunch of editors "idiots" and tagged their article {{<a href="../../../n/p/o/Template%7ENPOV_75c8.html" title="Template:NPOV">NPOV</a>}} without much decent explanation other than asking them to "ban Lenin fan editors". Eventually he participated in discussion on the page in question, to some extent, which is what I was asking for all along! I am not "out to get him".

<dd>The first and third are completely civil and accurate complaints about mis-treatment he had received, the second and fifth contain minor incivility in asking people to leave him alone, and the fourth is politely worded but assumes bad faith in suggesting that the reason for the sudden innundation of users to his page were some kind of puppetry.

<dd>Several people were engaged in an edit war with J.R. Hercules on his own talk page. In edit wars in user space, the user does own his page, and always gets the benefit of the doubt.

<dd>At best the issue here is overenforcement of policy. I see no reason to presume that anyone was intending to harasse anyone else and in any event blocks should be preventative not punitive. And no there is in no way shape or form any policy that edit warring on someone's own talk page somehow gives them a benefit of the doubt and somehow requires us to block the involved users. This has neither a policy nor a common sense basis. Everyone should just go back to editing. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:39, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kim a) as to your referrence to <a href="../../../b/e/f/Befehl_ist_befehl.html" title="Befehl ist befehl">befehl ist befehl</a> are you trying to be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">uncivil</a> or are deliberately invoking Godwin's law and/or the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum_0887.html" title="Reductio ad Hitlerum">Reductio ad Hitlerum</a> fallacy? To be blunt, if I weren't an involved user I'd be considering blocking you for that completely inappropriate comment. We don't block people for trying to enforce policy- it doesn't accomplish anything. If soemeone committs genocide and claims they are following Wiki policy maybe then you might have a point. b) A handful of edits don't constitute an edit war and again it has stopped and blocks are better preventative than punitive. c) So now you are advocating increasing block time for people since they thought they can plausibly say they were following policy?

<p><b>Comment:</b> Thanks to all who've provided feedback here. I appreciate the time you've taken to review and discuss my request.</p>
<p>A couple things I'd like to clarify here. One, though I probably should have made my sarcasm more clear, I did not mean to imply that sockpuppets were actually being used. I <i>did</i>, however, intend to convey my impression that some "ganging-up" and singling-out against me was taking place. If I am wrong on that, I apologize. But it struck me as an odd coincidence that the reversions on my talk page happened one right-after-the other within the span of ten or so minutes...</p>
<p>Second, from my end, I've always thought that Wikipedia "warnings" were warning <b>banners</b>, and I'm confused (as I was during the time of the edit war) by Chacor's characterization of his and the other non-banner edits as "warnings". Konstable did eventually put an actual warning banner on my page (which I'd like to archive or delete, if permitted), but that was after the initial edit sparring.</p>
<p>Last, though I know that users don't really "own" their talk pages, I was under the impression there's an understanding among Wikipedians that editing user talk pages (excluding adding comments; I mean specifically moving things around, deleting things, etc.) was the province of the user in question, and not other editors (except in extreme cases). I had once edited an admin's talk page to separate from my comments those of an anon user who added comments right after mine; he added his comments in a way that made it appear that I had made those extra comments. The admin messaged me to say he didn't appreciate me editing his talk page, and that it was his place to edit his own talk page. Hence, the comments I placed on Chacor and Konstable's pages. (Incidentally, Chacor just happens to have a disclaimer on his <i>own</i> talk page stating his prerogative to delete unfriendly comments...)</p>
<p>Again, though, thanks for the feedback. Points taken and lesson learned from my end. <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.R._Hercules_fd8f.html" title="User:J.R. Hercules">J.R. Hercules</a> 18:03, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Unless added in a totally incorrect situation (ie. the user has never actually edited the page which they <i>"vandalised"</i> - it happened to me once...), it is my interpretation that warnings don't fall under this "<a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>/<a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a> removal thing.

<p>I will not participate in this discussion where two users have harrassed and threatened me over things I have never done! Forgive me if this font looks a bit over the top, but I have had enough of people not reading my comments and harrassing me with fabricated accusations of incivil behaviour, threats and edit wars on Hercules' page, and this is the only way I can think of to get everyone to actually look at what happened rather than read CPD's false accusations: <font color="red"><i><b>I have NEVER reverted Hercules' page, not once, <a href="../../../0/r/r/WP%7E0RR_694b.html" title="WP:0RR">0 revert rule</a>; I have NEVER made any incivil comments against Hercules; I have NEVER told him he is not allowed to edit his talk page and remove content from it</b></i></font> - I have informed him that it is "not courteous" (my exact words) to clear his talk page without responding, and asked him to participate in discussion rather than clear his talk page ("Please" is not the same as "you must or you will be blocked" nor is it the same as "this is against policy") and I never reverted him or even asked him to revert it. If someone disagrees with ANY of these, wants to throw accusations or threaten blocks: <i><b>provide diffs</b></i>, <i><b>read</b></i> and comment on them.

<dd>Yes it is, its preffered they archive it for ease of reading, but its not required. You can always find where they blanked it and just look at the dif to see how it was just before the blanking. A link is an example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Illwauk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76823039" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Illwauk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76823039" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> though I believe you already know your way through difs by your own edit. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 16:58, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The blanking and deleting of talk pages has gotten more liberal recently. If people make enough of a fuss or have powerful connections, it will usually be deleted. However, there is a good chance that another admin will undelete the page, especially if the other admin is an enemy, the admin is absolutist about keeping talk pages or the person whose talk page is being deleted is not well connected. If a user really wants his or her talk page deleted, they could politely ask Jimbo to do it (he's busy, so ask someone else first). He does not see it as a big deal since the editors who want their talk pages deleted are usually not very good contributors (if I remember correctly) and (I suspect) because the value of the talk pages are less than the ill will that keeping them generates. Also, admins are unlikely to undelete pages deleted by Jimbo.</dd>
<dd>I think the policy on the talk pages should be changed to make it more fair for the people who are not well connected or complainers. I suggest giving users three choices in decreasing desirability. The first option would be to archive everything on their talk page and just leave links to the archives and, if they want, a note asking people not to post additional messages. Having the page protected to prevent additional messages would also be an option. This option would leave contents of the talk page intact and in an easy to read form. The second option would be to blank their talk page and talk page archives and either leave a note or have the page(s) protected. The old versions of the page could still be seen in the history by all users, but it is not as convenient as archiving. The third option would be to have the talk page and archives deleted. Only admins would be able to see the old versions and the convenience for them is less than blanking, since you either have to read the source or use the preview button, which does not always work. However, the page could be restored if needed, as long as there is not another crash that wipes out the deleted pages. The value of an intact talk page would be explained on the policy page and editors would be encouraged to simply archive them, but they would be able to choose which one of the three options they would like. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 04:34, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He's not banned. Sarah Ewart (the blocking admin) and I (an involved admin) agreed, following his 2 week block, that she would instate a month block, which has been applied to his 3 accounts. If he returns and continues abuse, then he should be quickly blocked again for, I would say, 3 months. There has not been any significant attempt to disguise the fact that he was running these 3 accounts. Basically he stopped using one and switched to another with a similar name, and his IP had previously been revealed to me anyway. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 20:45, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Once more there is a dispute over proposed policy that I think would benefit from the vision of admins, especially as they're the ones who would be enforcing it. The issue is protecting children's privacy, and there are two drafts on the table.</p>

Opponents claim that this does not actually protect children due to the arbitrary limit, is easily gamable by lying about your age, and has the side effect of blocking potentially good editors, and that legal issues should be deferred to the Board.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Protecting_children%27s_privacy&amp;oldid=77057763" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Protecting_children%27s_privacy&amp;oldid=77057763" rel="nofollow">The newer draft</a> is based on common sense and advises people not to post personal information because it may be abused, and recommends people to contact Oversight if they want information on themselves removed. Opponents claim that this wrongly puts the responsibility with young editors who should be held incapable of judging for themselves, it lacks "teeth" since it doesn't call for blocks, and has the side effect of subjecting Wikipedia to expensive lawsuits like the Xanga case.</p>

<dd>Radiant, you have been persistently misstating the proposal. The draft you point to <b>does not</b> prohibit users from stating they are under 13. It merely says that any user who chooses to do so, is prohibited from <i>also</i> posting personal information such as real name, phone number, home address. It is not about preventing children from being children, but merely about preventing them from being victimized in real life by people who might use personally identifying information from Wikipedia against them. An alternate version that would have prevented people from declaring they are under 13 has been discarded. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 22:43, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed this user's talk page was full of orphanBot warnings going back several months, as well as a couple of "last warnings" both about removing {{<a href="../../../t/o/n/Template%7ETone_4ead.html" title="Template:Tone">tone</a>}} tags from articles and unsourced uploads, so I blocked him for 24 hours on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">20 September</a> and asked him to please go over the relevant policy pages. This aparently had no effect as he today uploaded 3 more unsourced and untagged images and again removed several {{<a href="../../../t/o/n/Template%7ETone_4ead.html" title="Template:Tone">tone</a>}} tags. The user have <b>never</b> made any talk or user talk edits to try and explain or excuse himself so I saw no reason to try increasingly long blocks and went straight to an indef blocked, he is obviously not interested in cooperation.</p>
<p>I don't often block people so I'm posting this here for review. If anyone can actualy establish communication with him I won't mind him beeing unblocked at some point if he makes it clear he understand what he has been doing wrong. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 11:25, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not opposing anything just pointing out that the articles that had the tone tag, when the tag is removed the formatting goes back to its correct setup. The tone tag on those pages is actually destroying the layout of the page. Also most of the images he uploaded are artist related. I am not sure how much experience the user had with responding to talk page etc. But some of the images being uploaded are perfectly legit album covers. Oddly it woul dhave taken less time to review the images and see they are fair use album covers, perhaps this is where a bot fails. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 12:24, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I went and tagged the appropriate ones as album covers. any were already deleted so i do not know what they were.

<p>Have now repeatedly received password reminders for my wikipedia account that I did not request myself. This is beginning to have all the hallmarks of spam.</p>
<p>Feeding the last such mail to spamcop, the originating IP address of the mail itself is identified as: 66.230.200.221 When I look this up with:</p>
<p>nslookup -type=ptr 66.230.200.221</p>
<p>It would appear to come from wikimedia.org:</p>
<p>Non-authoritative answer:</p>
<p>221.200.230.66.in-addr.arpa canonical name = 221.200.230.66.rev.wikimedia.org</p>
<p>221.200.230.66.rev.wikimedia.org name = mail.wikimedia.org</p>
<p>I assume this means it is sent genuinely by your systems and the contents of the mail is generated using your systems?</p>

<p>Notification: Starting with the next such mail I will start reporting these as spam. This may lead to blacklisting of your mail server and cancelation of your account with you ISP. You can prevent this by configuring your systems differently. The most obvious way to do this would seem to be to request a user to provide the correct password before it can be changed. (If you want to accomodate people who have forgotten their password by sending e-mail to them, why not ask for their e-mail address before you send the mail? A legitimate user must know her own mail address. Otherwise: how is she going to receive it anyway? A non legitimate user will no longer be able to bother other people with bogus password reminders. (Of course no feedback should be provided on the correctness of the e-mail address or this could be abused to discover e-mail addresses.))</p>
<p>Question: Am I right in guessing this is done in order to gain access to my account so as to be able to spam the wikipedia using my user name? Or would it just be someone trying to harass me? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 145.97.221.117 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_145.97.221.117_972f.html" title="Special:Contributions/145.97.221.117">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Good heavens, slow down sir. It is a feature of Wikipedia that anyone can type in a user name and click on "I forgot my password", in which case Wikipedia will mail a new one to your registered e-mail address. It seems you are being targeted for harrassment by someone else. Oddly, these IPs are from all over the world, which makes me think they may be open proxies. (One is Hearst Television in NYC. Does that ring a bell for you?) If you go into your preferences and remove your e-mail account for a few days the messages will stop. Also, you can ignore the messages and your current password will still work fine and the individual behind this is not receiving a copy of the messages or access to your account. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 13:53, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For a couple of days now, a user apparently working at <a href="../../../s/t/a/StarHub_2e54.html" title="StarHub">StarHub</a> has taken it upon himself to vandalise a number of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>-related articles (including <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Vista_dc35.html" title="Windows Vista">Windows Vista</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Office_54b3.html" title="Microsoft Office">Microsoft Office</a>, <a href="../../../m/s/n/MSN_Messenger_5e0a.html" title="MSN Messenger">MSN Messenger</a>, and many more articles) in order to make some obscure point. One of there IPs, <a href="../../../2/1/8/User_talk%7E218.186.8.10.html" title="User talk:218.186.8.10">218.186.8.10</a> explained the intention thusly:</p>

<li><i>Wikipedia needs to stop anonymous editing.</i></li>
</ul>

<dd><i>Just in case you're wondering: I used to contribute to Wikipedia under an account, but I quit because I realized how much damage is done by allowing anonymous editing. And how unwilling admins were to deal with it.</i></dd>
<dd><i>And yes, I'm lucky. The last time I tried this, I got blocked after 1 round. This time, it took 6 rounds of vandalism to get blocked. Since you're an admin, why didn't you block? Actually, you should block all IPs for 61 years.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Right now, reverting his frequent vandalisms on the articles in question is keeping a considerable number of people on their toes, a situation which I personally find intolerable. Since blocking his IPs won't do him any good (he'll just reappear under another StarHub IP), I suggest the articles in question (see IPs' contrib lists) be temporarily blocked from anonymous edits, at least until he loses interest in this. Reasoning with him, I believe would not be effective, since he seems convinced that he is making a point. He is by some standards a kind of "open source terrorist", and I think the burdon is on Wikipedia to prove him wrong.</p>
<p>Some IP he has used in the past to vandalise Microaoft articles were: 218.186.9.2, 218.186.8.10, <a href="../../../2/1/8/User%7E218.186.9.4.html" title="User:218.186.9.4">218.186.9.4</a>, <a href="../../../2/1/8/User%7E218.186.8.11.html" title="User:218.186.8.11">218.186.8.11</a>.</p>

<dd>I think you are right. If we forbid anonymous edits, he will simply create account after account. this would be moving in the wrong direction. The hassle of reverting him again and again is not that bad, and I think it really does prove him wrong. I withdraw my request, reverting him his the right thing to do.

<p>Of the 5 articles mentioned in the complaint, four had been edited by <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>, three by <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> and four by <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkajati_914d.html" title="User:Ekajati">Ekajati</a> who has been using reverting to remove my tags extensively lately.</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkajati_914d.html" title="User:Ekajati">Ekajati</a> is currently blocked for 8 hours for violating the 3 revert rule, but the last two messages on his talk page are from <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a>. All of the articles in the complaint were edited by at least one of the above editors. Four were edited by more than one.</p>
<p>I believe the above three users are either the same person or working in concert to harass me and trying to drive me away from Wikipedia. There may be others involved, as all the messages on my talk page are extensively negative and lengthy ones. And most appeared in the last few days after <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> left his message. All the eccessively long ones were after his. I don't believe this is a coincidence, especially given that the finding of the sockpuppet mediator were that he agreed with my tags and the extensive negativity on my talk page seems unwarranted.</p>
<p>Please help me by stopping the harassment, unless you really do want me to leave Wikipedia, which I am beginning to think the powers that be do want. What should I do? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimmy12_3046.html" title="User:Timmy12">Timmy12</a> 15:24, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would advise all parties to cool it, and make no more sockpuppet accusations until there is available Checkuser evidence. In exchange, Timmy12, I'd recommend leaving no further messages on Hanuman Das' page.

<dd>Not that we need to compromise any of our principles, but I think it is worth a reminder, as Jimbo noted, that these things often turn into a bad experience for the subject. Instead, we should see it as an opportunity to gain the confidence, trust, and friendship of an respected and influential writer. Of course, that applies to all such contributors, whether they be famous or not; it's just that if we get someone with an audience fired up, it just creates a lot of work for us all.

If I had a WP article on myself, I might be tempted to downplay my youthful but drunken escapades, and focus instead on my more laudatory achievements. We've seen a bit of this sort of thing going on with articles on politicians here and there, with campaign pledges conveniently "whited-out". I'd also be able to add in information that is true, but either difficult or impossible for anyone else to check. In both cases, these are things we tend to frown on. I'm not for a moment suggesting that Greg Bear is doing this, but as the old Chinese proverb goes, the wise man does not bend down to tie his shoelaces in his neighbour's watermelon patch. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 11:12, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The key problem is balancing between introducing such newcomers to <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> and what Wikipedia is (we should remember few newcomers know what we really are, notable Wikipedians being no exceptions), while not coming through as insinuating that we don't want them here or we suspect they want to advertise themselves. I think most such people come here with good intentions, but they misinterpret our notices - or stumble upon somebody who is not very diplomatic - and think they are not welcomed here, or at least that they are committing a gross 'faux pas' and should go away - which I am pretty certain was never the intention of WP:AUTO.

<p>There is an ongoing dispute about the definition of "<a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>". One side says that "Paris" can only means the relatively small administratively-defined <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Paris_26cc.html" title="City of Paris">City of Paris</a> embedded in the larger conurbation (so, for example, excluding the suburbs of Paris, including the central business district of <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_D%C3%A9fense_eda4.html" title="La Défense">La Défense</a>); another says that the larger entity is called "Paris" in general English usage. This started as an edit/move war at the list, both before and after multiple votes on the talk page demonstrated that there was little consensus either way. There is now an ongoing <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-09-10_List_of_Tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_Paris_393f.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-09-10 List of Tallest buildings and structures in Paris">Mediation case</a>, but edit warring has broken out again on the list and related pages.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a content dispute, but a cursory look at the mediation page, or the talk page of the article, or the talk pages of any involved participants, will show that this is just not getting solved any time soon, and vitriolic accusations and counter-accusations are flying left and right.</p>
<p>Please would an uninvolved admin take a look.

<dd>It's a Parisian issue. France has revolved around Paris for centuries, and there's a big social distinction between living inside the city limits and outside them. The city of Paris discourages building large skyscrapers, which would overwhelm the traditional architecture of the city. So they're being built outside the city limits, mostly at La Defense, which was established as a sort of "skyscraper zone". The resulting tall building boom at La Defense is gradually moving the center of business activity outside Paris proper. This has some Parisians very upset. Don't worry about it. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 16:55, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>La Défense is the business district of Paris. I don't see how Parisians could be upset by having a world-class business district being built up in their very own urban area. It's like saying that Londoners are upset because businesses are moving to Canary Wharf. In case you don't know, residents of the City of Paris do not need a work visa to go work in La Défense or other suburban areas. In any case, the point raised by ALoan is that some editors (<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">User:Grcampbell</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePromenader_3b0e.html" title="User:ThePromenader">User:ThePromenader</a>) are bypassing the mediation going on at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-09-10_List_of_Tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_Paris_393f.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-09-10 List of Tallest buildings and structures in Paris">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-09-10 List of Tallest buildings and structures in Paris</a> and are editing the <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_D%C3%A9fense_eda4.html" title="La Défense">La Défense</a> article as well as about 20 La Défense skyscrapers articles (such as <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour_AXA_9e72.html" title="Tour AXA">Tour AXA</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour_EDF_0d1c.html" title="Tour EDF">Tour EDF</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour_Total_75fe.html" title="Tour Total">Tour Total</a>, and so on) despite lack of consensus on the mediation page.

<p>Hi. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a>, I left a message on your talk page about this.</p>
<p>There's actually four of us trying to make two Wikipedians see reason/publish fact, and few of us are Parisian.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a>'s accusations are completely baseless - the pages he is complaining are not at all in any mediation. The situation is quite the opposite as painted by him, as his constant reverts are opposed by three editors.</p>
<p>The "in Paris" situation is actually very black and white and widely referenced, which of course makes the warring seem all the more ridiculous. Only one side of the argument has every been able to provide any reference in this, and overwhelmingly so. Isn't this supposed to be an encyclopaedia? Just because a very few publishing theory put up a huge fuss to protect it doesn't mean those interested in fact should just give up and leave. What would be wiki then?</p>
<p>If anyone wants to look further into this, please do, as our mediator seems to have gone AWOL. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePromenader_3b0e.html" title="User:ThePromenader"><span style="font-family:Futura, Helvetica, _sans;color:#ddd7a3;font-size:95%;">THE<span style="color:#aba67e;">PROMENADER</span></span></a> 19:17, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>When deciding on this issue, please be aware of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, in particular this phrase: <i>An edit counts as original research if it proposes ideas or arguments. That is, if it....(It) provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms</i>. Quite simply the boundaries of Paris are well known and published (no less than by the French government who you'd think know what they are talking about (at least I hope)) and <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">User:Hardouin</a> wants to invent new definitions. Also, there was some consensus about correctly referencing the towers correctly on individual pages, with people from both sides agreeing, the only one in disagreement out of &gt;6 participating is again this user. He insists on listing the towers locations at the French equivalent of a PO Box number! For some reason, it seems to irk him that Paris has boundaries. What he fails to understand is that in France, when you exit a commune, you are no longer in that commune. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 20:09, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

These actions violate the letter and the spirit of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">protection policy</a>, which states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Admins should <b>not</b> protect pages in which they are involved. Involvement includes making substantive edits to the page (fixing vandalism does not count), or expressing opinions about the article on the talk page before the protection. Admin powers are not editor privileges — admins should only act as servants to the user community at large. If you are an admin and you want a page in an edit war in which you are somehow involved to be protected, you should contact another admin and ask them to protect the page for you. Not only is this the preferable method, it is also considered more ethical to do so as it helps reduce any perceived conflict of interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These actions are also inconsistent with the intent of the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocking policy</a> which states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use of blocks to gain an advantage in a content dispute is strictly prohibited. That is, sysops must not block editors with whom they are currently engaged in a content dispute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and implies that sysops shouldn't threaten to block editors with whom they are currently engaged in a content dispute, either. I request that <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a>'s improper reversion and protection of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> be reversed.

<dd>It does look like Radiant may have been too involved here. I suggest it would have been more appropriate to ask for another admin, on this noticeboard even, rather than doing it himself. It also looks like you've been edit warring on policy pages, and spamming other pages soliciting support to your edit war. Consequently, the page is now protected in my, uninvolved name, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Vandalism&amp;diff=77083895&amp;oldid=77083832" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Vandalism&amp;diff=77083895&amp;oldid=77083832" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>, and you are warned that if you continue either edit warring or soliciting you will be blocked by me. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 00:37, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ignoring Radiant's actions for a bit, I don't see the point of basically saying that people are never allowed to remove stuff from their talk page. The repeated reinsertion of a warning (especially a stupid warning) already admits that it has been received and read, so what is the point of edit-warring over it other than causing disruption and agitation? --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 00:38, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sigh. The part on removing warnings from your own talk page is quite possibly the most frequently disputed sentence on any policy page anywhere on Wikipedia. Can we some how, some way please come to final resolution to the removing warnings wars. I'm not even sure I care about the result any more, just that question is settled one way or the other. For anyone that has missed it, this has been a perpetual topic of edit wars and disputes for something like 9 months now, flaring up every few weeks. It has already been subject to at least two polls, including <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_poll_8b64.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings poll">Wikipedia:Removing warnings poll</a>, and many pages of largely unproductive discussion at <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EVandalism_8d2c.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Vandalism">Wikipedia talk:Vandalism</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 00:43, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is useful to ensure that a warning remains on the page for other users to see if the person's disruptive behavior continues, so that there is an obvious record of recent problems. What needs to be changed is to explicitly allow established users to remove warnings after a reasonable period of time, and to discourage the use of any pro forma warnings on established users. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 00:50, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It also needs to be changed to point out that newcomers do not know that rule, and are likely to see replacement of warnings as harassment. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 02:30, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was edit warring, so protecting it is appropriate, but if it be reverted it would make sense to revert to 21:12, 18 September 2006 Zazpot, distinctly before any edit warring or contested changes, rather than to the new change favored by the involved admin protecting it. Also, the CVU page is not your personal propaganda tool for hysterically summoning help in a dispute, which you did before with <a href="../../../v/i/e/WP%7EVIE_cf5b.html" title="WP:VIE">WP:VIE</a>, and its talk page is not yours to remove any discussions you don't like, which you have also done before; you were edit warring, which is not permitted; and Radiant did not threaten to block you. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 00:45, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, first the claim that there was no dispute/the policy was stable prior to Radiant's getting involved (involved again actually - he disputed it nine months ago too) is just false. This practice has been disputed since day one and <i>only</i> the willingness of its proponents to edit war and 'call for backup' (as in this case) in greater degree than its opponents has kept it on the policy page. There are two cases on this page <i>currently</i> where users complained about harassment because this practice was used to repeatedly re-add 'warnings' which were at best questionable if not completely false. I've cited half a dozen other, often worse, cases in past discussions on the topic. The claim that these warnings must be displayed so that past activity can be easily seen has always struck me as painfully weak. We have the user's contribution list. We have their talk page history. There is <i>nothing</i> preventing vandalism patrollers coming up with standardized edit summaries which would stand out in the history and work every bit as well as the standardized templates do currently. Providing a minor convenience for vandal fighters <b>cannot</b> be a good reason for maintaining a practice which <i>inherently</i> breeds harassment and conflict. And that's what this comes down to. This practice does vastly more harm than good and the 'good' it does do could be accomplished every bit as easily... indeed, even better, with edit summaries that the user <i>can't</i> remove. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:03, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Amen. Warnings are useful, but edit warring to force people to display them is too much <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarlet_Letter_3594.html" title="Scarlet Letter">Scarlet Letter</a> for me.

<li>I should point out that John's legalistic accusations are incorrect; it is plain from the edit history that I did not revert to my version, and neither did I threaten to block him. However, as I was pointed to earlier debate on the issue, I just found out that an edit war has been repeatedly flaring up on that page for over a month now, and there are several lengthy discussion pages on the subject. Ignoring issues of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/the_wrong_version" class="extiw" title="m:the_wrong_version">m:the wrong version</a> for a minute, if there's such a lengthy edit war I think the page should be protected for some time more while we figure out what exactly has consensus here, and preferably reach a compromise on the issue. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 13:29, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>The argument about the removal or warnings does not belong here. There is a talk page and discussion about that. The issue that was reported here was an admin's actions. I believe these actions are contrary to official policy and good practice.</p>
<p>I also think it would have been better to handle this directly with the admin and give the admin time to respond. It's just a matter of politeness and kindness! However, this notice is here, and I feel obliged to provide some input since I was the person that the admin reverted. i want to add: I do not have a problem with this admin in general or with any of the participants in what was considered an "edit war".</p>
<p>I requested that the admin rethink his or her actions. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Radiant%21&amp;action=edit&amp;section=53" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Radiant%21&amp;action=edit&amp;section=53" rel="nofollow">Here</a>] is my request on that admin's talk page. In essence I make these following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree that stopping edit wars is a good thing. (I generally think that even if my view does not "win").</li>
<li>I was not intentionally edit warring. I was participating with sincere and good intent. The page is on my watch list and I only made one edit.</li>
<li>I am not a vandal fighter.</li>
<li>The administrator was one of the participants in what he or she called an edit war.</li>
<li>The administrator did not just protect the page in order to stop edit warring. Had he or she done that, there would be no problem. But the administrator reverted to a position he or she favored and then protected.</li>
<li>The position reverted to, is not the position that existed before the edit war as the admin claimed. It is the position that started the "edit war".</li>
</ul>
<p>I note that the admin notified many people of his or her action but did not notify me... the person reverted. Perhaps it was an oversight, but, along with the involvement in the discussion and the revert followed by a protect, it gives the appearance of partiality.</p>
<p>I request that the admin revert his or her own revert. I also request that the discussion here be limited to the actions of the admin. Let's not turn this into a "meta" discussion about the content of the dispute. I think that distracts. There is a talk page for that purpose anyway. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 13:07, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, admins should generally not protect a page they have been involved in dispute on... which indeed is the only reason I had not protected the page to prevent what I consider the incorrect re-insertion of this practice. The original complaint was a technicality (Radiant's involvement was minimal, there <i>was</i> and edit war going on, and the version he protected on was not his own) and now obsolete because the page has been protected by an admin who was not involved in the dispute. I don't see much left to 'discuss' on that issue. The larger problem is the lack of consensus on the 'removing warnings' issue behind the edit war. Further discussion of that issue is needed and as it has come up three times (each completely unrelated to the others) on this noticeboard in as many days this doesn't seem an unreasonable venue. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 15:20, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>This is quite a lengthy discussion that has been going on for some time. Upon analyzing the situation, I think the main issue for the policy is not what we think should happen, but what in fact does happen. Do people in fact get blocked or otherwise sanctioned for removing warnings? If so, policy should reflect that; if not, policy shouldn't forbid it.

<p>Abu dabali has not made any useful or meaningful contributions to wikipedia. His only edits seem to be tagging images for deletion.

<dd>Oddly enough pictures taken off Flickr contain little proof they are owned by that person who owns the Flickr account.

<dd>What do you mean? His images are marked as "Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike 2.0" on flickr, and that's the license I used on Commons. In the case that some of the images I've uploaded have a problem, it should be fixed or, if not possible, deleted.

<dd>Doubts about the fan site's ownership aside, we do not include images based solely on permission for their use in Wikipedia. As noted above, these images do not meet the criteria for <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">fair use</a>, and therefore we can only use them if they are released under a free license so that they can follow their articles' text and be used anywhere, by anyone. This is the project's goal, not to simply collect content that's bound to the Wikipedia web site. There's much information about how to ask copyright holders to relicense their material on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission</a> and <a href="../../../e/x/a/Wikipedia%7EExample_requests_for_permission_0f4b.html" title="Wikipedia:Example requests for permission">Wikipedia:Example requests for permission</a>. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 19:28, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you have such a big problem with these images, why don't just go delete every image in the "fair use in" category? They are all just the same, yet these have been singled out. On Kryptonsite's website, it states that all content belongs to Kryptonsite, unless otherwise noted; and these images were not noted as belonging to someone else, so Kryptonsite owns the copyright. I have provided proof that the copyright holder (Kryptonsite) has allowed these images to be used for Wikipedia - that could also mean that if Wikipedia ever was released in print form, the images could be used there too. I just don't see what your problem is with using these images on Wikipedia, as they obviously don't violate copyright. But, as I've stated in some other places, I just don't care anymore, and I'm tired of fighting for these images. I'll just never upload an image again so I don't have to go through all this crap again. - <a href="../../../i/v/a/User%7EIvan_Kricancic_d72f.html" title="User:Ivan Kricancic">Ivan Kricancic</a> 02:51, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hola Admins,</p>
<p>I wanted to tell my friend that accepting microsoft is adapting to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herd_mentality.html" title="Herd mentality">herd mentality</a>, but when I looked it up there was only "blank stangeness".</p>

<dd>It was probably something weird that happened with the server or your browser. The article was not blanked in the history of the page, which you can see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herd_behavior&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herd_behavior&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a>. When stuff like that happens, try <a href="../../../b/y/p/Wikipedia%7EBypass_your_cache_1dae.html" title="Wikipedia:Bypass your cache">bypassing your cache</a>. If that does not work, try it again later (this is assuming you have checked the history for vandalism already). You could also try another browser if you have more than one. I have to use four of them (Mac Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Netscape), as they all suck at certain things and are incompatible with a lot of sites. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a></dd>

<li>As far as I can tell, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herd_behavior.html" title="Herd behavior">Herd behavior</a> is a normal article. Maybe it just didn't load correctly when you tried it.

<p>Technically, the article seems to be working properly. The name and content are somewhat inconsistent, the content is uncited, the writing is poor, and some of the uncited claims seems bogus.

<dd>Look Guys, There are over 60 of us from the same Multi-User IP Address. Why is it that when someone creates an acccount from our Multi-User IP Address, they are accused of Sockpuppetry. I am aware of the harassment issue that happened in June this year because it affected everyone at our Multi-User IP Address. 3 Brands is gone and you can ask him yourself at venables001_extreme_machine@hotmail.com. Brisbane Sports Entertainments address can be accessed by leaving a message on my Talk Page. 3 Brands is banned from using Wiki. BSE has seen to that. We are not his sockpuppets and never will be.</dd>

<p>It's true, Venables001 has said to me that he comes from a computer lab that has about 100 differant computers in it, and they have a static-IP range, so whenever he is blocked, he just moves along to the next computer. That IP range has been active tonight in the sockpuppets's comments today as seen on <a href="../../../d/v/d/User_talk%7EDVD_R_W_d778.html" title="User talk:DVD R W">User talk:DVD R W</a>. Venables has been indefblocked from this site because of his persistant harassment on me and Normy132. Thanks InShaneee for the block. — <span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva"><a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#CD2626">Moe Epsilon</font></a></span> 04:16 September 23 '06</p>

<dd>There's no vandalism within the last 6 hours. Perhaps the warning had its intended effect.

<dd>I might be misinterpreting policy, as I didn't think I could list this user on AIV before a "test4" template or a similar warning was noted on the user's Talk page before the current round of vandalism, and there wasn't one till I added it.

<p><i>(related to the comments directly above)</i></p>
<p>The IP above, 68.19.47.12 (the poster of personal details), was involved in an incident where he/she posted personal information on the <a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.30.152.217.html" title="User talk:65.30.152.217">talk page of 65.30.152.217</a>. The diff has since been disabled for viewing (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:65.30.152.217&amp;oldid=76183079" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:65.30.152.217&amp;oldid=76183079" rel="nofollow">here</a>), as the talk page was deleted and all the other revisions restored excluding this one. Obviously, admins can still view it thru the Undelete feature.</p>
<p>The last part of the message which contained personal details are published below:</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">

<p>The above was referring to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Ejaculation_Educational_Demonstration.ogg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76137894" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Ejaculation_Educational_Demonstration.ogg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76137894" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, made by the victim to the users' image upload. Interestingly, the IP who posted the personal details reverted the source change (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Ejaculation_Educational_Demonstration.ogg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76137894" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Ejaculation_Educational_Demonstration.ogg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76137894" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</p>
<p>The signing of the name "Ima Learning" initated my suspicions. Prior to the message being hidden via deletion, it contained numerous references to the 65.30.152.217 (the victim) "commiting vandalism" to certain articles, many of which this user has edited (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ima_learning_fb4d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ima learning">Special:Contributions/Ima learning</a>).</p>
<p><b>I think that, considering the .ogg reference in the quote and the username's log (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Ima_learning" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Ima_learning" rel="nofollow">look at the uploads</a>), there is very minimal doubt about whether the user is the IP who posted the personal details.</b></p>
<p>Any doubt I had was eliminated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ejaculation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76186593" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ejaculation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76186593" rel="nofollow">this diff</a> - notice the edit summary, and the person who he is reverting. Then, not very long after, 68.19.47.12 (the poster of the personal details) posts on the talk page of 65.30.152.217 (the victim), making numerous references to this vandalism revert that Ima learning made only 10-or-so minutes before.</p>
<p>Really, with the logs and then the reverting diff to squash any thought of an imposter, this user should be blocked indefinitely for maliciously posting personal details of a Wikipedia editor. <font face="sans-serif"><b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel</a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">.</a><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel.Bryant_8f7b.html" title="User talk:Daniel.Bryant">Bryant</a></b></font> 06:44, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Over the last few months, <a href="../../../w/y/s/WYSIWYG_fcf0.html" title="WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> has been vandalised by anonymous editors roughly once every 2-3 days. I was wondering if semi-protection would be suitable to prevent this problem? The article is also currently in a fairly stable state, and hasn't changed substantially for a while, so it shouldn't get in the way of improving the article. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 08:20, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

I previously nominated it for deletion since the goal of the "association" is to fight attempts to delete articles that have been nominated for deletion based on them being either not notable or POV pushing of 9/11 related material that is outside the mainstream viewpoint (better known as conspiracy theories). In wikinamespace, Shorfuse has declared that he is going to both watchlist articles and editors that he and whoever joins his association are in disagrreement with. I would have no problem with this if he did so in his own userspace, but surely, creating an association in wikispace is simply a poor namespace for such an effort. I recognize other editors use their own userspace to monitor articles and sometimes also editors, but this is the first time I have seen it done in wikispace. I can't even see how this would qualify as a WikiProject, as the purpose of the association appears to be an advocacy platform for vote stacking. I have also firmly told Shortfuse that if he starts adding names of editors, (which is pretty lousy with the article currently at Mfd) the article should be speedied as an attack page and he may end up being blocked. I can't imagine that this effort by Shortfuse can possibly be one of good faith.

Including CTs, whose articles are to be neither pro nor con. Like every other article. Per policy. So the stated aim of this group is to protect NPOV, ergo their aim is to uphold policy.

His comment contained phrases like "shut the fuck up, thanks," " I believe I already asked you to stop lying, sir," "Nice try," "Why don't you answer the goddamn question", etc. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AProtecting_children%27s_privacy&amp;diff=77328152&amp;oldid=77304331" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AProtecting_children%27s_privacy&amp;diff=77328152&amp;oldid=77304331" rel="nofollow">full comment here</a>. I removed the post and blocked the user for 24 hours. He had already been blocked 24 hours earlier for (apparently unrelated) incivility by another administrator. Admin Radiant!, who also vehemently opposes the policy, <i>replaced</i> the comment today, in the edit summary stating "Replace comments by JayW that were removed by Firsron. I agree they're not very <i>nice</i> comments, but they aren't meaningless either, and removing part of a discussion is not good." I've had no contact with Radiant! before this, and his talk page is <i>full</i> of nice compliments from people glad to see he's back, but I don't believe reverting to a "shut the fuck up"-type comment is in the best interest of the encyclopedia, and can only cause a disturbance. JayW is free to make his point, but there was no need for that. I seek feedback regarding this incident. For the record, I generally supported the proposed policy, but haven't written there much, and I would have removed an offensive post like that no matter <i>what</i> the position. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 20:04, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>A subject like "children's privacy" is bound to raise tempers with people on both sides. JayW's comment was phrased rather nastily, I agree; however, part of it was a valid argument, pointing to psychological studies in rebuttal of an earlier argument by Captaintanker. It seems JayW feels Tanker is evading the issue, which would explain (though certainly not excuse) him being angry. Thus, calling the <i>entire</i> comment a personal attack is throwing the baby out with the proverbial bathwater. It would be more conductive to discussion to remove or strike the offending parts per <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a>, rather than removing all of it. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 20:20, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Since the comments were written througout the message, removing them would leave the message somewhat unintelligible. While I strongly agree with you that a subject like "children's privacy" is bound to raise tempers with people on both sides, I've only seen <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayW_e416.html" title="User:JayW">user:JayW</a> resort to swearing and personal attacks. Replacing a comment like that only encourages users to think that sort of activity is appropriate, and as he's been blocked twice within 48 hours now, that's not the message administrators should be sending. Further, if you felt part of the message was constructive, why didn't you yourself replace the non-offensive parts, instead of restoring the full message, including personal attacks? <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 20:36, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I had noticed the block, and have no objection to it (although if this is about messages admins should be sending, one could argue that you're not a neutral party because you and Jay are involved on opposite sides of an emotionally heated issue). I didn't do a partial restoration of the message because I don't feel particularly offended by what he says and I have no way of knowing which parts were offensive to you. In my opinion someone who makes personal attacks stands condemned by his own words, and there is no need to hide those words. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 20:51, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am a neutral party because I have barely participated in the discussion (four posts in a month), never spoke to JayW on this discussion, and only generally supported the ploicy. As I stated above, I would have blocked anyone who left that type of message. It is unfortunate that you cannot tell what parts of a message which contains "shut the fuck up" might be considered offensive, and there's no need to "play dumb". <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 21:10, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The "play dumb" comment borders on incivility. That said, the amount of effort required to refactor, strike, or clean up the profane/abusive comments in the original messages should be less than what you've expended here in the complaints. I can see that you had a point that maybe Radiant should have cleaned them up, but this is a wiki... you can clean them up too. Please drop this pointless to and fro argument and just <i>fix</i> it...

<dd>You misunderstand, George: I <i>did</i> fix it. And then it was reverted by Radiant. Hence this discussion. And anyone who says they're not sure what part of a message that contains "shut the fuck up" is offensive <i>is</i> "playing dumb". <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 21:34, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am going to assume good faith. You did not fix the specific rude comments; you reverted everything he'd said. You are free to go in and edit the specific rudeness out but leave the rest of the comment. Though it's relatively rare to edit other people's talk contributions, this would be a reasonable exception. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 22:55, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for assuming good faith, George. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:RPA#Don.27t_destroy_context" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:RPA#Don.27t_destroy_context" rel="nofollow">the WP:RPA guidelines</a>, refactoring can be done to remove the personal attacks while retaining the good, useful parts of the comment. We'd be left with something like: <b>"No, it doesn't; and the substanceless hate speech following this claim doesn't attempt to provide evidence. [...] Thousands, in fact, according to the studies reviewed in Green (2002) and Hunter (1999). [...]</b> What <b>is your agenda? <i>I appreciate your answer in advance."</i></b> <i>As that would hopelessly destroy the context of JayW's message, it just didn't make sense to me to retain that little bit that was left, although I do appreciate your view (I really do). I am not free of error, I make mistakes, but I feel restoring a personal attack like that, in a place already frought with tension, didn't make much (or any) sense. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 23:36, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Being the person to whom the messages are addressed, I'll admit I do find them very hostile, incivil, and a personal attack. However, I am a large, <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hoban_Washburne_3ead.html" title="Hoban Washburne">semi-muscular man</a>; I'm not going to be driven off the project by comments written in anger, and I don't have a particular opinion either way as to whether they should be removed or stay in place. What I've chosen to do is simply disengage from the conversation; I've realized that it's unhealthy to continue with it, neither of us is going to convince the other, and it's somewhat the wrong forum for a discussion of the subject. JayW appears to consider my conception of pedophiles ungrounded and offensive; I can certainly understand why he would lash out. Were I an impartial observer, I would recommend that the block be served out fully (I have strong feelings about incivility on Wikipedia) and then have everyone get on with their lives.</dd>
<dd>I'd also like to take a moment to thank Firsfron and Radiant for contributing to the discussion on the policy page, and for being willing to publicly address the disagreements we have instead of allowing it to degenerate. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 21:02, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

This IP has been engaging in persistent, though low-volume, vandalism for quite some time, and has made zero useful edits during this year. The user has been warned repeatedly, but has only been issued a single 24-hour block in May this year. The consistency of the contributions strongly suggest that this is a semi-static broadband IP which is likely, though not certain, to remain assigned to a single user for quite some time. As such, I feel that the prevention of further vandalism while the block is in place, and the possibility of sending the user the message that such vandalism is not tolerated, outweigh the risk that the IP will be reassigned to an innocent contributor who would have to either wait until the block expires or to request that it be lifted before being able to edit Wikipedia. As this is, nonetheless, an unusually long block for an IP address, I am announcing it here so that other may review it. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 14:33, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>One month seems like a relatively cautious approach, given the case. I encourage others to similarly stick to a month at the outside for IP's, even stable ones, and to be ready to lift such blocks the moment there is even the appearance of collateral damage. (I'm not sure we can conclude that it's stable, I'm afraid, as I have seen an IP that had garbage only for 8 months and then an academically astute question, and then more giggling vandalism -- suggesting that it was a university library point.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:40, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have to admit that I've been known to give longer blocks, like six months, in similar circumstances. One month does seem to be cautious - but on reflection it is probably wise not to go longer than that. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 03:40, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I fully support Szvest's block. He has endured personal attacks from this user in the past and never took any action, hoping that she/he would change his manners. Unfortunately, I really believe that Bokpasa is here simply for the wrong reasons: To engage on disruptive edit wars and trollish behaviour in order to use wikipedia as a soapbox. He also fails to assume good faith, she/he insults other wikipedians and uses racist-like language. On top of this, she/he is not a newbie and knows the rules and policies, and had been warned to that effect a few times before. As for previous precedents, I would ask other administrators to consider the possibility of a <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html#Users_who_exhaust_the_community.27s_patience" title="WP:BP">Community Ban</a>.

<dd>I strongly support Szvest's block.

<ul>
<li>1) Using caps for emphasis is not incivil; it's just an alternative to bolding or italics (although overuse is shouting and is disruptive)</li>
<li>2) Your second bullet point doesn't really support your views; there is a definite case for a 3RR violation in the first link in this section, and the rest are a content dispute, which doesn't belong here.</li>
<li>3) You uploaded a dubious image and Opiner questioned you.</li>
<li>4) In this case, you have a case for incivility. Mocking an editor's grasp of English is inexcusable and you deserve a full and fair apology. A flaring up of temper is not an excuse for attacking an editor who is struggling with a language.</li>
<li>5) For the images portion of this section, you and other editors <i>have</i> been attempting to censor the images at hand, based on your point of view that they're "irrelevant" or "useless" or "offensive.". The rest (particularly the intro section, which keeps getting edit warred over) is a content dispute, which admins shouldn't be stepping into.</li>
<li>6) The "unsuitable" edit seems to be a discussion of a purportedly questionable edit.</li>
<li>My suggestion to you would be to open a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">request for comment</a> or a <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERFM_dd02.html" title="WP:RFM">request for mediation</a>; there is a legitimate dispute on the Muhammad page over POV and the suitability of images, and nobody involved has clean hands. This isn't a matter that requires administrator attention at this time. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 19:01, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>this is <i>not</i> regarding any content dispute, this is regarding <a href="../../../o/p/i/User%7EOpiner_8286.html" title="User:Opiner">User:Opiner</a>'s generally incivil behaviour, which is totally counter-productive to the project. you have not addressed all of the concerns.
<ul>
<li>1) it is <a href="../../../t/p/g/WP%7ETPG_5557.html" title="WP:TPG">against good practice</a>, and is certainly aggressive if used repeatedly, especially when used in the way it has been above.</li>
<li>2) making wholesale, contentious changes under the guise of an inaccurate edit summary is nothing to do with content dispute. it has everything to do with wikilawyering when you seemingly don't understand the policy.</li>
<li>3) legitimate concerns are always entertained. scandel-mongering, and most probably violations of <a href="../../../d/b/a/WP%7EDBAD_2716.html" title="WP:DBAD">WP:DBAD</a>, are things i am simply not prepared to tolerate when there was no basis for claiming dubiosity, where all one needed to do was study the source URL given.</li>
<li>4) you are mistaken, i am a native english speaker. that i may be pre-occupied or tired such that i make a mistake does not necessitate that i be pounced upon or "exposed" via childish games.</li>
<li>5) there have been legitimate reasons for opposition to some of the images, as you yourself confirm. please do not generalise, i personally do not recall being significantly involved in the image debate, which <i>is</i> a content dispute. i only recall removing an image once, with the justification that the grounds for its inclusion should be first discussed on talk. to resort to continuous allegations of censorship upon those who may object is a disappointing lack of good faith, as are accusations of POV-pushing and "alliances".</li>
<li>6) there are guidelines for using user talk pages. i find such remarks unwelcome to say the least. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 19:51, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

(To explain - he changed the heading "Consensus view" to "Columbia Journalism Review." While it is accurate that the quote comes from CJR, it is only notable insofar as it reports the consensus view regarding the topic. I have explained on his talk page what is wrong with his change (albeit a bit angrily at first when his actions were pure vandalism, but I tried to engage in dialogue over the CJR change). He continues to make the change despite the discussion there, and he has been gaming the 3RR, making 4 reverts in 25 hours (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salman_Pak_facility&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salman_Pak_facility&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>, 04:29, 23 September 2006 to 05:53, 24 September 2006). He refuses to engage in dialogue on the talk section of the page and refuses to compromise.

<p>Briefly as possible: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_RCP_%28Red_Car_Posse%29_7bf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The RCP (Red Car Posse)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The RCP (Red Car Posse)</a> (a rather unsavory article) became a series of new user votes to save, plus other single purpose accounts vandalizing the user pages and "articles I've created" articles listed on the user pages of those who had voted to delete. It seemed to be getting out of hand so I created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/User:Zoso2005" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/User:Zoso2005" rel="nofollow">this suspected sockpuppet report</a> for the most likely culprit. I was not, at the time, totally convinced that it was just that one user. The article is a vanity article about a group of three friends, and 2 user names and one anon IP have been used to edit it.</p>
<p>User:Zoso2005 responded to the accusation by saying first "it wasn't me" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASuspected_sock_puppets%2FUser%3AZoso2005&amp;diff=77582941&amp;oldid=77569709" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASuspected_sock_puppets%2FUser%3AZoso2005&amp;diff=77582941&amp;oldid=77569709" rel="nofollow">[79]</a>after which I explained how check user works. He then responded that "hackers could have stolen my IP" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASuspected_sock_puppets%2FUser%3AZoso2005&amp;diff=77605346&amp;oldid=77592746" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASuspected_sock_puppets%2FUser%3AZoso2005&amp;diff=77605346&amp;oldid=77592746" rel="nofollow">[80]</a>. After I further explained how unlikely that was, pointed out that one of the three full names listed in the article was probably his and that his school's IT admin could certainly use his IP and a choice of three full names to identify him without a doubt, he agreed to delete the article.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASuspected_sock_puppets%2FUser%3AZoso2005&amp;diff=77611118&amp;oldid=77608984" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASuspected_sock_puppets%2FUser%3AZoso2005&amp;diff=77611118&amp;oldid=77608984" rel="nofollow">[81]</a>.</p>
<p>My assumption is that he did this because he realized that it contained personal information that could identify him as a vandal. After some help from me with speedy tags, the article was speedied as {{db-author}}. The other part of my comment was that if he wanted to avoid trouble, he needed to own up to his vandalism and apologize which resulted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FThe_RCP_%28Red_Car_Posse%29&amp;diff=77610674&amp;oldid=77593968" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FThe_RCP_%28Red_Car_Posse%29&amp;diff=77610674&amp;oldid=77593968" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASuspected_sock_puppets%2FUser%3AZoso2005&amp;diff=77615765&amp;oldid=77608984" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASuspected_sock_puppets%2FUser%3AZoso2005&amp;diff=77615765&amp;oldid=77608984" rel="nofollow">this</a>. In spite of his refusal to own up and apologize, I no longer think the sockpuppet issue is that important -- and I am open to the possibility, that I pointed out to him, that if he lives in a dorm or something (which I think he does) one or more of his friends could have perpetrated the vandalism on his IP. I'm not totally sold, but it's a possibility. Either way, I suspect if a checkuser goes through, he will be blocked, and as he seems (somewhat) mollified by the trouble he got himself into, I don't really think he'll be trouble anymore. However, I'd really like some admins opinions.</p>
<p>Also, even if I wanted to (and I'm not sure I do), I'm not sure if its okay to just delete my own suspected sock puppet report.

<dd>Mr Sarantakos name isn't on the public record, as far as I know, and his proponents try at all stops to remove his name. That case is the same vein in that, assuming in the Sarantakos case his name is known but not of public record while the McGuinness case has the name of public record but "unknown", they both have to do with wanting secrecy/privacy in their stage identities. We're an encyclopedia so I do not understand why factual and supported additions are to be removed at the whims of people involved - do we rate the level of publicness as the time when we start to include facts that are already listed such as real names? Are we starting to invent a point of publicity before information has been added or do we follow <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not censored</a>? –– <b><a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a></b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../l/i/d/User_talk%7ELid_6320.html" title="User talk:Lid">Talk</a>)</small></sup> 01:44, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We follow the idea that Wikipedia is not the first place anything should be published. Mr. Sarantakos' name is published in multiple mass media sources, hence there is no reason we should not publish it, because it is already widely known public information.

<dd>This is quite a slippery slope in that we can't post sourced information because wikipedia has to regurgitate the information of media outlets. Why media outlets?

Where is his real name used other than Wikipedia and a trademark filing? Why should we countenance the use of Wikipedia as an <b>investigatory</b> tool about people's lives, rather than a means of encyclopedically summarizing their life and career based on reliable published sources?

<dd>From the previous examples of Buckethead and Criss Angel to every single character profile ever on wikipedia the real name is listed in the article, usually in the first line, even if that person doesn't want their real identity to be revealed to the public. Wikipedia is about facts, not ommitting them. The reason the published elsewhere question has been ignored is because it has no bearing on the debate, if it had been published elsewhere we wouldn't even be having this debate. The biggest issue is the precedent it sets, removing publically available facts because of a complaint when the facts are neither negative nor libel. Your ending line of "neener neener" is especially odd considering everyone here is keeping a level head and debating the topic fairly. If this passes does it mean that there is a level of public identity until which facts that are already known can be posted? It's a question that has huge ramifications in where do we draw the line? It's the precedent this sets that's the debate, not the individual. –– <b><a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a></b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../l/i/d/User_talk%7ELid_6320.html" title="User talk:Lid">Talk</a>)</small></sup> 03:32, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>His real name (which I just found and started searching around for on search engines) is nothing but a marker in a governent database. For this, while his information is in the "public record", I think it would be well afforded that since his real name exists nowhere outside of said government database it should be kept private. The logic has already been cleanly applied to birthdays (yes, everyone has a birthday, and if I go through enough trouble, I can find someone's birthday and other information, and all stage names have a birth name assigned onto them), but it doesn't need to be instantly included into an article. Its dregging up private information that should've stayed private. Now, if the media comes out and writes about his real name, as in several other cases, the cat's out of the bag. Its not like critism, though. Critism is a whole new ballgame to contend with, and I'd trust that the OTRS people would think very hard about well-sourced critism material being demanded for removal before compling with any such demands. But its not, its private information, and the right thing was probably done to remove it considering the quiet nature of his real name. Now, who wants to improve some sourcing with me? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 04:16, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Once again we're back at "private information" in the public domain and how that makes it still private. The case still stands in the literally tens of thousands of other character/stage name articles and their real names being listed, where do we draw the line? Many of those articles also list birthdates, in fact the vast majority seem to, where's the line? If secondary source reported the name they would be reposting the same content as the primary source, there's no difference in the context and the source is actually further back than when it needs to be thus adding additional steps to the detriment source of knowledge that is wikipedia. Public, not private, sourced information being removed on whims should not be what wikipedia is about. –– <b><a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a></b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../l/i/d/User_talk%7ELid_6320.html" title="User talk:Lid">Talk</a>)</small></sup> 04:40, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had decided, after my last comment, not to take any further partin this discussion; I have lifted my self-imposed parole just for this comment. Firstly, Kevin, I totally agree with you, and express my hope that the OTRS people would strongly consider whether to delete <i>well-sourced</i> criticism from a request. I was personally involved in something which was the exact definition of the aforementioned situation, and I was aggrieved to realise that Wikipedia had, in fact, deleted sourced criticism from an article. But that's the past, this is the present, and hopefully in the future WMF will consider their position more closely.</dd>

<dd>In this instance, I think the decision has to be made here is whether a <b>state-actors</b> real name is personal/private info, or is it public/needed. In most cases, a name would be public/needed, and hence includedin the article. However, the question is <i>do many people know this person/actor by his real name, and if they do, is there enough to deem it notable?</i> I have already expressed my opinion in this case, and won't just repeat it again for repeating's sake.

<dd>This whole issue has piqued my interest, perhaps due to FCYTravis's question above whether the USPTO is a "reliable" or a "notable" source. Can we rely on the USPTO to give us the real name of this Nigel McGuiness? I took at the Trademark database, &amp; found the name in question (I'll call him Smith in order to keep this discussion from being redacted), &amp; all it states is that Smith is the <i>owner</i> of the trademark -- not Smith is the real-life name of McGuiness. Now anyone can own a trademark: the actor, his agent, his lawyer or accountant, or a suit in the Professional Wrestling business who has no other relationship to the person who performs under that name. It's clear that Smith has some kind of relationship to the character Nigel McGuiness, but to explain what that relationship is would be <a href="../../../n/o/r/Wikipedia%7ENOR_0a29.html" title="Wikipedia:NOR">original research</a> (which is the point I suspect Metamagician3000 is arguing) -- unless someone can cite a published source that explains it. This line of reasoning is good enough for me to exclude this source -- although it does not settle the question people are arguing over above.

<dd>The principal for each is their parent companies, namely DC and marvel comics, however looking at those trademarks illuminated something to me about trademark formats . When a lawyer gets the trademark for another the trademark lists a section for "Attorney of Record" which the McGuinness trademark lacks. In addition the trademarks of those are listed next to type of mark as TRADEMARK while McGuinness is listed as SERVICE MARK, which under glossary is "to indicate the source of the services and to distinguish them from the services of others. A service mark is the same as a trademark except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product." As the McGuinness trademark is for "Sports and Entertainment Services, namely, live and televised performances by a professional wrestler/entertainer." this categorically proves the person who submitted the trademark is the real name of McGuinness. –– <b><a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a></b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../l/i/d/User_talk%7ELid_6320.html" title="User talk:Lid">Talk</a>)</small></sup> 12:48, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Another are the real estate databases maintained by local governments: can you always be certain that if Smith is recorded as the owner of a certain piece of land that it is where he lives?

<p>I think this discussion is missing the main points of having a BLP policy. The underlying idea is "do no harm". How does the inclusion/exclusion of his real name affect article quality? Does any benefit outweigh the harm we are doing by including the name? If the benefit clearly outweighs the harm, then by all means, include it. If the harm clearly outweighs the benefit, then leave it out. If you aren't sure, then figure it out. Why does he not want his real name plastered all over the internet? How would those of us to choose to edit under pseudonyms feel if ED tracked down our real names from, say a 15-year-old usenet posting, and publicised it? Now remember than we are one of the top-ranked websites, and everything that gets published here is mirrored in dozens of places. We can't work on the principle of "you can't stop me, so there!" We don't operate under the ethics of 12-year-olds. Figure out the costs and the benefits of including this information.

<dd>I would prefer it if you did it, as the principle is more important than the personalities. We, individually, don't decide whether or not someone will ever be productive or not. A pure vandal is a special case, but someone hurling poop and swearing is a problem that needs multiple sets of eyes to assess. Part of the problem causing such rancor right now is that some administrators have been personalizing everything, deciding that they, personally, can block someone else for being angry, etc. If you won't shorten the block, then I suppose I will have to. A month's block is usually <i>plenty</i> to defuse a vandal, and, if he's gone away, then he's gone away. If he hasn't, a week or month's block is better than indefinite and still shows up on his or her record. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:38, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is an offensive slang term derived from the senator's name, and thus is not allowed by WP:USERNAME. Indef blocked for inappropriate username. See the rfc also for discussion. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:07, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no objection to an indefinite block for the user name. (I'm not sure how it's a particular slang term as much as it's a pretense to being at the Senator's office.) I remain adamant, however, that personal attacks not be used as justification for long blocks, or even short blocks if there is any ambiguity. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:55, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personal attacks of any kind are not acceptable, and I support the same blocking terms as Geogre.

<p>Hi all. I've just received a death threat from the banned <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECretanpride_4e69.html" title="User:Cretanpride">User:Cretanpride</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HI Khoikoi, perhaps you have not realized how serious I am about adding my previous edit to that article(homosexuality in ancient Greece). Perhaps you have not realized the length I will go to get it. I will present to you an ultimatum now. Either my last edit stays. The one which shows Bruce Thornton's argument, or a young girl named Emily dies because of your unfairness. Am I bluffing? That's not the question. The question is whether you are willing to take that chance. Do you want this with you the rest of your life? You have 48 hours for the article to change to my previous edit or you can hear about this on the news. I am not asking for much. Just two paragraphs which encompass the truth. I hoped it wouldn't come to this. I have wasted two months of my time, I think I should be rewarded. Its your call.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is your fault for ignoring me and never considering my edit. You brought this girls death and you are responsible. But you can still save her by simply restoring me edit on homosexuality in ancient Greece. Not too much to ask. Bye. Bye.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems pretty serious—can anyone tell me what I should do?

<dd>This seems to require a serious effort on the part of wikipedia sysops and higher authorities to track this individual and send the police there. Even if there is no "emily" this threat is probably a federal crime. And if there is an emily immediate action is required.

<dd>The email should have a full set of header information available to view. Depending on your mail client and your settings, you may have to jump through one or more hoops to see these headers. (In Microsoft Outlook, for example, I believe you can right-click on the email subject as it shows up in your list of emails, and select "Properties".)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, the headers you are looking for will start off with the word "<b>Received:</b>" There will generally be 3 or 4 of these.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These headers will allow you to trace the origin of the email. The last one, reading from the top down, will <i>usually</i> contain the IP address used to actually send the email. This will give you the ISP used to send the email. After that, it's a phone call to the cops in the jurisdiction of the IP address. In the case of a direct physical threat of death, as in this case, most ISPs will waive the requirement for the cops to provide a subpoena, and will provide the subscriber info in short order.</dd>

<dd>Even when you all had not agreed, I would have done it. The police will tell you that rule number one IRL is that you NEVER EVER give in to blackmail. This regardless the threat, as it will just fuel further blackmail. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 20:29, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As an aside, police will not always tell you this. It would depend upon the circumstances and in particular the legal and social systems available in the location of the threat. Indeed, there are many instances internationally where the only safe procedure is to submit to demands, and the law enforcement officers will tell you that very quickly. Trite "rules" of conduct, repeated in a safe environment are unhelpful in many real world situations. If any one of you ever has a spouse or child kidnapped by Central American gangs, you had better pay up or your loved one will almost certainly die and the kidnappers/killers will never be caught. This is so true that sometimes a kidnapping does not have to take place, simply a threat of a kidnapping is sufficient to obtain payment and payment is sufficient to avoid kidnapping and the loss of fingers or ears or eyes and such. This is so prevalent that you can purchase Kidnapp and Extortion insurance for overseas travel. The record for return of hostages is quite good... if the payment is made.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, so this was not a real kidnapping and not a real threat to murder. I would not go so far as to say we got lucky because the likelihood of danger was small. Things transpired as probability would have dictated. Kooks abound and are mostly harmless. But I am glad that we did not get an <i>unlucky</i> roll of the cosmic dice. I am glad that we did not face the problem of dealing with the rare case where a kook moves to defcon 5. It feels really satisfying to be all tough and macho -- all the way right up until you actually have to pay the piper.</dd>

<dd>I've just received a call from the police officer; it turns out that he wasn't able to verify the identity that I gave him, so the timing of Cretanpride's second email was a coincidence. Given that email, it seems extremely probable that this was a hoax; while making a hoax death threat is still a serious matter, I think that we can all relax a bit now.

Yes, it was 99.9% a fake threat from a little kid who couldn't get his way - but that doesn't mean he doesn't need to be thoroughly beaten with a clue stick.

<p>User Havoc is posting on my talk page as if he was a moderator or admin of Wikipedia. I am not complaining about content of any edited article but I do not believe it is appropriate for someone who is not a moderator or admin to punish or inform other users of not meeting criteria as if they were in charge. Employees do not punish other employees. That is what the boss is for. I have deleted his "friendly warnings" and advised him to stop on his talk page but he continued to do so. Hyde v 22:21, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's actually entirely appropriate - I've handed out hundreds of warnings and I'm just an editor (1st class lightlap division). You seem to misunderstand the relationship of people here. Administrators are not the "boss", the different between them and normal editors is that they can <i>act</i> upon the warnings that normal editors put on other editor's pages or decide that they have been used incorrectly. As for your particular case, it appears that that Havoc has left two polite and to the point notes informing you that Wikipedia is not a games guide. I have not yet checked the edits and therefore cannot comment upon them (but that's my next action..). --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 22:27, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I concur - however I would note that maybe Havoc could have taken a little more time to explain policy to a new editor (and I'll hold my hand up for taking the same road on a number of occassions. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 22:34, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess I just will not post to World of Warcraft articles. Just about everything I have added to Wikipedia has been edited to the point that there was little left of my additions and it is always considered "cruft" or whatever the heck it is called. I do not feel it is my place to admonish other posters for what I perceive is wrong but it appears to be within the rules to do so. I think it would be best if I stopped being so public from now on.

<dd>No one's 'admonishing' you, nor is this about perceptions. He was simply informing you of a policy you most likely weren't aware of in an attempt to explain why your content was being removed. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 23:00, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Further to the above comments. Don't be too hasty, you clearly know your stuff and could make a positive contribution to the project. Let me make a suggestion, take a few days off or maybe a week. When you get back, discuss the edits you want to make on the talkpage with your fellow editors. Once you have been brainwashed... em.. get a bit more use to the policies and practices of Wikipedia, it all gets a bit more straight forward. Please feel free to drop by my talkpage if you want to discuss this further. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 23:06, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do apologize for being blunt, but this is not the first instance of game guide information I have removed, and as such I have become somewhat harsh in my way of handling it. Specially when it comes to the Warcraft articles, and especially <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classes_in_World_of_Warcraft_1af8.html" title="Classes in World of Warcraft">Classes in World of Warcraft</a> as it all started with me merging nine articles into one. And right after that a merger happened with talents from WoW aswell, making the article even more of a game guide then before. I have also explained not only to hyde v, but numerous other editors about the inclusion of game guide trivia and information, which in turn has lead me to believe that this has in fact been understod as nobody has voiced any opinion on the contrary. I could have toned down my warning, but as I saw it I had given him a fair amount of chance to object to my deletions of said information. Again, my appolagises for being blunt, my intent was never to make you feel harassed, but please do understand my position on this as many articles have been deleted because of the inclusion of this type of information. Thank you. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 06:09, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Potentially defamatory is the difference between:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>he was placed on paid leave while his university reviewed the scientific basis of his work in this area</i></li>
<li><i>who is on paid academic leave due to his apparent misrepresentation that his work had been properly vetted</i></li>
</ol>
<p>The first statement is neutral. The second states impropriety ("apparent" is no defence). There is no suggestion in the article that he misrepresented anything.

<dd>I'd like to second this motion. This user has been involved in an attempt to push POV on all 9/11 articles. His talk page makes both his position and his intent clearly evident for all to see, so I don’t think there is a need to link evidence but I will if requested.

<dd>Morton's use of userspace is hostile, inflammatory, and uncivil. His use of the {{vandal}} template for established editors, as well as categorizing editors into <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_friends_01ba.html#Super_Duper_Friendly_Folks" title="User:Morton devonshire/friends">friendly and unfriendly camps</a> is definitely a violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. His <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morton_devonshire_166d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morton devonshire">contributions</a> show an intermittent use of edit summaries; he is especially prone to not use edit summaries when he is making controversial edits. So far, I'm with you, except for the incident which you brought to the board: the edit in question wasn't vandalism, and you diminished yourself by making that accusation immediately (Morton isn't the only one to violate <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>). However, there's one more thing that you're missing, and that is... this is not the appropriate forum.

<dd>The key point is not just the content of the edit. It is the fact that the same sentence was instated <i>7 times</i>, i.e. each time Jones' name appeared.

I think you've missed the fact that I am one of our already extremely busy admins, and have posted here for confirmation that there are serious points to be addressed with this user, as he is claiming I have a grudge (I didn't know anything about him till a few days ago).

<p>I am not sure why anyone is even bringing up his user page, that space really has no bearing on the issue of the repeated insertion of the line in question. The issue here is his edits, while I think what he inserted is correct, it does not need to be put in 7 times. I think a simple warning that over use of that line is a problem. Jones has claimed that his work was peer reviewed. A college does not put its professors on leave simply because they want to check their work ... I mean seriously ... So the real issue seems to be the over use of the line in question. Again I reccomend a simple warning stating that it does not need to be included numerous times and possibly can be rephrased to an exact quote from a source, to prevent POV issues and rewording problems. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 16:37, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this will stumble into a larger issue after doing a little research. We have Jones used as a source of information in numerous articles and it turns out his work was not peer reviewed as per WP:RS in scientific articles or claims. I also want to point out that it seems everyone has been on the verge of WP:AGF here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Association_of_9/11_All_Sides_Editors&amp;diff=77335125&amp;oldid=77333763" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Association_of_9/11_All_Sides_Editors&amp;diff=77335125&amp;oldid=77333763" rel="nofollow">[99]</a> and perhaps everyone just needs to take a step back and relax a moment. I am not advocating for Morton because I think there is a general over use of that sentence that was attempting to be used, but I think a review of what we use here on Wikipedia from Jones should be considered and the line or mention of his schools lack of faith in his work should be made in a quotation form. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 16:45, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First off, if Morton Devonshire has stated that you (Tyrenius) has a grude against him, that's not a personal attack, but his opinion and we don't stiffle opinions in routine conversations. Secondly, the facts are that nothing Steven Jones has stated about his beliefs on the reasons why the world trade center collapsed has appeared in a single engineering journal or a reliable source because he hasn't had it properly vetted. In fact there isn't anything, aside from opinions, that support the idea that the world trade center buildings were brought down by explosives. No one is POV pushing if they are fighting to only use reliable sources and factual evidence when discussing these affairs. If folks want to believe, just as some do in UFO's and Bigfoot, that something so ridiculous as controlled demolition brought down the twin towers and otrher buildings, go right ahead. Morton shouldn't be (and I don't think anyone really should be) listing other wikipedians that he feels may or may not be "problem users" or cranks, but he certainly can list articles that have been deleted and others that should be if he so chooses. Furthermore, images of folks with tin-foil hats that are free use is a violation of nothing. My basic observation is that folks that believe in the controlled demolition theory of the WTC are either uneducated in the facts, have a strong anti-American bias or a political leaning strongly in opposition to the current American administration, or they are simply trying to disrupt Wikipedia when they create POV fork articles such as the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_demolition_hypothesis_for_the_collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_8913.html" title="Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center">Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center</a>, which has information that failed to meet consensus for inclusion in the main article which is <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_cfbf.html" title="Collapse of the World Trade Center">Collapse of the World Trade Center</a>. This kind of misuse of Wikipedia to advocate or counterbalance factual encyclopedic content is definitely a POV push. Lastly, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_E._Jones_96d2.html" title="Steven E. Jones">Steven E. Jones</a> is kind of the poster-boy of the controlled demolition advocates. He has, however recently been placed on paid academic leave from his university so that they can decide if his work has indeed been properly vetted, as he claims<a href="http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,645199800,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,645199800,00.html" rel="nofollow">[100]</a>--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 17:13, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is not a thread for a discussion about conspiracy theories or Steven E Jones. It has been turned into that, and it is an irrelevance. It is about admin and user conduct.</p>
<p>Very simple points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Morton Devonshire complained that I improperly warned him for inserting the same line 7 times (forget what's actually in the line - that's not the point!). This is a deliberatively disruptive edit, and the warning was in line with wiki policy.</li>
<li>He has been asked by an admin (Guinnog) to clean up his user space and not use it for polemic and provocation. These are attack pages against a large number of people. This is against wiki policy. It is irrelevant what anyone's view is of the people attacked. Wiki is not the place to express it. We are writing an encyclopedia, not carrying out a political campaign.</li>
<li>He has accused me of acting from a personal grudge. This is an attack on my integrity, and violates <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. I have had very limited interaction with this user.</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>If the edit is in fact factual, and true, and sourced by WP:RS and WP:V standards. Then wouldnt the removal of the statement be the disruption and not his inclusion. Wouldnt hiding this fact in a case where he is being used as a source, which in itself might fail WP:RS if it wasnt peer reviews, be pushing POV? I think MONGO has a point that if Jones isnt peer reviewed after all then Morton's edits were in fact for the bettermeant and actually a suitable middleground instead of removing Jones all together as failing WP:RS.</li>
<li>His attack pages are not relevant to this discussion if your complaint is the insertion of the quotation, much like anything you might have done elsewhere or in the past is the subject.</li>
<li>I dont see someone stating they think you have a grudge on them as a personal attack.</li>

<p>I can't see it as a political campaign if Morton Devonshire is working to ensure NPOV is being followed. That sounds like he is trying to defend policy, in fact. NPOV is non-negotiable and the undue weight clause of that policy is being misread by many. Undue weight applies to reliable sources, not personal opinions. Thus, while we can say lots of people believe "A", if we can't find reliable sources that support this belief in "A" from a scientific or engineering background, then it is a extreme minority viewpoint that deserves only a passing mention or no mention at all. This is an encyclopedia project, not a platform for advocacy of an extreme minority viewpoint. Morton may feel you have a personal grudge against him because he is possibly on the opposite side of the argument from him, and your request that he make major changes to his userpage is being done so because you feel insulted? I'm reaching here. I feel that if he doesn't point directly at any editor, but at the opposition in general, he is in violation of nothing...at least he is open and honest with where he stands in the argument.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 18:33, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are indeed reaching, and I would be grateful if you would kindly retract. I have no idea why you should feel that I am personally insulted by people in tin foil hats. I am not a 9/11 conspiracy theorist/researcher, and I am on neither "side" (though I note you consider that there are "sides", which I have also observed) of this 9/11 conspiracy debate. It is unfortunate that anyone editing an article about this topic is now automatically branded as on one "side" or the other. That is not how wiki works. The topic has very little interest for me. What does interest me is maintaining wikipedia policy and objectivity. I see very little evidence that Morton Devonshire is committed to NPOV, but rather more that he is on a campaign against 9/11 "conspiracy theories". That is not exactly the point. The case is rather:</dd>

<li>Misuse of user page for polemic and deliberate provocation. If the same thing were done to, for example, "Republicans" or "Democrats" instead of "conspiracy theorists" it would not be tolerated.</li>

I will also look at these 7 edits he made and if I find them to be excessive, I won't hesitate to let him know. His userpage may be possibly be polemic and provocative, but so long as he follows the policy, he would not be the first editor to post polemic or provocative commentary in his userspace.

There is nothing in my history on wikipedia to indicate that I act out vendettas. Morton has now followed up with some more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=77735992&amp;oldid=77696271" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=77735992&amp;oldid=77696271" rel="nofollow">unfounded observations</a>; see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=77770640&amp;oldid=77763278" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Morton_devonshire&amp;diff=77770640&amp;oldid=77763278" rel="nofollow">my reply</a>. I expect support in maintaining standards. I am not particularly interested in pursuing the PA business right now, but I am interested in getting rid of blatant provocation on his user pages. It is completely inappropriate for a user to choose a group of people they dislike and use wiki space to ridicule them. It is divisive and completely counter to building a harmonious community. I expect your support on insisting that user space is not abused in this fashion. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 20:08, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So he made an edit that was true but uncited, and included it everywhere Jones' qualifications as a BYU physics professor were mentioned. You post on the notice board saying this was vandalism, plus his user page is disrespectful to conspiracists and the memory of Che Guevara. And on top of that, Morton fails to assume good faith about your actions. Did you post here to have your admin actions reviewed, or to request some admin action against Morton?</dd>

<dd>I am on a campaign against conspiracy theories myself; I actively oppose conspiracy theorists using Wikipedia to boot-strap themselves to legitimacy. Conspiracists use a flawed methodology to arrive at their conclusions(at best; often they just spew innuendo). Saying so, and saying so in article space, makes Wikipedia a better encyclopedia. This can be done because there is an extensive academic literature on the subject. Presenting this nonsense as just another legitimate point of view that any reasonable man might hold is like defending sophists, or marketeers, or deconstructionists. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 20:25, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Morton felt persecuted by me, I didn't think it was fair to carry on engaging directly with him at that point, and wished to give him the benefit of wider discussion. I posted both so that my actions could be discussed and also for admin action to address anything necessary.</dd>

<dd>I am sure that maintaining adherence to wiki policies of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">VERIFY</a> will allow readers to gain the facts to make their own judgement. The less involved an editor is with the issues, the better this can be achieved. Pejorative language and <i>a priori</i> attitudes towards any subject are best avoided as much as possible. It also makes collegiality hard to achieve. We have to respect that people hold beliefs sincerely, even if we disagree with them or are sure they are flawed. There is no harm in being polite and refraining from being openly contemptuous to others or using scornful language. The truth will out in these matters.</dd>

<p>Hi. I suppose I feel compelled to respond here, although I really hate these things. I’ve seen the edits that Tom Harrison made to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_demolition_hypothesis_for_the_collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_8913.html" title="Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center">Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center</a> with respect to Steven Jones, and I like his version much better. Thanks. Also, I have taken into account the suggestions some of you have made, and have altered my user and sub-user pages accordingly. I decline to get into a content war with Admins. I apologize for being direct, but being an American, that’s my way: I don’t wish to be involved in continued sessions of dialogue, and choose to disengage to calm things. I hope that you will respect that. Cheers, and happy editing! <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire">Morton devonshire</a> 21:33, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This administrator is abusing his privileges and using his status to advance his own POV. For example, if you go to <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advocates_For_Children_in_Therapy_5219.html" title="Advocates For Children in Therapy">Advocates For Children in Therapy</a> you will see he continues to change the edits of others. In that dispute, he has be uncivil, edited the page when it was blocked, ignored two polls in which he was the only one opposed to the changes, and '<b>refused'</b> mediation. This is not the example that an administrator should set! If you check his talk page you will find may complaints by many others regarding a variety of pages on which he has acted without regard to Wikipedia policy...or claims to act in accord with it, but a reading of the poliy shows that he is only enforcing his biased interpretation. If you need specific page and other citations, let me know and I will provide those. For example, if you go to the talk page for SamDavidson you will see that FCYTravis calls him a meat puppet and claims Wikipedia policy in support of that; despite the fact that a reading of the policy shows that to be in accurate. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERalphLender_bfe4.html" title="User:RalphLender"><font color="green">RalphLender</font></a><sup><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERalphLender_f133.html" title="User talk:RalphLender">talk</a></sup> 13:48, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This IP appears to be a static IP that has been used nearly exclusively over the course of several years for vandalism, nonsense edits, and grafitti. This IP should be blocked, and in any case shouldn't be receiving test1 and test0 warnings.

<p>We've recently had some problems on <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_organization.html" title="Front organization">Front organization</a>, where an anon user edited the article and almost turned the ensuing revert war into a 3RR violation, leaving personal attacks in their edit summaries. The user's motives were then supported by a newly-created account (User:NoLongerScieno), who was immediately blocked by <a href="../../../n/a/c/User%7ENaconkantari_d810.html" title="User:Naconkantari">Naconkantari</a> for sockpuppetry. The user then came onto the #wikipedia IRC channel, yelling about the block and saying that he wasn't guilty of any sockpuppetry, despite the fact that his IP was in the same subnet as the anonymous editor. The user was then kickbanned from the channel, then immediately messaged me (I had been trying to resolve the problem), lying about the kick reason and forging messages from the channel operator who banned the user. No harm came out of this, but now the page in question has been protected, and I'm concerned that the user might be using User:Blainetologist to evade the block. Any ideas? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadow1_a579.html" title="User:Shadow1">Shadow1</a> 17:54, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be fair, I don't think an anon user getting an account really counts as sockpuppetry. Unless he then denies it.</dd>

He's been around for a while, and has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">uploaded</a> quite a few images. Many have been deleted, for various reasons, mostly just for being orphaned fair use images. Several have also had their status questioned for various reasons, such as for lacking sources or for having unlikely license claims or otherwise being suspicous, but have been kept after an explanation has been provided.</p>
<p>However, the more I look into the situation, the fishier it all looks to me. Here are some examples of his uploads that seem particularly odd, in rough chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image:Jgarner9.jpg: First uploaded with a {{<a href="../../../n/o/r/Template%7ENoRightsReserved_3537.html" title="Template:NoRightsReserved">NoRightsReserved</a>}} tag and the summary "<i>Jennifer Garner in Daredevil</i>". After tagging was <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex43223_old_291d.html#Image" title="User talk:Alex43223/old">disputed</a> by <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a>, Alex43223 reuploaded a different photo over it, stating "<i>There was a mistake in the original copy of this photo. I acquired it from a source that claimed all rights had been released. I found out that this was not true, therefore I changed the file to a press release photo.</i>" and changed the tag to {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPromoPhoto_eab3.html" title="Template:PromoPhoto">PromoPhoto</a>}}. In fact, he uploaded two new versions — the first one having the text "<i>www.comicscontinuum.com</i>" on it, while the second one had the text cropped off. Despite this, he later changed the image description to read "<i>Press release photo of Jennifer Garner at an awards show. It was given to me while on the red carpet at the Golden Globe Awards 2005. It was given out freely.</i>" (Compare with Alexavega1.jpg below!) The image was later deleted as an orphan fair use image.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Image:Jerryyang.JPG: Uploaded with a {{<a href="../../../p/d/_/Template%7EPD_b356.html" title="Template:PD">PD</a>}} tag. When the copyright status is <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex43223_old_291d.html#Image:Jerryyang.JPG" title="User talk:Alex43223/old">questioned</a> by <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWater_Bottle_595b.html" title="User:Water Bottle">Water Bottle</a>, an anon pops up on the talk page with the statement "<i>hey alex43223 i kno i told u in da letter dat da pic wuz not copyrightted, but i lied!!!!</i>" Picture is then deleted. (I suppose I should assume good faith here, but it does feel a bit suspicious given the other cases.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/r/i/Image%7EPrisonbars.PNG_ff21.html" title="Image:Prisonbars.PNG">Image:Prisonbars.PNG</a>: First uploaded in 30 December 2005 as {{CopyrightedFreeUse}}. After source was requested by <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmrboltz_9a0d.html" title="User:Admrboltz">Admrboltz</a>, retagged as {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} with the comment "<i>I created this on my home computer</i>". (Note: The image has since been moved to Commons and deleted locally.) Nothing particularly suspicious here, except that none of the user's other uploads show such artistic skills, <i>and</i> that I can <a href="http://www.gngwane.com/2005/09/my_visa_ordeal_.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gngwane.com/2005/09/my_visa_ordeal_.html" rel="nofollow">find</a> <a href="http://misslink.org/children/biblestories/silas.html" class="external text" title="http://misslink.org/children/biblestories/silas.html" rel="nofollow">several</a> <a href="http://searchviews.com/archives/2005/08/breaking_out_of.php" class="external text" title="http://searchviews.com/archives/2005/08/breaking_out_of.php" rel="nofollow">quite</a> <a href="http://www.dtl.org/dtl/letters/soul-spirit.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dtl.org/dtl/letters/soul-spirit.htm" rel="nofollow">similar</a> <a href="http://www.anticorruption.ca/index1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.anticorruption.ca/index1.html" rel="nofollow">images</a> on the web, all clearly derived from a common source, presumably from a clip art package somewhere.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Image:Muirfield cap1.jpg: Claimed to be own work, but first version has "Photo by Jim Mandeville" written on it. Second version uploaded with the summary "<i>First image was copyrighted and wrong one. This is the correct one which I took myself.</i>" — but it's the exact same image, cropped to hide the text. You can even see the bottom of the letter "y" at the top of the cropped version. (If Alex43223 <i>is</i> in fact Jim Mandeville, who seems to be a professional photographer, I can't find any evidence for it. If he was, you'd think he'd mention it on his user page, given what a useful venue for promoting his work it'd be.)</li>

<li>Image:Alexavega1.jpg: Originally uploaded with the summary "<i>This was a photo taken at the Teen Choice Awards - 7/2/2003. It was recieved openly as part of a press kit (taken by the press), and was included in the advertising for the event afterwards.</i>" After <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu badali</a> pointed out that it was taken from <a href="http://www.wireimage.com/GalleryListing.asp?navtyp=SRH&amp;str=Alexa+Vega&amp;styp=&amp;sfld=C&amp;nbc1=1&amp;sortval=4d&amp;PageNum=24" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wireimage.com/GalleryListing.asp?navtyp=SRH&amp;str=Alexa+Vega&amp;styp=&amp;sfld=C&amp;nbc1=1&amp;sortval=4d&amp;PageNum=24" rel="nofollow">[104]</a> (page number corrected in link), Alex43223 responds with "<i>The one on the stated website is obviously taken by a different camera or was given as a violation of copyright.</i>" — despite the fact that the third image on the page (<a href="http://images2.wireimage.com/images/Thumbnail/1333556.jpg" class="external text" title="http://images2.wireimage.com/images/Thumbnail/1333556.jpg" rel="nofollow">thumbnail</a>; the 400px version is no longer avaliable for free) is the <i>exact</i> same shot.

Reuploaded by Alex43223 with the summary "<i>Scanned this in myself</i>". However, the two versions are pixel-to-pixel identical except that the latter has a different rating label photoshopped onto it. Not that there's anything wrong with that, mind you — but why lie in the upload summary, then? This one's just weird.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some more straighforward copyvio cases (like Image:Aps1.JPG) in the user's upload history. Any advice on how I should proceed with this? I'm not quite sure where the best place to discuss such cases is, so I'm posting this here, in the hope that it'll get at least some attention from people with more experience with such things than I am. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 20:55, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is hard to tell if this user is deliberately inserting false information or just simply does not understand what is required. The best way to deal with this is with warnings (many have been already given) and then an escalating series of blocks. 24 hours, 48 hours, a week, etc. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 21:16, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
