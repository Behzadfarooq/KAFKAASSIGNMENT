<dd>As the letter seems to be here, (a link provided through the lovely article on you, Danny), I do not see how you can seriously claim censorship, especially when you so badly demanded that the lovely article on you be deleted.

<dd>Hm, actually I sort of regret the remark that encouraged him to list me on his site.

<p>Just saw this. I was't being uncivil by thanking him for visiting, I was <i>thanking him for visiting</i>. My other note was simply pointing out his hypocrisy.

<dd>Yes, and unfailing politeness even in the face of people who are purposeful vandal/trolls has its advantages too. For one it keeps clean hands and for another it either avoids escalating a situation or deflates it. I wish more people would reallize incivility ot trolls just incites the behavior. I think that is the reason I rarely get any retribution from trolls. I don't block a ton, but I've done enough to know unfailing politeness is more successful than lowering to their level by making fun of them, etc. I'd also argue it's more fun in the end. I think of it like Apu saying "Thank you come again" to someone he's just sent to jail for stealing. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 17:51, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The state of Florida has an invasion-of-privacy statute, and Wikipedia concedes that it is within the state's jurisdiction. This is not about cookies and log access, but rather about the right of a private person to be left alone. Articles on private persons could easily run afoul of this law. Where on Wikipedia is guidance offered to editors and administrators about how to comply with this law? 4.230.153.188 08:26, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, a private individual would have the guaranteed right to privacy, but a public figure does not. That is why celebrities cannot do much against hounding photographers, and magazines and such can publish info about them. So the question remains, is Daniel Brandt a public figure or a private one? The answer seems to be fairly obvious. By starting NameSpace, GoogleWatch, YahooWatch, and now WikipediaWatch (while being self-referential, stilll is notable for one of the most visited sites on the Internet), and since he has been covered in the media as a newsmaker, he has made himself a public figure. If there is an article about a private person, please feel free to point it out, and we'll see what we can do about having it removed. Thank you. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 17:32, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And yet, there is no photograph of him on the web. He doesn't give speeches. He doesn't do radio or TV. Quite possibly a "private person" for legal purposes. The point is, Wikipedia has no guidelines on this -- everyone is flying by the seat of their pants on this issue.</dd>

<dd>There may be no photos of him, but I found articles about him in The Observer, The Ottawa Citizen, Sunday Times (London), Washington Internet Daily, The Christchurch Press, American Libraries, The Irish Times, Playboy, San Jose Mercury News, and many, many other reputible newspapers, magazines, and other publications. He is not a private citizen in this right. We should be considerate to his family, etc. but he is a well-known, public figure. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 18:33, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the notability issue is very important. We should not put information on Wikipedia about private people. That's why Admins have the right to delete personal information, and not just hide it in the history. What makes a person a public figure? Notability. I think the two can pretty much be used interchangeably. It is an importnant issue that Wikipedia faces. A private person has the right to have his or her personal info not disseminated on WP. However, once the person gains noteriety, we have the right to have an article about him or her.

<p>I've gotten two "someone requested a new password" emails tonight, and I haven't used that feature for a long time. Fortunately, the email also tells me which IPs they are using.

<dd>Might be worth filing a bug^Wfeature request, to a) allow someone to suppress the "send me my password" button and b) create a function where an active admin or a steward or a bureaucrat (whatever) can effectively send the password anyway - in other words, you tick a box somewhere, and whilst you can no longer press the button you can go into IRC and ask someone to do it for you. Bit kludgy, though, and would require someone to be persuaded to write it... maybe if this becomes a common problem. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 03:35, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Second, it does not look good for an admin to settle personal grievences using his own blocking powers.</p>
<p>There are established mechanisms for dealing with users with behavioural problems (RfC, RfAr, mediation etc), but blocking someone who insults you isn't one of them. I've asked El C, and he will not unblock, therefore I invite further comment from the community.</p>

<dd>This is too fucking funny. I accused El C of Stalinism, and he banned me from speaking for 24 hours. I'm glad I didn't accuse him of being an ass-rapist. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 03:04, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not clear; I made the same warning weeks ago before ever undergoing any attack by Marsden. I only underwent the latest ones for stepping in while he was attacking other users, without showing any willingness to stop. MCrypto did not seem to bother in studying the case closely prior to coming his so-called <i>clear</i> conclusion, which is false. Point is: the user shows no willingness to stop the disruption. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 20:06, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There is precedent for blocking for personal attacks, under the 'general disruption' clause. This is controversial, however. A casual look at Marsden's history shows recent unpleasantness targeted at El C, Fred Bauder, Jayjg and SlimVirgin. None of this is really grounds for a block by itself, but thse could well be the tip of the iceberg. So I don't really see a reason to doubt El C here, but maybe he could cite an earlier diff or two to clear it up? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 20:23, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree that Marsden has engaged in widespread personal attacks, and dispute resolution is probably warranted. However, I strongly believe that an admin should not block someone in response to a personal attack directed at himself. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 20:28, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>While blocking for individual personal attacks is not policy, blocking for continued personal attacks, especially when combined with other disruptive activities, is not unheard of. Marsden has been quite free with his insults for some time, and not just against El C - there are literally dozens of examples. He has also promoted the claim that editors he opposes are paid propaganda agents, and described those who disagree with him as "Evil".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Marsden&amp;oldid=24641503" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Marsden&amp;oldid=24641503" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> He recruits people to revert war for him,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vizcarra&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23404322" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vizcarra&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23404322" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yodakii&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23404550" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yodakii&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23404550" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amin123&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23463023" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amin123&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23463023" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and even gives them explicit instructions on how to do so.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Huldra&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24213999" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Huldra&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24213999" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Larsoner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24214951" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Larsoner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24214951" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> He has also made it clear that he sees his main role here as "holding a stick over my head"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27004922" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27004922" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and making SlimVirgin's Wikipedia experience "very unpleasant".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=27053850&amp;oldid=27053694" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=27053850&amp;oldid=27053694" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> I think the real question here is, why only a 24 hour block? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:32, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Undisputably Marsden is a problem; it's just a question of what is the appropriate measure to take. I would argue we should use the normal Wikipedia processes for problem users. I recall another editor who couldn't refrain from personal attacks a while back (<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIrate_d7f6.html" title="User:Irate">User:Irate</a>). I would very much like to have blocked him on the spot when he started shouting "s*** for brains" at people (including myself), but, because we have a dispute resolution system, we took him through the process of RfC and RfAr. Eventually he was given a personal attack parole, and then banned. It was long winded, but was fair and accountable. When an admin blocks someone who's just insulted him, it <i>looks</i> like he's settling a personal grievance, and it doesn't <i>look</i> fair and accountable. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 20:45, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It all depends on how disruptive the editor is; some disruptive editors, who contribute in other ways, are taken to RfC and RfAR. Other editors, who contribute little, are simply blocked, and sometimes permanently banned. The Arbitration Committee has actually turned back cases of users who are so disruptive that they should obviously just be blocked, rather than taken through a lengthy Arbitration process. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 21:28, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>There is one problem here. Suppose I see a disruptive user who has been warned in the past, and I decide to block him for some time, then that would likely stand undisputed. Now suppose that rather than blocking him outright, I try to discuss the issue with him and make him see the light. If this works, then I'm happy. If this user instead starts insulting me, then I would be tempted to block him - not for personal reasons, but because I believe I could have blocked him earlier and tried reasoning first, and it obviously failed. See the problem? Obviously admins should never block in retaliation, but I see no problem with them blocking for something that may appear like retaliation at first sight, but at second glance really isn't, e.g. because they had a valid reason earlier and tried something else at first. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 20:51, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An easier solution would be to drop a note on, say, this board, and get other admins to discuss it and implement it if they agree. It is hard to tell to what extent El C's block was a retaliation for the personal attack directed against him immediately prior, but an admin should not be giving even the appearance of such. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 20:57, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>No need; I was <i>only</i> attacked for having tried to stop the disruption, so that is no grounds to withdraw. There were no attacks —but there were warnings— beforehand.

<li>I did indeed read your explanation, but I maintain that it gives the wrong impression when, after someone insults an admin, the admin responds by blocking him. It does look like retaliation, regardless of the motives. You say "no need", but there is a need for admins to be seen to be acting above board. Why not, after having being personally attacked by Marsden, have posted the situation to this board? That way someone else could have blocked (if the case was as obvious as you maintain), and there could be no possible grounds for complaint. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 21:20, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>It dosen't appear that way to me. There were enough administrators and arbitrators on the scene. Even Marsden would not try to pretend it came out of the blue. Your advocacy, therefore, seems hasty. (Un?)Incidentally, I am hopeful you yourself would be able to restrain yourself by refraining from personally attacking me in the course of this particular exchange. Your reference to me as "Nazi-like" very recently was the worse thing I was ever called on Wikipedia.

<li>*sigh*. Why not bury the hatchet? I've already apologised unreservedly; what more would you like? I note that you have also referred to <i>me</i> as "Nazi-like", and that previously, you had, without any provocation, alleged that my (and others') actions were "as far from good faith as were imaginable", and that they "revolted" you.

<li>I recall making an effort to reconcile our differences, but you simply rebuffed it. Again, though, you criticise me for having called your censoring behaviour "Neo-Nazi" like. I regret doing that, and I have, as mentioned, apologised unreservedly. Of course, you have referred to my behaviour as Nazi-like as well, so I have to wonder why you don't take your own advice about "vicious insults"? Moreover, saying someone is acting as "far from good-faith as is imaginable" is a very grave insult, as you are essentially saying the person's motives are as evil as can be imagined -- even worse than any Neo-Nazi's motives. That's certainly the worst thing anyone's said to <i>me</i> on Wikipedia. You seem to understand that insults can hurt <i>you</i>, but you don't appear appreciate that your insults likewise hurt others. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 22:37, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>That wasn't burying the hatchet but continuing to use it with abandon instead of saying: we'll have to agree to disagree. Of course I did not refer <code>to [your] behaviour as Nazi-like</code>. And WP:POINT, Wikipedia as an experiment in free speech, and all the rest that was implied by my charges, does not translate into being titled "Nazi-like." It did seem to me, as it still does now, in being as "far from good-faith as is imaginable," but I never alleged that there was a unified agenda, nor that it was in direct service of the Nazi you recklessly unblocked. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 22:53, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>El C's only "dispute" with Marsden appears to be the fact that he objected to Marsden's continual use of personal attacks.

<li>(bringing conversation back to the left) I don't understand what the fuss is about. Marsden attacked, defamed, and generally acted poorly towards El C. He attempted, and the other users, to reconcile, and when the personal attacks went too far, El C rightly blocked him for a simple twenty-four hours for violation of multiple policies.

<p><code>I'm glad we got to the point where we have an accurate title, and I'm not just saying it because I was the one who came up with it (or borrowed it from EB, rather) &amp; did the renaming; your OT(I) gave me the association of territories being occupied from Israel, and in that sense, not much more clear than OT(P) (!). Anyway, lot can change for the better with gestures of good-will, and such a process will greatly help to distinguish those who aim at positive improvements from the perpetually disruptive [...] But, the bottom line, it's nearly-impossible to operate with all this negative energy that never seems to dissipate. And as a result, an intellectually honest and unbiased presentation suffers, because some are unable to emotionally restrain themselves from repeatedly resorting to personal attacks, simplistic schemes (as well as simplistic conspiracies alleging these, as expanded on above), which then ultimately prove self-defeating and work to perpeturate the bias, by expending so much needless energy in trying to defeat it.

<p>All (and many other instances), of course, before ever being attacked by Marsden myself. So, should I unblock him simply for being attacked in pressing on him (recently; initially, gently) that attacks and disruption are unacceptable &amp; unrpoductive? Or should he be allowed to continue to vicioudly insult and disrupt while an RfC, RfAr, etc. are ongoing?

<p>To generalise, it would seem there has been some change in the community's view on personal-attack blocks over the last year. When posting above, I was recalling old debates such as <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_Personal_attacks_%28old%29_3440.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy/Personal attacks (old)">Wikipedia:Blocking policy/Personal attacks (old)</a> (August 2004), which attempted to establish a provision for admins to block for personal attacks. The proposal was quite well-supported but did not achieve consensus at the time (I voted in favour); opponents argued it gave too much power to admins. Here's the proposal:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Personal attacks are not allowed on Wikipedia. At their discretion, and only after warning the user, sysops may use temporary blocks to enforce a “cooling down” period for users who repeatedly make personal attacks. Blocks made under this policy should be short term – one to three days normally, and a week at most. Although blocks may be reapplied if personal attacks continue, repeated violations should be referred to the Arbitration committee. Sysops blocking under this policy may not block users for making personal attacks in the course of disputes that the sysop is involved in, and especially not for personal attacks made against them, unless the personal attacks also constitute clear and unambiguous vandalism (i.e. replacing their userpage with “U SUCK!!1!1!!”).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems that this formerly-rejected proposed policy, which is very applicable in this situation, is now viewed <i>de facto</i> as acceptable admin practice (for example, El C's block would be acceptable under this provision); I think this is a good thing, but it would be even better if this proposal was now explicitly recognised as official policy. In cases when an admin is attacked, it's more important than usual that he act within clear guidelines, because there <i>is</i> potential for abuse. What do people think: is it time to resurrect this old proposal? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 10:55, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Given the sheer growth of WP since August 2004, I'd say this is reasonable. Also see <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_Personal_attacks_ec18.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy/Personal attacks">Wikipedia:Blocking policy/Personal attacks</a>, which cites a number of uncontested blocks for personal attacks happening already. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 11:14, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Personal attacks are a different type of vandalism. I believe that they should be dealt with more strongly than other types of vandalism. Even if a serious personal attack is made in the heat of the moment, a cooling-down-period block would not be out of place. I think we can all say that vandalism is silly and annoying, personal attacks are nasty. Perhaps <i>nastiness</i> should be the measuring stick for our response to this kind of nuisance. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 12:23, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I kind of disagree with it. Only 24 hours?

<dd>That's no matter. I was being conservative because the idea is that in 24 hours, we should have at least some feedback. Kind of like a placeholder block. Blocks can always be extended. Since I was inviting discussion, I didn't think there was urgency, and kept it at the minimum 24 for now. Which is to say that personally I think it should be <i>at least</i> 48 hours as well, but thought we could agree on the length together.

<p>I would say that El C, as an involved party, should not have blocked; on the other hand, Marsden's comments above suggest to me that, in general, blocking was probably a fine idea. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:54, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

Now he's being even more disruptive; in order to avoid going over the 3RR, he's added a link to a bogus hate site at <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-hating_Jew_3d6a.html" title="Self-hating Jew">Self-hating Jew</a> instead, posted trolling text to a bunch of talk pages about "nigger lovers", and accused <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">User:Bishonen</a> of "helping to promote hate speech". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:36, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I repost here what I earlier posted on Jayjg´s talk-page (and which he has not responded (yet) to):</p>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly: as I recall: Marsden wasn´t blocked for revert warring, he was blocked for personal attacs.</dd>
<dd>Secondly: 69.138.215.194 has been editing since August, he was wished welcome on 22 Aug by user Humus sapiens (who had "noticed high quality of your contributions"...doesn´t sound like H.S. general opinion about Marsdens edits(?))</dd>
<dd>Thirdly: Marsden never edited <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-hating_Jew_3d6a.html" title="Self-hating Jew">Self-hating Jew</a> as far as I can see (which 69.138.215.194 edits now)</dd>
<dd>Fourthly: Isn´t Marsden allowed to edit under his own user-name now? The "block"-period mentioned on his user-page has certainly passed. Cant´t he then edit either under his old user-name, or any new user-name, or anon.?

</dl>
<p>And I repost the response from my talkpage (which was actually responded to 5 minutes before you posted here):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First, continuted disruption, trolling, and personal attacks (e.g. accusing people of promoting hate speech) are blockable offences.</dd>
<dd>Second, 69.138.215.194 is Marsden's IP - I suppose he imagines that using it gives him a measure of anonymity, in order to sow doubt in people's minds as to whether or not it is really him.</dd>
<dd>Third, Marsden has indeed never edited Self-hating Jew before - more proof he is simply Wikistalking me, which, as he has stated clearly, is his whole purpose for editing Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Fourth, Marsden is indeed allowed to edit under his old name, but not disrupt, troll, or attack, under his old name, or under any IP.

<dd>Huldra, don't be unsure about posting here, please post any relevant info and arguments in this thread. It's useful to keep it all together. As for Marsden accusing me of hate speech, it came 9 minutes after I'd reverted his filth on El C's page (a little proud of my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:El_C&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:El_C&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">quick draw</a> there&#160;:-)), so no doubt that was the occasion. Presumably that means I'm now burned as marsden-blocker. Suppose he gets a bot and trolls <b>all</b> admins, will that mean nobody can ever block him again? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a>|<a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:37, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, I´m compromising: I´m posting some here, but the full list is on Jayjg´s user-page, I just copy the "rest" here:</p>
<p>I do not know what proof you (i.e.Jayjg) have that 69.138.215.194 is a sockpuppet for Marsden, but if you say you have proof, then ofcourse I accept if. However, regarding what you write above: "Marsden has indeed never edited Self-hating Jew before - more proof he is simply Wikistalking me, which, as he has stated clearly, is his whole purpose for editing Wikipedia." Is Marsden/69.138.215.194 wikistalking you? I have taken a closer look at the edits of 69.138.215.194 (nb: I have only included the article-pages, not the talk-pages. Also I have not included the very first 4 edits, in August, (all to British Mandate of Palestine) they seem "genuine" pos. contribution). The rest is as follows (roughly! I might have missed some!):</p>
<p>[.....cut out list: full list on Jayjg´s user-page.......]</p>
<p>To sum up: only in <i>one</i> case has 69.138.215.194 reverted/edited just after Jayjg (in <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-hating_Jew_3d6a.html" title="Self-hating Jew">Self-hating Jew</a>). However, about <i>half</i> of <i>all</i> edits of 69.138.215.194 have been just after user <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John_McW_76ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/John McW">John_McW</a>, or they have been reversed by the same user. Indeed, it seems to me that 69.138.215.194 has definitely been wikistalking <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John_McW_76ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/John McW">John_McW</a>, and partially the opposite. (Actually, both user:John_McW and user:69.138.215.194 have been gone from WP for long periods, but if one appear here, then the other seem to appear just afterwards.) Now, if, as you say, 69.138.215.194 is a sockpuppet of Marsden, and Marsden "is simply Wikistalking me, which, as he has stated clearly, is his whole purpose for editing Wikipedia." (according to Jayjg), the why on earth is this sockpuppet actually wikistalking <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John_McW_76ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/John McW">John_McW</a>? I just don´t understand. Regards, <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 09:33, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Huldra, as I posted on your talk page, that IP address is Marsden's, and so it's Marsden's contribs you need to look at, not just the IP's, if you want to see evidence of his harassment of, and personal attacks on, Jayjg, and also personal attacks on El C, Fred Bauder, myself, and possibly others. It all gets a bit much after a while.

<p>Wikipedia has made national news in Norway because of an accusation of pedophilia in the English-language Wikipedia entry on <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jens_Stoltenberg_279e.html" title="Jens Stoltenberg">Jens Stoltenberg</a>, the prime minister.

<li>I know, and looking at the contributions in more detail it looks like a shared IP anyway.

<li>There was a conversation about this at <a href="../../../../no/t/i/n/Wikipedia%7ETinget_1935.html" class="extiw" title="no:Wikipedia:Tinget">no:Wikipedia:Tinget</a> (the Norwegian counterpart to the Village Pump). <a href="../../../c/n/y/User%7ECnyborg_49e4.html" title="User:Cnyborg">Cnyborg</a> has had a conversation both with the <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagbladet.html" title="Dagbladet">Dagbladet</a> journalist and the IT-man responsible for that address. The IP belongs to <a href="../../../b/u/s/Buskerud.html" title="Buskerud">Buskerud</a> county, and is shared by the schools in the area. The IT-man has promised to investigate who is responsible for this, so I don't think that blocking the IP will do much good now. The vandalism is really of a common type, but in more than 90% of the cases the RC patrol will catch it. It was unfortunate that this one slipped through. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:44, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As Sjakkalle says, I've talked to the head of IT service in Buskerud County, and he believes (as I do) that it's a computer at one of their schools. Blocking it would have very little effect on the person who vandalized the article, but would prevent anyone else who gets stuck with that IP-adresse from editing. With school or library computers, I find that a block of 1 to 3 hours does the trick; the person is stopped, and someone else takes over the computer. He asked me for the adress and the exact time; as the person vandalized two articles (Jens Stoltenberg and Red-Green Coalition) over a span of 15 minutes, he/she was logged in long enough that there's a fair chance they can trace it. Since it's against the rules of the schools to use the computers for such activities, they're quite anxious to get to the bottom of it. In other words, we've already done something by informing those responsible for the IP-address, and even if they can't trace it to a particular person, they will talk to the users about this and keep an eye on things. <a href="../../../c/n/y/User%7ECnyborg_49e4.html" title="User:Cnyborg">Cnyborg</a> 12:11, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>I know that this is probably the most incredible thing hearing this coming from my own mouth, but it's true. I have talked to Jarlaxle and he has been unbanned. The important tidbits behind his unbanning include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mediation/Mentorship</li>
<li>A formal apology given to Linuxbeak, Psychonaut, Anthere, NicholasT and anyone else who he may have caused harm</li>
<li>Repair any damage caused by acts of sockpuppetry/impersonation on other Wikis</li>
<li>A probationary period for as long as his defunct ArbCom case originally had set as the penal period (one year)</li>
</ul>
<p>Jarlaxle presented an apology on the #wikipedia channel and was officially welcomed back to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>See? There is always hope, and I am truly proud that we can welcome Jarlaxle back as a productive and active editor.

<p>The backlog on Category:NowCommons is getting pretty huge, and several editors on the talk page have expressed a desire for someone to work on reducing the number of duplicated images. I'd be willing to chip away at a little of this, but <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a>'s comment there suggests that there might be some policy reasons behind not deleting NowCommons images yet (i.e. that it's easier to protect images used here than if they're over on Commons). What's the consensus on this? <b>— <a href="../../../m/c/_/User%7EMC_MasterChef_eb58.html" title="User:MC MasterChef">MC MasterChef</a></b> <b>::</b> Leave a <b><a href="../../../m/c/_/User_talk%7EMC_MasterChef_684b.html" title="User talk:MC MasterChef">tip</a> —</b> 06:19, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am somewhat in the minority on this, but I've never seen much benefit in deleting images moved to Commons. If you assume disk space is not an issue (which is what they keep telling us), then having a local copy increases our control over the image. For example, allowing it to be protected and keeping things in English only. It also avoids the thorny legal issues incumbent with the GFDL in that we must make sure all contributors (and preferably all versions) are carefully documented if an image is to be moved to Commons and the original deleted. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 06:26, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having images at Commons is problematic, because ideally each image should have a reasonably detailed explanatory caption, in the same language as the page that incorporates it and with wikilinks to the Wikipedia that page is part of. That's no really possible in a standalone language-neutral Commons. Basically, Commons doesn't really work. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 06:45, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When images are re-uploaded it is mostly with the intention of using them in other projects. If the English description page is copied along, the user is mention with his user page linked to, the license is correct, then I see no reason not to delete the image, because having copies at different places of an image is bad in case one gets improved.</dd>
<dd>In the link provided, they argue about multiple file version. In my estimation, we need not be concerned about this currently, as I guess the vast bulk of images tagged "NowCommons" do not have multiple version?</dd>

<p>I swear I have a.) lost my mind and b.) have grown soft in my old age&#160;;-)</p>
<p>I have been talking to MARMOT (yes, MARMOT) and after discussing this with a few other administrators, we have decided to allow him to return to Wikipedia. Like JarlaxleArtemis, MARMOT is not getting a free return. The rules and terms of his unbanning include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A formal and open apology written to Linuxbeak, Phroziac, Cool_Cat, and others that he has caused harm to</li>
<li>Mentorship/mediation, which is to be pursued immediately</li>
<li>A probation sentence of one full year from the moment of his unbanning</li>
<li>Ceasing of all harmful activity against Wikipedia and it's users (including IRC)</li>
<li>An indication of behavioral improvement, marked by an RFC, after three months</li>
</ul>
<p>Let it also be known that MARMOT has indicated that he understands that if he takes this display of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> annd abuses it, he will be promptly rebanned and will never be allowed back to Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>So apparently I missed the announcement of Be Nice to Vandals Day, and while the idealist in me likes the idea of reforming trouble makers, if we are going to give them a second chance, have we considered maybe asking for some real life insurance? For example asking them to edit under their real name or provide details about their ISP and who to contact about abuse? Anonymity is a priviledge we enjoy here, but I would feel more comfortable about welcoming back problem users if they were willing to stake their real life reputations on improved behaviour. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 21:25, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The insurance that we have is that any admin can immediately block a known problem user given a single sign of relapsing into old ways.

<dd>Look at it my way, you got them to agree to some strong terms of their reconciliation (or should I say probation and parole?), but in the future when they get tired with mentorship and RFCs, what is to stop them from saying "Fuck this", and starting it all again? A persistent, returning vandal comes to us ready to make amends and concessions and yet in the long run we have no greater power to stop rouge behavior than we did before. Maybe today's vandals will actually decide to walk to the straight path (here's hoping), but in the long run I am sure we will see vandals for whom reform is short-lived. A small number of such persistent vandals represent some of the most destructive influences on Wiki, and if we are going to let them back inside the gates, I would have liked to gotten more in the bargain than concillitory words and promises of mentorship and probation. Oh well, too late now, and still probably better to know what they are up to than not. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 23:07, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Really, vandalism is a very small threat to the wiki, and we're on top of it. So there's nothing much to be gained by rehabilitating editors, <i>in terms of controlling vandalism</i>. However we do have a case here where a vandal who is blocked on sight has expressed a wish to perform useful edits. I don't see any problem with this, none of the change will facilitate further vandalism by that editor, and at the very worst we can go back to block-on-sight. In other words, there is no down side to this. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:25, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to the recent unbannings of Marmot and Jarlaxle, a new cabal/organization/committee has been formed by none other than Redwolf24, Linuxbeak, NicholasT, and Cool Cat. Originally titled the Probation Committee, it is now entitled the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Wikipedia%7EMentorship_Committee_9b60.html" title="Wikipedia:Mentorship Committee">Mentorship Committee</a>. The basic idea is that monitoring users for probation violations was currently too difficult, since one could not put Special:Contribs on a watchlist, say, but rather one had to manually check periodically the user being probated's contribution page to see whether there were any new ones. So, Cool Cat adapted an IRC bot, which filter RC for edits by specified users, and sends them to a channel. Currently, the bot and members of MentCom are in the #wikipedia-probation channel on Freenode. This organization is open to all comers, although the three users specifically assigned to monitoring a probed user preferably are experienced admins, and being on the Board (or being a "Mentifex" as Board members are entitled) is currently restricted to founding members.</p>
<p>The ArbCom seems interested in whether this new committee will work out and intrigued by its potential, as mere hours after the first discussions began in #Wikipedia, ArbCom assigned MentCom to monitor <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> in addition to the self-assigned monitoring of Jarlaxle Artemis and Marmot. Given that each case requires at least three users (preferably admins), and that there are a number of users under probation, more users and esp. admins are needed by MentCom. Volunteers are very welcome. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">Maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">Contribs</a> 02:58, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

The Onefortyone case was closed over a week ago, and he was put on probation. Anyone can enforce the probation. If a group of users wishes to do it in a more organized fashion, that's their prerogative, but that doesn't mean other users cannot. --<a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 04:19, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Raul, I wrote that because we didn't ask for 141 to be assigned us- we assigned ourselves Jarlaxle and Marmot, but we were busy organizing things. It was Fred Bauer (a member of ArbCom, I believe) who told us to monitor 141 mere hours after the page first went up. I think this unilateral, unsought action of his justifies my description. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">Maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">Contribs</a> 04:43, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>It is not allowed to use the tool for political control, nor to apply pressure on editors, nor as a threat toward an editor with whom you are in disagreement. There must be a valid motive to check a user (a bare disagreement with the leaders of a wiki is not a valid motive).</p>
<p>It is allowed to check an editor ips upon his specific request, when this user wants to publicly prove his innocence.</p>
<p>As a reminder, sockpuppets are not generally forbidden (editors may edit wikipedia under several accounts). It is the abuse of sockpuppets use (and in particular voting twice under two different names) which is severally frowned upon.</p>
<p>Notification to the one checked is not mandatory, but checkuser may choose to tell the person checked if they feel it best. Similarly, notification of the check to the community is not mandatory, but may be done as long as private information is not released.</p>

<dd>Sorry, but no dice. I do not believe that "Aetherometry is a thing to believe in" any more than I believe that Quantum Mechanics is a "thing to believe in". What I believe is that Aetherometry is a serious scientific endeavour and should be treated as such. I say this on the basis of having studied and thought about the Aetherometry research papers, which report in great detail the experimental and theoretical methods used. As far as I know, Connoley has done no such thing. To call his appraisal "scientific" and mine that of a "believer" is completely upside down. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankZappo_ec43.html" title="User:FrankZappo">FrankZappo</a> 21:51, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So what? Since when is scientific merit of a research endeavour measured by the size of the "loads of people" who are willing to make pronouncements about it without being bothered by their own ignorance in the matter? If there is anything pseudoscientific, it is the idea of resolving controversies about scientific merit by taking a majority vote among people who are not even scientifically honest enough to withhold judgement on matters on which they have not informed themselves. Pseudoscientific - as in stating conclusions without any willingness to examine the data.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for "personal attacks", in my book the kind of disrespectful, prejudicially contemptuous behavior that Connolley and others have engaged in with respect to the Aetherometry article counts as a much more egregious "personal attack" than any honest and explicit name-calling. It is a personal attack on people's time, effort, work, and good name. The mere fact that Connolley and the other "loads" that come to his support have a prejudice against scientific work whose conclusions dissent from those of officially accepted science does not, in my book, entitle them to this kind of contempt and disrespect towards those who do this work. Not even if Wikipedia has no policies against such contempt and disrespect, or even considers them "scientific". <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankZappo_ec43.html" title="User:FrankZappo">FrankZappo</a> 00:43, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>William M. Connolley 's obstructionist behavior on this entry and on many others in the non-mainstream science is a matter of archival record. The fact that he has a little coterie of people inside Wikipedia ready to support his antics only makes it all the more regrettable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.225.208.18 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.225.208.18_972b.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.225.208.18">contribs</a>)  00:19, 14 November 2005.</small></p>

<p>I have little to respond to the wealth of anonymous comments, or to FrankZappo's latest comments, except to note that the qualities of mind necessary to believe in Aetherometry and the qualities of mind necessary to think that Wikipedia should not, in a dispute between a well-respected scientist and a band of cranks, side with the cranks are remarkably similar. Should you feel compelled to push the issue further, I point out that the very fact of an Aetherometry article - and one that does not label Aetherometry a load of complete and utter crap in the first sentence at that - gives your "field of study" more and more respectful coverage than any other major encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:10, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Of course there are thousands of distinguished and highly respected scientists the world over who, despite William M. Connolley's claims to the contrary, would argue that it's hard to find a crankier modern pseudoscientific enterprise than that of the opportunistic band of cranks behind 'global warming'. These scientists don't, as people like William M. Connolley would have us believe, all work for George Bush or the oil companies. They aren't all, like William Connolley, civil servants working for the British government (who seem to have more time to spend endlessly pushing their dubious agendas on Wikipedia than they spend producing any tangible work for their employers - why is that?) and collecting their paychecks for producing politically expedient cash cows. 'Utter crap', they say about the 'global warming' racket - which they argue is nothing more than a hairbrained, computer-modeled manufacture of global warming - a field fueled only by political interests and not by science. So then it would be NPOV (you know what that is, I presume?) and respectful, don't you think Mr. Phil Sandifer?, to either stop plastering the gratuitous "pseudoscience" label (libel) on the Aetherometry entry in wikipedia - or plaster it on the global warming entry as well, to signal that there are legitimate opposing scientific views on the subject.</p>

<p>From what I've heard on IRC, the HTML tidy somehow deadlocked and caused the whole site to go down. The developers have temporarily disabled it, but as a side effect, it causes some breakage.

<dd>I think the important lesson here is that users should be careful to close HTML tags in their signatures; what we're seeing is errors in the markup that were previously hidden, rather than a new error in the parser. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 23:01, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It looks to me like most of the cases where a &lt;/tag&gt; is beign ignored, tags were nested incorrectly. Tag a would be opened, then tag b, then a would be closed, then b.

<dd>The worst problem seems to be unclosed &lt;font&gt; tags; some signatures simply reset the text with a second tag rather than closing the first. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 23:15, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

When a tag is contained within wikilinks (e.g. the middle link in my signature, [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|&lt;font color=#008000&gt;xd&lt;/font&gt;]]), it does not break. If the link is contained within the tags (&lt;font color=#008000&gt;[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|xd]]&lt;/font&gt;) it breaks. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">xd</font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 23:17, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would be thrilled to death to get rid of all three (images, the 'big' tag, and line breaks). There's no good reason for any of them. Images in particular suck up valuable resources, particularly since the image server has been slow of late. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 18:00, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Images (and long sigs in general) are the tools of Satan. Well maybe not but they are serve absolutely no purpose, the only thing they can do is slow down servers and make the editing page unreadable. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 18:16, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I generally tend to dislike technical solutions that limit user creativity and self-expression. Unless the devs say sig images are consuming a significant amount of resources, I would be opposed to eliminating them. The "big" tag is fairly harmless and frequently identifies user who feel so insecure or so self-important that they need a large sig. Frankly, I think having that information more than makes up for any annoyance that it causes. I can't recall ever having noticed a line break in a sig, so I don't know how I feel about that. Generally though, if you really feel someone's sig is a problem, I think it is better to talk to people about their flamboyant behavior than simply outlaw all sigs of X type. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 18:24, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have at least once seen a sig that crashed my browser because of the image - entirely accidentally, as far as I can tell. I understand the desire for user creativity and self-expression, but Wikipedia is not a message board - it's a serious project.

<ul>
<li>What about a middle route? Don't ban anything (for now), but let those who are concerned by sigs go somewhere and develop some kind of good-practice guidelines (WP:SIGS?). This would at least flag up to new users the types of signs that are considered poor form by some users, what their concerns might be, technical considerations, and some 'good practice' examples. People with problamatic sigs could be pointed towards it, avoiding long explainations on case by case basis, and without instruction creep. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/Doc.html" title="Doc">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 18:42, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would support this. There are plenty of ways to be creative with colour tags and Unicode symbols. Both because of performance reasons, and because of the potential of annoyance (most are unproblematic, but recently nationalist trolls found that they could get each other's goat by including flags in their sigs). But it is not the most urgent of problems in my book. Usually, it should be enough if several people tell someone their sig is considered annoying (doesn't hold for trolls of course). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 19:08, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If we were going to have rules for banning certain things in sigs, we'd have to agree on the rules first.

<dd>Image:Woom.jpg is an unsourced image that looks to be an image of a hilly/mountainous region with the hills in the foreground totally covered in a pine forrest.

The first remark is a clear violation of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">No personal attacks</a>. The follow-up is pretty much a death threat.</p>
<p>I've had some interaction with the person who made the threat, nothing particularly hostile, just some talk page stuff (see, for example <a href="../../../d/e/m/Talk%7EDemocratic_Union_of_Hungarians_in_Romania_9985.html#The_Truth" title="Talk:Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania">Talk:Democratic_Union_of_Hungarians_in_Romania#The_Truth</a>), over his tendency to characterize all Magyar autonomists in Romania as "terrorists". The person on the receiving end of the threat is apparently an administrator on the Romanian Wikipedia, where he says this same person actually makes good contributions about Moldavia. He contacted me by email. He's not sure how to proceed. He thinks he will probably start an RfC, but apparently does not want this person summarily blocked. I told him that seemed to me a remarkably measured response to such a threat, but that since he is the person against whom the threat was directed, in my view it is his prerogative. He agreed with my suggestion that this should at least be mentioned here so that people are aware of the situation.</p>
<p>I have deliberately left out the name of the apparent offender, because I don't particularly want searches on his username to come to this page. I would ask the same of anyone who responds (except the parties directly involved, who should feel free to name names). -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:09, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi folks -- I'm a new administrator, and I'm still looking through the reference material. One thing I am trying to figure out -- other than the address ranges listed on the blocking page, how does one figure if an IP is a shared IP? Also, what would be a standard first block length (for non-shared IPs)? Any tips would be appreciated. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> 05:45, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1. Run a whois search and guess from that (you can also look at the contibution history to see if it contians both good edits and vandalism).2.24 hours.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 05:47, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Basically, if its a dialup ISP, school, or govt whois result, it's probably a sharedip. If its roadrunner, comcast, shaw cable, Bell, etc.. it's probably a semi-static IP, meaning, those users have a dynamic IP but it would only change if they shut-off their router for 3 days or forced a new IP. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Who_d857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Who"><font color="#9999FF">«»</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a><sup><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Who" class="extiw" title="m:User:Who"><font color="#CC6600">meta</font></a></sup> 06:07, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a related question to which I really <i>ought</i> to know the answer by now, but I don't. How do you find out if an IP is an open proxy subject to an indefinite block? <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 15:53, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure how you would know which ones are open proxies, but it would be accomplished by a whois search as well. For example, if you do an IP whois and it comes up as a tor IP address, you'd block that. — <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><span style="color:gray;">Ilγαηερ</span></a> <a href="../../../i/l/y/User_talk%7EIlyanep_ef6d.html" title="User talk:Ilyanep"><span style="color: #333333;">(Tαlκ)</span></a> 18:38, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And another question somewhat in the same vein -- how do I find out if an <i>user'</i>s IP is a shared IP so that I can adjust block time accordingly? --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> 18:20, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Best way to spot shared IPs is find its hostname; if it has "dialup" or "dynamic" or "dyn" in it and is owned by an ISP (use whois to find this), then it's probably a shared IP. If it has "cache" or "proxy" in the name it's probably an outproxy, same thing.</p>
<p>For spotting open proxies: best is to ask <a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">User:Fvw</a> to check, he's good at that. Also, an IP address owned by a hosting company is likely to be an open proxy, especially if it's being used for vandalism. For TOR outproxies, there's a public list of them available through TOR somehow, although I can't recall how just now. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 18:59, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
