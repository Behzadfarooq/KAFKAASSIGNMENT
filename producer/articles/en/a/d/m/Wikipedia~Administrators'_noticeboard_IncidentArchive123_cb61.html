<dd>I really haven't seen any evidence that what Guy was doing was in fact votestacking at all. I personally voted in that article because it was on my watchlist, I think everybody kinda voted at once because they might have been waiting to see what other people's opinions were. I think that it is ridiculous that Guy is being banned for something that almost everybody does when there is a vote going on, after all I wonder how so many people that voted "support" found out that there was a survey going on at that particular moment especially when so many people had never edited the article in question before? That "votestacking" probably occured through E-mail.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 08:31, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kim, this is a controversy to which you are a party, and your "judgment" that votestaking has occurred, it must be said, is subjective.

<dd>If you have a look at the admin who made the first post of this section, you would have had your answer already, and as such, I consider this a act of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith</a>. Furthermore, see, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Arbitration_enforcement_148a.html#User:Guy_Montag" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Arbitration enforcement">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Arbitration_enforcement#User:Guy_Montag</a>, you will see I reported him, but did not do the ban. As such, an uninvolved admin has reviewed it, and come to the same conclusion. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 17:16, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Kim, you were the one who imposed the ban, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABattle_of_Deir_Yassin&amp;diff=64143684&amp;oldid=64070370" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABattle_of_Deir_Yassin&amp;diff=64143684&amp;oldid=64070370" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, so I'm not sure why the question is in bad faith. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 19:28, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Kim also seems to have a history of using his administrative powers to gain an advantaqge in disputes that he is a primary party to as anyone who was involved with the "Israeli apartheid" mess knows. As someone once said- "Assuming good faith does not mean be stupid".- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 20:48, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>She was the one who reported Montag as well. I suppose someone who is on probation is subject to the subjective judgment of any admin, but I think Kim needs to think long and hard about the difference between her role as an editor and as an admin. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 13:21, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was also concerned to see that Kim van der Linde, who is involved in this dispute, got Guy banned from the page, started a poll about the title, ignored the results of it, then misused her admin tools to move the page against the poll results, then felt obliged to post a tag declaring that Guy is banned from the page. It's up to the admin to do that; maybe he forgot, or maybe he intended not to. I'm worried about the extent to which Kim van der Linde seems to be taking every opportunity to cause a problem for pro-Israel editors, and is consistently confusing her admin/editor roles. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 13:38, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

At 12 and 13 July, Guy Montag allerted 5 editors, with known preferneces, on the poll, who all voted in the days after in favour of the by Guy Montag preferred name: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Leifern&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63441574" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Leifern&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63441574" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Moshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63432051" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Moshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63432051" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:IZAK&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63440858" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:IZAK&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63440858" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Crzrussian&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63544296" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Crzrussian&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63544296" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Irongaard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63825645" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Irongaard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63825645" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.

After that, I have closed the move poll, which was now corrupted by votestaking, and based my conclusion from before the votestaking (roughly 4 days into the poll), which was in favour of moving back. The final tally was no consensus (15-15 (12+3 to Deir Yassin incident), which indicates that the original contested unilateral move was not supported by the community. As suchm, I have moved the article back to the original name.</p>

<p>I have no involvement in this dispute and I don't remember ever editing pages on the Middle-East - but I do have some experience carrying out moves requested on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>. I think that Kim van der Linde should not have closed the debate herself, having taken part in it. In spite of that, having spent some time looking into this, I agree with her analysis. The vote solicitation by Guy Montag clearly tainted the vote. His original move was objected to almost immediately. The user is on probation for biased editing on articles of this kind. This all seems to speak fairly clearly to moving the article to the name it had at its creation and which it still had last month. I've seen no rebuttal to this - can anyone offer one? Sarah? <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 20:07, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Haukurth, I have no opinion about the title, and don't know anything about the arguments. My only concern is that we're calling an editor's attempt to get help from other editors "vote-stacking," when editors are in fact encouraged to involve other people in disputes and polls. Had he posted to 50 talk pages, I can see the grounds for concern, but five seems legitimate enough to me, and the fact that he was doing it openly on talk pages is another factor in his favor. There's probably a guideline about this somewhere, so maybe I should look around. I'm also concerned about Kim's comment that "Guy Montag allerted 5 editors, with known preferneces ..." How could she know what these editors' preferences were regarding what to call the Deir Yassin battle/massacre, if they hadn't already commented on it; and if they had already commented, then why is she concerned about their involvement? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:18, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Very often you can make a good guess what opinion people will have on a given dispute and selectively contact those you think will agree with you. I know, I used to do this sort of thing back in my move-warring days... In this case Guy was, it seems, 100% successful in contacting the right people.

<p>I really haven't seen any evidence that what Guy was doing was in fact votestacking at all. I personally voted in that article because it was on my watchlist. I think that it is ridiculous that Guy is being banned for something that almost everybody does when there is a vote going on, after all I wonder how so many people that voted "support" found out that there was a survey going on at that particular moment especially when so many people had never edited the article in question before? That "votestacking" probably occured through E-mail.</p>
<p>On another note, Kimv really seems to have an issue with using his administrative powers to gain an advantage in a dipute that he is a primary party to, while it is a step forward that he just admitted that he shouldn't have done it, I really must question his veracity considering the fact that in another post above he basically said that he didn't act inappropriately because people weren't "assuming good faith" whatever that means.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 21:00, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Kim, I think this is the type of situation that <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conflict_12e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conflict">Wikipedia:Naming conflict</a> (originally developed by <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a> and myself) was written to resolve. The guideline states that "Wikipedians should not seek to determine who is "right" or "wrong", nor to attempt to impose a particular name for POV reasons. They should instead follow the procedure below to determine common usage on an objective basis." It sets out three key principles, the most important of which is "The most common use of a name takes precedence."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Note that the issue of POV naming is specifically <i>excluded</i> from consideration by the guideline - if a subject is particularly contentious, there will almost always be someone who disagrees with the article title. The guideline sets out the use of objective criteria, such as frequency of use, and discourages the use of subjective criteria, such as political acceptability.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The name "Battle of Deir Yassin" seems to be virtually unknown (only 81 Google hits) while "Deir Yassin massacre" seems to be much more widely used (21,100 Google hits - Wikipedia entries excluded in both cases). Using a novel term for a well-known historical incident seems to me to be a classic example of impermissible <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> ("defining new terms"). Unfortunately it appears that the POV-pushers have taken over on this article; I think the page's move permissions will need to be locked and the case referred for arbitration. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 23:09, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is exactly the kind of title that shouldn't be decided by a Google search, in my view, because of the number of highly POV sites that get included. What I do with contentious titles is try to find out what mainstream academics call it. Maybe that could be done here: try to find out what academic historians refer to it as? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:43, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If it's any help, I just did a Google Books search for the two terms. 56 books use "Deir Yassin massacre" and only one uses "Battle of Deir Yassin" (citing "a motion [which] was put before the Jerusalem city council to honor the five Zionist patriots who "had fallen during the battle of Deir Yassin"." - the motion failed after a public outcry.) 142 books use the terms "Deir Yassin" and "massacre" in close proximity. Google Scholar returns 51 articles using "Deir Yassin massacre" and none at all using "Battle of Deir Yassin". All of the encyclopedia entries that I've found relating to Deir Yassin refer to the "massacre" at "Deir Yassin" (cites: <i>Brewer's Dictionary of Modern Phrase and Fable</i>, <i>A Dictionary of Contemporary History - 1945 to the present</i>, <i>A Dictionary of Political Biography</i>, <i>The Crystal Reference Encyclopedia</i>). None refer to it as a "battle".</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So it seems that the term "Battle of Deir Yassin" is not only little used but is associated with a specific, highly controversial POV - rather akin to calling the <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> the "Battle of Srebrenica", as some denialists are wont to do in that case. This seems a very clear-cut case of a non-mainstream term being adopted for presumably POV reasons. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 23:55, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not believe a move war is forthcoming Kim as long as you stay out of it. I reverted your initial move because of your completely unacceptable behaviour there. If Guy Montag's initial move was done without consensus, then it should have been reverted, and done so swiftly. You starting a poll on the matter, rejecting the legitimacy of the results when they failed to go your way, and then making an out of process move however, was farcical, especially given your current involvement in an ArbComm case on this very same matter. The move war was not the result the intractability of the issue, but rather a response to your complete lack of standing to make the aforementioned move. This entire move war could have been avoided if you had bothered to act in a way even vaguely resembling what is to be expected of admins. Protecting the page is thus likely unnecessary, as without your involvement in the move, I do not expect there to be serious objection to the page remaining there while debate continues on the talk page. <a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibigon_e00e.html" title="User:Bibigon">Bibigon</a> 11:27, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If Kim needs to "stay away from the situation completely", as Slim suggests, then so should Slim, myself and ChrisO. However, I don't see the point in delaying this - Guy Montag changed a long-established article name without consensus. His user page, <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Montag_3a27.html" title="User:Guy Montag">User:Guy Montag</a> identifies him as a supporter of the Irgun, the Revisionist Zionist armed militia identified as perpetrating the massacre so his interest in choosing an equivicating title for the article is clear. If a Stalinist tried to retitle "Katyn Forest Masscare" to "Battle of Katyn Forest" we would not permit it, even if he was able to rally the support of his friends in a poll.

<p>I'm rather troubled by the problems which <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> has reported over at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html#Battle_of_Deir_Yassin.2FDeir_Yassin_massacre:_move_poll_closure_review_requested" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI#Battle of Deir Yassin/Deir Yassin massacre: move poll closure review requested</a>. As I've posted there, the article's current title of "Battle of Deir Yassin" violates <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conflict_12e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conflict">Wikipedia:Naming conflict</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> (it's a novel term with negligible use outside Wikipedia - only 81 hits versus over 21,000 for the alternative "Deir Yassin massacre"). It also probably violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a>, as it seems to be a novel and minority-POV term for an historical incident which is generally known by a different name. (It's comparable, for instance, to renaming <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> to "Battle of Srebrenica" or <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_War_of_Independence_edf0.html" title="American War of Independence">American War of Independence</a> to "War of American Aggression".)</p>
<p>In the light of these issues I would normally simply move the article myself. However, the page has already had a move war today and sparking another wouldn't be helpful. Ordinarily, a move poll would be a good alternative. However, there has already been a move poll in which the participants deadlocked, with many on both sides explicitly stating POV reasons for their votes (see <a href="../../../d/e/i/Talk%7EDeir_Yassin_massacre_28e8.html#Clarification" title="Talk:Deir Yassin massacre">Talk:Deir Yassin massacre#Clarification</a>). There seems to have been relatively little consideration of what Wikipedia policy and guidelines require. Starting a new move poll would undoubtedly bring out the POV warriors again and, unfortunately, it's more than likely that they will again ignore policy and vote for their personal POVs. Are there any other alternatives short of taking the whole thing to the Arbitration Committee? -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 23:33, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps something can still be salvaged? You can look at who is supporting and opposing, and start a discussion with each, one at a time.

<dd>Unfortunately I've found in instances like this (<a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> comes to mind) that POV warriors usually won't agree to anything other than their own POV. Am I right to think that the Mediation Committee can't do binding mediations? Perhaps this is where we need some sort of intermediate stage between the Mediation Committee (non-binding) and Arbitration Committee (binding but not usually dealing with content disputes). We really need to have some way of dealing with these disputes that would involve taking them away from the POV warriors and giving them to neutral editors or administrators who know, understand and respect Wikipedia policies. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 00:50, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although formal mediation isn't binding, I think most editors would respect the conclusions of it. I think the key in this case is to use the term most often used by academic historians i.e. academics who are actually employed as historians by universities. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 11:45, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quick and dirty method is to attract as many uninvolved editors as quickly as possible, because POV warriors work by fighting in packs and outnumbering their opponents. But polls like that are almost always confrontational, so it would be better to try some form of mediation (formal or informal) as Kim suggested. Even if it fails then it's something to show to other users who can determine for themselves what caused it to fail, if it's because someone wasn't cooperating then that will be detrimental to them. A good first step would be to do a survey of the academic literature to see what name is more commonly used, Google is unlikely to settle this one. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 01:01, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the suggestion. I've done a quick check on the literature using Google Books/Google Scholar, Amazon's "search inside" feature and a number of encyclopedias on Xreferplus. It almost exclusively refers to the events at Deir Yassin as the "Deir Yassin massacre", the massacre at Deir Yassin and similar formulations. None use "Battle of Deir Yassin". So it seems plain enough that the article's current title is a novel term. The problem is, of course, that the POV warriors <i>don't care</i> about WP:NOR, WP:NC and all the rest. Mediation is certainly appropriate though I wonder if it's ever likely to work in a situation where the participants are riding roughshod over Wikipedia's fundamental policies. I suspect it'll probably end up in arbitration, one way or another. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 07:38, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thionk is a main problem for wikipedia, as the focus is consensus and prevention of disruption, and not so much upholding basic policies (Such as NPOV of which Jimbo states: <i>NPOV is "absolute and non-negotiable."</i>). However, in practise, NPOV is negotiated, just as other unnegotiable policies such as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. The bigger question is, can these policies be enforced, or are they negotiable? -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 09:43, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> is right. Discussion is the solution. As an experienced mediator, Kim is likely picking up on the fact that you are in too big of a hurry to settle the dispute. Having an article in the The Wrong Version is going to happen for some of the parties in the dispute. Mediators (and experienced editors) need to reinforce the idea that Wikipedia is not going to be ruined by having an article in the The Wrong Version. IMO, mediation goes astray once you began reverting or making moves based on the idea that there is a wrong version.

Slim is one of the admins against whom sanctions are being proposed - Fred Bauder proposed a one month ban - there have been no action proposed against Kim, nor is she accused of having participated in the wheel war that has gotten Slim in trouble.

<dd>Homey, quit it. You and Kim van der Linde have caused the entire dispute at Israeli apartheid, and you kept it going at maximum heat and intensity, because that's how you get your kicks at Wikipedia. I've never seen such disregard for the rules about using admin tools between the pair of you. The evidence hasn't yet closed, by the way, and I'm not going to argue it out with you here, because it would make your day. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Slim, you brought up the arbcomm case and misrepresented it by claiming that Kim was "central" to it while you are "barely involved" when in fact you are facing sanctions and she isn't. As for "disregard for the rules about using admin tools", you are the one who participated in a wheel war, not Kim (or myself) so stop deflecting (or projecting). Homey 17:21, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you serious? I'm sure that not even you can actually believe that that makes sense, You proposed a bunch of wierd and inappropriate "solutions" that nobody supported and then you claim that that shows that Slim is more involved with the dispute than you or Kim. The fact that there isn't a bunch of stupid proposals involving you and kim really just shows that other people aren't as spiteful or inappropriate as the two of you. I guess the fact that there is nothing on that page that explicity calls for your adminship to be taken away and for you to be banned must show that you are a completely neutral and uninvolved party or at least that you did nothing inappropriate at all in that conflict, is that right?- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 01:22, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it clearly inflames a situation that was almost over by re-banning Guy. It was already decided that the previous block was inappropriate, and that Guy's actions did not violate the terms of his probation. I am rather uncomfortable with the fact that you would ban Guy for such a similar infraction, I think your actions amount to a wheel-war and I would recomend that you undo the ban, and first discuss the situation here and with other administrators that were involved in the original dispute above.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 01:32, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Guy has informed me that he will be requesting permission for the use of the copyrighted text. I have asked another couple of admins to check over my ban, and if they disagree then sobeit.

<dd>Francis, as you recently commented on some of the issues on that page on the talk page (as an editor, not as an admin), and as you took the opposite position to Guy, calling his position "farcical," it would probably be better if you unbanned him and allowed an uninvolved admin to take a look at the situation. I've also left a note on your talk page that shows one of the alleged copyright violations wasn't in fact copied at all. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:18, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just for the clarity, only a fraction of the copyright violations are reporetd at the talk page.

<dl>
<dd>It does seem that the article is/was a patchwork quilt of material copied from different places. Whatever we may think of the merits of Guy's version, it's risky for us to have an article appears to be effectively a copy-and-paste from multiple copyrighted sources. The fact that Guy is saying <i>now</i> that he's requesting permission for the use of the copyrighted text is obviously an acknowledgement that he knows he didn't have permission before. As breaches of probation go, I'd say this was at the high end of the scale; the ban seems reasonable in the circumstances. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 08:04, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the article is that much of a convoluted collection of copyvio, the only solution is to delete it completely and rebuild from scratch, IMO.

<dd>Yeah, I'm going to block both of them for 48hrs. Frankly some of the material discussed isn't for me to understand - well I couldn't see anything obvious from the article edits, but some of the talk page edits seem rather bizarre to say the least and some of the knockabout tone and inappropriate language is very disconcerting. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 06:17, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Basically Aryan argues from a hard Hindu POV, and Elven is oppposite that.

<p>Having seen both these users (ARYAN818, Elven6), I endorse these blocks. Both of these users spent most of their time in disrupting the articles and attacking other editors, without adding anything fruitful to the articles in question. ARYAN818 has already been blocked several times for his user name, though he claims 818 is just his area code and has no neo-nazi connotations (though his frequent edit-wars in <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> provide an interesting insight). I suggest other admins keep an eye on the pages referred to above as frequent edit warring continues to foment there. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 07:37, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>His articles of interest (and manner of edit warring) lead me to believe that he is not a neo-Nazi. While this can also be easily faked, his name in the email address he used to write to the unblock mailing list also had "Aryan" as a first name. Maybe he should be blocked for edit warring, but I don't think he should be indef blocked unless he shows more serious behaviour. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 13:59, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Neo-Nazis use the code number "88" ("HH" = "Heil Hitler".

<dd>And Chinese people use "88" as a good luck number. I've seen plenty of people with "88" at the end of their user name (I mean email address and user names outside of Wikipedia, I don't know anyone here IRL), and they're about as Neo-Nazi as I am. I'd never heard of this 88=HH="Heil Hitler" stuff until here (and as a side rant, Buddhists can't show a certain religious symbol because of the damn swastika). And he's not 88, he's 818. Look, I'm not saying that it's not serious, but there is such a thing as <i>too</i> sensitive. This guy is an edit warrior, sure, but looking at his edits, he doesn't strike to me as a neo-Nazi (at least, not yet). That means that he's certainly a good recipient of a block if he's a persistent edit warrior, but it'll take more evidence to indef-block him for having a neo-Nazi username. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 04:17, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I thought this had been pointed out already, but in the same way that 88 means HH, 818 means HAH, or Heil Adolf Hitler. And there's the <i>tiny</i> matter of the fact that the code is preceded by the word Aryan. If his username was CuteFluffyKitten818 it might be different, but it's not. The claim that it's a common name sounds fishy to me - I've never heard of anyone called 'Aryan', and after going through two disambig links I only managed to find a single person called '<a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya_%28actor%29.html" title="Arya (actor)">Arya</a>'. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 12:36, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've already asked Essjay on his talk page to clarify this<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Essjay&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65415883" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Essjay&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65415883" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>, as I feel it is questionable. The comments by which led to the block of <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">User:CovenantD</a> are these: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65191174" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65191174" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65196448" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65196448" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65257141" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65257141" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>.</dd>

<dd>Essjay justified his block on the grounds of disruption. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=65257711&amp;oldid=65257141" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=65257711&amp;oldid=65257141" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CovenantD&amp;diff=65257439&amp;oldid=65218171" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CovenantD&amp;diff=65257439&amp;oldid=65218171" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> I find this highly questionable. I'm concerned that blocking was taken before any other form of dispute resolution. Blocks should be preventantive, not punitive, and as I commented to Essjay, this smacks of punishment to me. Looking at the block log <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:CovenantD" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:CovenantD" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>, Essjay describes the disruption as being: "incivility and borderline personal attacks at RFCU". Now borderline personal attacks are no basis to justify a block, and nor is incivility. <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> is clear on what constitutes disruption:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think this is a clear case of a badly issued block. Given the number of positions Essjay holds on Wikipedia, I would hope there are other issues behind this block. Otherwise, to me, it creates suitability issues for some of them. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 21:27, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think it fair to ask Essjay to explain his block here before speculating further. We need to be clear, though, that the comments CovenantD made on the RFCU page were highly, highly insulting and completely inappropriate. I don't know where he got the idea that such behavior could ever be acceptable. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 22:51, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's fair to say that CovenantD lost his temper and said some inappropriate things in his frustration. It's also clear that CovenantD was being extremely impatient with RfCU, which has always been a slow process, but as he noted it was his first RfCU and he may not have realized how long they take. I think these are mitigating factors that should be considered. But I don't see what's "highly insulting" about the remarks, nor do I understand the "abuse" you cited in your initial decision to reject. I'm curious to know what you were referring to. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 23:07, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't know if you are reading different comments than I, or reading them in a different light, but while I agree they weren't helpful and were pretty negative, I don't see anything "highly, highly insulting" in any way. --<span style="background: #CCEECC;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickstart70_e0ea.html" title="User:Kickstart70">Kickstart70</a></span>-<span style="background: #CCCCEE;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User_talk%7EKickstart70_36c5.html" title="User talk:Kickstart70">T</a></span>-<span style="background: #EECCEE;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kickstart70_b60c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kickstart70">C</a></span> 23:09, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm not convinced of that at all, no. The first comment I link to above is an expression of frustration, after all, Wikipedia is not meant to be a bureaucracy and here is someone running into a bureaucratic log-jam. I don't think anyone is being insulted other than the process. The user showed good faith in asking how long it would take, and having received no reply over 24 hours later frusratingly quesried no response. The rest of his comments seem reasonable considering the replies given. I think your response there is just as inflammatory, to be perfectly honest. I can't see how you were personally abused. Nowhere on the page does it indicate length of delay in getting a response. The first comment is not a personal attack in any shape or form, I can accept a case being made that it is incivil, but it's not cut and dried. The other comments are attempts at fixing a perceived flaw in the system. I think there's demonstrable good faith in Covenant's prior edits, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64978667" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64978667" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64795298" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64795298" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>, so I think respondents should have assumed good faith, and I don't think they have. I think this situation was escalated by the participants a lot further than necessary, and I think in disregard for user conduct policies. Let's be clear, no-one's conduct is acceptable after CovenantD expressed frustration, but nothing that needed blocks to be issued for. The phrase "storm in a tea cup" springs to mind. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 23:15, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>His remarks go far, far beyond normal frustration, and his insinuations were maddening. Checkusering is extremely stressful work, and Essjay's right about the repeated abuse we experience carrying out our task (the nasty emails, the death threats, the tirades, the incivility, the refusal to believe us when we identify sockpuppets, the conversations with Willy on Wheels). This is a question of customer service. He asked for something; fine. He gave no indication that the request was pressing–if it was an emergency one of us could have been directly notified. He then began making a series of personal attacks, each worse than the last. Finally, I have some time and I wander over the Checkuser page. This is what I find. It's always nice to know that the hours upon hours of sacrifice are appreciated. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 23:21, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please, asking seriously, give us direct links to the 'personal attacks'. I, for one, am not seeing anything that qualifies under any reasonable definition.

<dd>Nope, I don't see that they do go beyond normal frustration at all. Given your answer it appears you had the wrong frame of mind when judging his comments. The user had already noted he was new to the process, and was suggesting reasonable ways to fix the process based on having no understanding of the process. He did give an indication that the request was pressing, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64978667" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Samuel_Luo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64978667" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>. I'd also note you have no idea whether CovenantD was undergoing stress caused by his mediation of the dispute at the page indicated. All of us are volunteers. You criticise CovenantD for his frustration, yet seem oblivious to your own frustration and posting based on that. Your actions are equatable to CovenantD's. DOes this mean I should block you for 24 hours? I still can see no personal insult to you personally. That you took comments personally is one thing; that they were meant personally is another. I don't think you have considered the possibility that any attack was meant personally, but rather at the system which appeared to the user to be broken. If no-one watches the page for 24 hours, is it not reasonable to ask if we can have more checkuser enabled editors? Especially if you are told there are only 2 active in the 14. That seems like a flawed process to me. We all make hours and hours of sacrifice. I'm afraid to me your contention that a series of personal attacks were made is not born out by the edits in question. I accept the clerks responses were perfectly polite. I can't see that CovenantD's response was impolite, and I can't see how you and Essjay justify your responses, nor Essjay his block. I'm also concerned by the flaws this dispute throws up. Should checkuser requests be judged on the merits of the case? If not, there is a worrying precedent set here. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 23:46, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I'd worry about that sort of abuse causing our (volunteer) checkusers to "take a break" and cause other checkuser requests to lag, just because one person was impatient. Blocked or not, if CovenantD was that worked up over something on Wikipedia, it's about time to go do something non-Wikipedia for a bit. I'd suggest the new Pirates movie. *nod* Very good.

<dd>I can't quite balance one volunteer's frustrations higher than another volunteer's. They all impact upon Wikipedia. If that's how the checkuser system operates, I'd question considering another model. But CovenantD tried that and was blocked. He did do something else for 30 hours. I don't know. I remember voting in Essjay's RFA. I just can't see where Essjay got the idea these were blockable comments from. I can't see that no-one can accept some fault here or extend some understanding and good faith. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 23:53, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hadn't commented on the block at all, and I don't plan to.&#160;:) I'd like to see the block pass, then all sides forgive and forget. While overhauling the current system might be good, I do beleive that there are regular proposals on how to do so and none that I know of have passed. As far as volunteer status goes, imho the reason Essjay has all those nifty +flags is because he's trusted by the community to do the right thing: If a resource (such as active checkusers) is endangered, the community should either try to create more of the resource and/or protect the resource they currently have. Verbally assaulting the resources simply causes an already endangered resource in the persona of active checkusers to potentially vanish. <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 00:10, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Honestly, I don't see how one sockpuppet voting in a straw poll can make all that much difference to an article. Even so, I made a very polite response to CovenantD's nagging and suggested an alternate means for resolving the article dispute he obviously feels strongly about. His response was to dump on the checkusers (as a whole, as I read it). To paraphrase Essjay, people forget that nearly everybody working on wikipedia is a volunteer. Perhaps some members of the Arbitration committee should work on the RFCU page instead of the 28 outstanding cases they have right now. Or Brion V could drop his development work on the wikimedia software to help CovenantD win some content dispute. Last week, Essjay identified and reported a long-time apparently "good" editor who had a long-term record of creating vandal sockpuppet accounts, and the community reaction was a big yawn and a week long block. This week Jayjg's integrity has been publicly questioned in at least two places by an <i>administrator</i> he caught using a sockpuppet to evade a block for 3RR, and Mackensen has been harranged on his talk page over at least three declined requests before CovenantD came along. You're lucky to have checkusers at all, and you may find yourselves looking back on the halcyon days when a checkuser request took <i>only</i> 2 days to be answered. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 00:43, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Absolutely, Thatcher131. Part of the problem with checkuser is the difficulty in the process that's assigned to it. <i>Technically</i>, I could do the actual checkuser lookup, but <i>socially</i> I wouldn't touch it with a fifty foot pole manipulated by a radio-controlled robotic arm. Look at the Socafan (or whatever his name was) incident where he griped about Essjay revealing the <i>country</i> in which he resided. Actually, look at every five or so RFCU requests since the page began: there's no shortage of gripes and abuses heaped upon those who we're supposed to be trusting with this sensitive information. Now, if he took all the usernames that edited <a href="../../../t/i/a/Tiannamen_Square_70ca.html" title="Tiannamen Square">Tiannamen Square</a> and checkuser'd them and reported them to the PRC, I could see that being an issue. If I had someone request that I write an article on my talkpage, I'd consider it. If they demanded such and were nasty about it, I'd tell them to go bugger off in so many words. I think the exact same thing happened here, just with different privelege levels involved. <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 00:58, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would not have complained about the revelation of a country had it not been for absolutely no reason - the request lacked any basis and should thus have been declined, the fact that it was not revealed a bias - and if Essjay had not written: one is from country x, the other from country y, my geography is bad but I guess they are close so it might be a sock.

<dd>On what Thatcher has said, it used to take a lot longer, and the page was considerably less nice than it is right now. Also, the diffs presented are not entirely perfect, as shortly after making a comment, ConvenantD changed the wording from "Time to get more people." to "Time to replace some people.". Basically a call to fire some checkusers and get new ones because they aren't responding <b>instantly</b> to a request. There's no timeframe listed there, insted a resort to attacking the a volunteer process to use a sensitive tool. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 01:24, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I read it as "replacing the people who aren't actually doing any checkusering", but I guess I assume good faith from an otherwise good editor. I do note that the people claiming CovenantD was making personal insults have not responded to requests to specifically point out those personal attacks...and that was the reasoning behind him being blocked anyway, wasn't it? --<span style="background: #CCEECC;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickstart70_e0ea.html" title="User:Kickstart70">Kickstart70</a></span>-<span style="background: #CCCCEE;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User_talk%7EKickstart70_36c5.html" title="User talk:Kickstart70">T</a></span>-<span style="background: #EECCEE;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kickstart70_b60c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kickstart70">C</a></span> 04:43, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm really moved to wonder about the motivations of those who have stirred this up so much; hundreds of similar blocks are made each day, and none ges so much as a word, much less this sort of treatment.

At any rate, the community shall have what they desire: I'm joining the other 13 who don't go near RfCU, and I've encouraged Mackensen to do likewise; the fact that nobody could be bothered to think "Hmm, this might leave us with nobody willing to do this" indicates to me that the community really doesn't care if RfCU has 1000 backlogged cases. I will, of course, continue to be available for requests from the Arbitration Committee and the Foundation Office, as are the other 13; to assume that not working on RfCU = not running any checks is a grand fallacy. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 05:16, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've looked over this situation and while on first glance I can see why some people don't see it as a justified block. However, I also know (as a fellow CheckUser) how grindingly difficult that job is. I used to be the only person working RFCU, and I couldn't keep it up for long because it's timeconsuming and totally thankless. People who put out with an attitude that they're entitled to whatever they want right away are going to find that that's not the way things work. CovenantD failed to show respect for the very difficult job that Essjay and Mackensen are doing. The rude attitude with which he expressed himself was out of line, especially for someone serving as a mediator. Frankly, he needed a quick smack in the ass to get him to realize he was out of line. I don't know if 24 hours was the appropriate time, but I suspect Essjay would have shortened the block if an apology had been forthcoming.</p>
<p>Long and the short of it, treat your checkusers nice; there aren't many of them and they work really hard for you. Be mean to them at your own peril. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 05:29, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm. Correct me if I'm wrong, but did I just see a user (CovenantD) reduce the chances of every other user, including myself, getting help with a checkuser request? Because that kind of bites... I wish you would reconsider, Essjay. And even if you won't, why is it that only about 1% of admins are entrusted with this power, and only about 0.02% actually use it? If it's such a frustrating hassle that burns you out so badly, why isn't the power expanded, maybe to a whopping 50 admins? Surely there have to be, out of those 1000, at least 50 trustworthy admins! I would imagine there are far more than that. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 06:58, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Responding in the order questions were asked) Yes, that is the case. No, sorry I won't; this happens far too often, and as the link I gave above indicates, there is at least one user actively looking for opportunities to continue. Again, this is a fallacy; while only 2 of us are (were) active <b>on RFCU</b>, nearly everyone with the permission is active in using it. The majority of those who have it are on the Arbitration Committee, and they use it for that; there are also requests from the Foundation Office, and sua sponte checks on things like vandals who continue to create more accounts after they are blocked. If it were expanded, it would be 50 admins burned out, instead of 14; the problem isn't that the permission burns you out, it's the abusive treament from other users. Indeed, there could be, but you have to be very careful when you give out access to information that could get people stalked,imprisoned, or executed; if you give out someone's IP, they can easily end up being stalked, and if they live in a country with a hostile regime, can be imprisoned or executed for the things they do here. That's not something to be handed out lightly. Plus, more is not necessarily better; the more who have access, the harder it is to control, and being able to control who has access to very sensitive private information is imperative. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 09:53, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Question</b>: is it really so sensitive information? Everybody who is on Internet should realize that their IP is practically public; people who are unhappy with this use proxies. Countries with oppressive governments have many other ways to find out what their citizens are doing rather than wait for wikipedia admins to reveal IP addresses (and I know about such countries first-hand). Personally I would not care much if my IP address was visible to everybody. For example, currently my IP is 68.178.232.99, let anybody who wants to stalk, imprisone or execute me do their worst&#160;:) --Vlad1 04:20, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, no one is likely to break down your door over your edits, or maybe put your family in a re-education camp to keep you quiet, unlike a democracy activist from Egypt or a Falun Gong member from China. More than that, Wikipedia has a long tradition of anonymity and a strong privacy policy. And there have been some very bad stalking incidents. Oppresive governments are hardly the only groups that might have an interest in harrassing an editor off the wiki. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:50, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm sorry, but the reaction to this incident is completely out of proportion to the questionable block. I appreciate that it's a hard job, but nobody forces anyone to do it, and I think <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> cut both ways. I'm disappointed in a lot of people's reactions here. All I was looking for was an acknowledgement that there was an over-reaction. As to the discussion on CovenantD's talk page, I wopuld hope people would assume good faith in the fact that people were steering this to the appropriate venues. I would have been far happier sorting this out with Essjay, but a user brought it here, well within their rights and as I had already involved myself I felt obliged to comment. I stand by my assertion that this is a questionable block. I apologise for the grief it has caused people, but I still feel refusing to grant a checkuser request on anything other than the merits of the case is disappointing. I really think there was a failure in common sense on all sides here, and to be honest, if CovenantD deserves a slap, then can we tear up all the guidance on there being no cabal, and no elite, and make sure we tell people that if they ruffle the feathers of the important people or their friends, then they're in the shit. Because I'm sorry, but that's what happened here. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mackensen&amp;diff=65258574&amp;oldid=65051443" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mackensen&amp;diff=65258574&amp;oldid=65051443" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>. Every time something like this blows up it's because people act before they think. I know I'm guilty of it, but don't we have a right to expect better from the chairman of the mediators? This is out of hand; whatever happened to a common sense approach and the extension of putting yourself in the shoes of the other? If someone has a beef, I thought they had the right to be heard respectfully.

<li><i>If someone has a beef, I thought they had the right to be heard respectfully.</i> Couldn't agree more; I wish Essjay and I were extended the same courtesey. He was heard respectfully (from Thatcher) and he chose to be rude. I can't help that.

<p>You know what, I'd have no problems with Essjay and Mackensen going on a long (and possibly permanent) RFCU break. The one good thing that's come out of it is that it's advertised even more that RFCU is a gruelling and thankless job. If people choose to treat RFCUers like this, and the RFCUers feel like they're being hung out to dry, let them take a long break from doing that job so the rest of the community can realise how hard it really is. (please note, not a comment on specific people here, but a general comment on people being hung out to dry) --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 14:30, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the other hand, having them perform and the support a block against policy and without the warnings that should have happened show pretty clearly that there is an issue with judgement that needs to be considered.

<dd>Or maybe, since this was his first request of this sort, he (like me) didn't even know that every admin didn't have this power? Seriously, why is CovenantD getting such a hard time for this? No one who supports the block has detailed what the 'personal insults' were, even after multiple requests. Numerous other admins and editors say that this was a badly-issued and too-hasty block, and the admins involved in the initial situation aren't being at all asked to say that they did something incorrectly. This just smacks of 'administrator privilege', which is wholly against the policies of Wikipedia, by all I've read. Perhaps there are unwritten rules that allow this behaviour? If so, would someone be kind enough to share those? --<span style="background: #CCEECC;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickstart70_e0ea.html" title="User:Kickstart70">Kickstart70</a></span>-<span style="background: #CCCCEE;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User_talk%7EKickstart70_36c5.html" title="User talk:Kickstart70">T</a></span>-<span style="background: #EECCEE;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kickstart70_b60c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kickstart70">C</a></span> 21:40, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I understand the issue quite well; the issue is not blocking against policy. Thanks for ignoring my comments; I suppose it's very easy to construe this issue in such a manner when you've never read the original exchange (or, possibly, have no idea why being called, effectively, lazy and incompetent is an insult). I think we've about exhausted the usefulness of this forum, to say nothing of my patience.

<dd>I do not see how CovenantD called any of the participating admins lazy or incompetent. I'm sorry if this bothers you, I simply do not. So yeah, you have/had a chance to explain to me where he said this, but no one wants to answer me directly on this point, or whether the block violated policy. I'd rather not take this to Arbcom or RfC, but I guess that's what you'd prefer...involving more people, wasting more admin time, rather than answering some pretty bloody easy questions. --<span style="background: #CCEECC;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickstart70_e0ea.html" title="User:Kickstart70">Kickstart70</a></span>-<span style="background: #CCCCEE;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User_talk%7EKickstart70_36c5.html" title="User talk:Kickstart70">T</a></span>-<span style="background: #EECCEE;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kickstart70_b60c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kickstart70">C</a></span> 01:24, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with Samuel Luo's comment at RFCU; I'd say the block was a bit of an overreaction but CovenantD was definitely out of line and was operating based on misconceptions which I hope s/he understands by now. I also hope Essjay and Mackensen can de-stress for a while but (maybe after a break) continue to keep an eye on RFCU and handle the requests that warrant it. I think having RFCU available outside the machinery of full-blown arb cases takes nontrivial pressure off of every level of wiki ops that involves dealing with sockpuppets (including the arbcom). I'd oppose expanding checkuser for reasons described by Essjay. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 03:24, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It seems the part of policy that justified this block is really what's in question. So lets go to the policy. Its for 'Disruption: incivility and borderline personal attacks', and its for a day("24 hours)". There's an attack on the wikipedia process, a personal attack on all the checkusers, and general incivility from the fact that wikipedia isn't <i>always</i> instantantaneously responding from CoventantD. The problem is that you are not being stonewalled, you are being disagreed with. Several people do not agree with you that the block was without policy. The brief block was for incivility and borderline personal attacks, and warning is recommend, but <i>not</i> required. There is the policy reasoning Essjay applied behind the block, which is the subject of your AMA request. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 04:55, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How many warnings does he get. This is the second or third time in a week you've warned him. He's violating his probation, you obviously agree or you wouldn't be warning him. Are the warnings indefinite as long as he moves his disruption around?

<dd>I'm being patient and reasonable. If SPUI continues to get into these little squabbles despite multiple warnings, he may find himself sanctioned. In the past there has been a lack of community confidence in enforcement actions taken against SPUI, and I'm sure you agree that it wouldn't be sensible to impose a sanction only to have it overturned. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 22:11, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>True there has been SOME irregularity in sanctions against him in the past (most of the sanctions were justified in the past if just through the sheer number of them). But that was before there was a set ruling against him written in the perverbial cyber stone saying he can't do this anymore. Yet he continues to do so. Sanctions at this point have arbcom backing when it comes to disruption of highway articles and any admin wheelwarring a block against him now is violating the arbcom ruling. You understand my fustration here. If he's on probation he should be on probation, otherwise call it what it is and say the probation means jack shit and he, myself and any other editors subject to it don't have to follow it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyBGood_3156.html" title="User:JohnnyBGood"><font color="green"><b>JohnnyBGood</b></font></a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnnyBGood_d6fd.html" title="User talk:JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>t</b></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JohnnyBGood_a89f.html" title="Special:Contributions/JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>c</b></font></a> <b>VIVA!</b> 22:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Technically, Jonathunder first violated Remedy 6 of that ruling (I've no idea if he was aware of it, mind you), and <i>then</i> SPUI vio'd #2.1, and #6 too (which of course he certainly was).

Before one month it was big Edit War, not for the argumets but the serbians users block every inicitiativ witch has not to do with serbians. They are more users here or they are working for the Serbian goverment and they have maked a net here in Wikipedia with many users accounts (see all articels about Serbia, there are for each thing twise one for the "hero" and one for "inesans" serbian).

<dd>Well, I've been following and trying to "moderate" the discussion there for a month now (most of the time without logging in), and I'm tempted to say "yes, delete it" (in fact I've proposed it on the talk page), so as to get it off my hands, but I'm not sure whether it would be quite fair to those who have worked on the article. Also, you aren't apparaising the situation quite accurately. The editor who initially created the page was a folklore researcher, Jacqueline Simpson, who had based her text mostly on two texts by another folklore researcher, Bill Ellis. Neither is exactly mainstream or notable (while being members of various folklore societies, they don't seem to have academical degrees in these subjects), but they were not involved in the vampire hunts either. Next, User:Vampire Research Society appeared, still unregistered and using multiple IPs, and started a very aggressive polemic against Ellis and Simpson on the talk page, while at the same time vandalizing the article in accordance with his POV (that vampires exist and Manchester kills them). Eventually the article was semi-protected and his IPs were blocked. Afterwards he got his present account and started pointing out various perceived or real factual inaccuracies (which I found rather insignificant). These have been corrected when acknowledged by the other two editors of the article - Simpson and/or me. Since he was accusing Farrant of various faults and crimes, Farrant et al. appeared and started making counter-accusations. That's about it. I'm not sure what the conclusions should be. I <i>am</i> sure that the article/talk page is in constant need of admin attention because of the fact that the main "characters" of the story are extremely active online. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous44_ccf4.html" title="User:Anonymous44">Anonymous44</a> 19:49, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the history - I'll help monitor the discussion - I hadn't read the article itself very thoroughly - was more focused on trying to identify the alleged personal attacks that were on the personal attack noticeboard. I think a good course of action would be to delete the accusations on the talk page - or archive them since <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7ERefactoring_b7de.html" title="Wikipedia:Refactoring">Refactoring</a> seems out of vogue, and see where things go from there. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 21:07, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Archiving them would probably be a relief, although they're going to produce another 100 kilobytes of accusations in no time. But how do we tell the difference between personal attacks and simple discussion of the contents of the article? The accusations are, at the same time, at least possibly relevant material for the article. For example, Vapire Research Society justified his endless diatribes against Farrant by using them to prove that Farrant shouldn't be used as a source for the article. And vice versa. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous44_ccf4.html" title="User:Anonymous44">Anonymous44</a> 22:18, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Misrepresentation continues even above. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous44_ccf4.html" title="User:Anonymous44">User:Anonymous44</a> has claimed that our view is that "vampires exist and Manchester kills them." This is misleading and untrue. The VRS certainly accepts the existence of predatory demons and Bishop Manchester certainly exorcises them, but exorcism is not "killing." Supernatural entities cannot be "killed." They can only be cast our or removed from where they occupy. Anyone doing their homework will be aware that David Farrant and his two female helpers, Catherine Fearnely and Barbara Green, stalk Bishop Manchester and the Vampire Research Society on the internet and once found start posting extreme abuse, fabriction and libel. This they have done on the talk page where Jacqueline Simpson, the original article's authoress, consequently stopped contributing (though she has recently addressed something to 194.145.161.227 that is not Farrant related). Likewise, the Vampire Research Society also announced that it will make no further contributions to the talk page whilst Farrant and company are posting defamation and malicious falsehood. The reason the VRS was obliged to refer to Farrant in the discussion was due to Simpson's emphasis on his alleged part in the Highgate Vampire case in her article. There were inaccuracies which needed addressing. Source references, published court reports etc, were provided by the Vampire Research Society and reminders of glaring errors in Bill Ellis' published account where Bishop Manchester and David Farrant are mentioned. These were not views or original research. They are factual inaccuracies for which supporting evidence was made available. Jacqueline Simpson and Bill Ellis have both been offered archive material which includes recorded interviews with Farrant from 1970 and thereabouts. They have shown no interest in taking up this offer which was first made in 1996 and has been repeated down the years. This material would oblige them to alter what they have published as "fact." Farrant is a compulsive liar. This is not just our view. He was declared so by magistrates, judges, juries and journalists throughout the 1970s, which is the relevant period. Notwithstanding the mistakes in Ellis' and Simpson's accounts, Farrant has many criminal convictions, some relating to desecration and vandalism in Highgate Cemetery, others relating to threatening witnesses with black magic in a sex case, and was sentenced to four years and eight months in 1974. Bishop Manchester and executive members of the VRS (of which I am one), on the other hand, have no criminal convictions; though you would not know it from the way we are treated on Wikipedia. The offensive and potentially libellous comments from Farrant, Fearnley and Green remain on the talk page and, moerover, have been added to after Simpson and the VRS disengaged.</p>

<dd>I am not aware of any official policy to userfy all userboxes. I've seen a <i>proposal</i> for it, but certainly not any confirmation. It was your duty to ensure the deletion did not have any adverse effect or go against consensus, which you clearly did not even attempt. WikiProject userboxes have been, asfar as I know, sanctionned by the userbox-related guidelines. <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 20:37, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zoe, I'm afraid that what I mind and don't mind have nothing to do with the fact that the articles in question do not, to the general public, exist. Oversight, in fact, still doesn't remove the revisions, it only <i>hides</i> them, the same way as they're currently hidden since the articles are deleted. The only difference is that you, being an admin, can review the content regardless of the fact that they're deleted.</dd>
<dd>Oversight is approved for use in exactly three cases, and I would refer you to <a href="../../../o/v/e/WP%7EOVER_de86.html" title="WP:OVER">WP:OVER</a> to review those cases, or if you don't trust a page I wrote, see the original version of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Hiding_revisions" class="extiw" title="m:Hiding_revisions">m:Hiding revisions</a> on Meta. If a request is sent in to the Wikimedia foundation by those offended (<a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> applies), then an oversight request can be sent in to us, but at the moment it does not appear to warrant such attention.</dd>
<dd>While I dislike attack pages of all sorts, there's nothing differentiating this one from the thousands of others which have been deleted already, so it does not require oversight attention. If you still disagree, feel free to contact one of the users listed on the oversight page and ask them. I'm sorry. <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 02:53, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Kylu is correct here; apparent libel is not enough to oversight a page's history.

<dd>I was the admin who blocked the anonymous user. This should <b>absolutely not</b> be taken to imply that I condoned Qho's behaviour. My dealings were with the anonymous user who engaged in a number of disruptive edits. I am glad that someone else looked into Qho's edits. While I am not convinced that posting a country of origin (essentially, whois information) constitutes a personal attack, many of this user's other edits may have constituted such an attack (and apparently did as he was blocked).

<dd>A couple of observations: first, if you've been involved in disputes with this user before you shouldn't really be the one issuing the block, and second, it might be more appropriate to start a <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">request for arbitration</a> if this user has already been through an RfC. I do agree with JoshuaZ's comment that an <i>indefinite</i> block seems overly harsh for what you describe - it's a big escalation from a "brief" block earlier. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 22:04, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was asked by a user I <i>believe</i> is underage what my sexuality is. I do not feel this is a personal attack or anything but it makes me profoundly uncomfortable to be asked this by a user who is underage. Now, I have no intention of discussing my sexuality, religion, or political views here on Wikipedia with anyone, it is not the right forum. But I am concerned when the discussion turns this way when the person engaging me in conversation is under age.

<p>Several users, apparently school kids from the Baltimore area, have been salting Wikipedia with hoaxes for a <i>long</i> time now. They started with many, many articles on a supposedly famous American familiy called the Eyre/Heller/Peters "dynasty", all of which have been deleted now. Today <a href="../../../a/r/%C3%AD/Ar%C3%ADa.html" title="Aría">Aría</a> has been listed for AfD, and because of that, by checking the contributions of the article's authors, I encounted yet again another Eyre family hoax, Knowlton Estate. I have pared down <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grange_Estate_b1ed.html" title="Grange Estate">Grange Estate</a> to a one-sentence stub, since there was nothing verifiable in it since it included more Eyre/Heller nonsense. I have also speedy deleted <a href="../../../e/y/r/Category%7EEyre_family_48d1.html" title="Category:Eyre family">Category:Eyre family</a>, as it was being slapped on more articles which just begged for more hoaxing.

<dd>OK. However, another editor did ask and was denied. In this case, latest IP violated 3RR so there should be a short break. My general question is about "devoted" editors who repeatedly edit the same thing into an article, despite multiple other editors asking for a reference. If the editor won't respond on talk or user-talk, it's not exactly a content dispute. In a different case I'm following, an editor has made the same edit about 24 times in 20 days, not violating 3RR but also not explaining the edit.

<dd>Users end up being disruptive by refusing to discuss what is obviously a contested edit, and can be temporarily blocked for it. Clearly if they're making the same edit 24 times in 20 days without discussing the edit, they're not interested in consensus and should be temporarily removed from the process. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 19:35, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm really starting to get tired of JPGordon's personal vendetta against me. It's not spamming because: 1. The link is NOT COMMERCIAL, i.e. it provides no services for any fees, therefore it also 2. cannot be advertising. I added links to The Crux on pages such as The Greco-Persian conflict, Ezra, Nehemaiah, and Artaxerxes because there are specific chapters in the Book that present a very interesting Historical analysis of those particular topics, with specific reference to the history of the class conflict between the Jewish people and the Greeks and Romans around the time of the 1st Century. What on earth is spam about that? The only true guidelines about adding external links are that they cannot be the person's own website, they cannot be commercial links, and the amount of one particular viepoint should not dominate if that viewpoint is out of the mainstream. I have broken none of those rules. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan4_e363.html" title="User:Ryan4"><font face="Courier"><font color="darkblue"><b>Ryan4</b></font></font></a><sup><a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan4_df2a.html" title="User talk:Ryan4">Talk</a></sup> 18:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have some familiarity with Francisco Gil-White's writings in relation to the former Yugoslavia, one of my particular areas of interest. He's got a long history of pushing extremely tendentious conspiracy theories and denialist POVs (some sample article titles: "Was Slobodan Milosevic murdered?", "The Serbs Were Not Oppressing the Kosovo Albanians... Quite the opposite", "The Freezer Truck Hoax - How NATO framed the Serbs", etc - see <a href="http://www.hirhome.com/yugo/guide-yugo.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hirhome.com/yugo/guide-yugo.htm" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> for more). His work on political issues raises a number of red flags, particularly this one, which is present in spades: "Claims not supported or claims that are contradicted by the prevailing view in the relevant academic community. Be particularly careful when proponents say there is a conspiracy to silence them." (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Exceptional_claims_require_exceptional_evidence" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence</a>) I can't think of <i>any</i> reputable academic sources which cite FGW's views on Yugoslavia. I'm not familiar with his writings on Middle Eastern issues but based on his performance on Yugoslav history, I'd be very wary of them indeed.</dd>

<dd>As for <i>The Crux of World History</i>, FGW's not a professional historian so I would certainly not consider him a <i>bona fide</i> expert on ancient history.

FGW is an anthropologist and psychologist; he's plainly not a "well-known, professional researcher writing within his field of expertise". Nor is the book quoted in the articles. The whole thing seems very, very spammy to me and I strongly support removing the links. Further, I'm not at all convinced that the article on FGW meets the standard of notability set out in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia:Notability (academics)</a>, so I will be proposing it for deletion. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 20:11, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't see any issues with their links to wikipedia -- tons of sites do for more information. I don't think that wills are generally appropriate to link to on Wikipedia though, especially outside of the external links section.

<li>As the CEO of the Living Trust Network, I would like to respond to the above comments. First, we do not want to engage in any activities that might be considered unethical or wrong in any way. So, if we have added links to our website that should not have been added, then we will certainly take them down. We were in the process of adding links to Wikipedia's biographies of famous people whose wills are featured on our site when I discovered a link to a Last Will and Testament on another external site. That gave us the idea. Then we added a few links to wills on our site and discovered that we shouldn't be adding links except in the external links section. We then removed the links and put them into the external links area. If that, too, is not appropriate, then we will certainly remove them. However, it seems to me that having access to a person's will is a good thing and in keeping with the focus of the biography of famous people.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you view the page on our site in which the Last Will and Testament is located, you will see that there is no advertising or other offensive material. In fact, you won't find anything on our site that is offensive or in bad taste. We tend to error on the side of being good neighbors - and we will always remain that way.</p>
<p>So, please, someone advise us as to how we should proceed regarding the links to the Last Wills and Testaments of famous people on our site.</p>
<p>Regards, Michael Pancheri, CEO, Living Trust Network, LLC</p>
<ul>
<li>I wasn't meaning to indicate that you should feel bad or that it was impropriety to add the links, merely that in my opinion, I don't think they make the articles better because they don't fit with the nature of encyclopedia articles. However, despite feeling as I do, I recommend you want until there's been adequate discussion on this page to reach some sort of consensus on the topic. If you would hold off on adding more links until then, and occasionally check back here in case more discussion happens, that would be great. Don't feel at all bad about adding the link at this point -- we're still working on coming to a set of intuitions on this topic (there have been a few other somewhat similar cases, one involving a scientific journal and another involving Cliffsnote, this month). --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 20:26, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think it's interesting and appropriate information to add; I'm just unclear at this point why that website had the right to post it in the first place. Even if there is no privacy issue because a) the testator is dead and/or b) the documents were publicly filed in probate court, those documents (except for Franklin's and Washington's) would still be copyrighted. Wills are the type of thing that surviving relatives might take unkindly to having distributed like this (no one wants the world to know that daddy cut them out of the will), and Wikipedia could be secondarily liable for maintaining the links if the Living Trust site can be primarily liable in some way. I've posted a question on the user's talk page on this to see what their legal rationale is; it's quite possible they've received sound advice from counsel that there's no issue here, but it's worth a look. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 23:11, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I understand that correctly, that means to have the link promoter mention its availability on the target article's talk page instead of adding it themselves, so that others not involved in the external link's site can decide whether to add it?

Because his first edit was to immediately <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anarcho-capitalism#Is_FAQ_on_Infoshop.org_written_from_socialist_perspective.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anarcho-capitalism#Is_FAQ_on_Infoshop.org_written_from_socialist_perspective.3F" rel="nofollow">initiate a discussion</a> on a topic which had recently been the focus of user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:RJII" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:RJII" rel="nofollow">RJII</a>, he was soon accused by user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronS" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronS" rel="nofollow">AaronS</a> of being a sockpuppet. User <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Infinity0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Infinity0" rel="nofollow">Infinity0</a> also suspected Vision Thing of being a sockpuppet, and requested a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/RJII" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/RJII" rel="nofollow">checkuser</a>. Unfortunately, because of the nature of the RJ "project", as user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ArdoMelnikov" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ArdoMelnikov" rel="nofollow">Logical2u</a> said on the checkuser page, "all accounts by the RJII "team" will likely be undectable and un-check-user-verifiable, due to "home" computers, etc."</p>
<p>Due to lack of evidence from usercheck, the case appears to have been dropped. However, I believe that subsequent edits by user Vision Thing have more than demonstrated, via circumstantial evidence, his intimate connection to RJII. Unfortunately this is the only kind of evidence that could be applied to this case. I have compiled an extensive list of identical edits made by user RJII and Vision Thing. Please note that in my time searching dozens of articles edited by these two accounts I never found a single instance in which either editor reverted or even openly disagreed with one another, despite a tendency by both accounts to engage in edit wars and reverts. When I eventually became certain of Vision Thing being a sockpuppet I attempted to inform twice. Despite making several other edits on his talk page in the meantime, both my attempts remain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Vision_Thing#RJ" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Vision_Thing#RJ" rel="nofollow">ignored</a>.</p>

<p>As evidence I would first like to note RJII's repeated insistance on indicating that the writers of the anarchist FAQ are "social anarchists". This is the very topic that Vision Thing first used as a subject of his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anarcho-capitalism#Is_FAQ_on_Infoshop.org_written_from_socialist_perspective.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anarcho-capitalism#Is_FAQ_on_Infoshop.org_written_from_socialist_perspective.3F" rel="nofollow">first edit</a>. The similarity of their edits can be seen from these examples by RJ,</p>

</ul>
<p>which can be compared with this edit by Vision Thing after RJ was banned: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=An_Anarchist_FAQ&amp;diff=62901451&amp;oldid=61682987" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=An_Anarchist_FAQ&amp;diff=62901451&amp;oldid=61682987" rel="nofollow">9 July</a></p>
<p>Such instances are not isolated. For example, RJ and Vision Thing inserted the same edits concerning David Friedman on medieval Iceland:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Vision Thing has made many of the same edits that RJ was formally known for inserting since RJ's ban. Benjamin Tucker's "capitalism is at least tolerable" is a quote originally introduced into several articles by RJ:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Benjamin_Tucker&amp;diff=54139824&amp;oldid=53981946" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Benjamin_Tucker&amp;diff=54139824&amp;oldid=53981946" rel="nofollow">20 May</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=54140153&amp;oldid=53980168" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=54140153&amp;oldid=53980168" rel="nofollow">20 May</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After RJ's ban it has been inserted into articles by Vision Thing in his place: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=63957031&amp;oldid=63956265" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=63957031&amp;oldid=63956265" rel="nofollow">15 July</a></p>
<p>Individualist anarchism "reborn", is another quote originally inserted by RJ into the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> article:</p>

</ul>
<p>Way back in January of 2005 RJ started posting many edits about the "U.S. Postal Service monopoly"</p>

<p>not surpirsingly, after RJ was banned nearly identical edits started coming from Vision Thing</p>

<p>And yet another instance, before his ban RJ inserted the following edit into <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-capitalism.html" title="Anti-capitalism">Anti-capitalism</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-capitalism&amp;diff=58697379&amp;oldid=58266014" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-capitalism&amp;diff=58697379&amp;oldid=58266014" rel="nofollow">15 June</a> After RJs ban Vision Thing once again inserted an identical edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-capitalism&amp;diff=60469058&amp;oldid=60396833" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-capitalism&amp;diff=60469058&amp;oldid=60396833" rel="nofollow">25 June</a></p>

<p>It is important to note that when faced with a ban RJ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARJII&amp;diff=60597018&amp;oldid=60591200" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARJII&amp;diff=60597018&amp;oldid=60591200" rel="nofollow">eventually admitted</a> what had previously been obvious to many, that his intent was to use "...advanced techniques of psychological warfare... most importantly, most of our edits were not done through the RJII account but through multiple "sockpuppets" (from a seperate IP(s) for increased security against detection). Hence, the RJII account served largely to wear particular individuals down, pyschologically, who were judged to be enemies."</p>
<p>In admits again to having multiple sockpuppets already prepared and engaged in wikipedia, "In the meantime, the "sockpuppets," who evinced a somewhat amiable personality did not engage in personal attacks and other such disagreeable behavior that may have risked blocks by adminstrators, went about editing the encyclopedia... It is safe now for us to divulge that some of the sockpuppets will continue editing Wikipedia until at least the end of the year."</p>
<p>The edits of RJ and Vision Thing are so nearly identical, and so obviously from the same narrow POV, that it can't helped but be felt that RJIIs intent to be "successful in driving several individuals off of Wikipedia, or away from particular articles, who through their hands up in disgust (probably literally)" is being carried on via the account of Vision Thing. Circumstantial evidence is never certain, but I believe this is as much evidence as one could provide given the difficulty in tracking down all the sock puppets employed by RJIIs account. In the unlikely case that the circumstantial evidence I have compiled does not remove doubt that Vision Thing is a sock puppet of RJ he is at least a Meat Puppet (perhaps in the form of banned user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Community_ban_on_User:Hogeye" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Community_ban_on_User:Hogeye" rel="nofollow">Hogeye</a> who worked closely with RJ in the past). Regardless, Vision Thing is clearly carrying out RJs explicitly stated goals of disrupting wikipedia and gaming the system. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 05:10, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting analysis. I would tend to concur with you. However as you said, this cannot be proven. I suspect the only thing that can be done in this case is to go through the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">dispute resolution</a> process and get a similar result to that which was meted out to RJII. You could use the previous two ArbCom judgements against RJII as precedent. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 15:31, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I should point out that in any case, RJII also appears to be using a series of throwaway accounts to avoid detection. Accounts like User:Antitrust and <a href="../../../c/-/l/User%7EC-Liberal_ea6f.html" title="User:C-Liberal">User:C-Liberal</a> which were registered since he vanished, made a couple of edits (only two in Antitrust's case) to keep his preferred versions in place, and then promptly disappeared seem like classic socks to me. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 17:31, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I tend to agree with the assumption, but nothing can be proven. If his words are any indication, RJII would thrive on this kind of speculation. I'd rather not give him that satisfaction. He can play with this until he's 80 years old, for all I care. I might suggest some professional help, though. --AaronS 01:32, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Just as an addition to this witch hunt for RJll sockpuppets, that is an obvious attempt at getting rid of Vision Thing, these editors, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">User:The Ungovernable Force</a>, along with others, are currently working at destroying the featured article <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>. Their clear attempts at destabalizing this article are viscous and I wonder how much of it is being done out of petty jealousy. I find all this sickening, both the witch hunt for a good conscientious editor and what they are doing to this article, which they have brought up for featured status review, <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_review_Anarcho-capitalism_14e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article review/Anarcho-capitalism">Wikipedia:Featured_article_review/Anarcho-capitalism</a>, after having inserted blatant POV into it, and often made multiple edits to it all in the same day. The need to endlessly dominate articles and insert their own slant can be seen in the several anarchist related articles they tend to edit. Particularly here <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>. Francis Tyers, also, is hardly in a position to complain as he, on 7/23/06 made 9 edits to this same article. I would suggest that those that seek to run Vision Thing off of Wikipedia take a look at their own actions instead. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELingeron_802e.html" title="User:Lingeron"><font color="#003366" face="Verdana">Sha</font></a><font color="#006666" face="Veranda">nnon</font><sup><a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELingeron_ee69.html" title="User talk:Lingeron"><font color="#3906A2">duck talk</font></a></sup> 21:09, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't like the fact that people are poking around in my userspace. The purpose of that page is to benefit my ability to make decisions in the best interest of Wikipedia. Just a way of keeping track of people that's more reliable than my memory -- there's a lot of Wikipedians these days and I find that I can no longer manage everything in my head. All it takes to get on there is doing anything that makes you stand out to me -- good or bad, it doesn't matter; being included there doesn't mean I think you're a bad person or anything; it's just a list. I deliberately created it in my user space and at an out of the way location so that it wouldn't be disruptive, but of course someone had to go and make trouble about it. Nice show, people. I suppose I'll move it to my own wiki (which is closed, and I don't give out passwords to many people) where I don't have to worry about people messing with it. Even better, I can put it in a special locked namespace where none of you can see it, either.

<dd>Kelly why not just recreate it? There was no basis for the deletion of it and it can be easily restored through proper channels. I'm confused as to why it was deleted in the first place. Having a list of users isn't against any rule. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyBGood_3156.html" title="User:JohnnyBGood"><font color="green"><b>JohnnyBGood</b></font></a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnnyBGood_d6fd.html" title="User talk:JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>t</b></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JohnnyBGood_a89f.html" title="Special:Contributions/JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>c</b></font></a> <b>VIVA!</b> 22:32, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not the explanation you gave for it on IRC. I don't think this after the fact misrepresentation of what the list was for is really helpful. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 22:38, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Good grief. I can't believe we're even having this conversation. You created a list of names that apparantly was based on people you and others had disagreed with. You refused to say what it was for - simply giving a reasonable explanation would have sufficed. When you get caught, somehow it's our fault for "poking around in your user space", whatever that means. Still, rather than provide an explanation, Cyde removes the list. Calling it a list of people that stand out good, bad, or indifferent sounds dubious considering that (1) there were multiple substantial contributors to the list and (2) you added a large block of names from Sean's RFA. Now, you play the "drama queen" card of taking your football and going to your own secret wiki. Honestly, this behavior disturbs me. If everything you were doing was above board, then you would not at all be upset at discussing your actions. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:49, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

They should also realize that people like to see who is linking to their user pages, that such curiosity is perfectly normal, and that an unannotated and apparently random list would obviously stand out as a curiosity. <b>Objectors</b> should accept the contributors' explanations at face value unless evidence to the contrary is presented.

<dd>I don't particularly care what this list was for, but I think it was shockingly clueless of the people involved in making it to put such an unexplained list of editors on-Wiki, delete it when it attracts attention, and then refuse to really talk about its purpose, unless their goal is to create <i>drama</i>. If that was the intent, well-done, otherwise, that was dumb as hell, guys. If this was an "in-joke", or whatever, it was bungled and turned into a disruption by serious cluelessness on the part of those "in" on the joke. Sometimes, Kelly impresses me with her good judgement. This isn't one of those. On the other hand, her reaction of clamming up when the drama starts, instead of defusing it with candid openness, reminds me of Kelly in early January, so I guess that's not surprising. Why not try a different approach to controversy, Kelly?

<dd>Which is why it's pretty much a lot smarter to maintain an impression of openness instead.

<p>I concur with Oleg above. This showed poor judgment from all the people involved in keeping that list. The day wikipedians are voting according to what will make them look good among a click of wikipedia-veterans is a sad day for the community. Just the very notion that someone are keeping lists of "good" and "bad" wikipedians based on how they act and vote on RFA is very destructive to this community, a community based on everyone acting in good faith and according to what they believe will make this encyclopedia better. If I wanted to oppose an rfa because I didn't see the candidate fit as an admin, I should be able to make that oppose vote without any fear of ending up on some list that would haunt me later. Kelly seemed surprised that the existence of this userpage list became known. I think it would be more surprising if it didn't get known, and I bet many people knew about it long before it got blown up here. I just hope nobody made it influence their voting on Sean Black's rfa. But I'm afraid it might have. And that it might influence people in the future. That is not good, and Kelly should realize this. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 18:36, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is interesting to observe is the tortuous lengths Cyde and Kelly will go to to insist that this was a good, helpful, right, healthy thing to do, and that any upset is definitely not anything whatsoever at all to do with their angelic, prayerful selves, and that it is all <i>everyone</i> else's fault. That this was a stupendous error of judgement (of all those who compiled the original list), whatever its original intent, is plainly obvious; being unable to see that, especially when it is laid out for you in such painful detail, is an elegant corroboration of the judgement error already made. It also has the overtones of those days from primary school when you'd be passing a secret note around under the desks, and the teacher would say "What have you got there, Splash?" and you'd say "Nothing, Sir." as you screwed it into a ball and hid it under your chair. Then, at breaktime, you'd all huddle around the table in the back at the corner, and giggle, guiltily looking over your shoulders to see if any teachers were walking by and, when they caught you, you'd act all righteously indignant in hope you might bluster them into giving up. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 19:04, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, what's really interesting, to me, is the response. A list like this (and, please note, that I've never approved of it) has as much value as people place in it. Anyone who would let a list like that guide their judgement has already made up their mind. Or, more appropriately, has decided to let that list do their thinking for them. That's abominable. At the same time, anyone on a list who thinks that said list has <i>any</i> relevance to their actions clearly has no idea how a wiki functions. I'm saddened that anyone has placed any stock in this ridiculous affair. That goes for both the people who made the list and the people who ended up on it. The best response from the people on the list would have been to call it idiotic (which it was) and carry on with their lives (which I hope they do). This has been a tawdry affair, both silly and unnecesary, and to exacerbate it further would do very little good and probably a great deal of harm. I suppose if anyone hasn't finished expressing their moral outrage at list compilation they should do it now. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 19:21, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I couldn't care less about my name being on the list, but you must see that this situation is now self-exacerbating. Even if people stop commenting on it (which they won't), there are several things going on that make them feel worse than they already do for being placed on the list. First their oppose votes are roundly dismissed as ridiculous, then the RFA is closed somewhat unconventionally (again devaluing their concerns), and now we have RFA votes like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Eluchil404&amp;diff=65403490&amp;oldid=65234634" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Eluchil404&amp;diff=65403490&amp;oldid=65234634" rel="nofollow">this</a> from Kelly Martin, which barring any other explanation look like a "because you're on my list" vote. This whole thing was built up wrong from the beginning, and it has been beset by unknowns. That clearly has brought out a lot of suspicion and unease in serious editors, amd I don't think it is going to go away readily. Now we just have a list of people have not had their concerns validated, but who ARE having their suspicions validated. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 00:52, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>This whole discussion is utter nonsense. I can't believe it's going on and attracting so much attention. What Kelly is doing is not strange at all. Wikipedia is a work environment growing larger, more complex, and cumbersome by the day. For veteran Wikipedia editors, it is an increasingly daunting challenge each day to keep track of our peers. If a longtime, active editor such as Kelly Martin finds the need to create some sort of list of users-- a list which makes sense to no one else but helps him/her keep things straight in his/her own head-- no harm is done whatsoever. Similarly, I've found a need to keep a list of editors-- mainly users who edit my subjects of interest-- on my own userpage. It makes no difference if Kelly keeps her list in her user namespace, or in private on a database or document off Wikipedia. I suggest that everyone move past this contentious discussion, and let Kelly get back to working on her sole objective on Wikipedia, which is making the site a more reliable encyclopedia-- paranoid conspiracy theories aside. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 05:21, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That I can easily agree to. This debate and my argument above has nothing to do with the list. The list can stay no problem.</dd>
<dd>Voting on afds based on a "hatelist" however is disruptive. Adminship does not require people to love you. Its just a mop, a tool just like the ability to edit. It must not be made a big deal.</dd>

<dd>I am extremely concerned that El C chose to block while he was involved in a conflict with Kelly Martin over this issue. In addition to taking a threatening and confrontational tone, I note that he was one of the individuals listed on Kelly's page. Regardless of whether or not it was appropriate for Kelly to keep such a list, it was definitely not El C's place to threaten and block here. I'm tempted to block El C for wheel warring (deleting and blocking while the issue was being discussed further up this page) and immediately unblock Kelly Martin, but I'm aware of the irony that would lace such a course of action.</dd>
<dd>I would encourage a <i>rapid</i> sampling of opinion here and if there is a general agreement Kelly should be unblocked so that she can at least participate in this discussion—and continue to work on Wikipedia, where she has been bloody useful for the last two years. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 02:25, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On wheel warring—what do you call it when two admins delete and undelete (or delete and recreate) pages, then start blocking?

<dd>The /R list was a list of random users with random colors assigned to them. There was absolutely no meaning to the list that El C deleted. I created it for one express purpose: to see if El C would jerk his knee and attempt to punish me for creating it. Considering that he previously deleted a harmless redirect and a blank page from my user space, I wasn't too surprised that he did. To an extent, this is disrupting Wikipedia to prove a point, but if the extremely minor disruption that this causes exposes a wildly irresponsible admin for who he is, I consider it worthwhile. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 02:47, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Regardless of the rationale behind these lists, you ought to know better.

<p>Just a few reminders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing in Wikipedia policy permits the use of blocking, or any other administrative tool, for "punishment". Tools such as blocking are only permitted to be used for narrow specific purposes to prevent harm to the project. They may not permissibly be used to "teach someone a lesson" or the like. Nor is blocking a form of dispute resolution; it is only a tool to stop damage to the project.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> does not permit blocking except for "egregious disruption". Nothing of the sort occurred here. Also, note that the policy deals with <i>disrupting Wikipedia</i> to make a point, and uses examples such as systematic vandalism. <i>Wikipedia</i> was not disrupted here. Not everything you don't like is a disruption of the project.</li>
<li>What seems to have occurred here, though, includes a violation of the well-known provision that administrators must not use blocking to gain the upper hand in a dispute. It is generally considered highly suspicious -- or at least in need of detailed and calm explanation -- when an administrator blocks someone they've been in a dispute of any sort with. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 06:23, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry, the blocking function is simply not a toy. This block was wholly inappropriate for a number of reasons outlined above, and also because it appears that hitting the block button is becoming the first action of an admin, and not the last. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 11:24, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Take the name Kelly Martin out of it. Pretend Kelly Smith takes exactly the same actions (my apologies if there really is someone named Kelly Smith). Kelly Smith, along with some of her friends, creates a list that is apparantly composed mostly of people with whom she disagreed on an RFA. When asked why, she says it is to be used for "decision-making processes". When people express concern at being on the list, she refuses to give a more detailed explanation. After an administrator deletes the list, she recreates it multiple times. After another administrator informs her that she can be blocked for disruption, she creates the list again and then states that her sole purpose in doing so was to goad the administrator into blocking her. Does anyone honestly believe that Kelly Smith would not be blocked for some substantial period of time?

<li>One can not ignore the fact that it is Kelly Martin, since the fact that it is Kelly Martin is central to the debate. Many other admins and users have such lists, I see none of them being treated in a similar manner. The bottom line is that this is a page in a user's user space. It's not an attack page, so it's none of my damn business. There's certainly no call to put Kelly on notice as to what she can and cannot do in her user space. Arb-com can do that, maybe an RFC with a near unanimous consensus could do that. Kelly can't be disrupting unless the deleting admins are too. So should I put all of those on notice? Does anyone not believe this is all a waste of people's time. Frankly, I'm gutted I didn't get on the list.

Frankly, I figured I was snooping through someone's user space and contributions and I deserved what I found.

<li>Well, about 10 good reasons are that Kelly Martin herself has described them as wilfully disruptive, and basically described them as deliberate attempts to goad. That makes it trolling under any common definition. They count as easy-to-see problems in my book. I recall various verbs being put forward for what one might to do the troll(s), and none of them included giving them a hug and castigating any user who had the temerity to try to dispose of the problem. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 14:32, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tony comments that "<i>Robert the Bruce kept a list like this. So did Cool Cat at one point.</i> ". So what was the nature of their lists. A list of people who opposed their friend. Or a list of people whom have been disruptive while editing certain articles? I think we can all see a valid reason keeping the latter list. We are still waiting for a valid reason for the Kelly's list. As BigDT mentioned above, the only reasoning given to date is for "decision-making processes&amp;amp;quot;. Since I'm on this list I'd like to know a little bit more. As far as I can tell the parody of the lists and <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is all a distraction to avoid the important question.

<dd>Both were what I would characterize as "enemies lists". Robert the Bruce kept a list of anti-circumcision activists. Cool Cat kept a list of various people, color coded in such a manner that one could easily gauge the quality of his relationship with each member. Why are "we" waiting for a valid reason for Kelly's list, by the way? The reason for Kelly's list is her own business. It does seem to have some of the character of an "enemies" list, however. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 16:55, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

One good way to inflame a conflict is to turn a stupid dispute over a page's contents (in this case miscellaneous lists) into a much larger conflict by abusing administrator tools.

<dd>The lists were created to troll for that reaction, this has been admitted. It's sad that people think trolling is healthy, and trying to stop someone from trolling isn't. But... yeah, using admin tools when you're involved in a dispute isn't so great (which is why I haven't done anything admin-ish with this whole mess).

<p>FWIW I think Mackensen has an excellent suggestion there. Kelly: yes, it's been in your userspace. Regardless, some people have a problem with that. I assume you wouldn't be here defending yourself if people weren't perpetuating the issue, but it's like a battle, there needs to be a cease fire. The way to do that is to move on to other things and don't exacerbate the situation by creating more of these lists. Okay?

<dd>I think myself that people are too hard on Kelly because of the userbox mess from months ago. Everything she does is scrutinized and over scrutinized. Her lists are not desirable but I'm still not sure what rules she is violating here. AGF is too vague for me, especially for a block. And are we building a great encyclopedia? What the heck does that have to do with anything? --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 04:21, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

Please see further up this page where an editor's unthinking frustration led to a checkuser admin quitting the task, which is going to result in actual, real harm to the project because there are so few. Why did this happen? Because an otherwise positive user forgot that <i>everyone here is a volunteer</i>, and you don't dump on volunteers or they walk away.

<dd>Those of you who pay attention to Wikimania may have noticed that I am doing a presentation on consensus. I am actually (with Gmaxwell's invaluable help) doing some research into things like voting patterns on RfA and AfD, and other such things, with the hopes of using the findings as part of that presentation or perhaps for later purposes. (I imagine very few of you know that I was a political science minor in college.) I don't think that such examination of Wikipedia's processes should be considered "disruptive", but I'm sure that someone will be quite ready to accuse me of it nonetheless, as it seems that there are certain elements of the community that are simply completely incapable of extending even the slightest bit of good faith to me. That particular page is data that Gmaxwell generously provided me; I created it there partially to work on it and partially to see who would react badly to it.

<dd>Why has this gotten so blown out of proportion? So Kelly created a list, so what? There is no policy against having a list of users. There was no stated malicious intent by having a list. And unless malicious actions by Kelly were taken based on that list any assumptions of malicious intent a blatantly against <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. That list was just a list until Kelly's actions say otherwise or she states outright that it's a list being used for a malicous purpose. Neither of these conditions have been met. The only against policy actions have been taken by the two admins who blocked Kelly against policy and by anyone assuming the list has some bad intention behind it in direct violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyBGood_3156.html" title="User:JohnnyBGood"><font color="green"><b>JohnnyBGood</b></font></a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnnyBGood_d6fd.html" title="User talk:JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>t</b></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JohnnyBGood_a89f.html" title="Special:Contributions/JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>c</b></font></a> <b>VIVA!</b> 18:15, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now now, no need to threaten him. However I would suggest holding off on an Arbcom on this as there really isn't any grounds for it.

<dd>It was in no way a threat, and I'm sorry if anyone took it that way (as if I could issue threats on behalf of anyone, much less Arbcom).

<dd>There is no real dispute here which is why this is so funny. There is Kelly who created a list for her own reasons (which per <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> policy have to be assumed to be good unless there is evidence to prove otherwise, which none has been presented). And then there are those that take exception to a list existing, basing those objections on no solid policy or guideline except their own violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. Doesn't seem like a dispute to me. The attacking parties think they are owed some explaination by Kelly, but she is under no obligation to do so and it should have been dropped there. Instead several users have taken to blocking Kelly, against policy again. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyBGood_3156.html" title="User:JohnnyBGood"><font color="green"><b>JohnnyBGood</b></font></a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnnyBGood_d6fd.html" title="User talk:JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>t</b></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JohnnyBGood_a89f.html" title="Special:Contributions/JohnnyBGood"><font color="red"><b>c</b></font></a> <b>VIVA!</b> 20:42, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Ah, computer generated lists. Always look odd and scary to people not used to them, so I can understand the problem.</p>
<p>Even so, I'm flying across the Atlantic to be able to attend wikimania, and I'll probably want to go to Kelly Martins' talk as well. That's costing me quite a bit of time and money, as you might imagine (even *with* sponsoring). I do expect to actually be somewhat enlightened for my trouble of course.</p>
<p>Therefore, you can probably imagine I shall be somewhat unhappy if people interfere with Kelly Martins presentation in any way.</p>

<li>Kelly Martin made a random list of people in her userspace under /B.</li>
<li>Cyde deleted it, and Kelly said she would place it off-wiki.</li>
<li>/R and /Q were created as apparent "trolling", as admitted by Kelly above. <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and also possibly a violation of <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>-G4.</li>
<li>El_C blocked Kelly Martin for 24 hours after the creation of /R. It was quickly reversed.</li>

<p>A new user, Neuropean, who is very likely a reincarnation of Count Of The Saxon Shore (<a href="../../../c/o/u/User_talk%7ECount_Of_The_Saxon_Shore_3e75.html" title="User talk:Count Of The Saxon Shore">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Count_Of_The_Saxon_Shore_3545.html" title="Special:Contributions/Count Of The Saxon Shore">contribs</a>), with whom Rob(ert) was often in dispute, nominated Rob's article <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank%27s_cats_4d61.html" title="Anne Frank's cats">Anne Frank's cats</a> for deletion. The article survived the nomination, but it was certainly not an inappropriate nomination, since several people voted to deleted as unencyclopaedic. However, it always looks bad for a new user to start with an AfD nomination. (Since Count Of the Saxon Shore was not a banned user, he had every right to start with a new identity if he so chose.) Robert then started on a clear vendetta against this user, filing two RFCUs (one on Neuropean himself, and one on an IP), both of which were rejected by Mackensen with a {{<a href="../../../f/i/s/Template%7EFishing_980a.html" title="Template:Fishing">Fishing</a>}} template. He then made <i>numerous</i> posts to <a href="../../../r/f/i/WP%7ERFI_2cc3.html" title="WP:RFI">WP:RFI</a> about this user, calling him a vandal, a sockpuppet, and a stalker. He became heavily involved in wiki-stalking Neuropean, showing up at articles the latter had created or recently edited. By the way, it's obvious that he has been making a habit of editing articles that I have just edited as well, and Deskana and Frelke have noticed that he was doing it with them also.</p>
<p>This caused some distress to Neuropean, and he asked Rob on several occasions to stop. Rob continued wiki-stalking, and continued to accuse him of being a vandal, a sockpuppet, and a stalker.</p>
<p>I feel I should have acted sooner. By no means do I wish to imply that Neuropean was blameless, but after the stormy beginning, he showed that he wanted to move on, and made a few compromise offers to Robert. I do not think he will be back. He said he was suffering from depression. Nevertheless, I would like to ensure that this cannot happen again. We were too slow in putting a stop to it. I'm bringing this here for review, because I would like some support in making it clear that wiki-stalking and hurling round of unsubstantiated accusations of vandalism and sockpuppetry are not going to be tolerated, particularly from an indefinitely-blocked user who has been unblocked on probation.</p>
<p>I don't want to clog up the admin noticeboard, so I've created a subpage with more information <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_Robertsteadman_e505.html" title="User:Musical Linguist/Robertsteadman">here</a>. I know it can be a bit of a bore to start looking through a case that you don't have any experience of, but I'd very much appreciate some reaction. And by the way, although I and Gator1 deleted Rob's user and talk pages at his request when he left, I have undeleted the earlier versions, so as to be able to provide evidence of his behaviour.

<dd>Ann has missed some vital information out about Neuropean being an internet stalker from another site who had followed me here, has used several different accounts to harrass me. Count of the Saxon Shore (Crusading Composer) etc. may not have been a banned user but should have been. The stalking, as Ann well knows, went beynd WP and the TES forum into real life - she was informed of all this. I do not deel I wiki-stalked him - I edited some articles he had edited once I looked into his actions. If I did something wrong I apologise. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">user: Syrthiss</a> is well aware of all this and, from emails I have received, agrees that Neuropean was a trouble maker and agrees that evidence I have supplied him with shows a definite link to an internet troll and stalker from another web site. I think it is a great shame that Ann, knowing all of this, and being someone with whom I have had major disagreements with is now using this as a trump card to win an old battle over the Jesus article. Her entry here is truly the ultimate in bad faith edits. Robertsteadman 17:32, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Given that <i>six</i> checkuser admins said that there was absolutely no doubt of sockpuppetry, and given that they knew you work in a school, there must have been <i>much</i> more to it than that, even though they never give details of what they find as they don't want to teach editors to get better at sockpuppeting. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 18:55, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've already agreed that Neuropean is probably Count Of The Saxon Shore, so I don't think there's anything odd about him reappearing after I had said that I had undeleted your talk page. He knows that there's some nasty stuff that he wrote on that talk page, and so he logged on as COTSS to protest against the undeletion. That's not a violation of policy, he wasn't taking extra reverts or votes, and I doubt if he'll be back. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 18:55, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I agreed to allow him back, but I think it's a bit much that an indefinitely-blocked user who returns without permission and is then kindly permitted to resume activity keeps hurling the word "sockpuppet" at another editor who (if it really was Count Of The Saxon Shore) was <i>not</i> indefinitely blocked, and was therefore perfectly permitted to return, and was also free to start afresh with a new identity, and was not using the newly-registered account to get extra votes or reverts. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 19:09, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it was quite right to make the official reason sockpuppet of banned user, since he had been unblocked and allowed back on parole. However, I do support the block on the grounds that his indefinite block was lifted on condition that he behave himself, and that he resumed his abusive behaviour. It's not even a question of blocking him for his recent behaviour, bad though it was: it's simply that he was already indefinitely blocked and when he was given another chance, he started upsetting other editors, bullying and wiki-stalking. I honestly don't think he's able to change. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 21:25, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's technically possible for any admin to unblock an editor blocked by another admin. It should not be done without thoroughly discussing it in advance, either with the blockin admin, or, if he's not available, here at AN/I. Unfortunately, some admins do unblock without discussion, and sometimes original blockers reblock, leading to a wheel war. Let's hope that any further action will be discussed in full here before any overturning of the block is considered. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 21:25, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding the above discussion... I'm reasonably sure that Neuropean was the person who stalked Robert off-wiki a while ago (commented by Robert above), who came here with the knowledge that Robert would be unable to handle his presence. I will take some of the blame upon myself in that I started a wikibreak just as the Neuropean conflict began, though I advised Robert to talk to another admin (Tony Sidaway was one of the names I gave him) to help sort the situation while I was away. All that said, I'm disappointed Robert couldn't just step back from the situation when Neuropean started making overtures (and FWIW Robert told me he felt he stepped over the line as was sorry for it). I've never been stalked IRL or webwise so I don't know how that effects people's future behavior. I wish there was some other way, but per wiki policy and the terms of his parole I have to agree with the block. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 12:29, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I know that I said that I wouldn't edit here again but I feel quite strongly that an indefinite ban isn't appropriate here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert isn't a vandal out to disrupt, he is just very opinionated and stubborn. Yes, he can be quite rude at times, but my experiences on Wiki lead me to believe that abruptness is not an uncommon feature. His problem has been that he is looking for cabals and conspiracies and, to a very small extent, he has been justified in this.</li>
<li>Has he said sorry? Yes he has. Is he likely to do this again soon? No, I don't think so. I know for a <b>fact</b> that he can change for the better.</li>
<li>He has only <b>really</b> overstepped the mark with me and I suppose I am a red rag to abull to him (although he sees <b>me</b> everywhere, even when it is not <b>me</b>. I have promised never to post on <b>any</b> forum where he is a member, so future suspicion shouldn't be a problem. I feel that if I hadn't AfD'd his article, he would have continued in his 'ways' but not gone OTT, so I would rather not see him blocked.</li>
<li>I object in the strongest terms to any suggestion that I have stalked him in real life, I don't know exactly what evidence he has presented in his private emails, but whatever it is has got to be wrong. But I suppose that he has found my behaviour annoying - the AFD may have been a WP:Point, but wasn't meant as a 'personal' attack. It went downhill from there.</li>
<li>It has never been my attention to upset anyone - including Robert and I do not want to see him lose his hobby because of me. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, I'm sure Robert will agree with me.</li>
<li>I ask all concerned admins to give him one more chance. Blocking him will mean one less contributor and (although I still say that Moortje <b>was</b> an article crying out for a AfD,) he has made many positive contributions.</li>
<li>His probation wasn't very specific. Instead of blocking him, I ask that he be given more specfic terms and he be held to those in his <b>future</b> actions. Any admin action should be based upon '<b>future'</b> productivity and not <b>past</b> indiscretions. I think that's the whole point of Wiki.</li>

<dd>On reflection, and knowing what Brian is currently going through, I suspect that he should remain blocked until his condition improves to the point where he is ready to return. He can stick {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} on his Talk page when he feels he's ready, and then maybe he could opt for a period of mentorship.

<dd>Exactly how great are this guy's edits when he is "productive" that would justify allowing him to return <i>ever</i> after that blast at KM? Wikipedia is not therapy. I support a permanent ban. The thing is, he can always return to productive editing under a new ame, and if he gets his whatever under control, no one will ever know that it's him. But with this last screed on top of all the previous episodes, he has lost the right to return to the Brian G. Crawford account and whatever good karma he has accumulated. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 12:44, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
The fact that he has produced "productive edits" is a total red herring - if you went to your place of work and started calling people a "dyke" and making the threatening comments there, it's unlikely your workplace is going to say "oh but he gets all his paperwork in on time". While, clearly, we do not get paid here, surely the aim and aspiration is for to work together in as productive and as professional manner as possible?</p>
<p>The editor in question might have issues that he needs to work out - but other editors and administrators cannot be expected to be the virtual punchbag on which he does so. Looking at his edit history, I'm surprised to see (to put it mildly) that we are even discussing anything less than a total ban. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 13:18, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brian G. Crawford and Erik the Rude are the same person. I have not made real physical threats to anyone. Those that believe they have been physically threatened need to get out of the house more. Scott Groehning/Kelly Martin is a disgusting abomination who would not be taken seriously by any police organization, given his status as a known pervert. You need to lighten up, people. This is not real life. If you want to cross the line by calling the police, you should be prepared for the sequellae such as civil suits and the discovery process. What I did to Catamorphism, nominating her for adminship when I knew she would be attacked visciously and shot down was just my sick idea of fun. I have to admit, I hate bulldykes, and I've hated bulldykes ever since I saw them on my college campus. They told us to be tolerant, but I just can't. There's a certain degree of conformity and decorum that must be maintained. Catamorphism had better change her attitude if she wants to get a real job. I can return at any time, in any form I choose. I can be anything I need to be. My knowledge is so general that it would be hard to label me a sockpuppet. Looks like you're out of luck. Brian G. Crawford 17:58, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you're worried that an admin is going to see that deleted edit and decide, for whatever reason, to email that address, then by all means request that the revision is removed. I doubt any of the oversight users will do so. Here's the thing: Oversight is used to remove revisions that the Wikimedia Foundation and/or oversight users don't feel need to be readable by admins. It's for when AGF isn't quite enough, when faith in the trust placed in administrators isn't quite enough to make WM feel safe. In any event that oversight IS used when it's not needed...and trust me, Wikimedia <i>does</i> watch the use of oversight very closely...then the user with the oversight permission loses that permission. Each time they use that permission, they have to be sure that what they're doing is the Right Thing To Do <i>and</i> that it falls under the guidelines given by the Foundation. Unlike, say, if I delete the wrong article, the use of oversight is very permenant and involves direct developer intervention and quite a bit of work (comparable to checkuser) to reverse. If you have any further questions, I'd be happy to answer them. <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 03:19, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user has uploaded 54 images, all lacking any statement of source or license. The user has been warned about this, multiple times, with no response. The user has been blocked before, for 24 hours, for doing this. Today, the user uploaded 29 of the 54 images. I have blocked the user for 48 hours for this. I am looking to gage support for banning this user, from this account and any future sockpuppets that can be clearly identified as beloning to the same individual. Please state your thoughts on this below. Thanks for your time. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 09:34, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How irritating and what a waste of time. His user page says: <i>I am a normal boy who like</i> [sic] <i>to have fun.</i> Maybe he can't read English so well. If he does more of the same after his 48-hour vacation, give him a longer block. If the same pattern emerges elsewhere from another user while he is (or isn't) blocked, permaban the sock. If he doesn't get the hint after a ban of a week or so, permaban him. (NB I haven't actually bothered to look up the relevant policy; I assume that you have already done so.) -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:45, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The general way I do it is simply to double the block lengths each time, and re-block after each bad image is uploaded. The progression would be 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, 8 days, 16 days, 1 month (32 days), 2 months (64 days), 4 months (128 days), etc. Probably by the 4 month time I'd just change it to a perma block. I haven't ever had to go that far. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 09:50, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps if he, for the most part, begins to adhere to the image policy, you should be more cautious with the block. So far, he clearly has been deliberately uploading pictures incorrectly, but later on you have to account for mistakes. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> <small>(joturner)</small> 12:49, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok, let me amend my suggested procedure above - for every 5 sourced and licensed images uploaded, the next block length is halved; that will get it down to minimal with only a few good images uploaded. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 05:53, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user's main account was indef blocked, but he has used other user names and disconnecting and reconnecting and resetting his IP address. He seems to be using <a href="http://internet.libero.it/" class="external text" title="http://internet.libero.it/" rel="nofollow">this Italian ISP</a>, and if Wikipedia were to put long-term blocks on the two /16 ranges he editted from, that would block more than 130,000 Italian users from editting the English Wikipedia anonymously or otherwise. However, it appears that the only edits from these wide ranges are from this editor, and the ranges can be narrowed down further to 151.44.75.0/24 through 151.44.125.0/24 (I do not know the CIDR terminology for showing a range of ranges) and 151.47.75.0/24 through 151.47.125.0/24. These ranges would end up blocking near 25600 editors (I think) instead of the 130000 users of internet.libero.it. I am requesting assistance here, as there doesn't appear to be any way that this huge range can be dealt with. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 03:47, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

In general, removing content from talk pages is considered <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>, and according to policy the only exception to that is removing personal attacks, which does not include spam.

<dd>Tony, maybe I'm not clear on this, but the message in the provided diff didn't seem to request a vote in either direction, it simply served to notify the user that a vote was taking place.

<dd>Kasreyn, I didn't have much experience with both Zereshk and InShaneee, when I was involved in Zereshk's block by InShaneee. Zereshk asked all persian editors whom he knew, to vote for the AfD of the article Misconceptions about Iran (or moved to Views of Iran in Media or something similar). Well, Zereshk was spamming. It was his first time and he didn't know about the policy at all (as I can argue he even now doesn't know the details of what has happened to him now). From the very beginning, InShaneee was warning him of getting blocked. I have been around in wikipedia for awhile. I know, nobody gives a {{test4}} for a first time vandalism for example. Anyhow, I was at that time surprised with InShaneee's warning. Aside from the fact that Zereshk has over 15,000 edits to nearly 3,000 articles and this was his first time doing spamming, I told him that yes, he has done spamming but he was only notifying editors who have experience of living in both west and Iran. Zereshk added that some editors whom he has notified have given votes against his vote. Anyways, I asked the other editor who first reported Zereshk to notify several other editors on his choice. It was considered against policy and it passed. Please continue the story in the section on Zereshk here:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=65176255&amp;oldid=65175431" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=65176255&amp;oldid=65175431" rel="nofollow">[84]</a> I was mainly objecting to the length of Zereshk's block and and that his controversial comments could be read or understood in other ways. I was "only" asking another admin to just "look into" this case. Nothing more. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 10:11, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This confusion probably would have been avoided with an explanatory edit summary (no offense to InShanneee, not all of anyone's edit summaries are exemplary). I've noticed that many admins and veteran editors get huffy when someone removes content from their talk page, often saying that they can decide things for themselves, yet they do it to others without due consideration or explanation (I'm not saying that this is what happened in this case). Also, while it looks like vote stacking in this case to me, whether it is vote stacking, and therefore whether it should be removed, is usually decided by someone who disagrees with the alleged vote stacker's opinion, which is less than ideal. Removing the comments may not do much good, anyway, since editors will still get a new message notification and they can see the deleted text in the history of their talk pages. Finally, while I am opposed to what he was trying to do, if AfD is really not a vote, how can there be vote stacking? -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:41, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We are getting off-topic here. The point is this: As far as one can see from the actual<a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpamming_3172.html" title="Wikipedia:Spamming">policy</a>, internal spamming is not vandalism:</dd>
<dd><i>Wikipedia editors are not to engage in aggressive cross-posting in order to influence votes, discussions, requests for adminship, requests for comment, etc. The Arbitration Committee has ruled that [t]he occasional light use of cross-posting to talk pages is part of Wikipedia's common practice. However, excessive cross-posting goes against current Wikipedia community norms. In a broader context, it is unwiki...</i></dd>
<dd>As you see, no mention of vandalism, let alone a request to remove by third parties. In a sense, it is a matter of point of view how much cross-posting is <i>aggressive</i>. Even then, it is not vandalism according to policy, and is not to be removed.</dd>
<dd>On the other <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">policy page</a> we read under types of vandalism:</dd>
<dd><i>Deleting the comments of other users from article Talk pages, or deleting entire sections thereof, is generally considered vandalism. Removing personal attacks is often considered legitimate, and it is considered acceptable to archive an overly long Talk page to a separate file and then remove the text from the main Talk page ...</i></dd>
<dd>Thus, no mention of a legitimate deletion of internal spam or cross posting. <b>According to policy, The deletion of those comments is thus vandalism.</b> <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShervink_07f6.html" title="User:Shervink">Shervink</a> 12:10, 24 July 2006 (UTC)shervink</dd>

<dd>For those who don't know, Aminz's comments above are simply mocking me over my block of Zereshk (I told him to stop spamming, he said he'd continue, so I blocked him)(incidentally, his <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">user page</a> is now a giant rant about the evils of me and wikipedia). As for my actions, I only wish that policy allowed me to delete the edits from the page history entirely, since rolling back the spam messages did almost nothing to stem the tide of one-sided votes. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 22:01, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That said, we'd like people to keep their opinions to themselves (or take them elsewhere, like a message board) and actually work on some articles. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 03:05, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>InShaneee, true or false, there are two users who think the block at least in terms of its duration was not right. If they can not express themselves somewhere about their feelings, they can not work on the articles either. It may not be wiki policy but it is a humane thing. If you believe you were 100% correct in your decision, you should not be bothered by what Zereshk writes in his user page. Should you? If it is wrong, it will only prove something about himself and not about you. Similarly, all my posts here will prove something about myself if they are wrong and I have already accepted this. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 03:14, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aminz, I have never ONCE blocked someone without someone complaining that it was wrong. I can think of at least half a dozen users who've told me just that, and I am happy to report that they are all incorrect. As you'll notice, there's yet to be one admin here who's said that Zereshk shouldn't have been blocked. Now, Wikipedia isn't humane, either. It's not here for you to do as you please. We're trying to write an encyclopedia here, thank you. Your innermost feelings can wait until you've surfed elsewhere. I wasn't bothered by what Zereshk wrote, but the point was he doesn't GET to write that. If you can't be productive and useful, you shouldn't be here, period. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 03:28, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not inclined to second Aminz' sympathies for the conduct of the other blocked editor, but I don't see that Aminz has violated any policy, in letter or in spirit, and no diffs have been provided to substantiate the charges of "harrassment and personal attacks". Someone has made a mistake here. Aminz should be unblocked.Timothy Usher 06:39, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Timothy. It seems to me that there is too much enthusiasm here on the part of the admins to block people. You have that right for a reason, and you might need to reconsider what that reason was.</dd>
<dd>As for Inshaneee's post on my talk page, which I prefer to respond to here, I'm not saying Zereshk was right to do that. I'm saying that what you did is not strictly according to policy, which you by the way admit on my talk page "Just because it's not written down doesn't mean that it's not done by dozens of admins every day". So you mean admins can do as they please in Wikipedia? It's a good thing that you warned Zereshk, and maybe even that you blocked him (although I think for too long). What I am complaining to you about is only your editing of my talk page which I politely and respectfully ask you not to do in the future. I hope any misunderstandings are erased now. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShervink_07f6.html" title="User:Shervink">Shervink</a> 09:50, 25 July 2006 (UTC)shervink</dd>

<dd>Inshaneee, on my talk you acknowledge that what you did is not according to policy, but is done by many others as well. You claim now that you can do so because you are an admin. Do you realize that you are openly claiming you have a right to violate policy because you are an administrator? Once again, I'm not supporting the spreading of spams. But you are declaring that you are willing to violate policy in order to enforce it. That is unacceptable. I once again urge you not to do this, and I ask you not to remove content, spam or other, from my talk page, except for cases where you can back it up with the exact text of Wikipedia policy.

<p>After a bit of cooling down, looking back into what happened, I do admit that I lost my temper block of Zereshk. Even having a point can never justify my voluminous criticisms of InShaneee's administrative decision. I ignored the fact that one's admin actions does not necessarily depend on what a person has immediately done. I do admit that I lost my temper again after I got blocked myself and have done what I shouldn't have done; and by doing so, I have poisoned the well. So did I after Zereshk's block. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 08:51, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>He is referring to being blocked three times under three different user names, in pursuing this nutty vendetta against Gary Weiss who he is convinced I am. After this he whipped up a chain letter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CTSWyneken&amp;diff=65411775&amp;oldid=64931252" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CTSWyneken&amp;diff=65411775&amp;oldid=64931252" rel="nofollow">[102]</a> which he posted from various aliases on a number of user pages of people he presumed to have ill will toward myself and SlimVirgin.</p>
<p>At one point he sent around an email calling me (as his proxy for "Weiss") a "cancer" and saying: "I pushed back much harder than I normally would, and chose to operate outside the normal protocols, because the idea behind that exercize was to gather intel and save my bullets, not affect change. The time has come to affect change."</p>
<p>Then he moved here, pursuing an off-Wiki cyberstalking campaign (of questionable legality) here, and giving his Internet audience a blow-by-blow.<a href="http://messages.finance.yahoo.com/Services/Retail_(Catalog_and_Mail_Order)/threadview?m=tm&amp;bn=24012&amp;tid=109105&amp;mid=109105&amp;tof=-1&amp;off=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://messages.finance.yahoo.com/Services/Retail_(Catalog_and_Mail_Order)/threadview?m=tm&amp;bn=24012&amp;tid=109105&amp;mid=109105&amp;tof=-1&amp;off=1" rel="nofollow">[103]</a>. In the link, the Yahoo alias is the same as the email address of WordBomb/IPFrehley. Make no mistake about it: what you are dealing with is a determined and relentless off-Wiki cyberstalking campaign by an anonymous person who goes to great lengths to switch IP addresses to preserve his anonymity. The file originally posted by WordBomb and since deleted was professionally put together, and his switching from IP to IP shows a determination to evade detection -- not to mention evade the block on his three named aliases, which he has of course done very easily.</p>
<p>He has so many IPs and aliases that it is hard to keep track of them. Three named aliases have been blocked and a fourth (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchroedinger_the_Cat_92cb.html" title="User:Schroedinger the Cat">User:Schroedinger the Cat</a>) remains active. That was created yesterday for the purpose of harassing the administrator who blocked him.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 13:46, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would respectfully ask that an administrator take a look at recent activities on <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMantanmoreland_0e47.html" title="User talk:Mantanmoreland">User talk:Mantanmoreland</a>. The user has archived a current and very significant ongoing discussion and warning from a Wiki administrator and member of the ArbComm committee regarding the use of multiple identities on Wikipedia. I tried, respectfully, to ask Mantanmoreland to keep this material current. I put up a post asking him to clear up any confusion and doubt created by this situation by clearly identifying how many user identities he is presently using, or has used, on Wikipedia. He has now twice deleted these remarks, and labelled them as “trolling,” something he does commonly as a way of removing anything he doesn’t want on his talk page. I believe this is a situation that warrants an administrative warning, or a significant block. This behavior has been repeated many times over quite a long time. Thanks.

<dd>How would one go about determining the use of multiple identities on Wikipedia? I truly don't know. I'm happy to let it go, but I have no indication that the user will in fact cease and desist from using multiple personalities. Please advise how one can investigate and determine the use of multiple identities. It is appropriate to archive an administrative warning so quickly on one's talk page? Ironically, this same user told me that this was not appropriate when I was archiving. Let me know what Wiki policy is on this. Thanks. Ptmccain 13:49, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After a riveting read of the talk page, I would conclude that ALoan's actions are correct. There appears to be one very motivated editor itching to move the page (even inexplicably threatening RfCs to one editor who - correctly - described his actions as 'page appropriation'), and a number of editors who believe the page is fine where it is. Therefore, the page should stay where it is, as per consensus, and the numerous precedents on Wikipedia that ThePromenader seems to be ignoring. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 15:04, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 'hiding' was indeed a step beyond, but I think we can attribute this to the high editing temperatures caused by the wholesale reverting and short-sightedness in all this. It doesn't matter who's on 'who's side' but the verifiablilty of it all - by all means, let's talk, but through referenced fact only please. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePromenader_3b0e.html" title="User:ThePromenader"><span style="font-family: Times; font-size:12px;"><span style="font-size:16px;">T</span>HE<span style="font-size:16px;">P</span>ROMENADER</span></a> 17:49, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes I have and until the article either hs appropriate content or an appropriate name I'll do it till the situation is described properly. I have no intentions on accepting erronous information on the grounds of User:Hardouin having particular and special beliefs when it comes to geography. <b><a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_scarlet_6377.html" title="User:Captain scarlet"><font color="#000000">Captain Scarlet</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptain_scarlet_567e.html" title="User talk:Captain scarlet"><font color="#FF0000">and the Mysterons</font></a></i> 18:50, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is true that the article cannot remain in error, and will eventually change - but the fact that the road to this is obstructed by one using any means but reference to reverse any progress towards this indeed maddening. I do understand the frustration, but I wouldn't go drawing the line in that way: what we need is some sort of referee to ask for reference in the matter, then all will be clear and we can be done with all the referencless bantering and unjustified reverting and we won't have to bother anyone. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePromenader_3b0e.html" title="User:ThePromenader"><span style="font-family: Times; font-size:12px;"><span style="font-size:16px;">T</span>HE<span style="font-size:16px;">P</span>ROMENADER</span></a> 23:46, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those are precisely the sort of attitudes which will keep the article protected. I have blocked <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_scarlet_6377.html" title="User:Captain scarlet">Captain Scarlet</a> for a week because his response to the protection was (yet again) to try to subvert it and avoid discussion by changing links in other articles in anticipation of the "inevitable" name change. Negotiate, properly, on the article's talk page. Having looked at the history and "evidence" myself, I'm inclining towards the view that the current name's the right one and that moving to another name would represent the triumph of mindless literalism and pedantry over common sense and common usage - but I'm not going to get involved in the discussion, just in ensuring that any changes are the result of proper discussion, consensus and compliance with policies and guidelines. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 09:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look, you were right to block the article and put a stop to the reverting/moving/forking etc, and I even thank you for it. As for attitude, this only appears where discussion fails, and it would seem that this must again be discussed. As you seem to be getting involved, I can thank you for that too.
