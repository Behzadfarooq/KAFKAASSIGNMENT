Twenty minutes after the IP user's last edit, a new user, NewAwlins Traveler made their first edits, which seemed to be slight formatting changes to the spam links. This user has also kept adding the links back into the article, leading to the obvious conclusion that they are one and the same. As such, this user was given a spam3 warning. The links have since added the links again, and I removed them.--<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrat_53ce.html" title="User:Drat">Drat</a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/r/a/User_talk%7EDrat_c90f.html" title="User talk:Drat">Talk</a>)</small> 02:10, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi the article <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zahira_College_Colombo_f632.html" title="Zahira College Colombo">Zahira College Colombo</a> was tagged for COPYVIO on 13th of April, I am the creator of the article and assure that it is not a verbatim copy of the webpage mentioned in the copyvio tag. The article follows a similar structure thats all, The creator of the article on the mentioned webpage is also me, so I have the ownership of it, but I have no means of proving the ownership, so I am not going to try it. But the article I have created in wikipedia, is not a verbatim copy, it has taken a very long time for the admins to check this. Could somebody check and remove the tag? or delete the article.

<dd>It occurs to me that if you added a GFDL copyright notice to the bottom of your angelfire website article, then it would be obvious to everybody that the article can be used on Wikipedia without fear of Copyright Violation. Would that be a possibility&#160;? It would certainly prove that you are the author and that you are happy for it to appear on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 04:31, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, The text I have added is from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Zahira_College_Colombo/" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/Zahira_College_Colombo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Zahira_College_Colombo/</a> same thing is copied by someone into angelfire webpage, I can put GFDL copyright notice, but GFDL allows only a verbatim copy of the page, please correct me if I am wrong, my article is not a verbatim copy of the webpage. if just adding GFDL would solve the problem I can do it. And copyvio notice should point to the above site. Please advice <a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMyst%C3%ACc_07bb.html" title="User:Mystìc">«₪Mÿš†íc₪»</a> 11:54, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This has been tagged as db-copyvio by <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">User:SPUI</a>. I untagged it because (a) it's not content from which the commercial ocntent provider is trying to make money (per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>); (b) it's his company anyway; and (c) it's in User space. So, it's a user who has copied and pasted his bio from the website of the company he owns; deleting it as a copyvio seems like <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> to me.

<dd>Call me a copyright paranoid, but is there any evidence that User:Sbekele is actually Sophia Bekele? Since this user has only one contribution so far, I do not see the point of insisting on her having a user page. - Liberatore(<a href="../../../p/a/o/User_talk%7EPaolo_Liberatore_53e0.html" title="User talk:Paolo Liberatore">T</a>) 13:54, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>From an entirely different pespective, I'm concerned about page rank boosting by linking through user pages, as well as the propensity of some to use their user pages as web pages. That's not a definite opinion on <i>this</i> case, but I think doing a speedy delete after 2-3 days of inactivity and/or 2-3 days of non-productive edits would be in order. I don't think we solve our problems by "userfying," even if we get to avoid being meanies who delete things that way. (Again, this is general, not specific.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:36, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. We're not here to boost some person's sales or pagerank. And based on her meager contributions, I think that's exactly why she's here. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(tóg)</a> 16:54, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I think that that might still be considered a copyvio, as a) we don't know that she's the real owner (per Paolo Liberatore), and b) I doubt that such a new user would have any concept of the GFDL. I'd say call it a copyvio and ask if they really want to license it (as you've done). If so, then great. Otherwise, delete it. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(tóg)</a> 16:54, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am rather concerned on the grounds of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, as this material has only been on Wiki for a few hours, and we have no evidence of this person's future intentions. If it is posted by Sophia Bekele, then she could, from the bio, be a very valuable contributor in the future, and should be encouraged to be so. Over-reaction could alienate her completely. On a technical ground it is copyvio, unless authorisation is received from a valid email address associated with the origin of the material (i.e. the company). Re. page rank boosting - there isn't even a link from the user page, so it's a poor attempt at doing that and suggests that may not have been the intention. Reading through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Sbekele&amp;oldid=51332246" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Sbekele&amp;oldid=51332246" rel="nofollow">the bio</a>, I wonder if there is enough notability to merit an article on her or her company. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 17:33, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's why I suggest not acting for a day or two. If two days pass without any further contributions, we can assume a vanity entry.

<dd>If Dennis took the pictures, Dennis owns the copyright. If Dennis owns the copyright, he can choose to licence the images under the GFDL.

<dd>Yes, but if Dennis chooses to release them under the GFDL, shouldn't his homepage say that, rather than saying "© Dennis Chan 2004-2006"? Aren't the two mutually exclusive? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 10:21, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not at all. The GFDL only works because Dennis is the copyright holder. If he's not the copyright holder, he can't license them. The GFDL doesn't restrict Dennis' rights in any way. It restricts <i>your</i> rights to use the image in a way inconsistent with the license. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 12:08, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But doesn't the GFDL permit me to use the image in some ways that a copyright would prohibit, such as by modifying it? The GFDL allows me to modify his image so long as he's still traceable as the original author, right? But the copyright for the very same image on his web page prohibits me from modifying his image. So what the Wikipedia image page says and what the source page says are incompatible, aren't they? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 12:27, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The GFDL is just a license that permits certain uses of Dennis' copyrighted material. Unless he chooses to assign the copyright to someone else, he still retains it, even though he has licensed the material in a way that makes it possible for others to use it.</dd>
<dd>For example, if you were to take the image and reuse it without attributing it to Dennis, he would still be able to sue you for copyright infringement—you would be using his copyrighted work outside of the conditions imposed by the license (in this case, the GFDL).</dd>
<dd>Normally if you wanted to use or modify Dennis' work, you would have to contact him, seek permission, negotiate licensing terms, and lay out all the conditions under which you could use his pictures. By licensing the images under the GFDL, Dennis saves himself that time and hassle. He can just say, "<i>here</i> are the terms and conditions under which I will let other people use my copyrighted work. Enjoy!" He still holds the copyright on the images, and he's welcome to licence them to other people or groups under whatever terms that they might agree to. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 13:16, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Furthermore considering the rather clumsy nature of the GFDL it is quite posible people who want to use your images will want to contact you to ask for (or even perhaps buy) the rights to use them outside the GFDL.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 13:48, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been repeatedly, at least every other day, blocked on the basis that someone else using my IP address has infringed the rules - though I never have. The last IP address where this occurred was 205.188.116.135.</p>
<p>I suspect that this is because I use AOL as my service provider.</p>
<p>This is not just inconvenient, locking me out for more than a third of the time, but it also wastes a considerable amount of time - I have just spent 2 hours cleaning a topic (as requested on the page) only to have my work blocked and disappear!</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do about this?</p>

<p>As an admin and an inadvertent AOL user (I use Netscape dialup, but that's owned by AOL), I'm bugged endlessly by this. I have my own version of a policy, but no one would ever agree to it. I think all IP's should be visible for all editors, account or no, and that way admins putting blocks on vandals with names won't accidentally hit an AOL IP with an eternal darkness block. After all, I'm not sure quite <i>what</i> privacy we get by not having visible IP numbers, as an IP doesn't really say where you are anyway (as our vandals prove every day with their open proxy bounces). Like I said: no one would ever agree with me. However, I am a sympathetic ear for fellow "AOL" users caught in collateral blocks. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:04, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We were just discussing this in the previous section of this page. AOL and AOL-owned ISP users are regularly blocked accidentally. Usually, this is because a vandal with an account using AOL gets blocked. The auto-blocker then blocks all IP's associated with the vandal's account, which will be all AOL IP's. This is a drag because the person doing the block didn't knowingly block AOL, and it's a true hassle to unblock, because one has to go to <i>all the AOL IP addresses</i> to unblock. It's even worse than <i>that,</i> though, because the block doesn't actually hit the vandal! The vandal's IP is renewing with each page load, so he or she gets off scot-free, while some innocent gets blocked. Many admins (most admins) will understand and unblock if you're hit by accident. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:29, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I removed the information prior to being blocked. The reason I want it completely gone now is because users such as Malber are re-publishing the information in several locations, and that is not acceptable. I did add it of my own free will, true, but that was because I was attempting to foster accountabilty, when I thought that Wikipedia was still a decent place. As it turns out, it just became troll food, and that's why I want it gone. --72.160.80.78 01:38, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, and lies do not become you Raul. I've only gone on ONE vandalism spree, after enduring a multitude of abuses from you, NicholasTurnbull, and several other editors. I was wrong in doing so, true, and I recognize that. That's the only "vandalism spree" I have ever gone on, despite what summaries you use when blocking thousands of potential contributors by instating range blocks on 72.160.1.1/16. I've toyed with your userpage and NicholasTurnbull's userpage, but that is not the same as a "vandalism spree". I also have not at all harrassed Musical Linguist. She just happened to be the user most frequently watching your talk/userpages when I went a'trollin'.

<dl>
<dd>Truthfully, 30021190 doesn't look so random to me... it's a fairly easy-to-remember number with a lot of repeated digits, and likely had some meaning to its user. I think username blocking for randomness should be limited to situations where there is strong reason to believe that a username is genuinely random; at the very least, admins should ask before blocking on grounds of randomness, to determine whether the name in question is genuinely random, or if it just refers to something they don't know about. As noted above, <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> could easily have been blocked on joining by a careless admin who didn't bother to ask about the name. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 09:22, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actaully, I started editing on Wikipedia long before that policy clause was put in place.

<dd>To some degree, we're out on a limb here. His blog is his blog. What's there may indicate his intentions here, and so it might be evidence of his intent to stalk, disrupt, or vandalize, but we can only really care what Wikipedia has. If he wants to use his blog to say that we're all chronic bedwetters, that's his business, and I'm sure he'll get all the readers that a private blog gets. It's just one more opinion floating around out there. On the other hand, we can all watch his edits on Wikipedia with an especially jaundiced eye and keep a record of his first hand testimony from outside, and, of course, if any such statements ended up on Wikipedia pages, we'd delete them and arbitrate/block. I'm not sure how we can block someone on Wikipedia for something they did anywhere else. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 09:29, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In response to Geogre's suggestion that "if he wants to use his blog to say that we're all chronic bedwetters, that's his business", this simply isn't the case." For instance, in the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Jason_Gastrich_f733.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> case, Gastrich was sanctioned, in part, for his use of an external website to solicit meat puppetry. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 23:38, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jeezus, Tony. If you can't see the dangers in punishing people for things you disapprove of off-wiki, I think you need to give it more consideration. I understand the notion that taking wikiconflicts off the wiki doesn't actually help resolve them, and people who write lists of "fascists", "Jew cabalists", "rouge admins", whatever, generally are going to run into trouble here anyway (or already have), but you really might have another look at Geogre's POV, which I think is sensible. -- Grace Note.</dd>

I got an impression that he is a good productive although sometimes hot-tempered editor.

<dd>Usually if a blocked user is involved in an ArbCom case, it's a good idea to propose an injunction to unblock for the purposes of participating in the case if you want to unblock them.

<p>No comment on the merits of the case, but this happens way too frequently. Please, everyone, when blocking a user, <i>leave them a note explaining why</i>.

<dd>Hi Friday, I agree that leaving a note is helpful, but at the same time, admins shouldn't unblock people without checking with the blocking admin first, unless there's been an unambiguous error. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:11, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A block without justification <i>is</i> an unambiguous error, in some people's eyes. I agree that we shouldn't revert others lightly (whether admin actions or normal edits), but a revert is not always automatically inappropriate. Keeping things going smoothly is more important than fragile admin egos. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:15, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An unambiguous error is one that doesn't rely on a judgment call e.g. when someone blocked for 3RR clearly didn't revert four times. It's not a question of fragile egos, but of trusting admins to have blocked for a reason, and accepting that maybe they know more about the situation than the rest of us. It's about not assuming we always know best. It's about being able to tolerate than we disagree with a block but that someone else has decided to make it anyway. It's about not having a gigantic ego, in fact.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:21, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I`m taking a long break from this whole thing, but just for the record; as I was working on the case I saw two more users complaining about user Zora`s rudeness and incivilities, and because their grievances were similar to the editors involved in the case, I civilly asked the two users to review and participate in the ArbCom case, such that the committee will hear their voices. I had no idea this was illegitimate or counted as spamming. I have never been blocked for incivilities, and was not so in this case, nor was I “<i>obnoxious</i>” in any way as the admin who blocked me suggested. Had I been warned about this, rest assured I would have discontinued it. Just to note though, others involved in the case, including user Zora herself had asked many editors to go and help her out in the case by leaving positive feedbacks. Blocks like this have heavy consequences, so I urge the admins to not allow their temper get the best of them, and to kindly communicate with the user beforehands. I also want to add that I`m grateful that <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a> took it upon themselves to do this, because as it turns-out, after the unblock I was able to post a proposal in the case, and it helped greatly, since the case was motioned to close a few hours later after that. Otherwise, I would not have had the chance to submit my refutation<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Aucaman/Workshop#Counter_Motions_by_Zmmz" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Aucaman/Workshop#Counter_Motions_by_Zmmz" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.<a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 18:01, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just a note: Just throwing-around some words can be damaging to a user’s credibility here, since even after the quick unblock by other admins, the original block will stay on the user’s block log.

<dd>Sockcheck? You're not referring to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfCU_fdd1.html" title="WP:RfCU">WP:RfCU</a> are you? To be honest, I can't see a case for a CheckUser since the editor in question is soon to be indefblocked simply for harrassment if s/he carries on with you. I'm watching them to see if they keep harrassing you, and if they do, I will block them. Sometimes a <b>final warning</b> can make someone get their act together. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Lord Deskana</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">Dark Lord of the Sith</a></sup> 22:42, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Right, I didn't know that it had changed name, and that it had its own page now, oops. And no, its not the indefinately blocked user who somehow latched on to me; its someone from an awful lot longer back who has constantly returned to mess around with my user page and make snide comments on my talk page.

<dd>I blocked indefinitely just minutes after Deskana had given a final warning. I don't see any point in unblocking; the account obviously exists for the purpose of harassment, and he has the option of apologizing on his talk page if he wants to turn over a new leaf. He has no useful edits. Regarding <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a>, they may think it's unncessary since he's been blocked, but if it's a sockpuppet of someone who's in the middle of a six-month ban, for example, the ban would be reset if the sockpuppetry is established. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 22:54, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Right, one of said users other sockpuppets, User:Zerozero, has reappeared for the exact same purposes (attack account). This is why I requested a checkuser...

<dd>Hmmm. Taking a good look at his talkpage, I'm not sure it's more politeness that's needed. He seems a little aggressive in defending his nonsense articles, coming close to harassment in some cases. Many of his invites to the Governor election have gone to administrators who've tried to deal with these articles, and with him. He seems to focus especially on the patient <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">User:Academic Challenger</a> (who told him in March, with uncharacteristic terseness, that "It is obvious that you are not President Bush"). I think it may be coming up to block time, and have dropped a note on Academic Challenger to see if there's anything he'd like to share. And in the Governor Cruft race, my vote goes to <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Cruft_d5f2.html" title="Eugene Cruft">Eugene Cruft</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 05:51, 7 May 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I have a lot of experience with this user. He seems to enjoy playing around with administrators. About a month ago he wrote an article called Charles Edward Cheese which I and several other admins deleted, but he kept recreating it for a while until finally he got tired of it and got me to agree to what he called a truce. I'm not sure what should be done with him. He seems to have made some good edits and from his user page he seems to be pretty intelligent, but I'm not sure how to get him to stop these types of actions. Basically I've politely responded to all of his messages and that seems to be working somewhat. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">Academic Challenger</a> 05:54, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know what on his userpage makes on think he is "pretty intelligent"; I don't get that impression. He lists himself in the non-existent category of "Wikipedians with an IQ of surprisingly high" which doesn't even obey the rules of English grammar.

<p>My question is about <a href="../../../m/r/u/Image%7EMru_Dancing.jpg_f1b4.html" title="Image:Mru Dancing.jpg">Image:Mru Dancing.jpg</a>, uploaded by <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> (<a href="../../../a/d/i/User_talk%7EAditya_Kabir_1620.html" title="User talk:Aditya Kabir">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aditya_Kabir_e8cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aditya Kabir">contribs</a>).

<p>Now, the problem with the image is a bit of frontal nudity of one of the dancers.

However, it appears that the dancer is underaged, and my question in this case is whether the image is legal to use in the articles or view it, considering US or more specifically Florida laws regarding images of underage people.

<dd>Prurient doesn't quite apply here, thats generally used to classify obscenity (appealing to a prurient interest).

<dd>Well, we do often use the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miller_test.html" title="Miller test">Miller test</a> in considering whether pornography is obscene; I'd suggest, for example, that an analysis of an <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Geddes_7a73.html" title="Anne Geddes">Anne Geddes</a> photograph would turn on the lack of appeal to a prurient interest. Your point with respect to the difference between nudity qua depiction of a natural human state and nudity qua tool of sexual arousal is well-made, but such distinctions are sometimes difficult for judges to make, and there is a tendency to classify all that involves human nudity as pornography. Notwithstanding the legal distinctions, though, Wiktionary gives them as either word as a synonym for the other, so I suppose it's all good.&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 06:31, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Long ago, I added a photo of Louis Gossett, Jr., as Anwar Sadat.

It repeatedly has been removed and the other pic inserted. My stance has been that there is room for both. The latest edit warrior is insisting -- IMO, absurdly -- that there are "too many pictures" and that the Arab's photo is "more important." From where I stand, just another example of afrophobia.

<p>I am running a bit impatient with editor <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorash_082f.html" title="User:Vorash">Vorash</a> (<a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVorash_e7ef.html" title="User talk:Vorash">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vorash_3ca6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vorash">contribs</a>). The editor started out as a well-respected user of the Wikipedia, (though he and I had some major problem/wars when I first came here). Late last year, he closed his account because "he was labelled as a vandal". His anger was increased when his "pride and joy" <a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_selling_music_artists.html" title="Best selling music artists">Best selling music artists</a> was listed for deletion. After closing his account, he has made a few edits to Wikipedia (perhaps a few edits per weeks). Here's the problem: he made some edits to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_singles_discography_e74f.html" title="Mariah Carey singles discography">Mariah Carey singles discography</a> a long time ago, which were modified by some anon editors, and especially by <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> (<a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtraordinary_Machine_a46b.html" title="User talk:Extraordinary Machine">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extraordinary_Machine_28b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extraordinary Machine">contribs</a>). For some reason, Vorash is determined to have the article his way, and he does this by reverting the entire article to months old version, completely wiping out <b>all</b> updates that have been made since that time: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=39686378&amp;oldid=39608623" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=39686378&amp;oldid=39608623" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=52120620&amp;oldid=52054970" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=52120620&amp;oldid=52054970" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=34527627&amp;oldid=34382496" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=34527627&amp;oldid=34382496" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=36082148&amp;oldid=36002808" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=36082148&amp;oldid=36002808" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=48087113&amp;oldid=48003288" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=48087113&amp;oldid=48003288" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>. Even though other editors (myself included) <a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVorash_e7ef.html#Mariah_Carey_singles_discography" title="User talk:Vorash">have tried speaking with him</a>, he is uncivil and unyielding.

<p>I gave Vorash one final warning on May 7, 2006 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vorash&amp;diff=52051893&amp;oldid=51498819" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vorash&amp;diff=52051893&amp;oldid=51498819" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. The day later, he reverted it to his month old version (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=52120620&amp;oldid=52054970" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariah_Carey_singles_discography&amp;diff=52120620&amp;oldid=52054970" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>). I am getting extremely impatient with him. I cant block him for 3RR because he does not do it three times a day: he slips in every other day or so and revert it. I once protected it, but one can only protect the article for so long. As Carey has a couple singles on the charts, the page needs to be updated weekly. I am tempted to block him indefinitely, but:</p>
<ol>
<li>It might be too drastic. I really do not want to abuse my power.</li>
<li>Blocking might have no effect. He rearely uses his account anyway. He'll probably just use another ISP.</li>
<li>as he and I have been in squabbles in the past, I dont want to be the one to block him.</li>
</ol>
<p>Can anyone help me come up with a solution? I do not necessarily endorse the current version of the article. What I'm concerned with, however, is his rude <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">disruptive</a> behaviour, and the fact that when he reverts the page, all the weekly edits are completely obliterated (wrong info is therefore deliberately introduced into the page). <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJournalist_823c.html" title="User:Journalist"><font color="navy">Oran</font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../j/o/u/User_talk%7EJournalist_14df.html" title="User talk:Journalist"><font color="blue">(t)</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Journalist_65e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Journalist"><font color="deepskyblue">(c)</font></a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Journalist_c8a5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Journalist"><font color="mediumblue">(e)</font></a> 17:18, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems to be standard procedure to unblock a user before reblocking them with a different duration. I was just wondering if it's necessary, or if it's a hangover from a time when Mediawiki didn't properly handle this situation? I ran some block tests on a dormant account I created<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Kingbotk" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Kingbotk" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. First, I blocked the account for 1 hour, then - without unblocking - for 15 minutes. <a href="../../../i/p/b/Special%7EIpblocklist_2536.html" title="Special:Ipblocklist">Special:Ipblocklist</a> showed the latest, current block to be ending in 15 minutes. Of course that information doesn't guarantee that the old block has actually been overridden, it merely suggests that it does.

<dd>Yeah, feature. Whenever any active block on a user expires, all blocks on that user expire.

Based on the ministerial training I've received, posting "Hey, I've got cyanide" messages on Wikipedia would be pretty atypical warning signs for a person seriously considering suicide. Not to sound callous, but I don't take this guy seriously, and both the extent of intervention available via Wikipedia and its impact is negligable.

<dd>I'm altogether concerned that this has become "the place to report people discussing on Wikipedia their intentions to commit <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a>" (I readily recognize that perhaps Moink offers that description sardonically, and I'd certainly concur with that spirit); one's discussing his/her prospective suicide ought only to be dealt with as any other vandalism. Where disruption to the project occurs (e.g., when a user inserts extraneous comments into mainspace or consumes talk page space with wholly irrelevant comments), a user should surely be blocked; where disruption does not occur (e.g., when a user simply posts comments apropos of an imminent suicide on his/her user page to no deleterious end [vis-à-vis the production of an encyclopdia]), nothing should be done. Having followed the discussion last week with respect to this issue, I'm reasonably sure my position doesn't have a great deal of support here, but I thought it ought to be noted that we are here to write an encyclopedia (cf., to insinuate ourselves into the lives of other editors where the primary object is not the expansion of the 'pedia). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 06:11, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, and to view it from a practical standpoint for the "suicidal user," if they're genuinely looking for help online, it seems very, very unlikely that they're going to do so by coming to Wikipedia to pore over an article on suicide. This is not a self-help site, and if someone's able to find their way to an article in Wikipedia, they're able to use Google to look up a resource that's actually helpful. I think this is a good example of <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_stuff_beans_up_your_nose_750d.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't stuff beans up your nose">Wikipedia:Don't stuff beans up your nose</a>... don't give vandals the impression that they can eat up resources by claiming that they're suicidal.

<dd>Well, I missed the discussion last week (where is it? I just looked for it and couldn't find it), and I think we've got a responsibility to do more than ignore this. I also don't like the notion of dismissing suicidal talk just because someone has been trollish in the past. I'm not saying that someone couldn't make claims of suicidal ideation in order to stir up trouble or get attention, but I'd rather err on the side of responsibility — better to feed a troll a bit than have someone commit suicide on our watch. Besides the moral questions, imagine the headlines if it turned out to be genuine: "Wikipedia ignored suicidal teen's pleas for help" and the like.</dd>

<p>This humor seems grossly inappropriate to me. I agree that Wikipedia isn't a suicide prevention / general selfhelp service, and certainly agree that potentially suicidal users should be pointed to another, appropriate, external resource / service. I do disagree with, for example, the concept that "personal problems of users are only personal problems of users and hence is of no concern to wikipedia comunity as a hole." (sic) I'll keep this focused at a purely project level and suggest that, at least, it is my hope that the community would be concerned if an editor was lost to the project through suicide. There's a whole wide world out there for mocking fellow humans - this discussion doesn't seem to be contributing to a better encyclopedia, IMVHO. And, as <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">user:kingboyk</a> points out, we have a <i>moral duty</i> to do <i>something</i>. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colon</a><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_Esperanza_bb00.html" title="User:Col tom/Esperanza"><font color="green">el</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Tom</a> 11:31, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To get this in before somebody tells us to discuss it somewhere more appropriate... all joking aside, I'm fairly certain that all of the editors above would upset if an editor committed suicide. However, the likelihood of someone coming onto Wikipedia to declare their serious, immediate intention of taking their own life is beyond remote. Based on my somewhat limited knowledge, when a person has a serious intention of suicide, they will begin to manifest by speaking to friends and family rather than strangers online. More importantly, they don't do so by tagging obnoxious comments onto talk pages <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mass_suicide&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50030902" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mass_suicide&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50030902" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> with happy faces on them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Potassium_cyanide&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50031286" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Potassium_cyanide&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50031286" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. Part of the reason that you may be misunderstanding some of the responses above as callous is because this is a easy to spot case of a vandal looking for attention — it wouldn't be the first time he's tried <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christ&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48745470" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christ&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48745470" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>.</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure how much experience you've had dealing with vandals, but they'll do pretty much anything for a laugh... faking suicidal tendencies wouldn't be that far up the list compared to other things that have gone down here. If one starts to pick up that he can start getting attention from editors that rush to every suicide claim, trying to track down their IP and call their provider, he's gonna do it again. On a practical level, there's nothing an editor can really do other than refer them to a self-help site, but like I said above, if they got here, they can get there. Since there still seems to be some users concerned, though, here's a template that you can use in such a case. Looks like this:</dd>

<p>Template:Suicidehelp</p>

<dd>I can't imagine that I'd be particularly distraught over the loss of any particular editor, and I surely hope the community writ large (and even any given editor) wouldn't be upset over my committing suicide. I, in any case, oppose our apprehending a moral duty (as a matter of policy; certainly individual editors may act, generally, as they wish in this respect) to intercede, and think it altogether inappropriate for us to offer, on a template, an external link to what is plainly an advocacy site (even as most may think the POV for which the site advocates--viz., that one oughtn't to kill him/herself--to be the "correct" view with respect to suicide). This relates, I suppose, to the discussion currently underway apropos of WP: NOT EVIL, and, I think, at the end of the day, the concerns that militate against our adopting that proposed guideline militate against our having an advocacy template here; we are here to write an encyclopedia, from which we may then benefit, and not to inculcate morals under color of policy. If one wants to express on his/her talk page the view that suicide is wrong or should be looked upon with disfavor, especially by those contemplating killing themselves, that's fine (at least if one believes user pages may contain expressions of such sentiments; I, as I've expressed elsewhere, believe that the use of user pages to express personal beliefs is beneficial, rather than harmful, to the project), but I don't think it at all appropriate that we should have a template that responds to a user's querying talk pages and the like about suicide. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 04:02, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW if you catch a copy and paste move quickly before any other edits have been done. Its generally best to just revert it. This avoids an admin having to go to the trouble of a history merge etc. It also reinforces the "don't do copy and paste moves" message by forcing the user who did it to go through requested moves if they still wan't the move to go ahead. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 16:03, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I may, the page does list several albums produced by the band, which meets WP:MUSIC ("Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels"), and Google turns up a fair number of supporting pages like <a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/lynch_mob/artist.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/lynch_mob/artist.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>.

<dd>(ec) I wouldn't sweat having done anything "wrong"- it's been undeleted, no harm was done. As for notability, we already have an article on the founder of the band, <a href="../../../d/o/k/Dokken.html" title="Dokken">Dokken</a> guitarist <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lynch_%28musician%29_a3ef.html" title="George Lynch (musician)">George Lynch (musician)</a>. They have a (quite brief) AMG bio. The article could be better, certainly, but a band founded by a musician we already have a decent article on shouldn't be speedied IMO. Also, for those who care about <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, there's the bit about "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable". Maybe this should be merged into <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lynch_%28musician%29_a3ef.html" title="George Lynch (musician)">George Lynch (musician)</a>- I'm not opposed to that, but I don't think it should have been speedied. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:13, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've explained for many times why it was like that. I wasn't able to submit a statement before case was opened, for I was blocked around that period. When the block expired the case was already opened based upon one-sided opinion, and the evidence and workshop had started. I could not pretend all these had not happened and submit a statement by then. The statement wouldn't have much effect, anyway, since the case was already opened and things were already getting on. I requested to reconsider its opening, but the ArbCom members obviously didn't care about fairness and justice of the arbitration mechanism. That's, frankly, disappointing. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 20:34, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If using an article from that Wiki as source, no specific GFDL note is necessary, just use standard referencing for specific statements</li>

<dd>I think that specific information can be added as references, and than I want to go to the actuall cources. So, I do not see the need for this kind of credit giving in the first place. It suggests as if the page is made by that source and imported in wikipedia, which is definatly incorrect.

<dd>If this is used in articles which used the AIDS wiki as a source, this template is a bad thing. If it is used in articles which are derivative works (or wholesale copies) from that wiki, then it's a good thing.

<p>I don't think the ban was unreasonable, but I welcome review and would accept removal of the ban by another administrator. I have no intention of getting involved in mediation, as Zeq requests. If mediation were likely to succeed, I very much doubt that the case <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Zeq_29c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Zeq">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Zeq</a> would have been required in the first place. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 04:37, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I am not going to argue the ArbCom case here again but to note that it arrived to ArbCom without any mediation or RFC.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To the currect issue:</p>
<p>Clearly in the <a href="../../../n/a/k/Nakba_day.html" title="Nakba day">Nakba day</a> case mediation has been proposed (and needed). Instead of accepting it ian Pichford (which has tried for two weeks to "trap" me by reverting and changing any edit I did on wikipedia (violating harrsament policy, despite numoures request to stop on his talk page) has choose to bring admin action aginst me. I suggest that anyone intersted in what goes on will ask Ramallite who does not agree with me on content of the article but understand that this is an honest content dispute with no malicious intentions on my part.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The absured thing of all is that <b>prior to Tony appliing the ban</b> I announced on the talk page that I will stay away from the article until it is mediated. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 06:42, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course intention matter. I was trying to resolve the edit war on issues that do not belong in this article. I created focus (by taking many contested issues out) while the other side tried to turn the article in another battle field about the events in 1948 israeli-Palestinian war are debated.

<dd>If you're involved in an edit war, you're edit warring. These issues need to be resolved on the talk page before they're taken to the article. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 19:38, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find Zeq's assertions somewhat puzzling. At the time I inserted the ban notice, at 2305 on 8 May, the last edit on the talk page had been by Zeq at 1942 UTC on 8 May, and the last edit on the article had been by Zeq at 1859 UTC on 8 May. For someone who said "I will stay away from the article until it is mediated", he seems to have been awfully active! Moreover, even while banned, he is attempting to persuade me to remove edits by another editor. He hasn't left this article alone even now. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 19:34, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tony, Check your facts: I made an edit that was to stop the editwar on the events at 1948 and clearly suggested that if someone don't like it they can revert it <b>and I will not make any more change</b> This is not an <b>edit war</b> this is an attempt at resolution. Also suggested to one editor in the edit war (Rammalite) to correct any fact I may have left out.</p>
<p>My only "sin" is being bold in trying to resolve the issue. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 20:25, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm still trying hard to get other people experienced in the subject matter to review the ban.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Meanwhile I am rescinding it because Zeq and others have raised several legitimate points that cast doubt on my original decision. I've removed the ban notice and hereby place this update on all other relevant notices. If he really needs to be banned from this article then some other administrator will be just as capable of imposing it. In the meantime I apologise to Zeq. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 18:12, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Not sure what that was about, but <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~pgk/autoblock.php" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~pgk/autoblock.php" rel="nofollow">this tool</a> may help to identify autoblocks in need of removal. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 12:29, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The best rule is to ask the user for thier IP. For those who have never seen it, <a href="../../../b/l/o/MediaWiki%7EBlockedtext_22db.html" title="MediaWiki:Blockedtext">Mediawiki:Blockedtext</a> is the message shown to blocked users; right at the very top is a line that says "Your IP address is ...". If they tell you the IP address, you can unblock it directly (just go to the unblock page and put in the IP) and it will unblock any autoblocks (yes, they are masked with a #12345-style code on the block list, but trust me, unblocking an IP unblocks any autoblocks on that IP). Trying to hunt down the right autoblock by the mask number is difficult and time consuming, not to mention frequently futile, and is best avoided; just ask the user for thier IP (they can email it to you if they're concerned about privacy) and then unblock it directly. <span style="font-family:Sans serif"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 13:16, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unblock the IP? But won't that unblock the person you were trying to block in the first place? Is there a way to undo the autoblock without unblocking an IP that you wish to remain blocked? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(talk)</a> 17:15, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There seems to be a misunderstanding of the nature of autoblocks; <b>autoblocks are placed against IP addresses, not accounts.</b> Though people tend to speak of thier accounts being innocently "autoblocked", that is not actually the case: Your account doesn't get autoblocked when you try to use a blocked IP; it just appears that way, because no edits are allowed from blocked IPs, including those from logged-in accounts. No block is ever placed against the innocent account itslef; it is the underlying IP that is blocked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What the autoblocker does is block IPs (only IPs) previously used by blocked user accounts if they are used again after the account name is blocked. The timeline is like this: User:Foo, who is on IP 12.34.56.79, vandalizes and an admin blocks that account name. Then, someone else, User:Example (maybe a sockpuppet of User:Foo, maybe someone innocent, the autoblocker doesn't know) tries to use that IP to do something else. Since the software knows Foo was using 12.34.56.78, it assumes that the new person on that IP is Foo trying to evade his block, and places an autoblock on 12.34.56.78, stopping all edits, signed in accounts included. (This is when User:Example requests an unblock, thinking they have been blocked; not the case at all: <b>Their IP is blocked, not thier account.</b> If they switched to a different IP, they would be able to edit immediately.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The autoblock of 12.34.56.78 is recorded on <a href="../../../i/p/b/Special%7EIpblocklist_2536.html" title="Special:Ipblocklist">Special:Ipblocklist</a> as #12345 (no relation between the IP numbers and the mask numbers; 12345 is just convenient), to prevent disclosure of the user's IP address. (If it didn't, you would see "...blocked 12.34.56.78...reason: Autoblocked because your IP was recently used by User:Foo"; this would reveal User:Foo's IP to the entire world, which is not something we routinely do. Why do we care, when it's a vandal? Well, because not everyone who is blocked is a vandal.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, the only way to clear an autoblock is to unblock the IP; when you unblock #12345, you're unblocking the IP represented by #12345 (in the example above, 12.34.56.78). The software doesn't care if you tell it to unblock #12345 or 12.34.56.78; the action performed will be to unblock 12.34.56.78 in either case. Note that nowhere in this process does the account User:Foo (the vandal) get unblocked; however, when 12.34.56.79 is unblocked, User:Example (who was never really blocked, just using a blocked IP) is immediately able to edit again.</dd>

<dd>Hopefully this helps with understanding it; if I've not managed to make the whole deal clear, let me know and I'll try again. <span style="font-family:Sans serif"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 05:35, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>It might become good practice to skim an AfD's history page before closing it, as there has been a recent trend of anon (IP address) users attempting to add votes to these pages. They often (somewhat successfully) try to pass themselves off as logged-in users, using a name followed by a timestamp. Occasionally this might be an actual registered user forgetting to log-in, but in practice they should come back after they've logged in and confirm that it was actually them. Recent examples of this include <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wuice_e879.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wuice">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wuice</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bernard_Tomic_dc83.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bernard Tomic">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bernard Tomic</a>.

<dd>Agreed. A good idea would be for the nominator of each AfD to have it watchlisted; that way, s/he can spot discrepancies and any attempts to game the system easily and quickly. <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> <small>(<a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a>)</small> 21:03, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are people who don't watchlist the AfDs they create? It saves some embarassment if you can withdraw your nom after additional information is revealed during an AfD.

<dd>These backslashing proxies are always CGI proxies, written in PHP, with magic_quotes enabled, and unable to deal correctly with magic_quotes. You do not need a scanner (and in fact a scanner would return a false negative, since these kinds of proxies are just normal web servers); just use a normal web browser. In this particular case, it opens a <a href="../../../c/p/a/CPanel_3fbf.html" title="CPanel">cPanel</a> page, which means it's a shared web host; that is enough for a indefinite block as an open proxy (someone else already blocked). --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 20:35, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apparently you are the guys to talk to about editing in the wiki.</p>
<p>I got a bit confused and wanted to thank Mr Wales for his site as it helped me in researching for a recent paper i did, but I think i put my comments under the wrong tab or wrong place, i dunno.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there was somewhere i could learn about to edit the wiki properly. i clearly am inadept at it, but i don't think that made name calling a necessity. i mean i don't own any spray paint anyway.</p>
<p>your help would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>ps is there an easy way to sign your name without having to copy the time every time?</p>

<p>So, I've just had a flare-up on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">Anti-Americanism</a>. After a week of often snarky talk posts with a red-linked editor and another editor who won't use talk at all (user or main space) I have them both on at the same time and, given that neither is particularly active, I got wondering if they're the same person. Anyhow, I was hoping some one could check User:Rkrichbaum and <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristinam_ebaf.html" title="User:Christinam">User:Christinam</a> to see if they're editing from the same spot. I could totally be wrong and just have a situation where two newbies disagree with me at once, but I want to do due diligence. I have three reverts there now and I'm a little frustrated: it's a months-old intro and it got gutted without consensus.

<p>Hi there everybody. <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_ea9e.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets</a> is a page which was created few weeks ago when <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> was rewritten. The point of the page is to collect evidence that a user is a sock and then take action. And for action to be taken we need admins. For now, only admin taking part in this project is me. So I'd like to see some more admins participating and giving me a hand there&#160;:-) If anybody's interested, it'd be nice to put the page on your watchlist and to comment new cases as they appear. Concerning currently open cases, if you wish, you can take a look at <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Oldwindybear_f321.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Oldwindybear">this one</a> as I'm having problems deciding what to do about it... Participation of non-admin users would be just fine too. Since non-admins cannot block, I invite them to comment, propose action or just give their view. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 16:45, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey -- I haven't been meaning to patrol this, but in the last few days I've come across at least 3 editors who have been username blocked and were confused as hell and wanted to be unblocked, some specifically offering to get a new username. Anyway, it's not that big a deal, but I just wanted to remind the admins who do username blocks to please put {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameBlocked_b445.html" title="Template:UsernameBlocked">UsernameBlocked</a>}} on the user's talk page, so they have some clue what has happened. It explains what the block is for, and what they can do to solve the issue.

<dd>In case you are not aware, I'll inform you that using {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameBlock_348c.html" title="Template:UsernameBlock">UsernameBlock</a>}} or similar as the block summary (example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>) affects what the user sees when he or she attempts to edit. The "edit this page" screen is replaced by the <a href="../../../b/l/o/MediaWiki%7EBlockedtext_22db.html" title="MediaWiki:Blockedtext">MediaWiki:Blockedtext</a> page. The "$2" parameter on the latter is replaced by whatever the block reason is. If it's a template, the contents of the template are displayed inside the pink box. Thus, if I blocked you for an inappropriate username, it would look something like this:</dd>
