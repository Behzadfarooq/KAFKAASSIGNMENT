<p>For the second time in a couple of days, there seems to be a serious ongoing effort to thwart a good faith VfD by premature deletion. I restored the disputed speedy, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Benbow_6272.html" title="Warren Benbow">Warren Benbow</a> a few days ago after reading the deleted stub and confirming that the claim of notability in that stub was correct. I expanded the stub to a reasonable size, with enough referrences to establish the subject as a candidate article for Wikipedia. For reasons that I cannot understand but which he has attempted to explain, <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">User:Geogre</a> disputes the right of an administrator to restore a disputed speedy. Today geogre speedied again. In order to placate his concerns I listed the article for deletion on restoring. Geogre has speedied for a third time. The article isn't even close to being a speedy candidate and I think geogre would admit this. Meanwhile the VfD is proceeding <i>but only when the editors are able to view the contents of the article</i>.</p>
<p>When administrators in good faith dispute whether an article is deletable, it seems to me that it is appropriate to make the article visible and invite other editors to view it and discuss whether it should be deleted--in other words, to list on VfD. I have done my best to ensure that this happens, but the other administrator keeps insisting that the article, despite not qualifying for speedy deletion, must be speedied.</p>
<p>There is <i>some</i> room for dispute about whether the statement "drummer, songwriter, music producer and educator" is an assertion of notability. <i>Some</i>, but not much. A brief google would have confirmed this claim and more: Benbow has worked with many prime names in the business and was a major collaborator with <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Ulmer_47d8.html" title="James Ulmer">James Ulmer</a> on the Odyssey album.</p>
<p>I would appreciate help in ensuring that this deletion discussion is able to run to its five-day term. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:02, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mr. Sidaway is warring to impose his view outside of process. Instead of creating a new article where the deleted one was, he undeleted it and then overwrote it with his new article. (To make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>.) The new article is worth keeping and should not be deleted regardless of Mr. Sidaway's fight with other admins. Mr. Sidaway has pointed out his opinion that VfU is for "non-admins" and has not given other admings <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> as he is requesting here. I suggest that Mr. Sidaway and the other admin(s) refrain from deleting or undeleting and let it be resolved as "non-admin"s would have to - <b>according to process</b> on VfU and/or VfD. ("and/or" in this case because of the admin war.) - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 21:23, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think everyone involved owes Tony an apology. Also, I have no problem with him undeleting it - the original version, while substubby, had real info, and why shouldn't that anon get credit for creating the article that turned into what it is now? According to process, Tony did nothing wrong, except perhaps undeleting instead of starting anew - <b>big whoop</b>. Much ado about nothing, and people are really ganging up on Tony here. You can whack off about process all you want, but we also have another little ideal here called <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 21:28, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I don't undelete stubs that have been deleted unless they are useful in providing information that I can use to expand on. Those initial stubs are usually all that I am given to go on when I write the article--usually I have absolutely no idea that the subject existed when I start to write (which is why I think this kind of stub is so fascinating).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have absolutely no problem with speedies, in practice well over nine tenths of all speedies are spot on. But almost every day I find quite reasonable article about apparently notable individuals that do seem to assert notability but get deleted anyway. I routinely undelete and expand, and they become worthwhile articles. A very small number have subsequently been VfD'd and they nearly always survive, so these aren't sickly children I'm creating, but hardy, tough articles capable of fighting for themselves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most times if I inform an editor that I've undeleted a speedy because I think he got it wrong, I'll get an acknowledgement, usually it's a very warm one in which the editor's good intentions stand out. I could count the negative feedback on the fingers of one hand. But, well, occasionally things will go sour even though I do my best. But only twice, and both in the past couple of days, have I seen editors fight so hard against the principle that their decisions can be challenged. I don't think I have anything to hide, I'll always take a dispute to VfD and I don't think it's a waste of time doing so. These are articles Wikipedia has a right to feel proud of and I'll gladly give Wikipedia the opportunity to prove it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If an administrator does a <i>speedy</i> which I recover and expand, and he thinks I was doing something wrong, well it's easy enough to challenge me. If you think the article was speediable, it stands to reason that the article will not survive VfD for one minute--administrators will come up and say that it is a speedy candidate. So take it there. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:48, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have omitted from the list above the large number of bad speedies done by another administrator. But most of all, you have omitted to make a substantive point.

<dd>The other administrator is not included because you made this your issue and I am responding. You say "why should an administrator refrain from recovering wrongly speedied articles" - I ask you why should an administrator refrain from deleting a wrongly undeleted article? You undeleted outside of process because you think that <b>VfU is only for "non-admins"</b>. At the end, you did a right thing and only undeleted your own new article. (Something any user can create without undelete.) At that point the other admin violated process by again deleting it. I am not saying that no one else has done wrong here. I am asking that you, and all other parties, stop. Allow process to work. Your newly created article will be kept without you making this <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. What are you doing on this page?

<dd>The version that got speedied was, in full: <i>Warren Benbow Warren Benbow- drummer, songwriter, music producer and educator; b. New York, NY . Born December 22, 1954</i>. There is no claim to notability here: there are many, many drummers who are not in Wikipedia (and many songwriters, and many educators, and there are many "music producers" who are waiting on tables). Merely listing a profession is not at all an assertion of notability, unless substantially every member of that profession gets a Wikipedia article (eg, holders of public office).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It was a bit of a provocation by Tony Sidaway to restore that validly-speedied stub, a bit of a symbolic slap in the face to the admin (Geogre) who speedied it for good reason. Nevertheless Tony Sidaway created a brand new perfectly valid and encyclopedic article which was in no way speediable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Benbow&amp;oldid=21166223" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Benbow&amp;oldid=21166223" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and Geogre was very much unjustified to speedy this new article three times. Tony should have just created his brand new article without first restoring the validly deleted stub. No VfU was required to do so. It would be a concern if someone tried to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> by resurrecting a validly speedied article and making some cosmetic change to it (for instance: adding the single adjective "notable", as someone else has done in the past), but this is not at all the case here. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 03:34, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Both the original speedy and the restoration of it were kind of iffy.
<ol>
<li>The version that was speedied was the <i>second</i> edit of the article, which contained a great deal less information than the first. The proper procedure would have been to revert back to the version with gobs of informative text. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Warren_Benbow&amp;timestamp=20050815173141" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Warren_Benbow&amp;timestamp=20050815173141" rel="nofollow">First version</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Warren_Benbow&amp;timestamp=20050815173704" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Warren_Benbow&amp;timestamp=20050815173704" rel="nofollow">Second version (speedied)</a>. Except....</li>
<li>The first version was an apparent copyvio, word-for-word identical to <a href="http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=1752" class="external text" title="http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=1752" rel="nofollow">this external page</a>.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>So, what happened? The second version of the article was a legitimate speedy candidate—saying that someone is a drummer and educator doesn't tell us what's notable about them. The first version wasn't a speedy candidate, but it was a copyvio. Since Geogre hasn't mentioned that, I suspect that he didn't check the history very closely. (A slap on the wrist for that; checking the history is an important part of speedy deletion.)

<dd>Meanwhile, Tony didn't examine the history very closely either. A big lump of unwikified text contributed by an anonymous IP is pretty suspicious. If he really wanted to restore the article, he would have been better to flag it as a copyvio and start a new temp page.</dd>
<dd>Finally, Geogre <i>really</i> shouldn't have speedied Tony's new article version; I can't see any reason for him to have done that, given that he didn't seem to have seen the copyvio.

<li>Looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Warren+Benbow" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Warren+Benbow" rel="nofollow">the deletion log</a>, I'd say Tony should receive a block for 3RR violation.</li>
<li>Other than that, two points. First, if an admin dispute another admin's action (such as deletion), then there is a disagreement between admins and they should talk this out, or bring the matter to public (which would be VFU in this case). Second, if any user wants to create a good article in the place of a speedied substub, they can do so; I don't particularly see why they should then first argue over undeleting the deleted part. In other words, rewrite first (to stub level, at least), undelete history later (or not at all, it's probably worthless). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 10:06, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>On April 11, this article was listed on VfD. Starting on April 15, the article was repeatedly deleted, with various contents.

On April 25, <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">User:Mindspillage</a> closed the VfD with a result of "already deleted".

<li>No, formally under the rules Tony is wrong. The article was deleted, but apparently not because of the VFD (because it's closed as "already deleted"). But for whichever reason it was deleted, VFU decided to uphold that deletion.

<p>This article has been under attack by a series of anonymous editors. It seems from their behavior and prior knowledge of Wikipedia (one anon posted a frivolous report on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a> with his fourth edit) that they are either the same person or an effort directed by a message board or blog. They are not vandals - those are quickly blocked - but instead insist on reinserting material that a large consensus of editors on the have agreed does not belong in the article in its present form. Suggestions on how to deal with this are welcome. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 01:54, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>These IPs have been involved in several editing wars and several have been warned or blocked for 3RR violations. I have placed a message on each IP's talk page asking the user to get a username. I will consider edits by any of these IPs to been made by one person for the purpose of counting edits. I further believe that any of them that are involved in a 3RR violation should be blocked indefinitely on account of having been used to evade our policies. Once the user starts editing under a single identity any IPs that have been blocked could be restored. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 02:00, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I thought that transwikied articles could not be deleted, or it would violate the GDFL by removing authorship information.

<li>So where <i>is</i> the edit history? As it currently stands there is no edit history - it appears fully formed in Wikibooks. The transwiki thus creates a GFDL violation for which we, having put it there, are responsible. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 06:07, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No. See I wish more people would bother to acquaint themselves with the transwiki process, as currently there's only a small amount of editors that do it at all, and for none of them is it their main concern. As a result there are hundreds of articles in the backlog. Okay, rant over. Look at the talk page of the transwikied article, it will have the edit history from Wikipedia, thus crediting the original contributors. Also, the transwiki logs on both projects will record the move thus crediting the source (Wikipedia). There is no GFDL vio if the transwikied article is deleted, and in fact if there were, we would have an unmanageble amount of stuff still here on Wikipedia (<a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranswiki_log_fe21.html" title="Wikipedia:Transwiki log">we still do, really</a>). <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 06:53, August 18, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Further to Daniel's explanation: In addition to the transwiki logs, usually the edit summary that creates the article contains an interwiki backlink to the location of the original, as it does in this particular case. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:41:50, 2005-08-18 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Evil Monkey went ahead and deleted his userpage with the nudity images, saying that he will not be dragged into a battle over censorship. That same page was cited by the WfD group to find images that might not be suitable, which was one of my points for deletion of the Wikiproject. The whole project, IMHO, has boiled down to causing a major disturbance on Wikipedia's articles, the abuse of the above template (which I protected from recreation), the use of sockpuppetry and RFC's and now people calling for my head and for my bannishment.

<p>Wikipedia administrator Willmcw is being extremely uncooperative on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStalking_f70d.html" title="Wikipedia:Stalking">Wikipedia:Stalking</a> guideline proposal. This page contains a proposed guideline that is in the process of taking community input for its development and, as such, major edits are subject to talk page discussion conventions. Willmcw made a major rewrite of an existing section on this article without giving reasons for doing so or discussing the matter on the talk page. His rewrite was subsequently contested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AStalking&amp;diff=21274230&amp;oldid=21274130" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AStalking&amp;diff=21274230&amp;oldid=21274130" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and requests were made of him to explain the proposed rewrite and resolve objections to it before including it in the guideline proposal.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AStalking&amp;diff=21274593&amp;oldid=21274230" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AStalking&amp;diff=21274593&amp;oldid=21274230" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Willmcw has been unresponsive to these requests and has instead initiated revert warring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AStalking&amp;diff=21274020&amp;oldid=21273741" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AStalking&amp;diff=21274020&amp;oldid=21273741" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AStalking&amp;diff=21274773&amp;oldid=21274286" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AStalking&amp;diff=21274773&amp;oldid=21274286" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AStalking&amp;diff=21275068&amp;oldid=21274991" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AStalking&amp;diff=21275068&amp;oldid=21274991" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> to preserve his rewrite while refusing to respond to objections about it on the talk page.</p>
<p>Willmcw has also indicated his opposition to this proposal so it is also questionable whether it's appropriate for him to be engaging in major rewrites of its text while the consensus-gathering process is occuring.

<dd>Slim - Your pattern of harassment and disruption directed against myself is approaching a level requiring intervention. As was explained to you in detail yesterday, the post by Willmcw you refer to was merged into a single header as it was one of two simultaneously posted notices about the same guideline proposal. You made a <b>bad faith</b> assumption then in accusing me of attempting to delete his material, persisted in it then when I explained to you the purpose of merging the two even after I agreed to facilitate your bizarre whims and restore Willmcw's redundant second notice for the exact same article, and still persist in it now. Regarding the second case, I am unaware how the deletion you accuse me of tonight even happened as my only intended edit there was to post this incident notice. Any deletion that resulted in it was either by accident or programming fluke, and your persistent <b>bad faith assaults</b> of alleging otherwise are in clear violation of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> and will be noted as such in dispute resolution proceedings against yourself for a pattern of continued personal harassment against me and for abuse of your administrator powers. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 09:57, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

As for "unfriendly amendments" this is not a debate on a motion. It's a proposal that all editors are free to edit, just like any other. Your repeated attempts to stop the participation of myself and other editors have been noted. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 19:03, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello - some sort of page protection appears to have been applied to my user talk page. I believe that this action was taken by administrators <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">User:Willmcw</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> who were both actively altering my talk page at the time the protection appeared, yet the log is ambiguous. Whatever the case I am currently being blocked from posting a response on my own user page!</p>
<p>Unfortunately it appears that whatever page protection was applied was intended to inhibit me from responding to a disruptive <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> allegation made moments prior by Willmcw against me<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARangerdude&amp;diff=21276598&amp;oldid=21249895" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARangerdude&amp;diff=21276598&amp;oldid=21249895" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and currently being promoted by SlimVirgin<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=21277297&amp;oldid=21269133" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=21277297&amp;oldid=21269133" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> on the Village Pump for the purpose of impeding and discrediting a new wikipedia guideline proposal, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStalking_f70d.html" title="Wikipedia:Stalking">Wikipedia:Stalking</a>, that I listed yesterday. Willmcw's allegation, SlimVirgin's promotion of it, and the page protection of my user talk page also appear to be a retaliatory action by these two editors for my noticeboard post above in which I reported Willmcw for disruptive and anti-collaborative behavior on the same <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStalking_f70d.html" title="Wikipedia:Stalking">Wikipedia:Stalking</a> guideline proposal. Both of these editors have been extremely harassing in their behavior towards me for some time, and the events of the past few minutes give me reason to believe that one or both of them are abusing their administrator privileges to engage in this harassment and to disrupt the effort I initiated on the guideline proposal. Any help would be once again greatly appreciated. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 09:14, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They're just bullying him. Okay, they might feel he deserves it but trolling him with a message like that isn't going to help anything. I suggest to SlimVirgin, an editor I have the utmost respect for, that this isn't helping make a great encyclopaedia. The other guy is just acting to type, so far as I can see, but I do make the same appeal to him. -- Grace Note</dd>

<p>Slim - as an active party to a dispute between myself with yourself and Willmcw, I consider your application of protection in any area involving this dispute to be a conflict of interest that violates the protection policy, whatever the reason. I similarly consider yours and Willmcw's conduct regarding the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStalking_f70d.html" title="Wikipedia:Stalking">Wikipedia:Stalking</a> guideline proposal and the accompanying <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> disruption he posted to my talk page that you are now promoting to be cases of personal harassment on both your parts and will pursue them accordingly. Disruptive behavior, such as your recent hostile actions toward me, has no place on wikipedia, and least of all by an administrator. This is your final warning to cease and desist before dispute resolution is initiated against you as well. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 09:41, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rangerdude, you're trying to poison the well against me, and I won't allow it. I'm not party to your dispute. I've never even read the wikistalking page, much less edited it; nor have I edited (so far as I know) any of the other pages you and Will are disputing. What I've done is try to defend Willmcw, an excellent editor, against your weeks-long harassment of him, your filing of a failed RfC against him and Cberlet, another failed RfC against FuelWagon because he defended them against you, and now by the looks of it, you're threatening one against me too. You're a disruptive editor, your "final warning" to me notwithstanding. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:53, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Slim - You cannot actively assist Willmcw in his repeated attempts at harassment and disruption of my work here, repeatedly attack me personally, inappropriately employ your administrator powers to control my user page, and then disclaim any participation in this dispute in spite of all that you have done. As noted previously, your behavior toward me for the past several weeks has been unduly hostile and has regularly breached wikipedia protocol on civility, assumption of good faith, and no personal attacks - the latter in spite of a standing Arbcom caution against you from another case in which you were cited for making personal attacks. I've repeatedly addressed these issues to you, Slim, and have done so in a reasonably civil manner yet instead you persist in bad faith attacks such as the fraudulent allegations of deleting other users comments posted above and your blatantly provocative and harassing attempts to assist Willmcw, a personal friend of yours and an editor you nominated to adminiship, in pursuing disruptive and fraudulent <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> allegations against me<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=21277297&amp;oldid=21269133" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVillage_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=21277297&amp;oldid=21269133" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=protect&amp;user=&amp;page=User+talk%3ARangerdude" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=protect&amp;user=&amp;page=User+talk%3ARangerdude" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> for the explicit purpose of disrupting a guideline proposal I have made. Due to your repeated transgressions of this nature, I am filing a formal harassment complaint against you for your behavior, Slim, and will request that you be added into the mediation case between myself and Willmcw as an active participant in his harassing actions that originally necessitated the case. In the meantime, I will ask you once again to abide by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a> protocol and refrain from employing your administrative powers and energies in any manner that impacts the pending case between us and its related editing disputes with Willmcw. I will consider your failure to do so and any subsequent interfering administrative actions such as the protection you applied to my user page last night to be an abuse of your administrative powers and will both report the incidents as appropriate and add them to my case of grievances against you. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 18:53, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Note that an arbcom case has only just opened and has by no means come down with even remotely any penalty such as a ban. UninvitedCompany seems to think he has greater authority than ArbCom, and can completely act outside it.</p>
<p>Does UninvitedCompany has infinite power and permission to unilaterally with impunity?</p>
<p>Particularly when the user/victim in question has challanged a prior abuse of adminship by UninvitedCompany in an RfC, and has diametrically opposed political opinions?</p>
<p>This seems to be a case of right wing strongly anti-Islamic admin<b>s</b> thinking they have the right to dictate to everyone else.</p>
<p>It also seems in contempt of the arbitration committee's right to make the decision.</p>

<p>Speaking neutrally here, as an arbitrator on the case in question ... I have in fact seen lots of good contributions from -Ril- — have a look through his edit history and interests. Though relations between him and the Wikipedia community in general have evidently unfortunately broken down and I can see someone blocking him completely as a troll/vandal if they only had the recent actions to go on.</p>
<p>I would ask that he not be blocked indefinitely while the case is in progress, but only as needed to stop this level of disruption.

<dd>Given the fairly strong support for UninvitedCompany's action on User talk:-Ril-/ban, I would suggest to the arbitrators that they need to come up with an appropriate temporary injunction regarding -Ril-'s editing privileges, and that the current one is inadequate.

<dd>I'm a party to the arbitration case, and obvious feel that -Ril- is often a problem, but I don't think a blanket ban is necessary.

<dd>After moving the pages back and deleting the "on wheels" back-redirs, there's one more step to take: check the deletion log and search for any "Deleted to make way for move" entries. These may be signs that a double-move-revert was accidentally done, resulting in the original article being a redir to itself (or it may be a perfectly innocuous and valid move). This is most simply fixed by just deleting the article and then selectively restoring only the pre-Willy versions.

<p>I was hoping that I could attract some comment here regarding a particular vote that was settled by <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a> this afternoon. <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Religion_and_schizotypy_6f74.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Religion and schizotypy">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Religion and schizotypy</a>. Mr. Sidaway feels that if a concensus is reached concerning the vote cast by the user Gabrielsimon he would disregard that users vote to keep the article. During the voting process, <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielsimon_92ed.html" title="User:Gabrielsimon">User:Gabrielsimon</a> (now <a href="../../../g/a/v/User%7EGavin_the_Chosen_21b2.html" title="User:Gavin the Chosen">User:Gavin the Chosen</a>) used a sockpuppet, <a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhulhy_4354.html" title="User:Khulhy">User:Khulhy</a> to cast more than one vote. I feel this in itself should disqualify the user from having his vote counted, not just the sockpuppet. Comments here would be appreciated. I would further ask for opinions regarding the closure of the VfD in general. Mr. Sidaways approach to counting votes is I feel biased toward certain users and I have indicated as much on his <a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">talk page</a>.

<li>Looking at that VFD, it seems a good solution would be to <i>merge</i> the article as suggested. The vast majority of votes feel that this doesn't warrant a forked article. The point of contention (from Tony's talk page) is that he automatically discounts all votes from accounts less than a month old (on grounds of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>). Some may feel that to be overly harsh, or running counter to <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a>.

<dd>In general it seems that once you have an IP, it is yours until you drop the connection. In my case this means that I only get a new IP when I turn my router off, which on average I suppose is about once a fortnight or so at most, however its been a bit more frequent than that recently due to plumbers/builders/decorators. It or the connection occasionally just stops working and so I have to reset by turning the router off then on again. If you use the USB broadband modem that comes with the package then you might be turning it off when you turn off your computer, I can't remember whether it has an independent power supply or not (its been about 18 months since we stopped using it).</dd>
<dd>I don't know how relevant it is, but I noticed I had a 212.x.x.x IP this morning whereas I'd only previously spotted 80.x.x.x (or was it 81.x.x.x?) IPs.

I concurred with this, though I do find the article to really pretty stupid and feel that it has major problems. Anyway, it just go reopened by -Ril-, who readded a VfD tag and created Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Authentic Matthew (consensus). I have:</p>

<dd>The most problematic aspect of these renominations is that they are always accompanied by -Ril- sending messages to everyone who agreed with him the previous round, (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Authentic_Matthew_%28consensus%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Authentic_Matthew_%28consensus%29" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Historical_persecution_by_Muslims_%282nd_nomination%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Historical_persecution_by_Muslims_%282nd_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>).

<dd>Sigh. He &amp; I got into an exchange over this very article. A week ago, my opinion was that it was a slam-dunk delete, but by the time the VfD vote rolled around, the article had improved to the point where I thought it was worth leaving alone for a while, just to see if it would continue to improve. -Ril- did not like my opinion, &amp; argued with me on my Talk page over my vote. (Sheesh, it's just <i>one</i> article, I only have <i>one</i> vote, &amp; if the VfD vote fails, it's not the end of the world.) After annoying me with (IMHO) POV arguments about how the article was wrong, I took another look at the article &amp; realized that <i>maybe</i> my vote was misguided -- but by that time, the only way I would vote for its deletion was <i>if</i> -Ril- promised <b>not</b> to post one more word about this issue. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 02:07, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wondered about your name there too. Let's not turn this into a witchhunt, shall we. The "grouping" of editors should be deprecated. "-Ril-'s wife", fair enough, but well known editors like DreamGuy?

<dd>I see what she's doing now... She was complaining that the article was redirected after there was not enough consensus to delete, which she is claiming is consensus to keep and never redirect or make any changes ever... Apparently she only just now even btohered to look at the article when it had been merged and redirected ages ago. She undid the redirect and got it looked at the highly POV violating version.... greattttt. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 13:11, August 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>WTF? '-Ril- group' indeed! - I've joined an RfC against him, and supported his banning - but now I'm his 'groupie' (well since the same person accused me in an RfA of being his sockpuppet I supopose this is better). Unfortunately, -Ril-'s behaviour has disguised <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelissadolbeer_cda5.html" title="User:Melissadolbeer">Melissadolbeer</a>'s obscure POV pushing. Two weeks ago, I redirected <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authentic_Matthew_7546.html" title="Authentic Matthew">Authentic Matthew</a> to <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> after discussion in the wake of the last VfD. (Where even the 'keep' minority seemed unhappy with the name. No-one objected until now, and all was calm. Unfortunately, Mel Etitis was misled into believing I had done so unilaterally, but only because 'someone' had deleted the discussion on the talk page (see our respective talk pages). I've got a little knowledge of this subject, but I'm not willing to go toe-to-toe on this. Obliged if others can help. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 14:15, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Doc has summed the matter up correctly. Melissadolbeer is intent on keeping her <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authentic_Matthew_7546.html" title="Authentic Matthew">Authentic Matthew</a> article up no matter what. Ril is intent on taking it down no matter what. A few of us believe, for reasons of NT history and WP policy, that it should probably be renamed or redirected or deleted or rewritten. For voting on the matter, we seem to have incurred Melissadolbeer's wrath — I can't say I'm too concerned. She has proven herself unable to conform to WP rules, as has -Ril-. Shrug. --<a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> <big>ॐ</big> 14:24, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Basically, the result was that a majority were for Delete/Merge, but this isn't one of the options, and neither Delete nor Merge on their own had a majority (it should be noted that it had already been merged before the VFD).</p>
<p>There were 3 VFDs,</p>
<ul>
<li>The first was sabotaged by excessive sockpuppets - see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_Authentic_Matthew_%28inconcluded%29_65f6.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion/Authentic Matthew (inconcluded)">Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion/Authentic Matthew (inconcluded)</a> for quite how extensive they were - to the extent that the VFD was completely abandoned (note: it was not closed, but abandoned)</li>
<li>The second was <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Authentic_Matthew_8546.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Authentic Matthew">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Authentic Matthew</a>, and attempted to avoid the problems that lead to the first being abandoned, by being administered by an Admin - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a>. The exact results were
<ul>
<li>Keep&#160;: 12 votes (including one by a user with only 7 prior edits)</li>
<li>Delete: 21 votes</li>
<li>Merge: 4 votes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The result was somehow declared to be a "keep" and that there was "no consensus"</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Thus the third attempt, which was deleted (the VFD itself) after 2 votes by Ta bu shi da yu</li>
</ul>
<p><i>It should be noted that Ta bu shi da yu's personal opinion was that the article should be deleted</i></p>
<p>During the second VFD, Melissadolbeer raised an RFAR against the first 7 people that voted delete, claiming that they were sockpuppets - the first 7 were long established and quite distinct editors (the RFAR was dismissed).</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> seems to think that -Ril-'s actions in VFD'ing the article were down to a prior grudge against Melissadolbeer, but Melissadolbeer has no substantial edits concerning anything other than the article.</p>

<p>Note, the obviousness of these sockpuppets includes things like them not attempting to remove the sockpuppet tag from any of their user pages for at least the last two weeks, and pasting the same content as each other, as well as not making edits to any other articles.</p>
<p>Melissadolbeer also, today, deleted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAuthentic_Matthew&amp;diff=21352012&amp;oldid=20411306" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAuthentic_Matthew&amp;diff=21352012&amp;oldid=20411306" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> half the talk page of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authentic_Matthew_7546.html" title="Authentic Matthew">Authentic Matthew</a>, including the part where discussion finished over two weeks ago about redirecting the article and protecting the redirect. Absolutely no-one opposed this suggestion at the time, nor at any point in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that -Ril- did not turn the article into a redirect, that change was made by Doc Glasgow on 4th August - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;diff=20296975&amp;oldid=20293696" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;diff=20296975&amp;oldid=20293696" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>, it was undone <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=20296975" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=20296975" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, then re-done <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=20338071" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=20338071" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, by <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a>, who had mistaken a mediaeval reference to a "Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew" for a reference to an "<a href="../../../a/u/t/Authentic_Matthew_7546.html" title="Authentic Matthew">Authentic Matthew</a>" rather than to the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Pseudo-Matthew_328b.html" title="Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew">Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew</a> - this was discussed calmly in the talk page.</p>
<p>Between 5th and the 19th there was no dispute whatsoever, and the article remained a redirect.</p>
<p>On 19th August, Melissadolbeer reverted the article back to <b>her</b> version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=19350986" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=19350986" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> (22nd July version) (Acjelen had done some minor copyediting, despite having reservations about the content itself), not to the consensus and more neutral version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=20338071" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=20338071" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, that was the last version (5th August version) before being a redirect.</p>
<p>Mel Etitis then immediately (1.5 hours later) protected the article, claiming there had been an edit war. This claims to have been done in good faith.</p>

<p>While I respect Khaosworks' decision in the circumstances pertaining, I'm not convinced that the first VfD was irretrievable.</p>

I still think the risk of his being a sock of someone whose vote was already counted would be high because he only had a couple of dozen edits at that point, and he clearly knew his way around Wikipedia so was probably not a true newcomer.</li>

That account seldom ever edits articles, and most of its edits are on VfD or in articlespace to add VfD tags. I suspect that it could be a role account.

<p>There were some other probable socks that didn't cast a vote but merely made all kinds of silly allegations.</p>
<p>There was also a lot of silly edit warring but from the point of view of the closer this shouldn't matter at all. Each individual edit is in the history and it full effects can be seen. By examining the votes of the non-excluded editors one could arrive at a decision on whether a consensus existed on the disposition of the article. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:20, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Get lost -Ril-.</b> Just for once, can we have a debate on an issue, that doesn't become a discussion about <i>you</i>.

<dd>Melissadolbeer, your accusations are really quite bizzare, I have to say. Even if I had never encountered Doc glasgow, DreamGuy, or Garrett's edits before, a quick look at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authentic_Matthew_7546.html" title="Authentic Matthew">Authentic Matthew</a> and its VfDs shows these to be <b>very</b> different editors. The burden of proof is on the accuser. Do you have any diff or edit link that could even reasonably hint at these users accounts are being operated by the same person? Ril would have to be quite a clever and sophisticated troll to have so many disputes and ill will with his own sockpuppets. Given your behavior, I would be more likely to believe that <i>you</i> are a sockpuppet of Ril than DreamGuy or Master Thief Garrett. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">Func</a>( <a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func">t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Func_dbc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Func">c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Func_6e40.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Func">@</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" rel="nofollow">&#160;</a>) 09:24, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>-Ril-'s personality is sort of known by now, and he admitted to having several socks. Here are ones believed to be -Ril-:</p>

<dd>I would add Doc as their writing style and spelling are the same! --Mikefar 06:23, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, there are so many things that make "Doc" look like -Ril-, mostly based on interests, location and User page, without any of the bad characteristics. But on balance, at present, I think not, because:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>no Wikilawyering</li>
<li>began before all -Ril-'s troubles, and made quite a few edits</li>
<li>no 3RRs</li>
<li>no real edit wars or stalking</li>
<li>no reverts with statement "POV" or misleading reasons</li>
</ol>
<p>It is certainly possible that Ril had fun and sacrificed one of his socks and wants to carefully live on under the radar as a user, but I think it too difficult for him. He is so quick to do the above actions, that I do not think he can keep it out of his system. Also, the articles of interest and other Admin items do not totally match up. I may change my mind if the real Ril pops out, but right now on balance I have to say no. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 06:57, August 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It is quite obvious that -Ril- (<a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a>?) does not have the civility that is so important for Wikipedia to work.

<ul>
<li>all I've ever seen from -Ril- is trolling and tounge-in-cheek wikilawyering. The decision to block may have been bold, but I agree with it.

<li>Yes, he is a troll. For instance, <b>he has wasted a lot of people's time on nominating articles for deletion only to make people upset</b>.

<ul>
<li>I concur. -Ril- does have a good number of very productive edits under his belt. He also has, over the course of the past several months especially, developed an attitude regarding other users whom he apparently holds in lesser esteem, with extreme contempt—a view that exudes from far too many of his Talk, User_talk, etc. comments, and his edsums of late are notably less than exemplary. It's unfortunate that we might lose someone with such obvious analytical talents, and wideranging interests, but something obviously has to change. This isn't -Ril-pedia, after all.

<li>My only interaction with him was to nominate one of his nonsense categories for deletion (Category:Wikipedia:Suspected sockpuppets of Jesus).

<p>I think the option of "delete and move" when there is a page in the way is really doing more harm than good. I think it should be disabled. It's not like there is a huge difficulty in deleting things "by hand" when we need to make a normal move and there is something in the way, and it is awfully easy to make an accidental deletion when doing a mass reversion like here. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:14, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's easy to catch such accidental deletions after the fact, though. Just search through the Delete log listings for "Deleted to make way for move" entries (there's not too many of them). Some of these are valid non-Willy-related moves, and some are cases of two simultaneous page reverts by different admins, which leave the article redirecting to itself and the old history deleted. This is easily fixed by deleting the article and selectively restoring the pre-Willy revisions. It's just a matter of remembering to do this after a Willy attack; the actual effort is very small. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 20:48, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it has been determined that WoW does not actually use a script. Rather he loads as many pages as possible in a tabbed browser, sets them all up to be moved, and then goes through them as quickly as possible hitting enter. This limits him to about 50 moves at one time. It is likely that an account is abandoned after each barrage, even if it is not blocked. This is also why the page moves always come in waves, with each taking about twenty minutes for him to set up. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 21:48, August 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now that we have had at least two controversial deletion debates over pages in the project namespace (the "Decency project" thing, and the "Wikiblower" thing), can we have a discussion of what can and cannot be VfD'd? Both VfD's have caused a great deal of conflict over whether VfD has "jurisdiction" over the project namespace, and there doesn't seem to be a clear answer. The deletion policy offers "flexibility" to userspace and projectspace; some have argued this means project pages shouldn't be VfD'd, and others argue it means they should. Is this something that we can settle in a rational manner, or should we just lock Jimbo in a closet somewhere until he agrees to decide the point once-and-for-all? -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 07:24, August 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>it is part of a debate that is apparently necessary, never mind if it takes place on vfd, vp, or talk, and if people want to jump at each others' throats over differences, they will do it no matter where. But certainly, this is not the point of vfd. debates over the appropriateness of user projects should not be mingled with debates over notability of content. The many "npov" and "is not censored for minors" votes on the decency thing show that having the debate on vfd leads to confusion. Vfd is broken, and we need to look for solutions. We cannot solve all problems with one bold strike, because the consensus system is too inert for that. The way to go is to <i>separate</i> the problems, and address them independently. The first step will be to separate debates over the WP/User namespaces from article Vfds. Why is Ifd and Vfd separate (both dealing with content issues) while Vfd is unhappily mixed with community issues? To reduce instruction creep, my suggestion would be to add a new section to rfc, for discussing problematic pages in WP/User namespace. The most important thing is to disentangle these debates from disputes of article content and notability. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:40, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, a VfD that itself gets successfully VfD'd was certainly not going to succeed anyway. But I agree that having VfD votes on VfD pages would tend to introduce confusion, would destroy valuable voting records, and wouldn't serve any point. No matter what happens with the rest of this discussion, I think it's clear that any voting/dispute resolution page that is normally archived after completion should not be subject to a VfD, only speedies for obvious spam/nonsense cases. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 21:43, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I realize that may sound like a contradiction in terms, but we have to have something to point to that says "you can't do that." When someone wants to insert POV into an article, we point to <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. When someone makes a personal attack, we point to <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. We need to be able to decide whether or not we believe it is appropriate to make policy and/or destroy policy through VfD. As it stands now, there is no determination. Some pages may be VfD'd (Wikiblower &amp; Decency, for example) and any attempt to close them early as inappropriate use of VfD is shouted down. I noticed that NPOV was put up for deltion however, and it was quickly attacked as an inappropriate use. This makes no sense! The two convenient examples, Wikiblower &amp; Decency, are loaded examples, so I am going to move into the hypothetical: If a given policy proposal A can be rejected by listing it on VfD rather than going through the established proceedure for developing policy, then <i>every</i> policy must be subject to VfD. If NPOV cannot be overturned by taking it to VfD, then <i>no policy</i> should be subject to VfD. There needs to be an absolute standard by which we say "You cannot destroy a policy you dislike simply by taking it to VfD" or "Anything that is on this site, regardless of it's standing as an official policy, a decree of Jimbo, <i><b>whatever</b></i>, can be overturned by a VfD decision." Without an absolute standard, we are stuck in a place where some VfD's are considered no-brainers to close (i.e. the proposed deletion of NPOV) while others are a source of controversey, costernation, and the departure of valued contributors. I'm beginning to think this is one of those instances where we need an official word from Jimbo. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 12:39, August 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>"[S]hould we just lock Jimbo in a closet somewhere until he agrees to decide the point once-and-for-all?" As he has participated and voted in at least one of the examples you mention, I take that to be a tacit acceptance that it's a valid VfD.</li>
<li>So far as I'm aware (I don't know the Wikiblower case, and it throws up nothing on <b>search</b>), neither of your examples involved policy; this slide from "project page" to "policy" is one of the features of this debate, and it should be guarded against. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 14:07, 20 August 2005 (UTC) --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 14:07, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>True, he did, but as an "ordinary editor" with the specific caveat that his actions were not to be seen as official in any way.</li>
<li>The Wikiblower was a policy proposal; the "proposer" maintains that it was good faith, others mantain that it was not. (I will not make any judgement on whether it was or not.) Nonetheless, rather than being voted down via the policy proposal proceedure, it was VfD'd, and considering that it was giving me a migrane, I stopped watching it about two days in, so I don't know what eventually became of it. My question, however, is not "were these two examples legit VfD's," but rather, "is it acceptible to use VfD on the project namespace" (a.k.a. Wikipedia:). I've seen a number of answers to that question here, in IRC, and on the mailing list, and they all conflict; the only conclusion I can draw is that the only way this is going to be settled is by a quotable pronouncement from on high. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 15:12, August 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't see much wrong with Wikipedia: space VfDs. In the particular examples cited, and in a couple of others, the proposal got considerably more oxygen from VfD than they ever would have done otherwise. Contentious oxygen, but that's not particularly important. The only downside to a straight-off VfD is that it is effectively a poll without prior discussion. But the Decency VfD got more than a little discussion: discussion that I speculate might not have been nearly so wide-ranging had it simply been left alone. Importantly, we should not immunize Wikipedia: space agains VfDs as that would give the trolls immunity to put whatever they liked there. It's easy to avoid the CSDs (and the only likely one is patent nonsense anyway), and we'd be unable to remove the most stupid pages without a full blown vote on it....which might as well be done in VfD. The same applies to removing {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProposal_1286.html" title="Template:Proposal">proposal</a>}} tagged pages from VfD - anyone can stick a tag on anything. As it is, we get a bit of a flap every so often about a proposal page — most of the time there is no problem, and we shouldn't knee-jerk a response. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 17:54, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>↔</b> Several distinct issues are intertwined:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is <b>absolutely unacceptable</b> and contrary to The Wiki Way that any true policy proposal be subject to VfD. <i>The primary location for debate on the proposal is the proposal's talk page.</i> The fine point, not to be overlooked, is that VfD leads with <b>voting</b>: debate is secondary; and that it tends, at one extreme, to push a failed proposal into the deleted pages table, which is both opaque and (in the case of a contentious proposal) inefficient.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Some pages created within Wikipediaspace are not policy proposals. These fall into several broad categories:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>1. WikiProjects and Processes:</b> Functional pages intended to coordinate the activities of a subgroup of the Community. These may well act to <i>create</i> policy proposals; however, their entire premise is that they are not themselves policy -- proposed, failed, or accepted. From time to time, pure process and subcommunity content may become laden with policy proposals; these should be periodically extracted and moved to distinct policy proposal pages. A WikiProject or Process page should never assert itself as Policy of any kind.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>2. Information pages:</b> Some pages do not direct editors or set boundaries of right action (except in trivial fashion), but merely provide factual information. In some cases, they would be better moved to article mainspace; in others, they are so specific to the Project that this would be inappropriate. The Help namespace is the logical place for these; but that has become the target of mirroring from Meta. Until a new namespace is created for Info, these pages remain in Wikipediaspace.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>3. Individual opinions:</b> By definition, these are not factual, and poor candidates for Info namespace, not to mention mainspace. By definition, they do not attempt to control or codify right action, therefore they are not policy proposals. They should simply be moved instanter to userspace.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please note that a judgement call is not invited here. Unwise policy proposal is still a policy proposal. I define here a category of page in which policy is not proposed, because the actions of editors within the Community are not spoken to. For example, "Dethrone King Bush in 2006" is a proposal for action, but not within the Community, therefore it is not a policy proposal (3 above). "Seventeen Wikipedians were born in 1938" is (may be) factual, but not eligible for mainspace (2 above). "The love of BMWs is the root of all evil" is opinion, and does not call for any action (3 above).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>4. Vandalism and patent nonsense:</b> About which more than enough has been written; shoot on sight.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>5. Debate and discussion:</b> Threaded, signed, opinionated debate belongs on Talk -- whichever talk page is most relevant to the matter under discussion. It should be removed from the "front" side to the "back" side of pages as it accumulates.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Obviously, this is a great muddle, and multifaceted source of contention. I have been mulling Wikipedia:Infospace and Policyspace for a long, long time, and I think I am finally able to write the proposal. The demand that these namespaces be provided by the development team, however, is quite beyond my reach.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>In conclusion</b> I urge all admins to observe these distinctions and take certain specific actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose VfD scope creep.</b> To remove contentious policy proposals from VfD is itself a disruptive act, but regardless of the outcome of such invalid process, <b>take no action</b> to delete a policy proposal -- ever. Allow consensus to form in opposition to foolish and evil policy, and allow that consensus to stand, visible to all.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose VfD scope creep.</b> Humans organize; it is what we do. Few social movements are so dangerous <i>and</i> lack sufficient motivation that we both must <i>deny a forum</i> to a given subcommunity and <i>hope to gain</i> by doing so; highly motivated groups will merely reorganize out of sight. Rather, it is to the <i>advantage of opponents</i> of such subgroups that members identify themselves clearly. <i>Take no action</i> to delete such project, process, and party pages. Indeed, these are the only pages that truly belong in Wikipedia space.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Head them off at the pass.</b> Take immediate action on certain pages before they fall into the clutches of VfD. Move opinions to userspace; shoot patent nonsense on sight.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Support Infospace and Policyspace</b> just as soon as I get around to writing it. (Please don't laugh. It's time for lunch, I just woke up, I'm already ready for my nap, and my backlog would crush Atlas.) When the proposal matures, <b>urge the development team</b> to implement the trivial change needed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Sort stuff out.</b> It is less glorious than grand oratory, but of infinitely greater service to the Project, to move pages from where they don't belong to where they do. Policy proposals to Policyspace, information to Infospace, opinion to Userspace, talk to Talkspace. The machinery of Wikipedia itself, the wheels and cogs, processes, parties and noticeboards, move to Wikipediaspace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Above and before all, <b>defend the Wiki Way</b> against all comers. If we should lose the process of policy formation to the VfD gang, we lose all. — <a href="../../../x/i/o/User%7EXiong_2293.html" title="User:Xiong">Xiong</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiong_c362.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiong"><font color="#997749">熊</font></a><a href="../../../x/i/o/User_talk%7EXiong_bb60.html" title="User talk:Xiong">talk</a><a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_reform_5862.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion reform"><font color="#009900">*</font></a> 19:21, 2005 August 20 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with much of what you say, and strongly agree that we should never delete policy proposals made in good faith (and the benefit of the doubt should be given in all but the most bad faith cases). However, I disagree with your second contention that we shouldn't VFD bad WikiProjects. Having a WikiProject is a way to organize and create something for the betterment of the project. Ignoring really nasty WikiProjects gives the appearance of tacit approval, which can mislead users and give outsider a false impression of what this encyclopedia is about. I am inclined to be quite permissive about what is allowed, but at some point we have to be prepared to draw a line. For example, a theoretical project called "Skinheads for Putting Niggers in their Place" is clearly not okay. Absent a better way, I think using VFD is probably the best (albeit very crappy) way of deciding what projects the community is willing to tolerate and what projects are too blatantly deterimental to be allowed to exist. Maybe such people will go elsewhere to do what they are doing, but we don't have to help them by giving them space and advertising, and making it look like what they are doing might be okay even in cases where the community massively disapproves. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 05:15, August 21, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Unlike policy proposals, Wikiprojects just get together and they can work right away. No voting, no cosensus building. Hell, it could be just a one man or two man team and they could do a Wikiproject. Plus, if the Wikiprojects' main goal is to introduce POV, disrupt Wikipedia or circumvent current policy, we should have the ability to get rid of these pages as fast as we can. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 05:18, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>FWIW, I still disagree fundamentally with the premise at the top of the summary. The wikiway, if such a thing there is, lets anyone do what they like with a page.

<li>Like any namespace, Wikipedia namespace contains some amount of junk - so a page in Wikipedia namespace is not automatically immune to being VFD'ed.</li>
<li>VFD'ing an existing policy page or process page (which includes Wikiprojects) is not a good way of modifying said policy or process, and borders on <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Such nominations should be speedily unlisted. This includes attempting to VFD a VFD debate.</li>
<li>VFD'ing a <i>proposed</i> policy or guideline, or a non-functioning Wikiproject, well, that depends. If it's a serious proposal, it should be discussed rather than deleted. If the proposal itself is disruptive, silly or nonsensical, it can safely be deleted.</li>
<li>It should be pointed out that "Wikiblower protection" fell in the latter category when nominated, but it was rewritten early during the VFD to look like a serious proposal (which was nevertheless almost unanimously rejected)</li>
<li>What I just wrote is <i>precisely</i> what already happens. Wikispace pages are sometimes VFD'ed, and get consensus to keep if useful, or consensus to delete if nonsensical. <b>We do not need the instruction creep</b> of immunizing a namespace from deletion on principle.</li>

</ul>
<p>One very serious weakness of our Community is that it contains such a high proportion of technicians. Our Project is a service to humans, not to machines. I should very much like to hear more debate rational, and not merely logical.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why question a reasonable statement by postulating an absurd limit case? Anything can be broken if you lean on it hard enough. We are men; our works are corrupt and approximate.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The outstanding recent examples of attempts to subvert the Wiki Way are Wikipedians for Decency and Infobox Standardization. I don't agree with either the latter proposal or the agenda of the former organization. However, neither resemble in any <i>realistic</i> way Niggers against Stoopid Skinheads.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There must remain in this Community a place for intelligent discrimination and subjective, human judgement. If you are unwilling to apply your soul to your work, please, step aside. We can build an unlimited number of machines to follow explicit and inflexible rules.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>VfD is a terrible way to decide anything; if it is the "best" way, then we are very lazy people, or have closed minds. Instead, I think VfD simply serves the purposes of many who have agendas that they could never force through openly.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Many proposals with merit do not appeal to the masses. We do not require immediate acclamation in order to permit a proposal to develop. VfD must never be allowed to promote evil agendas by systematic elimination of their negatives.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"POV" is a clumsy acronym that attempts to attach a stigma to judgement and personal opinion -- among other things. The correct word is "biased", if you insist on a negative connotation. I resist the implication that it is wrong to <i>feel</i>, to have a point of view of any kind. You would reduce us all to mere machine parts.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Every</i> WikiProject has an agenda. It is naive to imagine that any human endeavor can be free from bias. <b>NPOV is not an achievable state.</b> It is a laudable <i>goal</i>, and every effort must be made to ensure that our article content does not serve a narrow agenda. But a WikiProject is not an article page. If we permit humans to do the human thing, and group as they will, then yes, they will advance agendas.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>When bad men combine, good men must congregate.</b> I see nothing in that text to suggest that good men must invade the combination of bad men, beat them with axe handles, and burn down their shacks. We gain more than we lose, by tolerating the intolerant; we lose more than we gain, by imitating them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let us not, in the fashion that a technical education seems to drive us to again and again, ruthlessly eliminate every human dimension from our work.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>If you disagree fundamentally with the Wiki Way, then you are in the wrong Project. If you question its existence, then again, you are in the wrong Community. Take away <i>this</i>, and nothing is left but a bunch of butt-headed technicians yelling at each other.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The Wiki Way does not say, "you can do whatever you like". That is anarchy and libertine excess. <b>Consensus</b> is at the heart of the Wiki Way, and few indeed are those who still retain the illusion that VfD is a process of forming or expressing consensus -- rather, VfD is a hack, a messy patch applied when consensus fails to jell quickly enough to satisfy some vocal Community members.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's true, I put the Wiki Way into short words; but I most certainly did not compose it. The Wiki Way was elaborated long before I had ever heard of a wiki. I suggest that if you disagree with Wikipedia:The Wiki Way, you may wish to spend considerable time seeking it elsewhere. You will find I did not distort its spirit. My <i>personal inclination</i> is towards a much less plastic method of policy formation. But I have finally come to realize that the Wiki Way, like all human methods, is a compromise between extremes; and for every view on "my" side, that policy formation should be more organized; there is a view on the "other", that there should be no policy at all. <b>If I can live with it, so can you.</b></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The gentleman with the deletionist and revisionist agenda has carried out a disturbing program of overly-bold policy amendment, apparently enjoying unlimited time in which to put his stamp on page after page of policy and process. Absent consensus, this comes perilously close to abuse of power.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sure I may be excused if I repeat what has been said before: Admins exercise no special authority. Sysop privileges are extended to certain users for the specific purpose of carrying out the will of the Community at large, as consensus expresses itself. Ideally, admins have no personal agenda at all; absent that, it is incumbent upon them to express such agendas <i>as little as possible</i> and remain neutral in their actions.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It is clever, but wrong, to say that anything I have written in this section constitutes instruction creep -- on several grounds:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The words "instruction creep", like so many in-group expressions, substitute an emotional hot-button phrase for reasoned, neutral evaluation. A less heated statement would be "We don't need a new rule."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Stripped of stigma, the statement itself may now be challenged. Our Community has grown; our social network has become denser. Naturally, we <i>do</i> need new rules. We should indeed question the need for each, and introduce them with care; it is easier to introduce a rule or process than to remove it -- witness VfD. But we cannot operate a tractor-trailer over an infrastructure intended for a tricycle. New rules must be built from time to time.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>That said, none of my words are novel. The Wiki Way is core; VfD is the "instruction creep", the hack pasted onto the rulebook. At one time, it appeared that this new method of dealing with contentious issues might prove effective and acceptable to the Community. Now, we see there are serious weaknesses in this.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Application of VfD to policy is <b>scope creep</b> -- extension of a limited process to engulf something quite beyond its compass. <b>Opposing creep is not creep itself!</b> It is the return of sanity to a process that has gotten way out of control.</dd>

<dd>Message to the administrators by the "vandal":</dd>
<dd>I do not have a account here on Wikipedia because I see that having one will not change anything on this issue. I know couple of my friends that spend a lot of time on Wikipedia trying to show how much Wikipedia is wrong and what all is done from the Greek users to stop any edits we want to make on the Macedonia related pages.</dd>
<dd>Just check the nationalities of the users who edit the Macedonia-related pages. 85% of them are Greek and 10% Bulgarian.</dd>
<dd>It seems that anyone can even proof that the earth is in a form of a triangle, if he/she manages to outnumber the opponents of that theory on Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>This seems the only way how to fight against the assimilation, ignorance and denial from Wikipedia (and its users) towards the Macedonian people.</dd>
<dd>P.S. Little mistake in spelling. I did not mean "death". I ment "deaf". They do not want to hear anyone's oppinion except theirs. Macedonians have been complaining for a very long time about the assimilative and offensive text towards them regarding Macedonia issues on Wikipedia. But, it seems that noone even cares. 62.162.194.4 15:01, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

However, in a county of only 45,000 inhabitants, it is very unlikely that most of these places are notable.

<p>User:83.109.179.167 is being a real problem, engaging in POV edit warring and making accusations. Could an uninvolved admin look at this and consider a block? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:38, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with your assessment. I have applied a 3 hour block for now for multiple 3RRs. This is probably a somewhat dynamic IP considering today's the first time he's been active, despite not being a new user (references to <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">User:Wik</a>). Incidentally, he committed 3RR vio in incessantly trying to add a Wik sockpuppet accusation to <a href="../../../r/i/v/User_talk%7ERivarez_4847.html" title="User talk:Rivarez">User talk:Rivarez</a>.

<p>Recently <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiPoliceman_e976.html" title="User:WikiPoliceman">User:WikiPoliceman</a> was blocked and all his subpages deleted for being a disruptive role account and troll and using his pages to create some kind of fantasy police department (while making vague references to a cabal). Reminds me of the Bank of Wikipedia fiasco. And now there is User:OfficerDibble who is definitely a reincarnation, with similar subpages, and a new one about The Disturbing Case of User WikiPoliceman. (More shades of the bank.) And I just learned that, as he says, <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> is my "power-crazed cohort." I was about to go to bed, anyone want to take a look at this? <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 08:21, August 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Cohort? Horde, maybe. This person is blocked and all of their nonsense deleted and the earth salted. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 08:58, August 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I put the template for a user who is permanently blocked onto the OfficerDibble's user page and that earned me a visit from an anon 84.68.8.33 who signed a contribution to my talk page as OfficerDibble. I've consequently blocked that IP address for 24 hours. We probably won't be getting problems with that being an ISP cache as it is the first time that IP address has made a contribution to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 14:46, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've found and blocked another anon sockpuppet. I also think that <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheBadge_0d33.html" title="User:TheBadge">TheBadge</a> is a sockpuppet as well. So far that account has uploaded a modified version of the barnstar with the same graphic used by Wikipoliceman at the centre, altered the barnstars template to include that, and made good post to the user talk of the person who welcomed them to Wikipedia. I'm not going to block straight away, but I suspect we have another sockpuppet with this user. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 15:06, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I would agree, except for 'cscn.casecorp.com', 'equityloans.paxed.com', 'XRAYF.MED.UPENN.EDU', and one or two others that don't look like they could be running a proxy intentionally or by zombie. Perhaps someone is IP spoofing? It'd be a lot of effort to go to for vandalism, though, and then most of the IPs would probably be random and so not associate with any hostname at all. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 16:45, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there. I'm hoping something reasonably effective be done about this fellow soon. He is relentless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Looping_audio_clip_stating_%22Hey_Everybody%2C_I%27m_looking_at_gay_porno%21&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Looping_audio_clip_stating_%22Hey_Everybody%2C_I%27m_looking_at_gay_porno%21&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. Incidentally, our defending the pages he is vandalizing very likely simply encourages him. I've been reverting his vandalism because it seems the best of the available options; however, is it possible to simply leave some pages in the vandalized state, where that wouldn't really impact the page? I realize this is a strange question, but the Administrator who closes the VfD above, for example, will surely know of Cyrius' vote, and can simply return it to its original state just prior to closing it (and perhaps locking it then). Right now we're feeding him — it must be an amusing game for the fellow.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="red"><sup>ζ</sup></font></a>&#160; 18:42:36, 2005-08-21 (UTC)</p>

<p>From the talk pages, and from information given by <a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">User:Kiand</a>, etc, I would not regard that sentence even highly dubious. Anyway, even if it is somehow dubious, it is still dispute of contents. I have believed that no one is entitled to regard something as vandalism, if it is not totally obvious that it is vandalism. Things that are "dubious" are by such definition not vandalism, and cannot be treated in that way. I think Jtdirl has again shown such habits that earned him an admonishment from the ArbCom. Perhaps Jtdirl should be admonished again, but at least his protections should be unprontected. <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 09:15, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Comment by <a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">user:Irmgard</a>: From what I have seen, there is a real edit war raging - on one side these users (the CARM party) and on the other side the <a href="../../../a/a/r/AARM_c384.html" title="AARM">AARM</a> party, consisting of <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">User:Hyperbole</a> user:FanofJR and some IPs. Both sides seem to be new to Wikipedia (and not very conversant with the rules here) and both sides definitely have their (incompatible) bias which they want represented in Wikipedia and both blame the other side on being biased (looks to me like this is the carrying of an ongoing flame war (moderators vs. disgruntled suspended users) into the new field wikipedia). The sockpuppet accusation regarding the CARM supporters comes from the AARM party, so it should be looked at with caution. In my view, none of the parties should be singled out to be blamed for the edit war - they both do their best to contribute (to the edit war&#160;;-) ). Also I have my general doubts, if arguments and references regarding a flame war because of some users were banned from a moderated notice board is noteworthy enough to be documented in Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 12:20, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have one comment. user:FanofJR is certainly not from AARM; he showed up on the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_W._Ratcliff_ef68.html" title="John W. Ratcliff">John W. Ratcliff</a> page to write POV-negative comments about Ratcliff in what he apparently perceived as "revenge" for the inclusion of controversy on the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Slick_77f4.html" title="Matt Slick">Matt Slick</a> page - and seems to have since vanished. I think that particular problem has been resolved, and the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_W._Ratcliff_ef68.html" title="John W. Ratcliff">John W. Ratcliff</a> page is acceptably POV-neutral. (It could use a run-through for clarity, but I'm almost afraid to edit it lest I touch off another edit war). --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 07:31, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While agreeing with Irmgard, it seems to me that we have a fundamental problem with the topics being covered. In my opinion, CARM is notable; Ratcliff is notable (as the designer of 688 Attack Sub and some lesser games); AARM is only notable in the context of CARM and Ratcliff (that is, it could be mentioned in either or both articles but does not merit its own article on its own importance); Slick is only notable in the context of CARM (notwithstanding being the author/publisher of a single book related to CARM). I advocate merging AARM and Slick into CARM with appropriate redirects. This needs to be done in one exercise and it would be best if the edit warriors understood the reasoning. Unfortunately, they all seem to have their fingers in their ears while they voice their own opinions. Perhaps we should let it burn out and tidy it up later. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 13:55, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Theo, I wrote the original draft of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Slick_77f4.html" title="Matt Slick">Matt Slick</a> as a collaboration with <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalphin_2def.html" title="User:Falphin">Falphin</a> (who posts to, and supports, CARM), and I'm sure that we would be more than amenable to spending some time merging <a href="../../../a/a/r/AARM_c384.html" title="AARM">AARM</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Slick_77f4.html" title="Matt Slick">Matt Slick</a> into <a href="../../../c/a/r/CARM_dbc3.html" title="CARM">CARM</a>. I further believe that we could do a good and professional job of it. I would say that the extent of my bias here is that I feel that the CARM page should and must reflect the existence of criticism of CARM in order to be NPOV. I feel that criticism of CARM is significant, and that the fact that the CARM administration is here forcefully and threateningly trying to whitewash all mention of that criticism really should be indicative of some of the reasons that the criticism arose in the first place. I have no intention of writing an angry, anti-CARM page; all I want is for readers to understand that opposition to this organization exists, and to be pointed to that opposition, should they want to read further on the subject. To me, it's a freedom of information issue, and one that should be able to easily be written in an NPOV style. Does this really have to be so difficult? --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 07:31, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with merging Slick and CARM. AARM should be mentioned as an aside in Ratcliff and CARM, but really as an aside only - it does not contribute to the noteworthyness of Ratcliff or CARM. An exodus of some two hundred users (out of over five thousand) of a moderated forum to a playground where they like the rules or opinions better including their critique on the former forum moderators is no more noteworthy as the arguments in the divorce case of Joe and Jane Doe (though Joe and Jane might, at the time of the divorce, see their arguments as important enough for the New York Times frontpage). --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 17:06, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, a merger might help. These folks are all barely notable, except to each other. I think that the problem with the CARM users is greater than <a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> concludes, but it may be easier to change the articles than to change them. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">User:Hyperbole</a> has generally acted correctly, but I'm not sure who else is on the "AARM side".

<p>There is a genuine attempt (however unlikely) to sort out <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authentic_Matthew_7546.html" title="Authentic Matthew">Authentic Matthew</a> in a civilized manner. This is being thwarted by the 'support' I am receiving from indefinitely blocked user -Ril-, acting under a number of accounts and now an IP. He has trolled on this issue before.

<li>I voted in the poll as well, but it should be obvious from looking at it that all notable verses should have their own articles (38 votes for that option; 8 votes to options for more articles, 11 to options for less) and a small minority of verses, i.e. hundreds of them, are notable (15 votes for that option; 6 to options for more articles, 8 to options for less).

<p>After editing the article about the SLMM I found that the edit had been reverted and the revert had been named "rv vandalism".</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLMM" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLMM" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLMM</a></p>
<p>I believe this is wrong, as I corrected facts and deleted a statement that can not be proved, and that anyway does not belong to the article. The revert seems to be from the person that added the content first (only an IP address as author) and it seems to me that he is rather biased. I do not want to do any more reverts, so I hope a admin can look into the problem. <a href="../../../u/l/f/User%7EUlflarsen_48cd.html" title="User:Ulflarsen">Ulflarsen</a> 16:16, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You don't really need an administrator, just someone to point out the problems. Continuing to discuss the matter on the talk page should be enough for now. I have informed 203.217.57.218 about the proper steps to take in dispute resolution, which do not include reverting good-faith edits. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 16:31, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok - will try to engage the person that did the edits. I was however rather suspicious, since he seems to forward the arguments of the very hardline Sihalese - and as I said, I didnt want any edit war over it. That he marked my edit as vandalism did not enhance my trust in him/her. <a href="../../../u/l/f/User%7EUlflarsen_48cd.html" title="User:Ulflarsen">Ulflarsen</a> 16:49, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He's been hitting us weekdays, usually several times at least, so expect him back momentarily. And as a neat segue to the section above, "wrongly marked as vandalism," I got reported at Vandalism in Progress for moving his pages back. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=21579774&amp;oldid=21575659" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=21579774&amp;oldid=21575659" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> Ha ha ha ha.
