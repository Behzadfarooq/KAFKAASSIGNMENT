<dd>yes, with all the throwaway vandal accounts, these start to clog up the database. I imagine that, likewise, all the indefinite blocks will affect performance. It would probably be safe to delete all indefinitely blocked accounts with less than 20 edits or so this would rid us of documents like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21_Jesus_was_always_a_Jew._He_was_never_Christian." class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21_Jesus_was_always_a_Jew._He_was_never_Christian." rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:06, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For GFDL reasons, we can not legitimately delete any account that has made a contribution, even if they are subsequently permanently blocked. I would have no objection to deleting accounts that are old and have never been used. For the blocklist, recent inquires were made about whether the 4000+ entries are slowing down performance, and the conclusion was that checking this only amounts to a couple percent of present processing time per action, and so is not currently a good target for improving performance. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 16:19, September 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At a technical level, such contributions should probably be removed from the database, not just deleted, if the account that made them was also going to be deleted, so that the edits could not be restored. This is a technical capacity that only developers have currently. At a legal level it would be necessary to check (probably by hand) that there were absolutely no future versions of any article or talk page derived from any edit of the person in question. This means not only checking that the edits were reverted but also that no one later put any of that material back. I think that the legal morass would plainly outweight the benefits in all but the unproductive cases of vandalism (e.g. WoW). For someone like Willy who frequently does absolutely nothing of benefit, deleting his "contributions" and those accounts is probably okay in most cases, but it would also mean erasing most records of what he had done. I am inclined to believe that having a record of his actions is probably better than removing a few accounts from Special:Listusers. However, as above I have no object to removing accounts that have never been used at all. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 16:58, September 10, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am aware that it is not a trivial matter, but those accounts whose edits were all reverted, the edits can be safely removed from the database, and the account deleted, GFDL or no GFDL. That will need quite some churning, I imagine, but I imagine if we want to do it, such a db cleanup process could be running in the background, and slowly remove traces of those account that left no trace in article texts anyway. A better approach would be to <i>not</i> block vandal accounts, but block their IPs instead -- the vandals don't care if their throwaway accounts are blocked, so why burden the blocklist with those? For this, admins would need access to the IPs of logged-in vandals. This would also allow us to put temporary rangeblocks on the ISP on re-dialling logged-in vandals. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 11:53, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article had a copyvio pasted into it a year ago. There was a revert war over it, but mostly the copyvio stayed in the article for about a year. Eventually the page was listed on wp:cp and last month the material was (kinda) refactored. The page was never reverted to the pre-copyvio version (as per instructions at wp:cp). Also, over the last year there have been edit wars, page protections and at least one other (unrelated) copyvio. I've been trying to resolve the latest copyvio for the last couple of days, it's a big mess.</p>
<p>My question regards derivative works. For most of the last year about eight copied paragraphs existed in the article as it was heavily edited. The copied material was then somewhat refactored. I have two problems, the work to the article that went on in the midst of and related to the copyvio, and the refactoring that was so minimal that the eight paragraphs still say the same things in the same way and are structurally similar to what they came from. I think the whole article is now derived work in two ways and should be reverted to the pre-copyvio version, per instructions on wp:cp.</p>
<p>Most of the feedback on the talk page has been from the anon doing the refactoring, but who claims not to be the same anon who originally inserted the copyvio (they are both Earthlink ips I think). This editor thinks I'm way off base, so, I'm asking for other opinions from editors with experience resolving copyvios (haven't got much of a response on wp:cp). --<a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDuk_3ef6.html" title="User:Duk">Duk</a> 23:11, 26 September 2005 (UTC) PS- i've no interest in this article other than trying to resolve <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html#Others" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">old copyvios</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>There's no excuse for not having reverted to the version before the copyvio tag. Revert immediately to that version and don't tolerate any edit wars.

<p>We need more than that. *All* incarnations of the work after the copyvio was inserted *must* be deleted.

<dd>This is something that confuses me. I agree that copyvio versions should be selectively removed. However, the instructions at <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> (which I refactored but did not write) say it is ok to rever to the last non-copyvio versions, leaving them in the history. Apparently, if someone wants them removed they need to ask specifically and will probably be reffered to the Foundation. The exception appears to be where a copyvio is in the article from the start, but is rewritten in place — in that case, the insrtuctions are to delete the earlier revisions. Is the revert option always wrong? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 16:29, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is often impractical to delete and selectively restore when there are a very large number of old revisions. If someone added copyrighted song lyrics to say, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.

<dd>There's an easy way to do selective deletes, as opposed to selective restores. 1) Delete the entire article. 2) Restore <i>just</i> the versions you wish to delete from the article's history . 3) Move the article (whose history now includes only the newly-restored versions) elsewhere. 4) Delete that other location. 5) Restore the rest of the versions of the original article. Hey, presto, selective delete!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:32, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you want to leave the deleted versions at the location of the original article, it takes a couple of extra steps. Omit step 4. Add the following steps: 6) Move the article (sans deleted versions) elsewhere. 7) Move the article consisting of the deleted revisions (created in step 3) back to the original location. 8) Delete it. 9) Move the article (sans deleted versions) back to the original location. Yes, it's a certain amount of hassle, but it's less work than clicking 999 check boxes! <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:36, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to the new speedy deletion criterion, we should be deleting orphan "fair use" images, since we can't claim fair use on images that aren't used. Here are some lists of images that contain the words "logo" or "screen", which <i>probably</i> means they're fair use images.</p>
<ul>
<li><s>User:TheCoffee/Orphan images/logo (1407 images)</s> - 95.4% deleted</li>
<li><s>User:TheCoffee/Orphan images/screen (188 images)</s> - 94.7% deleted</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that the image really is fair use and is an orphan before deleting it. If it isn't tagged as fair use, check if it should be. If it isn't tagged or sourced at all, it can be deleted for having no source or no license. The asterisk at the left of the filename is to indicate if the file has already been deleted. Blue asterisk means the file is still there. Red asterisk means it isn't.</p>

Now if you've nothing constructive to say it's better to say nothing at all." I think Ta bu was <i>compared</i> to an "agitated infant," not <i>called</i> an infant.

<dd>Good grief. I can't <i>actually</i> be called an infant because my own picture would logically preclude that.

<p>The best way for this to be handled is for TBetc. to put a brief, polite note on the talk page of the perceived finger pointer, <i>"I consider statement X a personal attack. Please desist."</i> Some else to put a brief note following that, <i>"TBetc. has placed a note on WP:ANI regarding a perceived personal attack."</i> Then everyone waits. If TBetc. gets called a baby <i>again</i> it's an attack.<br />

<dd>Not meaning to be quarrelsome, but I still don't get how there is even an insult involved, much less a "personal attack." Giano's statement was "the activity of coming back and going away is similar to the activity of an infant that can't sit still." I take no part in the disputes going on between Giano and Tabu, which is why I thought I could comment; I really don't see where any "attack" is happening, just a simile for an action.

<dd>So what is being said here is that I cannot come back to editing this site under this username. After all, Giano has basically said that I cannot go away and come back again — I remember the days when highly stressed out Wikipedians would leave and come back to no abuse. Evidently the project has taken a turn for the worse and this is no longer the case. Try to remember that there are two reasons why Giano doesn't like me: I added the bio infobox to several of "his" pages (yes, that's right, he was getting them to FA status so they are now owned by himself and noone else can contribute - this is the way I see it). I had no idea he was the primary author, and it was never done to attack him - however all of a sudden I found that I was receiving messages on my page asking why I was having a go at him. I had also placed one of "his" articles on FARC (at the time I had no idea it was "his") because I felt it was too like an essay. To my horror I discovered that he believed I was personally attacking him! Now I have to deal with all this crap: hence the reason I'm not as active on the site as I once was. Apparently, though I am the author of 5 or 6 FAs, the create of this noticeboard, have a considerable number of edits under my belt and have exhibited correct behaviour (except, of course, for the Dalek incident) I am still behaving like an infant by coming and going from a <i>volunteer</i> website. So far you'll notice that I've only logged in to defend myself.</dd>
<dd>One last thing: I <i>didn't</i> call Giano a Nazi. Sheesh. I was making a comparison of what would happen if I <i>did</i> compare him to one, as he was comparing me to an infant. I was pointing out that I still consider what he wrote to be an insult.</dd>
<dd>I guess I'm correct in not editing this website any more. It's really not worth it.

<dd>Not all unkind words are insults, nor are all insults inappropriate. Sometimes we hold rational views which others might find hurtful; such views need to be discussed to determine their truth and worth, not suppressed. When a user is willing to respond rationally and substantiate their position we can not conclude that their words were made purely with the intention to hurt, only that perhaps they were hamfisted in their delivery or wrongheaded in their reasoning. Rather than yelling <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTACK_3b8e.html" title="WP:ATTACK">WP:ATTACK</a> at someone when we think their criticism may be too harsh, it would be more productive to help them refactor their words to ones which are more constructive or provide reasoning to demonstrate them as incorrect. There is no cabal of nannys to make sure everyone does the right thing, so in each of our hands lies the responsibility to call the baby ugly. Without that we must either suffer the loss of salvageable editors when the minorly bad behavior festers long enough to force them from the community, or allow ourselves to be rotted away by negative behavior which doesn't warrant the drastic measures available through arbcom. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 22:54, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My point exactly - we can't tolerate editors harrassing other editors and trying to force them out of the project.

<dd>Nice counter, but your argument could just as easly be extended to say that we should never call out a frequent contributor no matter how bad their behavior is because we might scare them away. I don't agree. I think you might misunderstand the cause for the negative comments about Ta Bu's behavior. People are not saying these things because he simply took a break and came back, but rather because he makes what appear to be repeated insincere dramatic exits, crying for users to beg his return, and while he's supposidly gone for good (for the umpenttenth time) he continues to come back to further his arguments on the wiki all the while whining about how wronged he's been. His behavior is furthering ill will around the wiki, and attracting away positive attention which is more deserved by harder working users who have stressed out and vanished without the hysterics. Because of this it is all of our business. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 03:05, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sheesh. I'm very sorry Ta bu feels bad, I can certainly tell that he does. But if you prick Giano, will he not also bleed? Before anybody else allows themselves to talk of Giano "harrassing" and "trying to force out" an editor who was obviously bent out of shape by other things first (notably the <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> debacle of the Gay Nigger Association of America article<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), I hope they will take the precaution of reading the posts involved. This is not a matter of personal attacks! Nor is an admin matter, which makes me the less inclined to waste more space here by pasting in whole exchanges, but anybody can find them by following Giano's directions above. Please note Ta bu's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Vanbrugh&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Vanbrugh&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit warring at John Vanbrugh</a> on September 6 and 7, his final and very much not administrator-worthy action before he purportedly left. Mind you, I'd be inclined to excuse him for that, in view of the extreme wikistress he was obviously suffering, but given Ta bu's history of rapidly coming to his senses after losing his temper on this site, I would also have hoped he'd be ready to condemn it himself by now. Apparently not so: he is still in "nobody appreciates me" mode, and it's all still Giano's fault. This is a distortion of what happened, and I think anybody who looks into it will see that. For a balanced, and distressed, take on the respective roles of Ta bu and Giano in the unhappy conflict over <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Biography_b63d.html" title="Template:Infobox Biography">Template:Infobox Biography</a> at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vanbrugh_d131.html" title="John Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a>, you can't do better than read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=22766747&amp;oldid=22763146" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=22766747&amp;oldid=22763146" rel="nofollow">ALoan's post on my page</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 03:44, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>as always, I think Bishonen is spot on. It is certainly bad taste to say things to people that you <i>know</i> will distress them. Yet on the open forum WP is, I do think you have to be prepared to meet sarcastic and/or outspoken criticism of your behaviour. I am sorry Tbsdy is stressed, and I would certainly try to go easy on him, but obviously this is not a case for AN. I do hope Tbsdy will regain his cool, but at the moment I am afraid this isn't any different from any random disgruntled user coming here saying he has been treated without proper respect by another random user. <a href="../../../b/a/a/User%7EBaad_2689.html" title="User:Baad">Baad</a> 18:38, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) I might also add that the other day, I <i>didn't</i> block User:Four Wheels, and it turned out to be a Willy. I'm not concerned with these blocks that Essjay has done. What I would be concerned with is if he started blocking harmless nouns and adjectives without reason. That's when alarm bells will go off - at least for me. The "autobot" was probably blocked because it can be mistaken as a bot. Check out what happened with the sneaky vandalism done by "Uncle Ed's major work 'bot" above! The others, I'm inclined to feel they are Willies too. Generally speaking, I've found that if users are legitmate, they will contact you by e-mail. "Death omen" is sort of a grey area, but I'd be inclined block it. I use this rule of thumb sometimes: assume the user becomes established. Are there any existing established users with names that read like that?

<dd>(edit conflict, before SecretLondon's response) Well, to be honest and truthful, I don't think anyone can say they know know for certain. In fact, I don't know many things for certain. This just happens to be one of them, and after some amount of deliberation, I've settled on doing something I feel comfortable with. Granted, it may not be the most optimized way of doing so, which is why I like to rotate around different sysop chores during my Wikipedian career. At least this encourages myself to re-read policy every now and then and lets me update my approch to do things on Wikipedia. "Grow" in a sense.</dd>

<dd>I think it would be pretty difficult to homogenize 100% the approaches towards defining inappropriateness of usernames; in any large complex system, sometimes an amount of stochastic activity can be healthy. It is impossible to handle 100% of events 100% perfectly everytime. But with a variety of reasonable approaches, we can approach handling, say "95%" of cases "95%" of the time unambiguously, and make our management system robust and adaptive. I think your approach would complement this quite well, really. <small>In fact, as an aside, some of the questions you are asking are related to very deep implications in artificial intelligence...</small> --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 18:01, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>I agree completely with the premise that we should be very very careful blocking just based on username, it should be pointed out that <i>The Big W!!!</i> was in fact a vandal all of whose contributions were deleted.

<p>Overzealous username blocking is a problem. Besides the ones that have already been mentioned above, a look over Category:Wikipedia:Inappropriate username blocks reveals the following username blocks of dubious justification:</p>
<ul>
<li>User:Accepttheownage</li>
<li>User:Jesus of Suburbia</li>
<li>User:Wikipediasux</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePedanticPrick_f167.html" title="User:ThePedanticPrick">User:ThePedanticPrick</a></li>
<li>User:Thebitch nextdoor</li>
<li>User:Satan's Kitten</li>
<li>User:Pothead</li>
</ul>
<p>And I'd guess the majority of username blocks aren't added to the category, so who knows how many more there are? Why are we so eager to on the one hand point out that Wikipedia isn't censored to avoid offending anyone's sensibilities, and on the other hand so eager to censor usernames of marginal offensiveness? I'd say <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers</a> applies here. <a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETacoDeposit_8aab.html" title="User:TacoDeposit">Taco Deposit</a> | <a href="../../../t/a/c/User_talk%7ETacoDeposit_4b46.html" title="User talk:TacoDeposit">Talk-o to Taco</a> 23:06, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think some people need to lay off the block button. It was noted that ThePedanticPrick was blocked by an admin called Bumm.

We really could use a Process for Deciding What Names Are Inappropriate, and Reviewing Such Decisions. I don't know about a general power kick, though; it's just that if you have a few overzealous admins, a lot of users will get blocked, and as I don't know anybody besides myself who does block-log patrol (and I only started that today because of this incident), it's unlikely that those blocks will be rectified. TacoDeposit, would you mind providing examples of a "general power kick" as opposed to a few dicks and well-intentioned rogues?</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but the line between a "a few dicks and well-intentioned rogues" and "an all-round power kick" is too subjective and not quantifiable.

<p>I think we need to bring the good ol' "when in doubt, don't delete" to the blocking policy as well - "when in doubt, don't block". Personally, I'd much rather wait for offensive usernames to start vandalising (which they usually do), and then block them for <i>that</i> instead. Blocking an user also takes out the underlying IP, as you probably are all well aware of - and not being able to edit anymore even without their allegedly offensive username has a most chilling effect on good-faith contributors, I suppose. Note that clear Willysocks (of which Kswheels <b>isn't</b> one) should still be blocked on sight. But then again, there's no doubt in those cases. --<span style="font-family:monospace">&#160;<a href="../../../g/r/m/User%7EGrm_wnr_b9ae.html" title="User:Grm wnr">grm_wnr</a></span> <a href="../../../g/r/m/User_talk%7EGrm_wnr_e8bc.html" title="User talk:Grm wnr"><span style="border:1px solid;color:black;font-size:9px;padding:2px 1px 0px 1px">Esc</span></a> 12:53, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

The thing is, currently I'm taking care of two articles that have been protected while editors solve their differences on the talk page: <span class="plainlinksneverexpand lx"><a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovakia.html" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a> <tt>(</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../s/l/o/Slovakia.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../s/l/o/Slovakia.html" rel="nofollow">edit</a><tt>|</tt><a href="../../../s/l/o/Talk%7ESlovakia_e6f7.html" title="Talk:Slovakia">talk</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../s/l/o/Slovakia.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../s/l/o/Slovakia.html" rel="nofollow">history</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Slovakia_8ccd.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Slovakia_8ccd.html" rel="nofollow">links</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../s/l/o/Slovakia.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../s/l/o/Slovakia.html" rel="nofollow">watch</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a><tt>)</tt></span> and <span class="plainlinksneverexpand lx"><a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Moravia_5ac3.html" title="Great Moravia">Great Moravia</a> <tt>(</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../g/r/e/Great_Moravia_5ac3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../g/r/e/Great_Moravia_5ac3.html" rel="nofollow">edit</a><tt>|</tt><a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGreat_Moravia_353a.html" title="Talk:Great Moravia">talk</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../g/r/e/Great_Moravia_5ac3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../g/r/e/Great_Moravia_5ac3.html" rel="nofollow">history</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Great_Moravia_5b9d.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Great_Moravia_5b9d.html" rel="nofollow">links</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../g/r/e/Great_Moravia_5ac3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../g/r/e/Great_Moravia_5ac3.html" rel="nofollow">watch</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a><tt>)</tt></span>. From what has been written there (the main discussion is going on <a href="../../../s/l/o/Talk%7ESlovakia_e6f7.html#Knieza.27s_edits" title="Talk:Slovakia">here</a>), it looks like there's still some distance to go before the articles can be unprotected again: there are two sides, both claiming the other is trying to push POV (one pro-Check, the other, pro-Slovaks) and calling the other side immature or childish. Early on in discussions, one of the parties requested the unprotection of both articles, mainly because the other side was somewhat slow in replying to the user's posts on the talk page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=24205603&amp;oldid=24203541" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=24205603&amp;oldid=24203541" rel="nofollow">here's the request</a>). I did not unprotect the articles, for even then it seemed clear that, if the articles were unprotected a revert war would immediately ensue. The tone of discussion so far confirms this.<br />
Because I'll be gone for a longer period of time, I'd like at least one other Admin to keep an eye on the developments there, mainly because it is possible that an agreement is reached, or maybe some other type of conclusion, and the articles are requested to be unprotected. Or it could be that animosity increases and some sort of "intervention", or a mediation, becomes necessary. It's just a precaution, because I don't like leaving loose ends. It may well be that the parties would come to me to request a mediation, or the unprotection of the articles, since I've been encouraging the parties to talk from the beginning, and if I'm not there... Can someone cover this? Thanks, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 20:27, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The United Kingdom, and its four 'kingdoms' or regions can be slightly confusing to foreigners, and even to some of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>However, for good or for bad, the United Kingdom is the name of a country. England is not. Scotland is not. Northern Ireland is not. Wales is not.</p>
<p>So, for example, when I was looking up Formula One drivers earlier I happened to be curious when I saw a link at the bottom of one particular driver's Wiki entry that pointed me to a list of drivers' entries per country.</p>
<p>This is not very well organised or consistent. To illustrate what I mean, I will point out some of the drivers in this category.</p>
<p>Alan McNish. This driver is Scottish. Yet he is listed in the category of British F1 drivers, and not in the Scottish sub-category.</p>
<p>David Coulthard is Scottish. Yet he is listed in sub-category of British drivers, and not in the main British category.</p>
<p>Eddie Irvine is Irish. Yet he is listed in a completely different section which isn't a sub-category of British drivers, nor is he listed in the category of British drivers.</p>
<p>Jenson Button is English. Yet he is listed in the British category, but not in a sub-section of English drivers.</p>
<p>I think that one category should be made for all British drivers, and a decision should be made as to whether to keep all British drivers together, or create sub-categories for each region of the UK. It took me longer than it perhaps should have, to find David Coulthard for example, as he is organised differently. Eddie Irvine isn't even in the British category, so people might assume this driver is missing from the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I would guess that its not just Formula 1 that is affected by this inconsistency. I propose that some kind of standardisation or guideline is drawn up to help keep entries on all things British, consistant.</p>

<dd>Note that much of the inconsistency follows from the ambiguous meaning of "country": in some cases it has been used as if it means "sovereign state" and in others as if it means "geographical region". There is currently no agreement on Wikipedia as to how we should be using it. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 02:17, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is indeed much inconsistency across the categories. And McNish does not even appear in the general racing driver list (now added). I see no problem with a driver being listed in both British and Scottish categories, as <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Clark_%28racing_driver%29_768e.html" title="Jim Clark (racing driver)">Jim Clark</a> already is. Such multiple category listing is common in WP and helps users find articles. The problem is to iron out inconsistencies, such as Coulthard, Irvine etc missing from the main British category. There is currently no English or Northern Irish sub category, but if someone wants to create these and categorise the drivers accordingly I am all in favour. --<a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECactus.man_4fe2.html" title="User:Cactus.man"><font color="#2B7A2B">Cactus<b>.</b>man</font></a> <a href="../../../c/a/c/User_talk%7ECactus.man_82b9.html" title="User talk:Cactus.man"><font size="5"><span class="Unicode">✍</span></font></a> 11:47, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

I blocked the username, and as you all know, this causes the underlying IP address to be temporarily blocked as well, although the admin applying the block cannot access any information about what that underlying IP address is, or even what ISP or part of the world it is in. It turned out the underlying IP was from a Singapore ISP and various people complained that they suffered "collateral damage" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Curps&amp;diff=24591487&amp;oldid=24572913#Innocent" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Curps&amp;diff=24591487&amp;oldid=24572913#Innocent" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. I think this issue has been discussed before: should there be a way to block a username without blocking the underlying IP, or should the blocking code perhaps have a little more smarts and know which IPs are pool addresses and which aren't. This may be more of an issue for Asian ISPs, since that part of the world has fewer IP ranges available.</p>

<p>I will hazard that at least part of the reason (or, at least, my reason) for not rolling up my sleeves in these categories is/was the hoo-hah over talk-pageing users. It was/is unclear if DeletingAdmin is <i>actually</i> expected to drop 10,000 talk page messages, wait a week, and then start deleting images or not. It was also plain that, even when explained to them, many users were unhappy with 'their' images being deleted: admins didn't receive enough support because other admins were wanting them not to delete until talk pages had been messaged. So people aren't deleting as many of them as they might. Or, at least, <i>I'm</i> not.-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 13:33, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem here is that the original uploader is often the only one who has the image description page on his watch list, so when you add {{<a href="../../../n/o/s/Template%7ENosource_08ca.html" title="Template:Nosource">nosource</a>}} to that page, it is not very visible. One way to correct for this is to notify the uploader; still that's only one editor (who may not be active this week anyway). Best solution is to remove the images from the articles they are on (this has to be done anyway), which will be seen by many editors, wait a week, delete image. The original uploader is not the only one with an interest in the image, who may update the source information... <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a>'s suggestion of working from <a href="../../../u/n/u/Special%7EUnusedimages_8220.html" title="Special:Unusedimages">Special:Unusedimages</a> looks like a very good idea. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugene van der Pijll</a> 14:14, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

What we should do is get a list of the 10,000 or so images in the category, remove them all from articles with an edit summary like "rm unsourced/unlicenced images", wait for a week, then delete them if they're still unsourced/unlicensed. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCoffee_bcb6.html" title="User:TheCoffee">Coffee</a> 14:43, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yup, I think we've consistently held here that users should always get a polite warning first. Either the lowest applicable test message or something suitably polite.

<dd>It is your choice to be kind to vandals, including the user who created a fake person and injected fake content about that person into other articles.

<p>Sorry about the "sneaky bastard" comment. The user was trying to create a fake person and was implementing it in the encyclopedia (such as listing the person under something like "1951 births"). Since this can seriously damage our credibility, I rightly blocked the user for longer (although that's arguable if it's a dynamic IP). In any case, it has always been my choice (as the Blocking policy says it can be) to block users for 24 hours for each of their vandalisms. 24 hours for a user whose only contribution is to blank <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> is nothing, as they were unlikely to contribute anything useful anyway. Chances are that by the time you go through sticking test templates in, their IP has already been moved on to another user, someone who might want to contribute legitimate content but freaks out at the warning left on their talk page. Blocked users can still view any article on Wikipedia. I feel and have seen others agree that we take vandalism too lightly, often attacking those who stop vandals rather than the vandals themselves, as if they weren't doing anything wrong.

If people here seem to be in favor of blocking problem editors, why was the person who created a fake individual unblocked, or the person who has been blanking pages for the past month?

<dd>Yes I should have used I instead of we, but you seem to be taking this too personally instead of listening to the overall message. This from an admin that thinks we are overall way too lenient with problem editors. There is a difference with new editors though. If you had politely warned all the people you blocked they would probably not get unblocked. The warning essentially demonstrates intent if they do it again and makes the block an easy call. The sarcasm below (later removed?) could stand to be toned down and so could marking your responses here as minor edits, which they aren't. That said, if someone is obviously repeatedly vandalizing, I don't support unblocking them either. They still deserve a warning or at least an explanation though. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 15:56, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Use caution if you unblock. In some cases the blocking admin may have more background information or context, and may be able to recognize that the "newbie" is clearly a returning sockpuppet, in which case they've already gotten their warning in their previous incarnation and don't need any new ones. However, if you just wade in and look only at that one sockpuppet's contributions without knowing the context and background and prior incarnations, you might mistakenly unblock. "Assume good faith" doesn't only apply to the vandals and newbies, it also applies to the intentions of the admin who applied the block.</p>
<p>I would also add that a "newbie" vandal who heads straight for some obscure page in Wikipedia or Template namespace is quite probably not a newbie at all, and again a warning may be superfluous, though usually it's best to err on the side of caution and give a warning anyway.</p>
<p>Finally, in a disturbingly large number of cases when it's necessary to block indefinitely, you look back at the contribution history and see some petty vandalism a month ago and they got blocked for 24 hours, then they come back and do something more serious that warrants an indefinite ban.

<p>We should all take a deep breath here (OK, one, two, three... release) and take things into perspective here. We are here to <b>discuss</b> the blocks, not to stress each other out, so let's try and be polite. In my opinion, it should be up each admin to decide whether an IP address warrants an immediate block, or requires warnings. For IP addresses where I clearly see malicious intent (i.e. inserting graphic pictures into main page articles), I've done 24 hour blocks without warning. However, if I beleive it is newbie testing, with no bad intentions, then I go through the "test" system. Sometimes, depending on the seriousness, I start with "test2" or "test3". In this case, though, for blanking the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> article, I would have started with a {{blanking}} template, and then escalated the warnings if s/he continued. <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> | <small><a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a></small> | <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_Desk_89ed.html" title="User:Flcelloguy/Desk">Desk</a> | <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignpost_5b65.html" title="Wikipedia:Signpost">W</a><sub><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignpost_5b65.html" title="Wikipedia:Signpost">S</a></sub> 18:13, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't give any warning to people who have vandalised more than a few pages. I do give warnings to people if the vandalism was potentially a test or if it was their first offence. While there is an aruement that we don't want to scare away new editors, I do still think it is insane to give 5 warnings, how many people have been warned more than once and gone on to become positive contributors? I think firmly asserting that we do not tolerate and kind of vandalism is the only way to maintain our credibility.</dd>

<p>In the future I will use the properly-named test templates correctly. If the edit can be construed as a test (such as sticking in Example.jpg or something similar), then I'll warn. If the edit is the blanking of a page, it is clearly not a test, and I will block for 24 hours. Anything that I don't believe can be considered a test will be considered vandalism, and individuals will be blocked accordingly. Others have different views on when/when not to block. That's fine. They can unblock anyone I block. As we have already seen, this has led to 2 repeated/sneaky vandals being unblocked, as a result of assuming bad faith on my part for following my own guidelines, as the Blocking Policy permits. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-10-3 19:05</small></p>

It's not always clear what is a test and what isn't. Even when a user is clearly vandalizing and we act against them with haste beyond what is required to protect the commons we often create negative <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?PunishReputation" class="external text" title="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?PunishReputation" rel="nofollow">emotional attachment</a> or convert whatever positive feelings they had to strongly negative ones. Most vandals are being foolish, not trying to harm. Blocks run the risk of creating enemies, and they give people a nice puzzle to fight against. We should use them in a way which minimizes damage. The increased damage in tossing out a warning before issuing a block is small compared to the harm of even a slightly increased chance creating another long term wikipedia enemy. Also, people are incorrectly blocked all the time. For example, if they are the second one to add a {{db|}} to an article with an attack-name they might recreate it and be seen by someone else as a vandal. Our users are all volunteers, so we should treat them all with respect, even those who do not deserve respect. This doesn't mean we don't act to stop vandalism, but it means we need to respond appropriately for the threat. So, If you are not interested in wielding blocks with patience and precision, then you should leave that job to someone else who is... --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 20:48, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

See, for example, the case from last week of 206.162.152.82 (<a href="../../../2/0/6/User_talk%7E206.162.152.82.html" title="User talk:206.162.152.82">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.162.152.82_b401.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.162.152.82">contribs</a>) and Delmontejuicebox (<a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelmontejuicebox_1f36.html" title="User talk:Delmontejuicebox">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Delmontejuicebox_75a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Delmontejuicebox">contribs</a>), who I assume to be either the same person or two kids sitting next to each other in a high school (or nursery school) computer class. I found vandalism, I reverted, I warned, they got mad and vandalized some more, and eventually an admin blocked them. It was not instantaneous, but it was fairly quick and effective.</dd>
<dd>I DO want to see more prompt and certain response to vandalism, but I think that can mostly be summed up by applying the existing policies with more certainty and rapidity. While I certainly think there are times an instant block is the obvious solution, I do not think it's appropriate to skip the warnings because the warnings themselves seem burdensome. If a vandal is truly that big of a problem you will pass through all of the warnings <i>very</i> quickly.</dd>
<dd>It's a bit like being Shakespeare. Shakespeare could get away with violating "rules" for English poetry, but only because he was a master of those rules. People shouldn't be stepping out of the normal blocking procedure, IMO, unless they are experts at using said normal procedure.</dd>
<dd>I do not think page blanking can be assumed to be vandalism. It's the perfect example of a "test." Yes, it's destructive. But it's not too much to revert a page blanking, warn, and watch to see if the guy does it again. I would think that people who enjoy the job of fighting vandals would be <i>glad</i> to do it. In the same way, I think it's surely hard to assume that something is vandalism; the line between "vandalism" and "curiously pushing buttons to see if they really work" is a gradient rather than a well-defined border. Best to err on the side of caution, particularly since you can always come back and block later.</dd>
<dd>I do think it'd be nice to have a set of warning templates that do not assume quite so much good faith. When I see a user has been warned for vandalism eight times before over the past six months, it is not a time I want to say Thanks for experimenting with Wikipedia. Your test worked, and has been reverted. Please use <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">the sandbox</a> for any other tests you want to do. Take a look at the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome%2C_newcomers_06aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers">welcome page</a> if you would like to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia.

<dd>I tend to agree iwth what Jdavidb said in his first paragraph. We have the tools we need to deal with vandalism, except that it's often just not handled quickly enough. One of the things that frustrated me about being a user -- and I imagine frustrates others, potentially enough to quit the project -- is that administrator intervention on vandalism issues seemed glacial or nonexistent. Witness <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a>; it's a backwater, hardly paid attention to. Peoples' requests languish for days. On the other hand, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism_ffcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism">Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism</a> gets taken care of lickety-split. I can see why, of course -- people who go to AIV typically know when something is blockable vandalism, and are aware that people need to be warned. Lots of folks who go to WP:VIP don't know about either threshold, or somehow don't conform to the requirements of the page, so researching the claims and responding to them take a lot more time in my experience. But to me, it's just as important to be responsive to that page as it is to the AIV page, maybe more, because it's utilized more. It can be <i>extremely</i> frustrating, as a good faith editor, to report something to a noticeboard and feel like nobody cares or is paying attention (which certainly happened to me). Even if the solution is do nothing, it would make good faith editors feel better to know that someone's evaluated their report and said "sorry, not yet." So, all that is basically a longwinded way of encouraging admins to spend some more time at WP:VIP I guess. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 22:24, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, I didn't realize policy gave us so much leeway and power. In my opinion, an editor should not be blocked unless they are given a series of warnings, that is, one to let them know they're being noticed, one to teach them what vandalism is (because we bandy around the term like everyone should know what it means, which isn't always true), and one to make sure they understand that they will be blocked if they keep it up. And I think they should be at least 5 minutes apart, so we know the editor got the chance to read the warnings. That's why I originally created the test2 through test4 templates... I found myself doing this every once in a while. I find most vandalism is done by newbies unfamiliar with Wikipedia, and many of them have the potential to become valuable contributors. It's really easy to follow them around, clean up after them, and leave them test messages, so I see no hurry in blocking. But it's pretty obvious in this discussion that I'm in the minority. <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> 22:32, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, so <i>you're</i> the guy who cursed us by creating five warnings instead of just one and a half! Just kidding. As near as I can tell, use of your warnings is policy or de facto policy, but policy certainly does grant us a lot of rules. Look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_official_policy_9680.html" title="Category:Wikipedia official policy">Category:Wikipedia official policy</a> and you'll see that it includes <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Wikipedia:Ignore all rules</a>. Editors including but not limited to admins can and should throw the rules out the window ... when appropriate!! This goes with what I said above, that rules should only be broken by those who are expert in following them. Looking at the discussion, I don't think you're actually in the minority. I think most people do practice warning multiple times before reverting, although perhaps not everybody goes all the way out to five warnings. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> 23:02, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My 2 yen: I almost always give at least two warnings before blocking, but there are cases where an instant block is the only remedy. It really depends.

<dd>Yes, in fact I've talked to quite a few regular editors in IRC whos first edits were playing pranks on Wikipedia. The fact of the matter is that a few jokes here in there by themselves are harmless, the problem is that when you scale it up to the millions of potential editors we'd be overrun with nonsense edits. Some people don't think this out, so they decide it would be fun and harmless to insert a penis in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a>. It's less obvious who started with vandals, because people often do this anonymously, then get accounts after their first postive expirence with people on Wikipedia. People also are also <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Hedley_bff6.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Hedley">wise</a> to not jump up and admit their seedy past: although there is <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Hedley_2_3b6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Hedley 2">some evidence</a> that we forgive and forget, it isn't strong.... We're not talking about highspeed / bot driven vandalism here.

<dd>I can't think of anyone off the top of my head who went around doing active malicious vandalism for a while and then settled down (though it would be hard to tell, since much vandalism is done by anon IPs and most regulars register). Some would say <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlato_bf19.html" title="User:Plato">User:Plato</a> falls into that category, but I'm not sure he was all that positive an editor. There have definitely been people who did some little test insertion of silliness, and then accidentally blanked a page or two, and then figured out how everything worked and turned out to be cooperative. Really malicious people should be blocked, but it seems like Brian0918 and some others aren't assuming good faith, and are blocking very quickly some things that could be either tests or vandalism. <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> 02:12, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It does not matter if the user intended to vandalize, to test, or whatever. Intent is very difficult to determine accurately, when it seems obvious it often isn't, and even once you are sure you've pinned someone's intentions you will have little luck getting widespread agreement in the community. Without community support you will have <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CommunityMustAgree" class="external text" title="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CommunityMustAgree" rel="nofollow">little luck</a> enforcing a block, or at least you'll risk more 'rogue admin' accusations. The reason assume good faith works, and indeed the reason we're able to do any enforcement at all, is because we act on actions, not intent. By acting on actions rather than intent we avoid the entire rats nest of determining intent entirely. Good users do bad things too from time to time, bad users will act in mysterious and chaotic ways... it doesn't matter, if they harm the project we can block them all. ... When we see people getting blocked without warning, when there isn't a compelling reason like speedy vandalsim, then we must conclude that someone has blocked them based on presumed intent (since when would you block a good intentioned user after one edit?). <b>No one</b> can accurately determine intent, so blocks based on presumed intent rather than actions are more likely to be wrong, are unlikely to be supported by the community, and they violate the spirit of our blocking policy if not the letter of law. Yes, the process says to apply judgement, but it says that because we want to be flexible and to avoid bureaucracy. It is not a blank check. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 04:38, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I must say, I think that Gmaxwell summarised it very well in the above paragraph. This question often seems to perennially come to the foreground when some admin has been found to have started a "crackdown" on vandalism by somewhat zealous banning (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">User:RickK</a> jumps to mind). There is, I feel, a wider issue at play here; and that is where we consider admin discretion overrides standard policy, and when it is either appropriate or inappropriate for that to be ignored. Of course, we have IAR; but as Greg so aptly put it, it isn't a blank cheque. I think it is true to say that a lack of reasonable tolerance of initial vandalism actually tends to create more vandalism, since it turns the previously neutral user into an enemy (perhaps, in the spirit of <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>). I think that there is a delicate balance between being too relaxed on vandals (since they learn to trash the wiki as they please) or being too harsh on them (as it causes the parties to "declare war"). What we really are attempting to achieve is somehow making constructive editing more attractive to newcomers than vandalism; civility, and tolerance, are key in the process. As to how else we could achieve this process I don't know; I will give it some thought. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull"><font color="#906040">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></font></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_NicholasTurnbull_2b3e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/NicholasTurnbull">(e-mail)</a> <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">(cabal)</a> 05:13, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An editor (editing both as an anon. and as <a href="../../../d/p/k/User%7EDpknauss_4a5a.html" title="User:Dpknauss">User:Dpknauss</a>) has been doing extensive work on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Crowley_%28printer%29_aec8.html" title="Robert Crowley (printer)">Robert Crowley (printer)</a> and a couple of related articles. I began to be worried that a lot of it looked like original research, and posted a comment on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Talk%7ERobert_Crowley_%28printer%29_2d59.html" title="Talk:Robert Crowley (printer)">Talk:Robert Crowley (printer)</a> asking if that impression could be remedied. Dpknauss's response has been (in between the personal abuse, and the rejection of Wikipedia policies and guidelines as "utterly stupid, incoherent, self-contradictory") to say that yes, of course it's original research, so what?</p>
<p>The article is very long and detailed, and I'm in no position to edit it so as to remove the original parts while retaining the rest.

<dd>Material that is original research is useless to Wikipedia. In fact it is probably a negative. Give the user a chance to substantiate the material with valid sources, and if they choose not to, make it clear all the material will be reverted, not as a punishment, just what is in the best interest of the project. Of course the material may be correct, and if so it would be easy to verify with good sources. If the user refuses to follow policies, suggest somewhere else is a better place for their work, and carry it through the dispute resolution process if need be. An RFC could be successful, just don't give up on enforcing our policies. WP:NOR is non negotiable too. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 12:50, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Removing coments from your own talk page is not a violation of policy, it's only generally discouraged (since it makes one look like as if he was trying to hide something).

<dd>No, they're not sockpuppets. BigDaddy777 and Gator are both conservative editors; Gator started defending BigDaddy777 at about the point when the RFC was opened on BD777's conduct, and the two of them have continued to banter back and forth. Derex was involved in a contentious article that BD777 had also edited, and has as a result become imbroiled in the entire fiasco. There's a good deal of bickering going on, that's why the talk page is fairly active. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 17:13, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. I blocked two users indefinitely on sight, because their names were obvious admissions of being straw men. They had both edited BD777's talk page, so I reverted the changes, and Gator1 reverted my changes. I let the matter drop then, because I felt I knew too little of the conflict. It just piqued my curiosity. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 17:31, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's good, I'm glad that was taken care of. I agree with that particular block. Without putting words in Gator's mouth, I suspect he probably reverted the changes because he feels it's further evidence of BD777 being persecuted here (witness the wholly offensive comparison of BD777 and other conservative editors to blacks in the American South in the 1950's manifesto BD777 posted on his talk page). To me, it's not worth it to try reverting again -- there've been quite a lot of shenanigans going on on his talk page already so I'm just keeping away from the whole thing.

I also informed him that we don't protect pages permanently. He wasn't satisfied with my response that I would keep an eye out; his e-mails were suggestive of legal action, and he felt that Wikipedia was being complicit in libel by not protecting his page.

<dd>During last <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Fools_Day_8caa.html" title="April Fools Day">April Fools Day</a> there were a number of admins who edited the MediaWiki messages, and there was even some edit warring with other admins who were quickly reverting those changes. I think that one admin was even AFAR'd, but the ArbComm quickly decided, at least in that instance, that it was a one-time thing and unlikely to happen again. Before next April Fools Day admins probably should be warned that this is behavior that they should repeat. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 13:33, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Changing <a href="../../../e/d/i/MediaWiki%7EEdit_594d.html" title="MediaWiki:Edit">Mediawiki:Edit</a> changes the tab, but changing <a href="../../../e/d/i/MediaWiki%7EEditthispage_a47c.html" title="MediaWiki:Editthispage">Mediawiki:Editthispage</a> doesn't seem to change anything.

<p>Administrators who were watching <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> last week may have caught the brief but very clangorous battle of words between some participants in an apparently trivial war over the <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanites.html" title="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> articles, and those who have watched <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> will have seen a related failed attempt by one participant to bring an arbitration case against another.

<dd>I don't see any reason protected pages are not valid for deletion nominations. I disagree with fvw and think that vprotected should not be nominated. Instead, that should be handled an protected pages.

<p>All unblocked - someone reasonably higher up in TAFE asked me to unblock them as they are trying to encourage their students to contribute to Wikipedia. No thanks to Ozemail, who must have the worst security team in the world: I was informed that these IP address ranges were being used by their proxy servers. From what I'm getting, it appears that they don't know their own network. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 08:14, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure where to ask this, but I thought that the AN might have some experienced editors/admins willing to provide some advice.</p>
<p>I had a brief and slightly negative encounter with a particular editor. I'm not going to mention his username, as I think that would just escalate things before I'm ready for it. I'm pretty immune to minor incivility at this point, so I'm not complaining about a particular incident. But I checked out the user's contributions, and he seems to very frequently break almost every rule on <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>. We're talking near-constant abusive edit summaries, hostile and sarcastic comments on talk pages, vicious newbie bites, etc. However, he has also done some quite useful edits. The civility page suggests using peer pressure, but I'm afraid if I try to start a dialogue with this contributor I'll just redirect his hostility my way. Any suggestions for how to start a productive conversation? I don't feel I can just ignore him; I think he may be scaring some newbies away. <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> 16:19, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello there Moink - firstly, well done for taking the time and trouble to consider this, and to ask for assistance on this matter without plunging straight in. Being able to take a step back from the issue, and consider the best course of action, is always the most important thing in dealing with things like this - so you've already done the first part right.&#160;:-) Below are a few pointers on how to deal with hostile users:
<ol>
<li>Firstly, <b>be prepared for them to be uncivil towards you at first when you try to raise the issue with them, and don't get mad in return</b>. When people comment on or criticise the behaviour of someone else, that person can often feel threatened or attacked at first - but if you continue a good faith effort to reach out to them and assist them, they will eventually learn that you do not intend any malice towards them. If the user does make personal attacks against you, or behaves with animosity, politely - but not indignantly - point out what they are doing, and how they could correct it. It is important to assume good faith, and start off with the assumption that the user is not aware of their behaviour being unacceptable.</li>
<li>Try to find a point of agreement with the user. In other words, find something positive - an "olive branch", if you will, to kick the dialogue off onto a good start. It is important that you do maintain some degree of agreement with the user throughout the dialogue, as when agreement is missing understanding cannot possibly occur between yourself and the user and dialogue rapidly becomes fruitless. In all communication with the user try to find things you can agree upon, to keep the dialogue running smoothly.</li>
<li>Further to the above, try to word all discussion of what the user is doing incorrectly in a positive fashion. In other words, speak to the user in a manner as if you are assisting the user to become a better Wikipedian, rather than telling the user they aren't doing something right. Make sure you tell the user how they could improve their behaviour on Wikipedia, rather than just telling them what they aren't doing right.</li>
<li>Maintain a good communication cycle with the user. Be sure to acknowledge the user's messages to you in your replies, and remain cordial, polite and friendly at all times.</li>
<li>If you feel the user is being reserved in his or her communications to you, consider finding a more private medium for communication than Wikipedia talk pages. Often, people are either ashamed of discussing their weaknesses in public, or do not wish to mention things due to disputes that had previously occurred on Wikipedia. You may wish to offer them your e-mail address, or arrange a meeting on a messenger service (such as IRC, Skype, MSN Messenger, etc.) so that they can talk about private matters openly.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I hope the above assists you in resolving the matter with the user. If you find yourself unable to continue working on the issue, please feel free to drop us a note at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal</a> and we will take over the case if you wish, or provide secondary support - also, if you wish, you could direct the user in question to contact me.

<dd>While we're on this subject, whilst a gradiation warning system is fine for newby tests, blankings and general sillyness, I'm fed up seeing 4 warnings given to folk who do things like replace biographical articles with 'IS A COCKSUCKER!' - these folk never turn into good editors after three gentle reprimands. I wonder whether we need a 'first and final warning' templet for blatent and offensive vandalism. Perhaps {{blatantvandal}} rendering</dd>

<dd>I like this idea. It would certainly help with response time to vandalism. I've been starting off with a {{test2}} or {{test3}} for highly questionable edits, but your alternative is a lot better.

<dd>What the HELL is wrong with having links to one of our greatest living critics' and novelists' comments on literature and literary works? Are you COMPLETELY deranged? I really, really, really think Oates herself is too busy to be doing this, but even if it is her (HAHA!) taking the links down is the most stupid thing I've ever seen done here (and that's saying a lot, because I've seen the page <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Mertz_f5c3.html" title="David Mertz">David Mertz</a> wrote about himself).

<dd>While I wouldn't go as far as the above comments by <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanya_Ravine_76c9.html" title="User:Tanya Ravine">User:Tanya Ravine</a>, Oates is indeed a very noted author and critic, and a link to her comments on a particular author or literary work seems to me to be likely to be a proper and relevant addition to articles about those authors or works, depending on the exact content of the page linked to, of course. But this seems to me to be less a case of linkspam than is adding an IMDB link to an article about an actor or a movie -- note that the IMDB is a commercial project, and contains lots of ads, but we link to it routinely and frequently because it is a highly relevant source of info. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:50, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Some of the pages linked to have only a few book jacket type blurbs add nothing to the Wikipedia articles that they were inserted into. Others are quite in-depth and do add to their articles.

<dd>Concurring with GraemeL here. Oates is indeed an important academic critic, who has written on many literary works. A link to a book jacket is silly, but a link to an actual literary essay by Oates on a given author or book is worth keeping. It <i>is</i> funny for an editor to be solely concerned with topics that Oates has written on, but it's not destructive to add such links where relevant. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 21:18, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>[Raising hand politely to be counted as Oates fan.] Apart from her stature, Oates is an incredibly productive writer and must indeed be very, very busy. Also, I don't think, if it was her doing it, that we would see such varying quality in these links, and therefore it seems more likely to be a fan/student of hers inserting them. Please don't remove any links to actual essays. The interview with Oates about Dylan (enhanced by containing video clip as well as text) is one of her slighter pieces, but I personally find it nevertheless more deserving and less spam-y than, say, <a href="http://web.utk.edu/~wparr/scripture/scripturelinks.html" class="external text" title="http://web.utk.edu/~wparr/scripture/scripturelinks.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> external <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> link, or <a href="http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/Side%20essay%202.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/Side%20essay%202.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 11:36, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One minor thought—by adding information about 'page move vandalism' and describing in detail one of our most notorious vandals, are we violating the <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> principle?

<p>The email didn't specify which IP was affected, but looking through my block log, it appears that 210.0.177.84 is the only one that could have possibly been affected. I'm curious as to what other admins think about possibly unblocking, and whether this IP really belongs to King George V school- it is a Hong Kong IP, as is the school, but I didn't necessarily find any evidence of the IP belonging to the school in particular. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">Ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> <a href="../../../p/o/s/WP%7EPOST_8e4c.html" title="WP:POST"><font color="blue">W<sub>S</sub></font></a> 18:32, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think deleting {{d}} and {{db|reason}} are a bad idea. I remember that before I became an admin, when doing new pages patrol, there was a lot of junk being created - i.e. something like "'''[[Bold text]][[[Media:http://www.example.com link title]]]'''Insert non-formatted text here" It is quite obvious that if a page like that were created, it should be deleted — it's more common sense than pointing to the specific criteria that says "patent nonsense" or "created with little or no context". In addition, forcing someone to use a specific type of delete tag not only wastes time when doing new pages patrol, but is also confusing. Even now, I have no clue what criterion a1 is, or which one "patent nonsense" is. And I don't intend to know — it should be enough that I know those are criteria for deletion. The {{db|REASON}} also should not be deleted, because it lets users type in a reason — if someone doesn't know the specific criteria but knows that the above example is junk, they can type in {{db|newbie testing}} or something like that. In addition, {{db}} is also useful in cases of miscellanious deletion, such as a user trying to delete a user subpage. Thus, while I don't oppose the introduction of the new templates, I am strongly opposed to the deletion of {{d}} and {{db}}.

<dd>Fair points - I'll just have to keep droping notes to point out that 'advert' isn't currently a CSD. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 22:55, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oops, I think you thought I meant that I was thinking of deleting {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}}. No, I was thinking of making the rest of the CSD tags (plus, I can't delete them even if I wanted, I'm not an admin). However, that said, I don't see the use of {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}}. {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}} is <i><b>extremely</b></i> useful, but {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}} doesn't say anything. It doesn't tell the closing admin why the page should be deleted (and I'm not just talking about saying something like "Delete because of CSD G7", somthing simple as "Newbie test" works too). So <i>if</i> something should be deleted, it should be just {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}}. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">xd</font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 22:58, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Deleting {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}} wouldn't be a bad idea, but {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}} encourages more descriptive explanations as to why an article fits a certain criterion. I would therefore tend to keep that tag. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:05, 10 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I concur. I often encounter {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}} on articles that aren't clear speedy candidates, and just end up removing the tag. {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}} at least forces the tagger to provide a reason, whether it's a valid one or not, and it is still frequently used by those who aren't used to the more specialized templates. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 13:17, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>OK, I think we've got a small consensus here - any more views?

<ul>
<li>I don't necessarily think that {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}} is helpful, it is definately over used, if an editor adds it for a bad reason, then that bad reason would be listed on {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}}. As for the other templates, I know a few of them, but really only used {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}}, mainly because when it comes down to it, knowing policies are one thing, remembering 20 template names is another. I would definately say dumb d and keep db. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Who_d857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Who"><font color="#000000">∞</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#FF0033">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 13:30, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do occasionally use {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}}, though that's just laziness on my part when it's an obvious speedy. I use {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}} a lot more. Getting rid of {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}} would probably be a good thing. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeL_c5a8.html" title="User:GraemeL">GraemeL</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraemeL_c70d.html" title="User talk:GraemeL"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:35, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If it's not clear from viewing the article why it's a CSD to an admin who knows <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, it probably isn't a CSD anyway. {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}} is a labour saving device for non-admin RC patrollers and I don't think we should be making them type more, they have it hard enough as it is. Just give people mis-using it a quick hint that they shouldn't use it on unclear cases, should they present themselves (you could even make a template for this message if you want).</li>
<li>On the other hand, it does appear that all the arguments for and against have been made here, so if you want to TfD it go ahead, there's no need to have a strawpoll here and then have another one there. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 13:54, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Meh, looking at the previous TfD, it looks like any such nomination would fail. Maybe instead of trying to get it deleted, we should just discourage its use. Maybe some reminder text on {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}} itself, encouraging the user to instead use {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}} or one of the specialized ones? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 14:34, 10 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed, I've no stomach to nominate this in the face of such an overwhelming 'keep' less than six months ago. But I wonder whether a gentle worded 'please view the CSD, before tagging any more speedies' message template might be in order.

<ul>
<li>Good idea. Perhaps two talk-page message templates: One for the tagger who's tagging deleteable articles with {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}} instead of the more specific ones, and one for the tagger who's tagging non-deleteable or ambiguously-deleteable stuff.

<li>I'm broadly in favour of deletign - but given the previous debate was an overwheling 'keep', I'd probably advise against it --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 00:12, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

But perhaps more worryingly, existing criteria are being pushed to catch ‘common sense’ deletions – which don’t fit careful rules. It is currently easier to tag nonsense, which is not patent, or things like advertising, with {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}} and hope an admin will be flexible, than to go through the full AFD process. Increasing speedies answers the ‘deletion imbalance’, but can leave subjective and practically unscrutinised deletions.</i> This makes me believe that {{<a href="../../../d/_/_/Template%7ED_3872.html" title="Template:D">d</a>}} is being used to circumvent the CSD, which was not brought up on the previous TFD.

<li>Too be frank, I use {{d}} in exactly that way. If I see something that's not cleanly in a category <i>but</i> I still think would be a slam-dunk at AfD <i>and</i> didn't miss out on having it's own category, I'll slap a lazy D on it and hope for an IAR admin. However, I'd support something that explicitly said <i>"Anything not tagged with a specific CSD and that names that CDS in it's deletion comments will be restored and sent to AfD if deleted."</i> Additionally, the rational given by most of the "keep" votes last time was very slim. (E.g. "Don't be silly"). I think that <i>if</i> the nomination explained very carefully why {{d}} should go but {{db}} should stay <i>and</i> pointed to this discussion, a second TfD might have a different outcome. (Plus, I didn't see DES's "delete" vote in the nomination linked? Was there yet another one?)<br />

<li>Well, the reason for the speedy (through the {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}} template) doesn't need to <i>quote</i> the CSDs, but it should say <i>something</i> about why it is a speedy.

<li>Yes, agree there. Still think that the <i>deletion comment</i> should quote the criterion used or be restored, but that's a seperate issue that I am now officially shutting up on. I'm about a picosecond away from putting it on TfD...<br />

<p>I've been a little <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> myself, and (per the discussion above) created a 'first and final warning' tag for blatant or offensive vandalism. It's intended not for tests or general silliness but for folk who blank articles with obscenities etc. It warns that any more such acts may result in an immediate block (whilst leaving discression to the next admin, whether to block or warn again). I can’t find anything in the blocking policy that forbids this, but I will not use them until I see if anyone objects. They are <a href="../../../b/l/a/Template%7EBlatantvandal_5997.html" title="Template:Blatantvandal">Template:Blatantvandal</a> , notated {{blatantvandal}} or {{bv}}.

<dd>Just so people know. I was an undergrad there. Many IP addresses are assigned centrally and statically to students' rooms for an academic year, or longer (in some cases we retained an IP for 2 years or more despite moving), at a time. Students uniformly live in their Colleges so this possible. So, if these are vandalising outside 'working' hours in the United Kingdom, blocking them is very unlikely to cause any collateral damage. Working hours in this case is largely 9am-1pm UK time since that is when practically all teaching in the Uni happens — students are not often lurking at departmental (i.e. shared) computers at a high density outside those hours (although those who are too keen are, of course). There <i>are</i> shared computers which are in regular, round-the-clock use, but these are in the minority and are principally in in-College computer rooms that contain plenty of other computers for an innocent editor to use. Oh, and if they turn out to be Willy, the University Computing Service will be all ears, I would imagine. Not that I can prove any of this to you, of course. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:09, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you can log the IPs, and file them somewhere, they can often be identified to one individual <i>user</i>, and a pointed complaint to the university computing service about JANET regulations - well, it can't hurt, and if the admin in question is feeling pissed off that morning someone might get a nasty email. In many colleges in-room machines have a username chosen by the student (I remember tales of the Churchill undergrad whose machine revelled in the name of pika.chu.cam.ac.uk) making it both easy to trace and easy to identify as an individuals machine - communal ones tend to be more vaguely named.</dd>
<dd>For example, the one you blocked earlier was 131.111.202.113 (<a href="../../../1/3/1/User_talk%7E131.111.202.113.html" title="User talk:131.111.202.113">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_131.111.202.113_e2ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/131.111.202.113">contribs</a>), which resolves as kentrosaurus.chu.cam.ac.uk - it's almost guaranteed to be a private in-room machine at Churchill, and whilst I can't tell you who that is (though if it wasn't 3am I could ask around and see if anyone knew), their admin <i>can</i>.

Should any sysop feel that it is necessary that either Yuber or Guy Montag be banned from an article where one of them is engaged in edit warring, removal of sourced material, POV reorganizations of the article, or any other activity which the user considers disruptive they shall place a template {{Yuber banned}} or {{Guy Montag banned}} as appropriate at the top of the talk page of the article, and notify them on their talk page. The template shall include the ending date of the ban (one year from this decision) and a link to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProbation_b453.html" title="Wikipedia:Probation">Wikipedia:Probation</a>. The template may be removed by any editor, including Yuber and Guy Montag, at the end of the ban. If Yuber or Guy Montag edit an article they are banned from, they may be briefly blocked from editing Wikipedia, up to a week for repeat offenses.</li>
<li>Yuber is instructed to use only this account, and no anonymous IPs. What editing constitutes Yuber's is up to any sysop to decide. If Yuber violates this, any sysop is authorised to ban them for up to a week.</li>
<li>For three months Guy Montag is banned from editing any article related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the date of closing this case.</li>

<p>This is not kosher. IPs are not to be blocked permanently unless they are open proxies, which this one isn't. I've adjusted the block to last the duration of the school year, the same as has been done with other Australian school IPs, which all seem to generate massive quantities of vandalism. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 06:06, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fvw, did you get it all? The last time I hit one of these there were a lot of edits that were older and couldn't be automatically rolled back, so I had to manually remove each link.

PM Poon is being insulting and hostile to an editor who seems to have done no more than (correctly) point out that PM Poon's copyediting hadn't been effective and that a "copyedit" template souldn't be removed, and who then copy-edited the article herself. PM Poon's behaviour is harrassing, and has extended to a minor case of Wiki-stalking. I've experienced him myself (as Poon and Tan), and he's overwhelmingly insistent.</p>
<p>Poon is, in fact, a bit of a problem across a range of articles. He has a habit (as he did when editing as Mr Tan) of "copyediting" articles, which usually involves at best the imposition of his sometimes odd ideas about good style, and at worst the introduction of grammatical mistakes. He then becomes aggressively defensive towards those who point this out. His English is poor, but he insists on giving advice to others, including native speakers whose English is in fact perfectly good. That's what seems to be happening here.</p>
<p>Partly because I'm unlikely to get anywhere with him, partly because the insults include the appalling calumny that Phronima's really me, but mainly because I'm a little tied up with other matters at the moment, I wondered if another admin would take a look and act accordingly.

<p>I've reverted him, and I'm going to warn him that repeatedly reverting an article against such a clear consensus while refusing to discuss the edit on the article's talk page is vandalism and that if he continues he will find himself in dispute resolution and his ability to edit restricted.

<p>I'm assuming good faith and have placed my warning on his new, blank talk page. If he reverts again today I'll block using 3RR. If I see him revert again after 24 hours, I may give a warning block (assuming noone here hollers and tells me that's not appropriate), or I may try to bring it to attention through dispute resolution so we could have an ironclad case for action if he doesn't concede. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 20:35, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a small number of disruptive editors going round trying to change date styles from BC to BCE in contravention of WP policy - I have been reverting them. It appears here that I erred and that the page (unfortunately for most of our readers who find BCE alien to them!) apparently was not originally BC. That's a shame - we should always use common terms over unusual ones, but I shan't revert this page again. Incidentally, where I know I have made at least one revert of any page, I always check to see whether a further revert would make me in breach of the 3RR (which seems a sensible approach). I'm not into gaming - I'm into making WP as useful a resource to as many people as possible, it's just a shame that a small number of users aren't, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 20:46, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><del>Resolved, then, mostly. Thanks for your good faith, here</del>. I do think you (and all of us) need to realize that the present status quo on BC/BCE/AD/CE is pretty shaky. You can't go wrong if you treat it on an article by article basis and let the regular editors of that article come to consensus.</p>
<p>I don't think you're trying to game the 3RR system, but I do think you should think a little more about the spirit behind the policy. From experience, I get changes made more effectively when I'm discussing more and reverting less. I'll leave further comments about it on your talk page. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 20:49, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, he's repeatedly removed my comments from his page. By my count he has done this four times: once through immediately archiving (now the timing is more suspicious), once for when I replaced my original comment on the new talk page, once for my next comment about the spirit behind the 3RR, and then once more after I replaced both removed comments. Is this a violation of 3RR? <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 21:31, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, check his edit history and note that he is still carrying the fight about era notation to other pages. Again I contend that this violates the spirit of 3RR when you are effectively carrying on the same revert on multiple pages. I rescind my above comment that this is resolved. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 21:33, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>He has removed my comments again. I consider this to be the fifth revert and a violation of 3RR and am blocking 24 hours. If anyone disagrees, feel free to unblock or otherwise admonish me. I think I'm doing right here ... but as a newbie admin I would like some feedback.</p>
<p>My understanding is that regardless of whatever control and latitude may be granted to you to control your user talk pages (which does not, according to any policy I can see, appear to be much) you don't get a free pass there from 3RR. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 21:38, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm bewildered by Jguk's attitude to this. <i>He</i> is the editor who's being disruptive by going around changing pages that have been stable around this issue for months, so far as I know. There <i>is</i> no policy on this. The MoS says both are acceptable and anyway the MoS isn't policy, but Jguk is going around implying that using BCE/CE is somehow forbidden. For example, a recent edit summary of his read: "I'm told the MOS mandates this copyedit," <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khazars&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=25224757" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khazars&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=25224757" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> which strikes me as less than honest, because the MoS, as Jguk knows very well, mandates nothing about anything. I really wish he would stop it because all it's doing is creating bad feeling. On top of that, he's archiving all the comments about it on his talk page, so people don't see that quite a few editors oppose him. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:58, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A simple question. Is it a policy or a guideline? It doesn't actually say definitively either way on the page, and as a result there's some wikilawyering going on at <a href="../../../t/h/o/Talk%7EThomas_Woods_7195.html" title="Talk:Thomas Woods">Talk:Thomas Woods</a> over whether or not some uncited assertions can remain in the article. I had always assumed it was a policy, but it doesn't specifically say that. Anybody?

<dd>My opinion has always been that unverifiability (evidenced, among other ways, by information being unsourced) is a legitimate reason for removal of information from an article. Off the top of my head I'd say whoever is calling for information to be removed or sourced is within rights. I've always thought CITE was just info about how to get the formatting right and what sources were applicable and such. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 20:15, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would venture that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is a policy, which directly references citation. I would therefore hold <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> to be a guideline for documenting verifiability, as would also be the case for the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, the guideline for what sources are reliable for verification purposes. <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">Buffyg</a> 20:32, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pragmatically, I think one needs a source to justify getting material in <i>and</i> out. If something is just added and questioned, remove it to talk and request a source. That's legit, if there is no source, it doesn't get in if it is questionable. But if something is already in the article for a while, someone can't hold it all hostage and wholesale remove it unless they have a source that demonstrates it is wrong. At first, most any source above a geocities page counts, but of course higher quality sources should trump lower ones. And everyone should enforce edits in favor of the editor with the highest quality sources. Someone reverting against what high quality sources say should be dealt with through the 3RR rule or the dispute resolution process. An RFC would likely be quickly successful because Verifiability is a core policy. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 13:23, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, from what I understand, there's the worry that some of the recent huge spate of unused newly-created accounts may be dormant sockpuppets of Willy On Wheels or similar page-move vandals, because you have to have been a user for (time X) before being granted page-move privileges.</p>
<p>I'd like to suggest that this be modified: not only do you have to have been a user for (time X), but you also need to have (# of edits). Not a <i>huge</i> number - perhaps a hundred or so, but more than it's worth doing at random in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Just a suggestion from a new admin. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 01:40, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seems reasonable.
