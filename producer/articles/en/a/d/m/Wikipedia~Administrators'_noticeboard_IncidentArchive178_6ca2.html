<p>On November 5 2006 we requested the elimination of the sexual orientation item about Mr. Anderson Cooper's entry. We were partially pleased with the results, but the item has surfaced again, we ask that the rule will be applied as soon as possible and in full and final compliance. Including the deletion of the discussions of the topic. Thank you.</p>

<dd>Hi. The section in question (<a href="../../../a/n/d/Anderson_Cooper_b4fd.html#Personal_life" title="Anderson Cooper">Anderson Cooper#Personal life</a>) has been edited down to ensure that only a referenced direct comment from Mr. Cooper about his sexuality remains, which he made to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Metro_4d93.html" title="New York Metro">New York Metro</a>. This is in line with our requirements on <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biographies of living people</a>. At this time, I do not feel that neutral, scholarly discussion of the topic on the article's talk page needs to be removed. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 10:15, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I've been closing <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> requests lately, and I just closed a somewhat controversial one. You can see it at <a href="../../../u/s/h/Talk%7EUshak_carpet_bec6.html" title="Talk:Ushak carpet">Talk:Ushak carpet</a>. It's a case where I closed it against the numbers, because, IMO, those supporting the move based their arguments on <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMMONNAME_4276.html" title="WP:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a>, while those opposing the move basically disagreed with <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMMONNAME_4276.html" title="WP:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a>. (That's a guideline, not policy, but there's a one-sentence version of it at the policy: <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html#Use_common_names_of_persons_and_things" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME#Use common names of persons and things</a>.)</p>
<p>Because I closed against the numbers, which is often controversial, and because I have received feedback on my talk page questioning the move, I request a review of my actions by other administrators, and the community at large.

<p><s>I need the help of someone more experienced than myself. For the last few days, there has been a minor edit war going on at <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndolences_6e3c.html" title="User:Indolences">Indolences</a> has been ignoring the discussion on the talk page and making sweeping deletes of properly sourced material. The problem now is that there have been several minor edits since his last deletion, and I am not competent to reverse it without just doing a cut-and-paste job on the text, which won't save the history. I invite whoever would help to read the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Talk%7ESealand_a26d.html" title="Talk:Sealand">Talk</a> page for Sealand to verify what I claim before deciding if what I ask is proper, or perhaps if someone could direct me to the correct method for dealing with this. <a href="../../../n/i/p/User%7ENipokNek_2558.html" title="User:NipokNek">NipokNek</a> 11:01, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</s></p>

<p>I've been referred to posting here by an advocate who I went to for some troubles with user User:Bob Wilson.</p>
<p>First, this user flagrantly defaced the ECourier page (the deletion is an issue being dealt with separately and not relevant here). I wrote a message on his talk page outlining the edits (e.g. replacing the corporate link with a link to Micky Mouse, changing <a href="../../../r/e/l/Release_1.0.html" title="Release 1.0">Release 1.0</a> to "Release the balls" etc. Now, some time later, I have received the following threatening personal attack:</p>
<p>Well, looks like I won after all, you self promoting loser.</p>
<p>You had the nerve to send me a patronising message, who the hell do you think you are?</p>
<p>A moral victory for the Wilson.</p>
<p>I am asking for admin help to address his conduct and prevent further attacks / defacement. Thank you.<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaybregman_dbf7.html" title="User:Jaybregman">Jaybregman</a> 23:03, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Thank you for this. But I respecfully disagree with your comment. First, although the edit may have happened at that time, I've been on holiday and have only just seen it. Second, I think any personal attack is serious, isn't it? I realise more experienced users or admins may encounter these issues all the time, but for those who don't it's quite shocking to see ad hominem attacks on their talk page. It doesn't exactly make you want to spend more time with this community. I am thankful you were able to deal with this so quickly and efficiently and that there are procedures in place to do so.<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaybregman_dbf7.html" title="User:Jaybregman">Jaybregman</a> 23:15, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, as one gains experience one will be the recipient of a larger number of personal attacks. However, before you pass judgement on whether you want to "spend more time with this community", please stop to think of who "this community" actually is.

<p>I was referred here to report information re: the pie vandal, so I assume this is what I'm supposed to do.

His edits typically involve inserting the name Michael Alfred Montalbano, or some variant, into the text. These three IPs have been used for this purpose in the article <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torn_%28Ednaswap_song%29_5b64.html" title="Torn (Ednaswap song)">Torn (Ednaswap song)</a> and have also edited other articles in a similar manner: 172.144.143.60 (<a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.144.143.60.html" title="User talk:172.144.143.60">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.144.143.60_2c56.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.144.143.60">contribs</a>), 207.69.139.12 (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.69.139.12.html" title="User talk:207.69.139.12">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.69.139.12_0fa2.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.69.139.12">contribs</a>), and 207.69.137.36 (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.69.137.36.html" title="User talk:207.69.137.36">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.69.137.36_7480.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.69.137.36">contribs</a>).

<p>There has indeed been extensive litigation over the sex.com domain name before Judge Ware, as is discussed in the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.com.html" title="Sex.com">sex.com</a> article itself. However, the claim that the court would enter an order barring any information being posted to an independent website is frivolous, and the claim that it would be contempt of court for a non-party to the proceeding to violate an order as to which it lacked notice and an opportunity to heard is inconsistent with governing precedent. To me, it looks like the goal of the poster may have been to harass the Court with a deluge of phone calls to the number provided, and I suggest that the edit be deleted. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:58, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've had a quick peek at the current calendar for Judge James Ware of the USDCNDC. There is no case "98-2017 JW" listed on it. Note that (a) that is not a complete case number (compare it with the real case number for <i>Kremen v. Cohen</i> and the ones on the calendar), and (b) the "98" indicates that it would be a case from 1998. The telephone numbers for Judge Ware's docket clerks (civil and criminal) are published on the court's own web site, by the way. But they certainly don't belong in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:35, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Judge Ware is responsible for a case concerning ownership of the sex.com domain name, as is revealed by a quick Google search.

<dd>I have to say, this whole idea of issuing warnings for the removal of warnings is just crap. We've got a dynamic IP here, and quite possibly someone getting caught by someone else's block. The guy doesn't need his own legitimate complaints deleted from his talk page to be replaced with an officious template-turd about not removing warnings. Why does that template even exist? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 00:06, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What a good question. The chief function of the template seems to be to deceive the inexperienced into thinking that removing warnings is a wikicrime, and to go harass users based on that false belief.

<p>I recall it used to be considered that material in general shouldn't be removed from user talk pages (apart from archiving), as it showed user conduct, and in particular warnings should definitely not be deleted. Then it was pointed out that some admins regularly deleted material, and the approach started changing, but don't think it's a good thing. If warnings are removed, then it's necessary to search through the history, which seems a needless task. They should be left displayed so anyone can make an assessment of conduct (including of course any response by the user regarding a warning). <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 10:09, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think having to look at the contribution history is such a burden. If I see someone vandalizing, I'd better look at their history, to see if there are other pages they've been hitting.

<p>On the subject of things that used to be: It used to be that we had a principle of forgiving and forgetting. (In fact, we still have. See <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Wikipedia:Etiquette</a>.) Requiring that people sport scarlet letters, and chastising them when they take them off, is a gross violation of that principle.

<dd>Most recent week-long ban seems to have been made in error.

<dd>Well yes, I don't know how the blocking admin was counting for that 3RR. And although some of the general behaviour of this user has appalled me, I think a community ban seems heavy.

<p>I have been having a problem with <a href="../../../7/1/d/User%7E71Demon_5555.html" title="User:71Demon">71Demon</a> (<a href="../../../7/1/d/User_talk%7E71Demon_ccac.html" title="User talk:71Demon">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71Demon_fd32.html" title="Special:Contributions/71Demon">contribs</a>). He uploaded a number of images with false licenses and kept on reverting the no-license tag. Eventually, we received confirmation from a senator's office that the license was incorrect but that the images were released to the public domain (and so usable on the Wikipedia). I corrected the image license. Now, though, I'm faced with a few edits like this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Schadler_robert.jpg&amp;curid=8920282&amp;diff=101147069&amp;oldid=101136317" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Schadler_robert.jpg&amp;curid=8920282&amp;diff=101147069&amp;oldid=101136317" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>I believe 71Demon's actions warrant a block for this uncivil behaviour. His statements are also false; the images were not licensed under the GFDL as he falsely claimed. However, it would clearly be a conflict of interest for me to block this user. Could someone else take a look and block or warn as they see fit? --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 18:51, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He's already on a 48 hour block for incivility. I just got done moving all the discussions from the licensing section of the images to the talk page &amp; I left him a little note that hopefully clarified the issue here, namely he didn't license the images correctly and then tried to put the burden of proof on other editors by just providing a weblisting and phone number to the originator of the photos (as well as not helping himself with incivility).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:15, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed, earlier today, <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFasterPussycatWooHoo_b42d.html" title="User:FasterPussycatWooHoo">User:FasterPussycatWooHoo</a> added a rather inflammatory statement to his user page, calling other Wikipedians liars <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:FasterPussycatWooHoo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101073856" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:FasterPussycatWooHoo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101073856" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. Shortly after, he softened the wording slightly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:FasterPussycatWooHoo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101077086" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:FasterPussycatWooHoo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101077086" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, but it still implies that other Wikipedians are liars.

<p>At what point does one say formally "I suspect this IP address and that user to be one and the same person"? I've been looking at a set of reversions and edits to multiple related articles made in quick succession by a logged in user and an IP address. The edits have been primarily to remove a template that the user and the IP address feel should not be applied to articles, and no edit history is entered. My perception, which may well not reflect reality, is that the user logs in or out to revert additions of this template and avoid being accused of 3RR, though probably stops just short of it in any case (not that I have tested, I do not do revert wars!).</p>
<p>If one says it formally, where and how does one do it? I see it as a last resort if talk page attempts fail. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 08:27, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Back to the original issue. I am not sure whether the same user is logged in and out to make the edits. It may be several like minded users, which is ok. There are now two IP based users, one is 67.180.110.244 and the current one is 152.131.10.133 each of which appear to track to different US locations. An article that is a case in point for the edits which keep removing the same template is <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Hoffman_a00e.html" title="Jim Hoffman">Jim Hoffman</a> whose history may be seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jim_Hoffman&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jim_Hoffman&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a>. One could argue that this is a content dispute with some justification. There is one set of editors that feels the template <a href="../../../9/1/1/Template%7E911ct.html" title="Template:911ct">Template:911ct</a> should be present and another that feels it shoudl be absent. But wikipedia is a vehicle of consensus, and I see no attempts to build a consensus except my own. My reason for raising this is to check if the same user is logging in and out and thus seeking to evade 3RR. If this is multiple users with a similar opinion that is very different, and valid, though reaching a consensus would be far better. I'd like to hand this to a knowledgable admin, please. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 00:14, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Its about time you had a weekend off, its all you ever seem to be doing(going on wikipedia)." This is an appalling, callous, personal attack? And people here are taking this seriously?

<dd>Each action on it's own may not justify a block, but those examples are all from the last couple days. This user has made no indication that he is willing to follow our civility policy as is evidenced by his removed warnings and previous blocks. The fact that the most recent incivility was moments after being asked to be more civil was the clincher. 4 days does not seem like a long time for a fourth civility block, this user already received a week long block for the same thing in December. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 17:08, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that any of the comments counts as genuine incivility (well, maybe one was slightly uncivil, and another was too brusque, but was a reaction to page-blanking). One hundred uncivil comments doesn't add up to incivility, though, no. Nor do one hundred slightly impatient comments, or even one hundred snappy but not really uncivil comments.

<dd>If I may add a little context... the reason the comments he made are rather incivil is that they follow immediately upon my note on my talk page that I was taking a little time to grieve over my grandfather's death.

<p>I've blocked this user twice in the past, for the diffs shown by FisherQueen. My primary concern is his targeting of FisherQueen. While the comment was certainly callous and insensitive, we do not block people for lack of manners. However, we do block people for continuing to harrass and stalk users, which is what I feel this was. I will continue keeping an eye on this user. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope"><b><font color="#3D59AB">Merope</font></b></a> 18:47, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yup. A textbook case of how a series of incivil comments that directed to another user in a different context might not be concerning, but here certainly count as disruption. Perhaps this indicates a less legalistic way forward after the PAIN deletion. That is, to take much more into account the reaction and desires of the user who is the target of the incivil comments. If they are iron-skinned veterans who are willing to brush it off, then no disruption has occurred, so no need for admin action.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>But the flipside is that users who are affected by incivil comments that perhaps for most people are not that severe, should also have the right to claim that such comments are disrupting their ability to edit the encyclopedia, and should be protected. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 19:41, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I see from reading the user page there are various cultural issues with the indian use of the name Aryan. However I still think the name needs to be changed because it the conclusion I've just made is a likely one for many western europeans to make.

<dd>Exactly. He keeps claiming that his name is Aryan and he lives in the 818 area code, but won't listen when it's explained to him that the two things put together are Nazi-speak. If he removed the 818, it wouldn't be <i>that</i> egregious, if he could explain that his name is Aryan, but the two together can't stand. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 19:03, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I suspect it could symbolise the victory of the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arianism.html" title="Arianism">Arian</a> belief that God has only one (1) nature over (0) the trinitarian view that he has 3 (father, son, holy spirit).--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 22:17, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As the word in parentheses hinted, "one nought three" sounds like "one, not three" -- one God (the Father), not three (the Trinity). <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arianism.html" title="Arianism">Arianism</a> was the losing side at the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Council_of_Nicea_56d6.html" title="First Council of Nicea">First Council of Nicea</a> (AD 325), and a theological ancestor of today's <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitarianism.html" title="Unitarianism">Unitarianism</a>.

<dd>It was a matter of heated controversy once -- literally "heated", since later Arians were burned at the stake as heretics -- but why should an expression of the minority view be any more a username violation than an expression of the majority view?

<dd>It just seems to me that there is a big can of worms being inserted into a can opener here. If (say) the Trinitarians were to object to each name that implied a heretical view, while the heretics <i>en bloc</i> objected to the names suggesting orthodoxy, would <i>all</i> those names have to change? Or would majority rule let all the big groups block all the smaller groups' names? <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CENSOR" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, but usernames clearly are -- is there a discrepancy here, or has it been explained somewhere I missed? -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 23:12, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Back to the user at hand. Assuming he agrees to change names, what are his options? Would "Aryan [lastname or initial]", possibly with the addition "in LA", be acceptable to everyone? Name not in all-caps, area code removed? Would <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> (or the presumption of innocence) extend that far? Or will there now be suspicion of any username he proposes that still includes "Aryan"? How much wiggle-room will he be allowed? Is this a matter still to be discussed on his talk page, or should this go to an RFC? And will all this be explained to him on his talk page? -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 23:36, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've not seen the policy that forces you to embed a phone code into your username. Why not use the post code?

<p>Regarding the recent debacle on <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818s</a> I hope that the following information I have provided was of use. Previously I have had some problems with this user on the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Talk%7EDravidian_people_ec0f.html" title="Talk:Dravidian people">Talk:Dravidian people</a> with his inexcusable behavior and intolerance. My first reaction when he posted such a message stating that "we do not exist" was to be calm and cool. I then diplomatically posted a message in regards to his post ending the message by offering him an "olive branch" and to work together. However, he was non-negotiable and continued with his rowdy intolerant behavior puting our culture down. I have asked for some advice with some other users and they have directed me to this page earlier to post reports on such activity. Also, I have posted some detailed discussions on his page.</p>
<p>If this user does get a different name, the question will be whether he will continue with his abusive, disruptive behavior. The <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian_people.html" title="Dravidian people">Dravidian people</a> need a lot of editing and work to be done on it, since there are other users on there vandalizing the page making it look like a propganda page. I know that this may sound petty, but it is hard having users like <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> vandalizing, and disrupting sites we are currently working on like <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian_people.html" title="Dravidian people">Dravidian people</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_people.html" title="Tamil people">Tamil people</a>.</p>
<p>It was mentioned that he does not belong to a hate group of a kind. However, Amongst the Indian community are many people of different ethnicities and religious backgrounds. User <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> has taken the privilage to put our Dravidian culture down and state that we do not exist. Furthermore there are others like him on Wikipedia who are on a "revising campaign" regarding anything that has to do with India, changing the history to suite their own cultural interest. This is very un-Wikipedian.</p>

<p>I recently blocked <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> for 3RR violations (more like 6RR) on two articles. After being blocked for 3RR, he started editing under his IP address. I blocked that IP address for 2 days, and saw that he was back under a new address. I have also blocked this address for a week. I am now upgrading the block on the user from 2 days to one week because he has been avoiding a block that he fully deserved. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 00:43, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe four days would have been sufficient (the extension being to encourage him to stop evading his block). The articles on which he has been revert-warring have been protected, meaning the additional lengthening would be more punitive than preventative. But a whole week isn't <i>excessive</i>, so I won't make a federal case out of it. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 01:16, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Prolific edit history, genuine commitment to Armenia-related topics. I don't see the need to go harsh. Consider give-and-take. I've reduced blocks for editors who've negotiated.

<dd>What's so prolific about his edit history? He hasn't done anything useful since he joined Wikipedia. In fact all he does now is wasting the time of several users and admins (just ask <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">User:Thanatosimii</a>). 90% of all his contributions have been reverted. He has been here several months, tons of users and several admins have tried to make him read the rules, particularly the five pillars and he still doesn't get it. I think the block is well justified and should have been done sooner.--<big><b><a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator"><font color="#00N510">Ευπάτωρ</font></a></b></big> <sup><small><a href="../../../e/u/p/User_talk%7EEupator_d1d3.html" title="User talk:Eupator"><font color="#974423">Talk!!</font></a></small></sup> 04:52, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, Tariq has retracted his statement, as Ararat has used two more IP addresses to edit under. I don't see any potential deal making any progress here. He was blocked for 3RR violations just four days ago, and yet he continued to violate even though he was well aware he would be blocked. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 04:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>All right then, no call for leniency. When this happens I caution the editor that longer blocks will be forthcoming from further evasion, then increase systematically and as soon as possible after each new infraction.

<p>Could an admin help me with this one. This article was written by Eugene Guth's son, User:Mikeguth. The article was based on Eugene Guth's home page. A copyvio notice was added. The editor removed it. I have been trying to help him. I put back the copyvio notice and after a lot of discussion, I wrote a brief stub which I put in <a href="../../../e/u/g/Talk%7EEugene_Guth_Temp_5453.html" title="Talk:Eugene Guth/Temp">Talk:Eugene Guth/Temp</a>. Could one of you please remove the copyvio notice and install this stub? Mike Guth appears to be the copyright owner of Eugene Guth's home page and is prepared to put it under the GNU license. Eugene Guth died in 1990. Mike is a newbie and has got quite angry, but I think he has calmed down and will now work constructively. A delay in getting the article stub up however is not helping him, so I am asking help here. I will keep an eye on him and the article. I have of course told him about <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 04:44, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone named "skull" (but with a userid of Rpsuguar ) has posted a pretty nasty attack on my personal talk page complete with racist language like "Jewish Khazar scum". He says he's sent the same screed to "another forum" asking his friends to edit the article he's mad about and also giving them the address for my user page. Can something be done about this? <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneral_Idea_8d7c.html" title="User:General Idea">General Idea</a> 05:09, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>here is what skull/Rpsugar posted on my talk page:</p>
<p>RON GOSTICK----</p>
<p>So "General", you choose to muckrake without discussion, because you are a kindred ideologue of Lethbridge's and apparently the "B'nai B'rith", not an encyclopaedist or NOT someone with no other agenda but truth and fairness. In otherwords... just a pure muckraking vandal...ala..David Lethbridge the lying Libeler (see the talk page if you know how to use it). I have posted this at another forum, because it is clear to me who you and Dimitroff are:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; How do you all feel about Communists and Socialists (same thing--just different tact: ultimate goal is the same--TOTAL GOVERNMENT)? I have a gaggle of them at Wikipedia attacking a page set up by who knows who on Ron Gostick. I checked out both the editors (since it hadn't been touched in a long time, until I brought it up in this room. I suspect who the culprit is that made the first edit to remove the "zio-comm" agitator David Lethbridge's Communism and his proven unabashed LYING in a court case against him for Libel. He was quoted as an "authority" from the Bethune Institute (which, if anyone knows anything about Bethune...he was a "Marxist"). Under the guise of fighting "Fascism and Racism (sic)", these "Jewish Khazar" scum in tandem with their brethren in the world of higher politics and money agitate and exploit all political and dishonest means to suppress Freedom of Speech and ultimately other freedoms. I allowed the Lethbridge statement stand only on the proviso that it be shown what his prejudice is...thus I created a link to a geocity site on the Libel case he unequivocally lost, the fact he ran as a Communist Party candidate with a statement to the effect he dissembled against others on Free Speech issues (this was throughout the Zundel-Keegstra and other heinous assaults on squelching speech that was not to "their' liking!).</p>
<p>If anyone is interested go to the page on Ron Gostick (someone is adding a lot of other names to Wikipedia to slander and muckrake!) These are two names that have edited just fairly recently....General Idea..his wikipage: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:General_Idea" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:General_Idea" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:General_Idea</a> and Dimitroff..his wikipage: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dimitroff" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dimitroff" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dimitroff</a>. In fact General Idea is there just as I write this to undo my edits. These people if you will look at their page are "Marxists". I have on my own page under rpsugar....the second to last edit of mine and on the Ron Gostick discussion page, I left the reference and link to David Lethbridge. If you want to help, and know how to use wiki.....go there and help subdue these packs of wolves. they Lie and connive like the devil (to use a term I dislike). Check it out!

<dd>First of all, <a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYarillastremenog_c48f.html" title="User:Yarillastremenog">Yarillastremenog</a> is a well-known sockpuppet that we are struggling to eradicate for a long time.

Please note that his is trying to hide his edits by marking all of them as <b>m</b> (minor). He had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Jeff_barnett" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Jeff_barnett" rel="nofollow">7 sockpuppets</a> at the last incident. It was stated at his page that he is <i>undefinitely banned</i>. I do not understand why the block does not work. As for his anti-Ukrainian contribituion you can see yourself - this is just one topic which is targeted. All NPOV. He does not provide references when requested having only one dubious yellow press article in his arsenal. As for absense of our discussion with him - this is not true. All is here: <a href="../../../u/k/r/Talk%7EUkrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II_dccf.html" title="Talk:Ukrainian-German collaboration during World War II">Talk:Ukrainian-German collaboration during World War II</a>.

<dd>To mix anti-Hindu remarks with a beg to unblock is akin to shooting yourself in the foot while you are bleeding profusely. While the other side is not faultless, it does not entitle Szhaider to conduct retributive actions. The idea of indef-blocking him will not be conducted (at least by me) without strong community consensus, and no consensus has emerged of yet. So no worries about the non-impending ban, but Szhaider has to change his attitude, by blocks if necessary. --<sup><a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhysicq210_4b59.html" title="User talk:Physicq210"><font color="#000000">210</font></a></sup><b><a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0" face="Comic Sans MS">physicq</font></a></b> (<i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Physicq210_25e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0">c</font></a></i>) 00:06, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think <a href="../../../s/z/h/User%7ESzhaider_2a97.html" title="User:Szhaider">Szhaider</a> may have reacted emotionally because he felt cornered and helpless. I will give you some evidence below. Admin <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> has been involved in edit-warring himself with Szhaider on the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Iqbal_2024.html" title="Muhammad Iqbal">Muhammad Iqbal</a> page. In this, <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakasuprman</a> have joined Rama's Arrow on what certainly <i>appears</i> to be a tag-team effort. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Iqbal&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Iqbal&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a> from Jan 4, 2007 onwards. Let me give you a little background. Iqbal was a famous poet of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_India_bca4.html" title="British India">British India</a> who died in 1930 before British India was divided into the independent nations of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. However, it was he who first proposed the idea of a nation for the Muslims of the subcontinent (which later became "Pakistan"); consequently, he a big national hero in Pakistan, as well as their national poet; not to mention that Iqbal alway lived in the part of British India that is now Pakistan. Rama's Arrow and Co. were fighting with Szhaider over how to "label" Iqbal in the first sentence, with the former group wanting to call him an "<a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian.html" title="Indian">Indian</a> Muslim poet" (where <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian.html" title="Indian">Indian</a> is a disambiguation page whose first link is <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_India_d1b0.html" title="Republic of India">Republic of India</a>, a country that Iqbal most certainly <i>didn't</i> belong to) and Szhaider wanting to call him a "Muslim poet of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>" (where the subcontinent includes both India and Pakistan, <i>i.e.</i> the lands of British India). From my perspective (as a neutral observer as well as someone who has co-written the current lead for the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_India_d1b0.html" title="Republic of India">Republic of India</a> page), Szhaider's characterization is more accurate. Please now look at Szhaider's [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Iqbal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98573656" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Iqbal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98573656" rel="nofollow">edit1</a>], followed by Rama's Arrow's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Iqbal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98850071" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Iqbal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=98850071" rel="nofollow">reversal</a> with edit summary "rvv POV". Whatever Szhaider is doing, it is not vandalism (and hardly POV). That Rama's Arrow is aware that he is edit-warring is clear from his characterizing his "rv" as "fx link" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Iqbal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=99204962" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Iqbal&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=99204962" rel="nofollow">here</a> to avoid a potential 3RR violation. Admittedly Szhaider is less savvy about using "NPOV" sounding language, but he is no more a vandal than the "tag team" is.</p>
<p>I feel that Rama's Arrow has violated his administrator's privilege by issuing a 1-week ban of an editor he himself was edit-warring with, especially in a situation where, to a neutral party like me, it is not at all clear (at least on the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Iqbal_2024.html" title="Muhammad Iqbal">Muhammad Iqbal</a> page) which party was more at fault.</p>
<p>Szhaider should be given a warning, but he should be unblocked after 24 hours. Alternately both Rama's Arrow and Rumpelstiltskin223 should be blocked for a week. I have myself battled Szhaider on various pages, but I think he is getting a raw deal and, concurrently, Rama's Arrow and Rumpelstiltskin223 are getting away scot-free.

<dd>He has been adequately warned by many editors. I know that the Indian-Pakistani conflicts on Wikipedia are often tense, but it is not a "get-out-of-jail-free" ticket. Nothing justifies his behavior. And considering that he had been blocked once before, I'm sure he knows that his current behavior is not appreciated by the community as a whole. I don't condone the incivility others may have perpetrated at Szhaider, but there is a point where you just have to cool down, take a break, grow a thicker skin, swallow your anger, and go edit somewhere else. I'm already willing to drop the indef-block suggestion if he would only change his behavior. --<sup><a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhysicq210_4b59.html" title="User talk:Physicq210"><font color="#000000">210</font></a></sup><b><a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhysicq210_ccba.html" title="User:Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0" face="Comic Sans MS">physicq</font></a></b> (<i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Physicq210_25e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Physicq210"><font color="#0000C0">c</font></a></i>) 03:36, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rama's Arrow has now increased the block to 3-weeks (for Szhaider's trying to edit from an IP address). Even though Szhaider is at fault, I don't think this rapid escalation of punishment is going to help, especially by an admin who should have recused himself from such action. <a href="../../../f/o/w/User%7EFowler%26fowler_e6e1.html" title="User:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#B8860B">Fowler&amp;fowler</font></a><a href="../../../f/o/w/User_talk%7EFowler%26fowler_5ef0.html" title="User talk:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#708090">«Talk»</font></a> 04:22, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not defending Szhaider (or his IP mischief), but I still think the punishment will be more effective if it is served in controlled doses, rather than in this summarily snowballing fashion. As for your example of Szhaider's incivility after he came out of his week-long block, which was an exchange with me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taxila&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taxila&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a>, it's funny, but I didn't think he was particularly uncivil! It was a vigorous exchange to be sure, but I didn't lose any sleep over it. The issue was resolved satisfactorily on the <a href="../../../t/a/x/Talk%7ETaxila_532c.html#Sanskrit_or_Indianization.3F" title="Talk:Taxila">Taxila talk page</a>. I am just very uncomfortable that an Indian admin, Rama's Arrow, (without posting a notice here), has blocked 3 Pakistani users for edit-warring and incivility, when he himself has been stoking the flames of the fire (at least on the <a href="../../../i/q/b/Iqbal.html" title="Iqbal">Iqbal</a> page). <a href="../../../f/o/w/User%7EFowler%26fowler_e6e1.html" title="User:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#B8860B">Fowler&amp;fowler</font></a><a href="../../../f/o/w/User_talk%7EFowler%26fowler_5ef0.html" title="User talk:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#708090">«Talk»</font></a> 07:11, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

What does that have to do with what we are discussing here: whether an admin, Rama's Arrow, who had a history of edit-warring with Szhaider, has perhaps over-reacted?

Certainly if bureaucrat <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp</a>—someone with great experience in India-related matters—felt that the first 1-week block was "a little too harsh and a 48 hour block should have sufficed," and that "Ideally, as a party involved, RA (Rama's Arrow) should have raised the issue on WP:ANI." (see <a href="../../../f/o/w/User_talk%7EFowler%26fowler_5ef0.html#re:Blocks" title="User talk:Fowler&amp;fowler">here</a>), we are well within the pale of reason to ask if Rama's Arrow has indeed over-reacted.

<td>I have been unnecessarily kind to many people not complaining about them when I was personally attacked. It's time to report them. A copy of this email will be sent to at least 4 other admins. And if you decide to unblock me permanently, before doing so, take a look at my contibutions compared to those of who have complained and warred against me and see for yourself who desrves permanent ban.
<p>Complaint 1</p>
<p>At <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Anti-Hindu_remarks" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Anti-Hindu_remarks" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Anti-Hindu_remarks</a> User:Rumpelstiltskin223 has specifically insulted me by calling me Islamic Fundamentalist although my disagreements are of political nature. By using the terminology of Islamic Fundamentalist he has also insulted all Muslims of Pakistan in general.</p>
<p>Complaint 2</p>
<p>At <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Szhaider#Family_History" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Szhaider#Family_History" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Szhaider#Family_History</a> User:Baloch Victory called my ancestors Hindu and Kaffirs. I was offended by both specially by the term of Kaffirs which is insulting even for non-Muslims. It should be noted that it was one of his very first edits at Wikipedia. However, at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Baloch_Victory" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Baloch_Victory" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Baloch_Victory</a> User:Bakasuprman encouraged him by welcoming him and changing the standard welcome message with more encouraging words i.e. "We can't say that loudly enough!"</p>
<p>Complaint 3</p>
<p>At <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Szhaider#Ignorant_Behaviour" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Szhaider#Ignorant_Behaviour" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Szhaider#Ignorant_Behaviour</a> User:Abulfazl committed his first personal attack against me where instead of discussing the differences, he insulted me; and look at my reply how calm it was.</p>
<p>Complaint 4</p>
<p>In the summary of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Mohsin_Mighiana&amp;diff=97102709&amp;oldid=96902583" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Mohsin_Mighiana&amp;diff=97102709&amp;oldid=96902583" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Mohsin_Mighiana&amp;diff=97102709&amp;oldid=96902583</a> he left this message: "There exists no college named Faisalabad tum chootiey aadmi ho szhaider ya tumhari gand men bohat bara keera hai"</p>
<p>"tum chootiey aadmi ho szhaider ya tumhari gand men bohat bara keera hai" is transliteration of an Urdu sentence which translates into English literally: "You are a small man szhaider or you have a big insect in your anus"</p>
<p>You decide if it is insulting or not. My response was in the summary of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Mohsin_Mighiana&amp;diff=97371126&amp;oldid=97370682" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Mohsin_Mighiana&amp;diff=97371126&amp;oldid=97370682" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Mohsin_Mighiana&amp;diff=97371126&amp;oldid=97370682</a></p>
<p>I think my mostly silent and often polite responses to personal attacks should be given some credit.</p>
<p>The usage of word of "accused" (as User:Rumpelstiltskin223 has pointed out) on my userpage was not deliberate or thought through as I wanted to put ahead a message to User:Bakasuperman who had encouraged User:Baloch Victory who had insulted me. I would have removed the said sentence if I were even warned. I do not like anybody editing my userpage except for neutral admins (who never have had any edit-war with me). I reverted the userpage because User:Rumpelstiltskin223 edited it without asking me to remove the said sentence. He should have asked me to remove it. I had no solid reason to keep it if I were asked to remove it.</p>
<p>I think it is fair enough to ask for unblock after the above explaination. Please unblock me. I will restrict myself to minor edits (spelling mistakes, repeated words etc. which I can not resist editing) for some days in order to avoid any edit-wars or graver differences. I am compiling a list of suggestions regarding edit-wars of political nature. I would like to share them with all admins and other users.</p>
<p>I'll be waiting for a response.</p>

<p>I'm finding it very difficult to take what Fowler is saying in good faith. Here we have a clearcut example of inflammatory and incivil statements made by <a href="../../../s/z/h/User%7ESzhaider_2a97.html" title="User:Szhaider">User:Szhaider</a> and his IP's, and Fowler is questioning the wisdom of the block, even going so far as to claim that it is punitive because of disagreements over an article? Szhaider's actions were clearly egregious and everyone contributing to this thread has agreed. I suggest that Fowler give this up, because I sure can't figure out why he's trying to vilify Rama's Arrow for a good administrative action -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b> <small>धर्म</small></a> 06:34, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Notice that I did not say that he was an Islamic Fundamentalist, merely that this is a view commonly held by Islamic Fundamentalists. Commonly is not the same as exclusively so his claim that I was calling him one is baseless, as is his rather hysterical claim that I am somehow "insulting all Muslims of Pakistan" since the word "Pakistan" was not even mentioned in the sentence in question. There are Muslims all over South Asia. Thus, there is no insult here but the one that Szhaider perceives or infers, and his perceptions and inferences are not my problem, or that of all wikipedia people, for that matter. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 07:10, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would only like to reiterate that I have never, ever sought to engage in the kind of behavior Fowler accuses me of doing. It is plainly wrong (and were this not a lucid discussion on ANI, even insulting) to suggest that I was trying to supress Pakistani editors.

I had already expressed a desire to recuse, but when it became obvious that Szhaider was being disruptive over several policies and articles, it was clear to me that a block was necessary. I respect the tradition of recusing, but I can't say I was wrong to block Szhaider in the first place. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>Rama's arrow (3:16)</b></font></a> 17:56, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Blatant lying and personal attacks" is a complete misrepresentation and thus incivil. If one of the print authors concerned is also one of the WP editors, then WP:NOR is being violated. If not, I was making a statement that has nothing to do with civility. "disconnect himself from reality"; hmmm, that is very civil, I suppose? I was not "refusing to consider them actual sources" but rather questioning the context in which the title of the article in question occurred; however, I do question the validity and motivation of most such works. If anyone would bother to look at the whole flow, it would be clear that my claim that most points I made were simply ignored is true. The persistent ignoring and condescension certainly appear to have been intended as incivility or even goading from this perspective.<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFasterPussycatWooHoo_b42d.html" title="User:FasterPussycatWooHoo">FasterPussycatWooHoo</a> 14:59, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"assault" is very strong language; there are lots of other instances of very strong language directed this way above. This seems to be not the first time that people have tried to *ahem* I don't know how to say it without the fear that the people concerned will misrepresent and exaggerate things. The sequence is a mystery to me, apart from the initial warning, since which I have been careful to stay civil. I haven't really been informed about what is going on; and I certainly didn't use incivil language regarding other editors except on the one occasion mentioned above (which is cited and misrepresented to give the appearance that it was part of a sequence). The efforts made to improve the article (which I still maintain is under a misnomer and adequately covered elsewhere) are larger due to my initial comments; that is neither a lie nor an instance of incivility, and will be borne out by a quick inspection of the history. One key assumption here seems to be that a 'lone editor' necessarily deserves no understanding, support, or respect. Sorry, I think that using external media to muster support etc. is a little cheap and appears to have been going on here. We could probably do with more editors that don't see WP primarily as a social network or political game.</dd>

<dd>I felt the use of the term "dick" was appropriate within context, since the essay to which I was linking is entitled "Don't be a dick". If it were "Don't be a &lt;something else&gt;", I would've used a different term.

<li>Several recent debates at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a> have veered away from purely examing usernames on a case-by-case basis, this is unfortunately where this one led.. I removed the discussion in question on sight, and hopefully Kaldari has realized this is not the purpose of the RfC/N board, or an ideal standard of conduct for admins. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 06:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>My point has been made and I will drop the issue. My RFCN was not intended to be disruptive or frivilous, it was intended to be a legitimate discussion about Hit bull win steak's username and how it relates to how people interpret our username policy. We seem to be extremely sensitive to certain religious sensibilities (to the point of absurdity) while ignoring others completely. As a Hindu (albeit non-practicing) and a lifelong vegetarian, I legitimately find Hit bull win steak's username offensive, and I'm sure I'm not the only person who does. However, I don't think offensiveness should be a black and white criteria for banning usernames, especially since the way we judge offensiveness seem to have an extremely western bias. I apologize for any disruption and I hope that we can return to productive dialog on the issue. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 16:52, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There's no good interpretation. If it isn't block evasion then it's malicious impersonation of another user by posting an announcement to violate policy in the first person on the other userpage.
