<dd><b>Anyone can go there and see that the admin JzG was the one in violation, but apparently because he was himself partisan in the discussion, he used his powers of blocking to make himself feel right. You don't even have to know the issues to see it there. My explanation fell on deaf ears and I got blocked. The article was in <i>status quo</i> when I came there on April 30th. The discussion was still going after 11 days and JzG edited the article ON THE VERY POINT OF DISPUTE, making a edit of what was well-accepted even all the way back to January. JzG, as an admin, does not know the simple rules and is abusing his powers as an admin. It is like a citizen who points a gun at a robber, and the police take away the citizen. Any admin should know that in an RV skirmish, the person who FIRST makes the violation, is the ONLY one who violates the 3RR rule, NOT the citizen who is RVING to correct the violation. I got blocked as that citizen. Incidentally, JzG put in an RFC at the beginning of that discussion. And his summary in the RFC shows that he didn't even understand what the objective of the discussion was about, which may be the reason why he later violated by editing the article out of step with the discussion.</b> (<a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDiligens_001c.html" title="User:Diligens">Diligens</a> 12:04, 12 May 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>It wasn't a warning for vandalism, it was allegedly for 3RR, and the policy says <i>"may"</i>, it does not say it always is. More importantly, the admin violated policy of 3RR because the policy says, <i>"an administrator should not block users for 3RR if they themselves have reverted that user's edits on that page"</i>. JzG was involved in the discussion, and after 9 days of arguing he made an edit that pertained <b>directly</b> to what had not be decided yet. Not only did he violate what I just quoted from 3RR policy, but he violated the process of discussion by choosing to edit according to his side when the discussion was not complete. (How much a person gets "worked up" has nothing to do with it, either an issue is valid or it is not.)

<p>Would somebody here be able to mentor Johnleemk? As the result of an arbitration case, he posted these words on a talk page: "Lou_franklin is banned from editing this article... The user is <b>not</b> prevented from discussing or proposing changes on this talk page." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASocietal_attitudes_towards_homosexuality&amp;diff=51851563&amp;oldid=51758586" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASocietal_attitudes_towards_homosexuality&amp;diff=51851563&amp;oldid=51758586" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Since it explicitly said "The user is <b>not</b> prevented from discussing or proposing changes", I did. As a result he blocked me for 48 hours! He apparently made a mistake posting the wording because he changed it to "the user <b>is</b> prevented" after he blocked me. Obviously since the talk page said I am "not prevented from discussing or proposing changes", it is not appropriate to ban me for doing so!</p>
<p>Other users <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Lou_franklin#Blocked" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Lou_franklin#Blocked" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> suggested to him that he "ask for clarification at the relevant ArbCom page" and "I think it is advisable to ask clarification" and "since the template was misleading, the block should probably be lifted", but he flatly refused saying "there is nothing to clarify... Specific rulings overrule a general template." I asked him to post a link to the Wikipedia policy that states that. He could not provide one, and responded by saying "you should know better than to rely on a general template".</p>
<p>This admin is making up rules as he goes. If an admin posts that it's OK for a user to add to the discussion, it's really not reasonable for the same admin to block the user for doing so.

That Johnleemk put up the wrong template is regrettable, but the arbcom findings, in my view, overrule minor procedural errors like that. You need to stay out of that article AND its talk page, indefinitely. It would also be helpful if you didn't post long rants about the sad decline of Wikipedia on the talk pages of all and sundry, but we can't have everything.

<p>Jurisprudence has a concept called conflict of laws.</p>
<p>I've noticed that this concept and some other legal concepts are not well understood in wikipedia, including by arbcom. But that is to be expected in a young project and one which inevitbably reflects the power of appointing members to arbcom. Nonetheless, in this case, and even if Lou is gaming the system, the rule of law should be respected and applied.</p>
<p>Since I'm a legal positivist in my thinking and training I argue that the law is applied to suit the outcome desired by those making the decision. It would be better though, in this case, to give the benefit of the doubt. The 48 hour block was thus unjustified.</p>
<p>As to the 7 day block. Excessive. Homo is derogatory, yes but not as derogatory as some words. Lou should be unblocked and templates should be improved.</p>
<p>To put the matter beyond doubt, my comments should not be read in any way for support of his views. <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccready_a493.html" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a> 17:14, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_Laws_8706.html" title="Conflict of Laws">Conflict of Laws</a> occurs when two different nations have different laws, that contradict each other.

<dd>Sorry, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a micronation. We don't make laws; we make policies and principles and expect editors to use their common sense instead of lawyer their way out of trouble. Also, I find this emphasis on the homo thing strange; to me, it was secondary to the massive bad faith Lou placed in his post to Jimbo's talk. As the arbitration committee insisted that special attention be paid to bad faith, and in light of Lou's recent violation of his article ban (I've already explained on his talk why he can't use the template as an excuse), the 7 day block is justified. (Even if it wasn't and we want to hew to policy, bear in mind that the arbitration committee set the maximum block at 7 days -- if Lou even slightly deviates from what he's supposed to do, any admin can wham him as hard as they like provided the block does not exceed 1 week. I was lenient with Lou the first time, so the second time round...) <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 18:29, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Call it what you will (law, rule, principle, policy, guideline, "spirit not the letter", norm etc), in the last analysis you have a system of power where some are more powerful than others, yet WP is still a normative community and that means "laws". Whether you interpret them as black letter law or as spirit, as a positivist, I say the outcome is identical. And in any normative community unless you have consistency and justice, unless you temper power with good judgement and impartiality you will undermine the community. John, your block edit of a week only mentioned "homophobic epithet", not the display of bad faith which I agree was deserving of a block even allowing for rhetoric. I'm still inclined to think the penalty on the harsh side. "Wham him as hard as they like" might not be the attitude to enourage a reformed editor. And by the way, conflict of laws doesn't only apply to nations, Kim. If I understand the norms here correctly, would it be possible for John to express willingness for another admin, someone less closely involved, to remake the decision? <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccready_a493.html" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a> 19:15, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't recall using either "homophobic" or "epithet" at all where Lou was involved. I can't remember the last time I used the word "homophobic" (probably in some off-Wikipedia irrelevant debate about homosexuality), and the last time I used "epithet" was in literature class. My summary for the block only referred to a violation of the personal attack parole, and my message to Lou focused on bad faith with the "homo" comment added as a finishing touch. The basis of the block was never the "homo" comment, and certainly never was "homophobic epithet". <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 19:31, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The legal jargon leaves me cold. Lou violated two of the conditions set by ArbCom, received a week's block (John referred to this as "the full one week", personally I would have thought the maximum was two weeks for two violations) and consensus is behind the blocking admin's interpretation. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:09, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>John, it appears you may be in error here. The system records you as using the phrase "homophobic epithet" in the edit summary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Arbitration_enforcement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52519382" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Arbitration_enforcement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52519382" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Could someone else have had access to your logon? Sam, what I meant to say is whether you apply "law" or "spirit of law" the outcome is identical. As a relatively new user I'd appreciate an answer to my question as to whether WP culture permits John to step back and allow someone else to remake the decision? <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccready_a493.html" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a> 04:17, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No other admin -- not one -- has disgreed with his decision, and every one of them has the ability to override it.

<dd>Uh...the title of the section I was editing was "<a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_franklin_89f1.html" title="User:Lou franklin">User:Lou franklin</a> and homophobic epithet". I did not use the word "homophobic epithet"; the complainant (Cleduc) did. (My edit summary for this edit will be "<i>Conflict of laws</i>" because that's the title of this section, but I'm certainly not using that phrase at all.) My rationale for the block has been clearly stated, and the "homophobic epithet" did not form the bulk of its basis. Anyhow, WP culture discourages <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wikipedia%7EWheel_warring_5f5d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wheel warring">wheel warring</a> unless there's consensus that the admin just went bonkers. There's consensus that I didn't go bonkers, and asking someone else to undo my block and then redo it is just process wonkery. (Incidentally, someone else did block Lou after it turned out my 1-week block didn't take effect, so your request has already been fulfilled in a sense.) <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:08, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At the beginning of last month, an anonymous user posted links to a website which attacks some of the editors on the Christianity article. The website, which I looked at at the time, was certainly an attack site, and was based on the deleted user page of User:John1838, but it did not have real names or photos. On 13 April, John reappeared as <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimplePilgrim_2f56.html" title="User:SimplePilgrim">User:SimplePilgrim</a>, and posted several more links. At this stage, the website had KHM03's photo, his real name, and a link to his website which gave information about his location, his wife, his family, etc. SimplePilgrim was reverted by SOPHIA, and a new user (with obvious connection to a user who has violated <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> more than once in the past) began to follow her around and repost the link. He was blocked indefinitely by an admin, and another admin almost simultaneously blocked for a month. SimplePilgrim was also blocked for a month.</p>
<p>KHM03 left Wikipedia as a result. Creepy messages were sent to his talk page, mentioning his wife, children, and dog by name. In addition, a very inappropriate e-mail was sent to his superior.</p>
<p>The background is long and complicated, and I don't want to clog up this noticeboard. So I have written an account <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_Easter_019c.html" title="User:Musical Linguist/Easter">here</a> of the events that led to these Easter blocks. The blocks are due to expire very soon, and I would like some other admins to review them with a view to making them indefinite.

<p>You are referring to my edit to [[matsuri]. What I did was remove an inappropriate html table of links that you added to an already link-heavy article. There were 14 external links in the article, and nine of them were in your table. You have been told many times that Wikipedia is not a link farm. Please notice that after you reverted my edit, an administrator immediately wiped out all of your links as well as several of the others. Your edits to matsuri are inappropriate to Wikipedia. One doesn't have to know anything about matsuri to see that or to correct it. Fnarf999 17:33, 12 May 2006 (UTC)<br />

<dd>Over the last few days several editors have pointed out to <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkidd_dublin_1e95.html" title="User:Akidd dublin">Akidd dublin</a> that many of his edits are impossible to understand due to english not being his native language. Generally that wouldn't be a problem, slightly unusally phrasing or minor grammar/spelling errors are easily fixed, but Akidd dublin's edit's, while well meaning, are often at the level of being completely impossible to understand. His contributions to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Static_random_access_memory.html" title="Static random access memory">Static random access memory</a>, for example, were reversed by two different editors as "unintelligible" and "poorly worded and hard to understand". Many people have pointed the problems that his difficulty with english is causing (See his talk page for some of the many comments) <a href="../../../f/n/a/User%7EFnarf999_8dfc.html" title="User:Fnarf999">User:Fnarf999</a> was just one of many, but <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkidd_dublin_1e95.html" title="User:Akidd dublin">Akidd dublin</a> responded by changing words in his comments<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAkidd_dublin&amp;diff=52833065&amp;oldid=52826111" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAkidd_dublin&amp;diff=52833065&amp;oldid=52826111" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, for which he was warned by <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">User:Yamla</a>. Since then there has been <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-05-10_Low_quality_edits_by_user_with_poor_English_skills_f5ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-05-10 Low quality edits by user with poor English skills">mediation</a>, and prior to this comment on the incident board, Akidd dublin also posted on the villiage pump<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28miscellaneous%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52880632" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28miscellaneous%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52880632" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> in a similar manner. Akidd dublin has also selectively archived comments on his talk page, and from reading his replies, I don't think he realises how much difficultly his edits are causing. He also has a tendency to add content which is unrelated, except by very tenious links (e.g. adding a link to a film site (rottentomatos) into Red Hair, because tomato is a nickname for red hair, or to Yahoo groups, because they have red haired avatars there. Nothing which is vandalism, but quite fustrating for those trying to fix these issues as communication with him is proving very difficult, as his talk page shows! It's also not helpful that he won't tell us what his native language is, which could be of use to try and understand what he is saying, because quite frankly, I don't understand what he means most of the time, and it's this quality of english that he insists on adding to wikipedia. (he's also created a new account, <a href="../../../y/y/-/User%7EYy-bo_c77b.html" title="User:Yy-bo">User:Yy-bo</a>, which has only made a few edits recently.

<dd>Thanks very much, Martin. The only bit I understood was the far-fetched accusation of racism, which I can't say prediposed me in favor of the usefulness of this editor.

<dl>
<dd>The thought had crossed my mind also, Zoe, but my gut feeling is that he is not. I may be proven wrong, but until then, I'll assume good faith. That leaves me with a dilema, I would like to keep an eye on his contributions so if he adds something that doesn't make sense I can ask him to clarify and/or fix the grammar myself. However, I want to do that as a good faith measure to try and ensure articles remain understandable, and also help him edit better, and not in a wikistalking way, so I want to get a general opinion on whether actions like these would be accepatable before I go any further. For example, he has just edited <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superstition.html" title="Superstition">Superstition</a> and I have made some grammar fixes, and requested on the talk page to explain what he meant by "Urban legends, which are not scientifically prooved (justification) are put into correlation(s) which do no exist in physical, visible reality.", which I believe is a reasonable enough request. I think I get the vague idea behind the sentence, urban legends and superstition are somewhat related, but I haven't enough to work on to try and fix the grammar. Unfortunately many of his edits are like this, close enough to the subject to believe he's in good faith, but written in such a way that it's difficult, if not impossible to work with.</dd>
<dd>Does my idea seem okay, or are there any other suggestions on the best way to progress on this matter? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 13:32, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I would worry that watching his contributions on any article he edited could be seen as provocative, no matter how justified it might be in this case. I think I would tend to wait a day or so and see if anyone else has the article on their watch list and fixes it without your intervention. Wikipedia can bear with 24 hours of bad english in a few articles. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:44, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It appears that the user has abandoned his account and will take up editing under a new user name (as it is entirely permissible); I'm sure someone will alert AN/I should his new account make edits of similar quality and talk page discussions of similar disruption. It's rather difficult to determine if the user is trolling, I think; so many of his talk page contributions are necessarily ironic and altogether funny, and they often seem to be from a native English speaker affecting (jocularly) the writing style of a non-native speaker (as in <i>I do not spell grammatically incorrect sentences within articles. If anyway think I do, then make it three-line (if possible)</i> [I assume the latter portion to mean that he does not want verbose comments to his talk page, which surely would be consistent with his not being familiar with English]; <i>I do not harass terms, just funny things</i>; and, <i>My new articles are not full of mistakes, neither they spell completely wrong grammar. I have abandoned this account. I found it ridicioulus: there was annoying information (article:red hair). It was removed. I was accused then of spelling wrong sentences. It does not have to be in usage by anyone (i.e. "Please understand it forehand"). It sounds better than: "You have been warned". It is not impossible to understand this writing</i>). One hopes, though, that if the user was trolling, he'll use his new account for good; if he wasn't, one hopes that he'll seek to improve his English (at least for the purposes of editing here) or partake of a Wikipedia with the language of which he's more conversant. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:05, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you sure you're the Dark Lord, Lord Voldemort? Last I checked, there was someone very pale and stealing Christmas claiming to be the true evil person. Oh, wait... never mind. It seems like some kind of lion has taken care of that.

<li>In fact, the singer <a href="../../../m/o/m/Momus.html" title="Momus">Momus</a> declared that, on MySpace, there was an imposter who had done a whole user profile and posted a song that Momus himself had deleted, and now, he says, there are all these people who "know" him that he's never met. The faux Momus was apparently a devoted fan. That said, there are several persons named John Wayne, Valerie Plame and the like. The account name <i>per se</i> shouldn't be an impersonation. Impersonation is more than a name: it's a behavior. Since, as I hope we settled before, Wikipedia takes no account, gives no credence, to real life identities (doesn't have "expert editors" and the like), a person claiming to be Karl Rove would be just another editor, I hope. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:52, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive99_8b59.html" title="Edit section: User:Wallie">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">User:Wallie</span></h2>
<p>I have been concerned over this user's edits on New Zealand related articles for the last week or two. Today I posted an accusation of trolling on <a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWallie_7a44.html" title="User talk:Wallie">his talk page</a>, and he vigorously objected to the accusation. The fullest version of his reply is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGadfium&amp;diff=53046800&amp;oldid=52969360" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGadfium&amp;diff=53046800&amp;oldid=52969360" rel="nofollow">on my talk page</a>.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, he made the following edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Howard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53067236" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Howard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53067236" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. Take a look at the source; it contradicts the edit.</p>
<p>Looking at some of his earlier edits, I find these: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foreign_relations_of_New_Zealand&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23213909" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foreign_relations_of_New_Zealand&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23213909" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foreign_relations_of_New_Zealand&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23216545" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foreign_relations_of_New_Zealand&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23216545" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> In the first, he says New Zealand has always had excellent relations with France, yet the relationship has been strained over both French nuclear testing in the Pacific and the Rainbow Warrior sinking. Why would anyone add such a paragraph if they were ignorant of these events? In the second, he says NZ felt abandoned by Canada, yet clearly it was Britain that NZ was looking to.

<dd>What are you saying? Just change the article(s), if you know something I don't. Don't go into all this bureaucracy. As you say, this is not a dispute between you and I. If you disagree with anything I say, you are free to change it. Please put in what you think, in any foreign relations area, or anything else. You can always discuss content with me. You certainly don't need an RFC or arbcom. What for? Who are you arbitrating against? Yourself?

<dd>Regarding the article I changed on John Howard, the source does not contradict the "Honest John" statement. There is some editorial comment that does though. I was referring to the public perception, and giving a source to back it up. He is known as "Honest John" is Australia... Gadfium, we cannot get things perfect first time every time we make an edit. Some Australian editors have aleady taken me on about these edits. That's OK. These articles "evolve" over time.

<p>Not wanting to get into this, but, since I accidentally did, you could consider a content RFC rather than a conduct RFC. Often enough, people who haven't been editing will take a stand and help settle content disputes there. Beyond that, if Wallie is demonstrably having editing trouble, where his meaning isn't clear and the two of you are therefore in dispute, it might be a mentoring situation. Surely there can be <i>some way</i> of working these things out harmoniously, as it sounds like you're both interested in helping the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:45, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I largely see Wallie's edits as being in good faith and for trying to sort things out. I've recommended that Wallie use the talkpage to propose major edits before doing them, which may help to calm the situation. --<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidnighttonight_662c.html" title="User:Midnighttonight">Midnight</a><a href="../../../m/i/d/User_talk%7EMidnighttonight_d19a.html" title="User talk:Midnighttonight">tonight</a> 01:44, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I stumbled upon this article a few months ago. The original article was probably written by people who collect prank calls to his show and was very derisive. I wrote a new version of it, based on the facts in George's own homepage. Now there is a big edit war going on, anon user claiming to be George has posted on the talk page and removed parts of the article, his edits however, have been reverted by an other user. The comments on the talk page hint a bit towards legal action. I would also like to hear if you think this article is even notable enough and how much the article should concentrate on the prank calls. <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapinmies_aa85.html" title="User:Lapinmies">Lapinmies</a> 08:42, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bhadani, whether you are shocked or not is your business, but since your attentions are clearly unwelcome, perhaps you could keep them to yourself? Also, it's not your business to try to enforce your interpretation of Indian law; if you think that Anwar is acting illegally, take it to the Foundation's lawyers. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenry_Flower_de0f.html" title="User:Henry Flower">Henry</a><a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenry_Flower_b54b.html" title="User talk:Henry Flower"><sup>Flower</sup></a> 17:48, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As far as I'm concerned telling someone that they may be accused of treason is, if not a legal threat, at least deeply uncivil and provocative. I would suggest, Bhadani, that you keep your 'friendly advice' to yourself if this is the form it takes. And whether Anwar drinks alcohol is, frankly, none of your business as a Wikipedia editor either. I don't see it as particularly shocking, no more than a Christian saying he's gay, for example. The concern about whether Wikipedia could be blocked in India I have addressed as a reply to Bhadani's post on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28miscellaneous%29_ea61.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)">Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)</a>, as I feel it is more appropriate there. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 17:57, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My reply to <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenry_Flower_de0f.html" title="User:Henry Flower">Henry</a>: my intentions are not unwelcome, I was really shocked and so I expressed them to his talk pag. As regards assertions on the user page, I would like to draw the attention to a proclamation on the <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a>'s page. Moreover, I have already raised the issue at the village pump. I am not trying to enforce the interpretation of India law, I was trying to expalin to him the exact legal position and the difficulties in which he may find himself, in case, he is a citizen of India. At the same time, I was explaining about the possibility of an Indian citizen taking the mattter to the Indian Court based on such proclamation. It may not count much to non-Indians, but even a thought of a distinct possibility of denial of access of wikipedia to Indians like me shall mattter much. I have placed the position for the information of community, and if the community so feels, the matter may be taken to the Foundation's lawyers. Your interpretation that my intentions are unwelcome is wrong, as I am acting in the best interest of the Wikipedia; and stating the factual position.

<dd>Whilst I totally think you were trying to be helpful, it can't be true that your intentions were welcome- if they were welcome you wouldn't find this report here on ANI.

<dd>It is surely evident that Wikipedia would not be legally culpable were Anwar's comments indeed in contravention of Indian law (even as I don't think they are), and so Bhadani's decision to inform Anwar as to potential problems arising from his comments was certainly not one he was compelled as an admin totake; notwithstanding Bhadani's evident good faith, he should have known that Anwar's statements of views--divisiveness aside--in no way legally imperil Wikipedia. At the very least, were his intention (as I think it was) simply to apprise Anwar in order that Anwar shouldn't face legal troubles, he ought to have done so much more decorously. The drinking comment was rather untoward, I think, inasmuch as it didn't seem as much a genuine expression of surprise as an intimation of Anwar's being a <i>bad Muslim</i>; I'm certain that such sense wasn't intended, but it was nevertheless present. I had occasion recently to meet a user who, like I, is a member of <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a> but who advocated on his user page certain positions inconsistent with such membership. I queried him on his talk page about the conflation but made clear (a) that he oughtn't to infer any normative assessment (that my question was one of genuine interest) and (b) that he should feel under no obligation to answer what was surely an untoward (or at least unduly personal) question. A productive discussion ensued, and I found someone with whom I look forward to collaborating on encyclopedic content in the future. Certainly every Wikipedian has written here things of which we later think better, but Bhadani would do well to apologize and watch his comments a bit more carefully. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:38, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bhadani, however much he may protest otherwise, is indeed engaging in legal threats. I would support an RFArb over this issue, as I have supported others in the past. However, if Bhadani is willing to apologize and promise to not do it again, let it drop. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 18:14, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can agree that it wasn't a very tactful thing to say, and Bhadani should let the matter drop without pursuing it further (and be careful about saying similar things in future) but a RfAr would be totally over the top. This was clearly a good faith attempt to warn someone of a (perceived) potential problem. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 18:36, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding the self-proclaimed Muslim who drinks alcohol, this doesn't particularly shock me; there are many people in the world who style themselves adherents of some religion or other while disobeying or disagreeing with some of the rules or precepts of that religion, such as Catholics who use birth control. Such matters are between them, their church/mosque/temple's authorities, and their deity, and are not Wikipedia's business to enforce or get shocked or offended by. Neither is it Wikipedia's business to enforce the laws of different countries regarding what sorts of speech or opinions are lawful; if the Wikimedia legal department sees a legitimate legal risk they might take action based on it, but otherwise our normal NPOV standards apply and no position is taken one way or the other on political conflicts. (Where the matter concerns userbox statements, as this one does, it's yet another example of the divisiveness and distractiveness of those darned things.) And as far as I know there's nothing in U.S. law that would ban an American from advocating the secession of New York or any other state; I know of actual seccessionist movements in Texas and Hawaii which are not intrinsically illegal (though some actions they take could be unlawful). <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 20:06, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If, like Bhadani and Joe, you feel the need to contact a Wikipedian over something that has nothing to do with Wikipedia and may not be well-received, I would suggest keeping Wikipedia out of any potential strife by not using Wikipedia to make contact.

<dd>Sam is altogether correct here; even as my question wasn't adversarial and indeed helped me to form a relationship with a user with whom I'll collaborate in the future, my initial contact ought to have been off-Wiki, and we'd all do well to follow Sam's suggestion. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:00, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, my dear friends, firstly, my message to him was not in the capacity as an administrator, but by way of a friendly advice. I do accept that I should have used the words in a diffirent manner. Firstly, as regards the drinks, I withdraw my comments, I stand corrected in view of the clarifications made by you all. Now, I am not shocked any more. As regards the other point, my dear friends, I was actually trying to help a fellow wikipedian (in case, he is an Indian citizen) to the potential problems to which he was exposing himself. Now, if someone wants to set up RFArb, I feel helpless. However, I am sure that <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> should now get convinced of my intentions: as explained above, I was not engaging in any overt or covert legal threats, and my intention was really to help another wikipedian to avoid potential problems for him, with an adverse affect on us. As suggested, in future, I shall take up such issues through wiki-mails.</p>

<p>A mediation case recently arose at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-05-14_Blue_Panther_6376.html#Dab" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-05-14 Blue Panther">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-05-14 Blue Panther#Dab</a> which gives all the background information you need in a nutshell for an incident about a that was voted for deletion at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Blue_Panther_14e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Blue Panther">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Blue Panther</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Blue_Panther_%28second_nomination%29_d914.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Blue Panther (second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Blue Panther (second nomination)</a>. The page concerning Suzie Kassem (her alias is the Blue Panther, apparrently) has come back up by a self-proclaimed marketing team. The information about this came after the fact that the page about <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Panther_%28wrestler%29_78e2.html" title="Blue Panther (wrestler)">Blue Panther (wrestler)</a> was undergoing a revert war between User:Far2steep (part of the marketing team) and <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarren_Jowalsen_31c2.html" title="User:Darren Jowalsen">User:Darren_Jowalsen</a>.</p>
<p>The whole situation is quite confusing, really. Basically, a page voted for deletion (Suzie Kassem) has been re-created by a self proclaimed advertiser and was involved in a disambiguation war between <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Panther_%28wrestler%29_78e2.html" title="Blue Panther (wrestler)">Blue Panther (wrestler)</a>. What should be done, in my opinion, (not to sound condescending, but to try to make the situation make sense) is that the disambiguation page should be changed to a redirect to the wrestler page, and the Suzie Kassem page deleted once more and protected. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109">Cowman109</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Talk</font></a></sup> 18:50, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the final time, Ardenn, and I really shouldn't even have to say this. You don't want me to remove needless tags? Don't remove the hard work of others. I have worked tirelessly to improve the Queen's page and, being a student at the school, am proud of it. You went ahead and deleted, in a highly arrogant and self-righteous manner it appears, the work of myself and others without consideration or a group discussion. Raise a question about the information, question it all you want. That is ACCEPTABLE. I have no issue with that at ALL. What I do have a problem with is you vandalizing the article then trying to wreck my user page with warnings, when I am trying to cooperate and work with you, but your pride is attacking me. I DON'T APPPRECIATE THAT. Please stop. I want a third neutral party to help this dispute since your pride is keeping it from going anywhere. 70.28.199.81 00:11, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

And, for whatever my opinion is worth, I think longstanding traditions are worthy of inclusion. You just need to find some publication that mentions these traditions; the local newspaper, even the alumni magazine would be an appropriate primary source in this case. Online sources are not required if you can provide the date and page number of a book or magazine that is not online that is fine too. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:31, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, I was referred here by another administrator. My understanding that deleting useful and factual information is vandalism according to the Wikipedia policy--isn't this called "blanking?" I quit using the talk page because this user is very much a troll--he argues and argues really riduculous points just to argue, then he resorts to personal attacks when he isn't agreed with. It was so exhausting that I just gave up and began reverting his deletions and reporting the vandalism. (Please note that I never revert his contributions that are good additions, just the destructive ones that erase quality content written by others.) I was unaware of the 3 revert rule, and will pay close attention next time. Still, I don't know what to do with this situation because it is useless to argue with a troll. <a href="../../../a/i/n/User%7EAine63_4c1a.html" title="User:Aine63">Aine63</a> 04:03, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is clearly a content dispute-- not <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">vandalism</a>. You say he makes destructive edits. He says the same bout you. I would suggest you make a case for your version on the talk page. Perhaps you can provide sources for information he claims are unsourced. Allow him to do the same. Then ask a third party to review and make suggestions. Invite others who have contributed to the article to help establish consensus. Wikipedia is about consensus-- not labelling someone good or bad. Please try to be objective-- labelling someone a <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll.html" title="Troll">troll</a> might be seen as violating <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTACK_3b8e.html" title="WP:ATTACK">WP:ATTACK</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.

<p>Thanks for the feedback. But since I've already been attacked several times by Meta from the very beginning, I don't feel much guilt about labeling him. All you have suggested I tried to do with him in the beginning. (His first personal attacks came when he deleted information in favor of his own and I asked him to back it up with sources.) But it doesn't really focus on the real problem. I'm not making a case for "my version" as it wasn't my information he deleted, and it has been there for months. The only reason he deleted this info (he would view it as American info) because he was angry I added some new information backed up by American sources. My case is for his constant deletions and revisions of factual information simply because he personally does not like them or because he does not want an "American Voice" in the article. Why doesn't he just add his point of view, rather than erase the points of view of others in favor of his own? He won't do this; what he does must be at the expense of other's contributions.</p>
<p>But yes, I will take your advice and step back from the article for a bit. I believe strongly in the Wiki community and the belief in consensus. Thanks again for your feedback. Let's hope this all quiets down now. <a href="../../../a/i/n/User%7EAine63_4c1a.html" title="User:Aine63">Aine63</a> 05:30, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Without wanting to get involved in the dispute: the Manual of Style says that "[if] there is no strong tie to a specific dialect, the dialect of the first significant contributor (not a stub) should be used." There is no official French dialect of English, so "the dialect of the first significant contributor should be used."

<dd>Yeah, I'm sorry, Mr. Koot, but I don't think that's accurate. The Manual of Style doesn't mention any sort of British dominion over articles pertaining to European topics. It's my recollection that the British ultimately lost the <a href="../../../1/0/0/100_Years_War_f534.html" title="100 Years War">100 Years War</a>, so articles about French topics aren't held to either British or American English. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 16:58, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The two editors above me are right: there is no such mention in the Manual of Style. In fact, the only mention that comes remotely close to Europe is this: "Article on European Union institutions: British, Irish and Maltese English usage and spelling". In other words: wikipedia has no preference for British English over other dialects of English when it comes to Europe. The only thing in the Manual of Style that applies here is that "the dialect of the first significant contributor should be used." The first significant contributor is Hardouin, and he/she used Transportation. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Apple</sup></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>knocker</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>Flophouse</sup></a> 17:26, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ugh. Another candidate for a job at the soup kitchen. The key is consistency within an article. Beyond that, the status quo has an advantage over <i>any</i> change. Anyone changing for pigheaded, chauvanistic reasons is no better than a vandal. If a person is changing not to correct mistakes in information, not to aid in coherence, but rather because he or she is a bigot about his own nation or a visionary who wants to assume what other nations <i>should</i> write like. What is the difference between someone rewriting an article that is consistent and clear to reflect his personal fetish for language and someone doing so to reflect his personal political views? Both are changes that do not aid anyone but the editor, and that's not what we're here for. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:56, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My reason for changing Transportation to Transport had nothing to do with changing American to English but to appky consistency between <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_France_6f51.html" title="Transport in France">Transport in France</a> to a section of transport in France, as state in all of my edit summaries. Replying to <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> and as a parenthesis, English is taught in France rather than American, I'd know.

<p>Captain Scarlet's argument that he changed the spelling only to conform to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_France_6f51.html" title="Transport in France">Transport in France</a> is a bit of a joke. Transport in France was originally called <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transportation_in_France_59a9.html" title="Transportation in France">Transportation in France</a> and was moved to Transport in France only a month ago (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transportation_in_France&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transportation_in_France&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>) apparently by another user who doesn't like American English either. Is that how things should work on Wikipedia? By the way, in France there is no particular English spelling taught in schools. Both American and British English spellings are taught, depending on the English teacher. Traditionally the English manuals were more oriented towards British English, but these days with the arch-domination of the US in the world and the fascination of French people for the US it is rather American English that has the upper hand in schools. Parents insist on the school teachers teaching American English to their kids, with US material (recordings, videos, etc). <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 20:34, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You may see this as a joke, just as much as it seems others see your edits as a joke, but since I have spent half my life in french education, I am french, I have lived in France, I would find comments like your rather obscure. As I always say, If I make the effort to make an edit, or a comment I know it is true. If I'm unsure, I don't mention it.</dd>
<dd>Transportation in France was changed Trnasport in France, quite rightfully, and as such any article containing [[Transport in France)) should use the same approrpriate naming, for consistency's sake. I have edit a handful of articles, making few of those featured within the following day in accordance to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_France_6f51.html" title="Transport in France">Transport in France</a> and to nothing else, wether you accept it or not, that is a fact.</dd>

<p>SlimVirgin removed User:203.122.215.44's comments on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Talk%7EWikitruth_3083.html" title="Talk:Wikitruth">Wikitruth talk page</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wikitruth&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52969154" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wikitruth&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52969154" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> Please note that the text of the edit description is a standard rollback message.

I posted a note to SlimVirgin's talk page asking her not to do same, reminding her of the policy violations in a rather mild way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=53015308&amp;oldid=52971974" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&amp;diff=53015308&amp;oldid=52971974" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>.</p>
<p>SlimVirgin's response stated the removal was because the comments were made by a banned user, and that I should have assumed good faith. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWCityMike&amp;diff=53077011&amp;oldid=53059554" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWCityMike&amp;diff=53077011&amp;oldid=53059554" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> I responded, "Your response seems to be based upon the following: first, that I am able to swiftly connect a post signed as 203.122.215.44 with a user named Zordrac; second, that assuming I knew 203.122.215.44 was Zordrac, that I would know he was banned by the Arbitration Committee; third, that it is appropriate to remove anonymous comments; and fourth, that somehow not making these assumptions is a violation of WP:AGF. WP:AGF also quite clearly states, 'ssuming good faith also does not mean that no action by editors should be criticized, it only means that one should not ascribe said action to malice.' I don't believe I ascribed malice to you at any point, just criticism." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53077011" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53077011" rel="nofollow">[33]</a></p>
<p>SlimVirgin replied, "I'm not going to argue with you about it. When you see an admin removing material, assume there is a reason, and don't assume the admin is a vandal. Just because you're not familiar with the reason doesn't mean it doesn't exist." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWCityMike&amp;diff=53081786&amp;oldid=53080807" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWCityMike&amp;diff=53081786&amp;oldid=53080807" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> She directed me to make further replies on her talk page, or else she wouldn't see it. (See Wikipedia's recommended <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page#How_to_keep_a_two-way_conversation_readable" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page#How_to_keep_a_two-way_conversation_readable" rel="nofollow">reply policy</a>, which this counters.)</p>
<p>Following her request to make further replies on her talk page, I went there. I stated that her lack of description in the edit description did not assist editors in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, and that absent that, it was difficult to assume good faith when witnessing an act that is quite literally a textbook example of vandalism. I also asked her if she could provide a cite as to policy that allowed removal of anonymous edits that were <i>suspected</i> to have come from a banned user, as I could find no such policy. I also noted I had trouble with the way she phrased her response. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53081463" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53081463" rel="nofollow">[35]</a></p>
<p>She blanked that section of the talk page with the edit description "unbelievable". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53082474" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53082474" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> I posted a note to her page citing Wikipedia policy regarding blanking unreplied-to items on a personal talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53083007" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53083007" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. She blanked this response, too <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53083855" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53083855" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>.</p>
<p>I solicit administrators' opinions on the following issues:</p>
<p>First, does policy exist that allows administrators to remove talk page comments made by people <i>suspected</i> to be banned users? If so, can you please provide the policy cites, which SlimVirgin was unwilling to do?</p>
<p>Second, was I to somehow swiftly connect a post signed as 203.122.215.44 with a user named Zordrac; know that 203.122.215.44 was Zordrac (or was suspected of same); know Zordrac was banned by the Arbitration Committee; and know that removal of his comments was permissible, all on my own? And was my failure to do so assuming bad faith?</p>
<p>Third, is SlimVirgin's statement that I did not assume good faith correct? "Yelling 'Assume Good Faith' at people does not excuse you from explaining your actions," says <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, and as the earlier-quoted example outlines, criticism does not constitute assuming bad faith; I did not ascribe malice.</p>
<p>Fourth, has SlimVirgin conducted herself incivilly in her responses to my actions and in her repeated blanking of her talk page? I believe she could have been much less prickly in her handling of this matter.</p>
<p>Fifth, is this the appropriate forum for this query? I do not think this matter is serious enough to go higher in the dispute resolution chain, but if the Mediators' Cabal or Mediation Committee is a more appropriate venue, I can inquire there. I doubt that the Arbitration Committee is appropriate, but I am not well-versed in the dispute resolution areas of Wikipedia, so would appreciate others' feelings on this issue.</p>

<dd>WCityMike, I implore you to exercise common sense rather than following a rigid application of policy and guideline pages. If you wanted to know why SlimVirgin rolled back an edit like that, you should have <i>asked her</i> instead of accusing her in the first place; once it was explained, you should have gone ahead and assumed SV was pretty good at identifying the banned user by his editing style; once your campaign got to the point where SV was removing you from her talk page, you should have gone "no harm has been done and I am now annoying somebody" instead of posting this here.

<dd>WCityMike, normally reminding a user of policy is the appropriate approach, but when the user is an admin, you should probably assume that they know about policy. The best course of action here would have been to ask SV why she was removing the comments. That way there wouldn't have been any problem. I don't think anyone's setting out to be uncivil, but it can be frustrating when these sorts of issues snowball into a big issue when they shouldn't have been problematic at all.</dd>

<dd>It's interesting how the responses so far have so avidly focused on what <i><b>I</b></i> could have done to prevent the situation from escalating. Have any of you looked at it from the viewpoint of the average, well-meaning editor who may not have an intimate knowledge of the Wikipedian bureaucracy? How about, for example, if SlimVirgin had put a edit description that actually described what she was doing? I can tell you I would have never reverted her change if it had said, "Reverted additions to Talk page made by banned user posting anonymously."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Or let's just say she didn't do that, but posit a different response that didn't come across as a "just trust us" pat on the head. Something like, "I appreciate your attempt to safeguard Wikipedia policy, but I actually knew what I was doing there: the user posting anonymously was a user whose account had been banned but who was posting anonymously. If next time you could just check with me prior to reverting my changes, it'll save us all a lot of work. Thanks. -- SlimVirgin".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can absolutely <b>assure</b> you that if the first had happened, I'd never have reverted, and if the second had happened, I'd have actually probably responded with something akin to, "Oh, geez, sorry about that. Lesson learned. Have a good evening."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even if she hadn't done the above, if she didn't then refuse to talk about the issue on my talk page, <b>specifically</b> instruct me to head over to her talk page, and then eliminate the discussion outright on her page while describing it using a snark edit description, I probably would've just chalked the situation as an unpleasant experience, and gone on surfing or doing something differently this evening.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I understand that as admins, you want to express solidarity with each other. That sort of kinship is admirable if looked at with the right viewpoint. But I just find it really disturbing that the response here tonight has been seemingly that it is perfectly acceptable for an admin to specifically <i>violate</i> several policies and guidelines, and then, when that violation causes confusion, chide the user as if it was their fault. It implies that once that magic RfA gets granted, you've suddenly got a lot more <i>social</i> weight in disagreements. (Of course, I assume it doesn't hurt if the person has about five thousand barnstars.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And then when the user comes here to try to hash things out politely without clogging up the dispute resolution process, instead get a lot of snark and "shoo, fly" stuff tossed at them -- thanks, Bishonen -- is even more disturbing.</dd>

<dd>Neither Bishonen nor SlimVirgin were incivil. Civility is not "be totally as kind as posible all the time and give everyone hugs and kisses". Sure, we could all be somewhat more polite at times, but there is no policy stating that being even slightly less and sweetness and light is unacceptable, far from it. Now please, move off of this absurdly miniscule topic and go do something more productive. <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ForgiveAndForget" class="extiw" title="meatball:ForgiveAndForget">Forgive &amp; Forget</a>, I suppose.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black"><font color="#FC0FC0">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:07, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, agreed, but the rule isn't applied consistently. I wouldn't even particularly care if that <i>is</i> what it said, as long as it was treated as saying that all the time instead of whenever it suits the needs of any particular admin. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_9_6eb1.html" title="User:Rogue 9">Rogue 9</a> 13:38, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>While different users have different views of "civility", I might add that this should be viewed not so much a matter of policy, but a suggestion. If SlimVirgin had done this, she would not have had to deal with all of this. It isn't that she had done anything wrong, it is just that it would have been helpful to her to be <i>more</i> civil. A similar view would have prevented the whole Danny/Eloquence issue - being less abrasive in reversions, even when the other user is clearly at fault, can go a long way toward keeping such situations from happening. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus"><b>Philosophus</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus"><b>T</b></a></sup> 01:40, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Once he reforms himself I have no objection to his presense. He needs to get the message about behavior and he didn't get until now. If blocking him would help, he needs a block.

AlexPU got back from his block on 8 May, and the edit by KK you're referring to is timestamped 14 May <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALupo&amp;diff=52991903&amp;oldid=51872891" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALupo&amp;diff=52991903&amp;oldid=51872891" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>. That means that all those incivilities by AlexPU precede the edit by KK you're referring to...</dd>
<dd>And no matter the cause of the conflict, there are no excuses for AlexPU, as NPA should be the stance... -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 23:07, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point is that he was contacted by so many users who warned him to calm down that I perceive an RfC (whose goal is merely to request for comments from more people) a waste of time. ALready enough people commented to him at his and article's talk. There is no need to solicit for more opinions to the fact that keeping it civil is good and calling others "motherfuckers" is bad. ArbCom is fine with me if there is no action from here. I just thought that this is too plain obvious for an ArbCom to waste time. Almost every talk page entry by the user is an insult. What's more we need. Why bother ArbCom? But if no admin action or advise will follow, I am prepared for an ArbCom if others think that the ArbCom doesn't have anything better to do than deal with plain obvious <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> gross violators. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 07:36, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've looked around and haven't seen a specific policy on this, so I'll ask here. What is the policy on very young children editing Wikipedia? Currently a user named <a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmo12456_f091.html" title="User:Elmo12456">User:Elmo12456</a> (alternate accounts: <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetRochelewsad_5eba.html" title="User:SetRochelewsad">User:SetRochelewsad</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetRochele_bfdb.html" title="User:SetRochele">User:SetRochele</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmo12456%E2%99%A3_acfa.html" title="User:Elmo12456♣">User:Elmo12456♣</a>, probably others) has been editing the dinosaur articles on WP. We immediately noticed the articles were mostly all bad info, and we've been working to correct the mistakes. Some users were originally labelling this as "vandalism", but these do seem to be good-faith edits, just horribly incorrect. In many, or even most instances, every word is incorrect (for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libycosaurus&amp;diff=51015432&amp;oldid=50976011" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libycosaurus&amp;diff=51015432&amp;oldid=50976011" rel="nofollow">WP's article on Libycosaurus</a>. We've tried, without success, to contact this user. He doesn't seem able to reply to his messages, although we have left many for him. It has occurred to me that it's possible this is a young child, and I recently noticed this user has many accounts, one of which edited the article on <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dora_the_Explorer_4d2f.html" title="Dora the Explorer">Dora_the_Explorer</a>, making me wonder if my child hypothesis is correct. I also wondered if this wasn't maybe a joke account after looking at his <a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmo12456_f091.html" title="User:Elmo12456">animation-filled graphics-overloaded user page</a>. This user has quite a few edits, and they've almost all been reverted. Advice? Ideas? What's the policy?--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron">Firsfron</a> 02:51, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Gah! Is there a policy on excessive userboxes? This user has <i>just added</i> at least 115 additional userboxes to his page, in addition to the 50-100 he already had. Add that to the animated gifs and full-sized images, and my browser is close to crashing. Also, one of the userboxes states he rates his professors, so he's obviously not a kid.

<dd>He was up to 1,200 userboxes a short while ago. I <b>was bold</b> and took the libery of reverting and placing a note on his talk page explaining why. I hope that doesn't get me in hot water. Actually, I'm not sure of the count. I did a Word-aided count of his page and counted over 600 in the first half of his page. I'm only assuming there were 600 more buried in the second half. Many of the userboxes were duplicates, and many flat-out contradicted others. This appears to be some kind of joke or hoax account, IMO.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron">Firsfron</a> 00:12, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have already taken back my initial remarks about Nathan in favor of simply agreeing with someone else who was far more eloquent than I was about what was essentially the same viewpoint.

<p>In view of certain recent edits by me to wikipedia, my family members, particularly my wife have expressed apprehension of cyber-stalking as well as physical-stalking. Their apprehensions are based on certain e-mails received in our family’s mail box. Accordingly, she desires that following four images uploaded by me be deleted:</p>
<ul>

<li>Image:An Inside View of a Bank of India Office.jpg</li>
<li>Image:Bhadani In Early 1970s.jpg</li>
<li>Image:Rashmi Bhadani Late 1970s.jpg</li>
</ul>
<p>I as the uploader of the above images request for deletion. I shall upload the same/ other images as and when my family members gain confidence.</p>

<p>yawn... if the GA spammers were willing to discuss their reasoning behing adding the GA spam to <a href="../../../f/e/a/Template%7EFeatured_8cc7.html" title="Template:Featured">Template:featured</a> - i'm still waiting for a valid reason other than inappropriate advertising and self-congratulation - maybe there wouldnt be so much uncivility going on? all i see is worldtraveller bleating about how the world is against him while consistently failing to engage in the debate about how "this featured article was once a good article!!!" helps wikipedia in any way shape or form.</p>

<p>Can any admin, acting alone, issue sanctions (official warnings), or dismissals (blocking), or even executions (permanent blocking) to any user with whom he or she disagrees? Is this done fairly? Is this also the right forum in which to ask this question? Thank you. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWallie_96b2.html" title="User:Wallie">Wallie</a> 13:08, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are certain things that are clearly outlined by policy that allow an individual decision on blocking. Warnings are a thing anyone can do, administrator or not, although they're worth only as much as the person issuing them is. Permanent blocks can be issued by an individual only in very, very well defined cases, and each of those requires acquiescence by the general community. None of these can be initiated simply for disagreement. Disagreement triggers nothing. All of these require certain <i>actions,</i> not opinions, except for blocking under the naming policy (User:Booger sorts of things, where the block is when the user picks an inappropriate user name). Otherwise, a Request for Comment (RfC) needs to take place on content disputes, a Request for Mediation on personality disputes or disruption disputes, and then actual blocks for life and limitations on editing priviledges come only from the Arbitration Committee. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:48, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well there are cases when admins can block from life that don't need the ArbCom to rule (Community bans, vandal only accounts etc.) I agree that admins cannot block only for disagreeing, but without seeing the example you are thinking of (assuming you have something in mind) then I can't really give a full comment to this. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 13:55, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no provision for "punishment" of any sort in Wikipedia policy or practice. The purpose of blocks, bans, page protection, and other such administrative procedures is to prevent specific harms to the project. It is <i>never</i> acceptable to use such means to "punish" an individual for perceived moral or personal slights. Admins are servants of the project, empowered to use certain technical means to protect it and to clean up after vandals and other problems. They are neither police nor judges, and do not have the power to punish anyone. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 00:12, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If that is so, then why are people blocked for violating 3-rr hours and hours after the disagreements have ended? The dispute is long over, no editing is being done, and yet the admins issue blocks, sometimes long ones. - <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">Drogo Underburrow</a> 13:54, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In my experience, they generally don't, although it does happen occasionally. If you have violated 3RR, and haven't been blocked within twelve hours, you probably won't be blocked. Reports of 3RR from the day before (or earlier) are not looked on kindly. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 15:05, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>User:Amibidhrohi, reported for 3-rr 23:33, 9 May 2006, punished over 15 hours later, at 15:09, 10 May 2006 blocked for 3 days for being a repeat offender. (The fact that blocks are longer for repeat offenders is punishing them for crimes). Deiaemeth 09:41, 11 May 2006 (UTC) gets blocked by admin at 20:26, 11 May 2006 (UTC), ten hours later; How can blocking someone ten hours after editing has stopped be anything other than punishment? There is more, but its just repetition, I've made my point. Seems some of 3-RR enforcement is to stop immediate problems, but most is after the fact punishment. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">Drogo Underburrow</a> 15:28, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It may happen, but it doesn't happen often (and shouldn't). Regarding Amibidhrohi, the maximum block allowed for 3RR is 24 hours, so something's odd there. I suspect the blocking admins were thinking in terms 3RR as a form of disruption rather than per se. Without having looked at the history, it seems that his/her disruption went on for a substantial length of time. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenry_Flower_de0f.html" title="User:Henry Flower">Henry</a><a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenry_Flower_b54b.html" title="User talk:Henry Flower"><sup>Flower</sup></a> 15:40, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The point is, it's outside of the job of administrators to contemplate how or whether to "punish" people. Acts of punishment presume the existence of <i>authority over others</i>, which Wikipedia administrators do not possess. They hold <i>only</i> increased technical power over certain aspects of the Wikipedia computer system -- not juridical authority over editors.</p>
<p>Acts such as blocking editors need to be justified on the basis of <i>preventing specific harm to the project</i>, not on any basis such as what a person <i>deserves</i> (revenge), what they need to convince them of the wrongness of their ways (reform) or what would discourage others from offending (deterrence). --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 03:56, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "right to vanish" isn't a process that has to be followed exactly in order to gain the "privilege" of having one's user page deleted. He's fully entitled to have his user page deleted whether or not he ceases to edit. If he wants the page deleted, delete it and leave it be. Whether or not he continues to edit is entirely up to him. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 14:36, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is it appropriate for a user to request deletion of his talkpage to get rid of unsightly (but quite appropriate) warnings, ArbCom notices, etc.? That's what appears to be happening here. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 14:46, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I was about to add the same thing. Locke Cole has an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Locke_Cole_d46c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Locke Cole">outstanding ArbCom case</a> and his talk page archives show all sorts of warnings and disputes which appear to me to be relevant. We tick people off for deleting warnings from their talk pages, but in this case it appears that a user has been able to eliminate his entire talk page history with the blessing of an administrator, while continuing to be an active editor. I'd feel slightly differently if he was just editing stuff related to the ArbCom case prior to giving up and disappearing, but that doesn't seem to be the case. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 14:54, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I personally don't see why we make such a big deal about removing warnings from user pages, and think we need to stop making such a big deal about it as it's mean to newbies and generally not a friendly practice. And I think at this point everyone knows what they need to know about Locke Cole. IMO, we should <b>not</b> rely on user talk pages as a history of conflict for a user. Perhaps we need an administrative history page for a user that is only visible to admins? <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 15:06, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An administrative history page for users is an excellent idea because the worst users, the ones most likely to attract admin attention, are the quickest to remove warnings. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:57, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think there is a balance and common sense to be applied, immediate removal of warnings tends to suggest (and in some cases certainly is) attempting to hide the warning, so a subsequent warner may be unaware of the previous warning. On the other hand forcing retention of warnings forever seems to serve no purpose. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 16:51, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't make a big deal of it myself, and I agree that after a reasonable amount of time has elapsed, people ought to be able to remove anything they like from their talk page (although this goes against the guideline that <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html#Ownership_and_editing_of_pages_in_the_user_space" title="Wikipedia:User page">you don't own 'your' talk page</a>). However, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> says "Removing warnings for vandalism or other issues from one's talk page may also be considered vandalism." That's not a dead or obscure piece of policy - I've seen a few other admins quoting it at transgressors in the last week. If there's consensus to do away with it, fine, but we ought to do away with it properly. I also find it odd, to say the least, that someone who is halfway through an ArbCom case can announce he's leaving the project (while plainly <i>not</i> leaving the project) and have his user and talk pages deleted. Again, if there's consensus that people should be allowed to request deletion of "their" talk page, there ought to be a process to do it without having to dishonestly claim that they are clearing off. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 18:49, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Kelly. Locke Cole should be free to have his userpage in a deleted state.

<dd>I have to disagree with this. A user who has been frequently involved in runins with policy, and has been frequently warned, shouldn't delete those warnings from their Talk page. If an uninvolved admin encounters bad behavior and goes to their Talk page and sees that they have been warned previously, then they can just issue a block. But if those warnings are gone, the uninvolved admin would think that the bad behavior is a first-time occurrence, and would just issue a warning. This could happen over and over again. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:25, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In particular, a user's talk page is primarily made up of edits by other users that the user in question should not have control over deletion.

<dd>The talk page should be blanked if the user wants to disappear. If Locke Cole wants his userpage gone, it should be okay, but the arbcom notices, etc. have to go somewhere -- and in this case, the talk page makes sense. So if Locke wants his userpage gone, he has to keep the arbcom notices on his talk. At least, that's how I think. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:29, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think there's also an important distinction to be drawn here between blanking the talk page, and deleting it.

If he's going to come back in a month's time and resume where he left off, then his talk page history needs to be around so that anyone he comes into conflict with, not just admins, can see it. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 08:43, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The ones from the troll? You can't be serious. Any serious warnings (which were few and far between; most non-cabalers seem to think I do good things here) are <b>very very old</b> and <i>stale</i>. If someone is using them as an excuse to block me, they'd be acting punitively, not preventively.</p>
<p>As for <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> (<a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Knowledge_Seeker_989a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Knowledge Seeker">contribs</a>), it's amazing to me that you can twist what is an obvious indicator of support of my talk pages deletion as an excuse to <b>undelete</b> the page. Yes, I'm treating the one month ban as my cue to leave; it's clear to me that if things are this skewed, there's no hope for Wikipedia. It'll need to be forked to something where there's no cabal, and certainly nothing resembling the ArbCom we have here (love the fact that even during the proposed decision/voting phase only two arbitrators have taken time to respond to questions (one of them less than helpfully); tip to wannabe arbitrators: don't run for the job if your intent is only to rubber-stamp other peoples proposals).</p>
FYI: When I've had it deleted in the (recent) past, I've usually come back at the behest of someone else via e-mail or a talk page message (or had the page undeleted when someone complained about the red link). From now on I'll use better judgement and simply ignore such messages or requests. In any event, <i>if</i> I ever return, I'll make certain to have my various pages undeleted, but for now, please respect my wishes and leave the page deleted. Please stop harassing me simply because I respond to a few final comments prior to the block being imposed. Please do assume good faith (you know, like you're <b>supposed to</b>).

<p>I would like to ask all here to kindly respect Locke's decision to quit (Which I hope he rethinks and comes back once that harsh punitive one month ban is over). And just for the records (if anybody should care): he is banned by ArbCom for a month for "stalking" someone who was found to have caused disruption (in the exact same ArbCom case and a prior case). You might want to rethink for a second how that may feel on Locke's side. Thank you for your consideration.

<dl>
<dd>Seth,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have tried everything possible within the Wikipedia community's rules to clean up the article. That has not been allowed and, as you know, I have not been treated fairly by any stretch of the imagination.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's not a big deal, but the underlying problem is that you have an encyclopedia article that uses the word "cocksucker" and unnecessarily features nudity. That would be fine if the audience were all adults, but that is not the case. I know that children are reading that article. I was blocked by an admin who was 14 years old. That kid shouldn't even be reading that article (let alone making administrative judgments about it).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently very few of the editors care about corrupting the morals of children, but I care. I care a lot. Think back to when you were 14. Do you have a 14 year old nephew or niece? It is very wrong to expose 14 year old kids to that kind of indecency. And in the case of this article, the indecency is not even relevant to the topic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have gone through all of Wikipedia's bureaucratic hoops and raised a red flag to people at the very highest levels within the Wikipedia community. I have no more options within the Wikipedia framework. I have been given no choice but to work outside Wikipedia's structure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So far there are four events planned starting on August 4th. All are all very legal and non-violent. I don't want to ruin the surprise for all of them, but I want to get your opinion about one of them.</dd>

It also starts on August 4th. There is an anti-gay group that has acquired somewhat of a reputation for their ability to get media coverage to their protests. This group has read the article and is aware of my efforts and is understandably concerned about the lack of fairness and neutrality displayed here. They have not committed for certain, so I don't want to mention the group's name in case it doesn't happen, but they may protest the Wikipedia event.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am understandably concerned about the article and my treatment, but I have reservations about getting this group involved. These people are truly insane. And I have nothing against gay people, I just want an article that is not obscene and maintains some semblance of neutrality. But, on the other hand, I absolutely will not be the one who allowed kids to read "cocksucker" and see that illustration in the article. And there doesn’t seem to be another way to work this out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What do you think the odds are that Wikipedia will do the right thing and either delete the article or fix it without a big scene? I have to give this group some lead time and I worry that once I set this up I may not be able to get the Jeannie back into the bottle.</dd>

<dd>I don't find anything particularly troublesome there, and I certainly don't think he's going to find many supporters for the proposition that <i>It is very wrong to expose 14 year old kids to that kind of indecency</i>; I can't think of anything on Wikipedia the reading of which I wouldn't permit (or even encourage) by any 10-year-old whom I know, let alone any 14-year-old. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:11, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't really think its our business to be concerned about what he will or will not do outside of Wikipedia (so long as no one is harmed by it), but I feel that perhaps he really doesn't get it - I mean, the idea that Wikipedians can or should be subject to political pressure by non-editors, if adopted, undermines the whole project. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Smahoney</a> 22:48, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with Aecis for the reasons expressed by Seth and further in view of my general disapproval of our looking at a user's extra-Wiki activities in ascertaining whether he/she should be blocked/banned/otherwise regulated. My point with respect to finding support was more, I suppose, of an inducement toward Lou's carrying out Plan B; notwithstanding that Seth is correct that the project isn't likely to compromise principles such as <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in view of a WikiMania protest, I sought to suggest that it was unlikely Lou'd find many people to protest in any event (I suppose I may be incorrect there; at the very least, I don't think Lou's position would ever win the support of most editors here, irrespective of his outside agitiation). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:08, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I trust Seth, and the content of the email is Lou through and through. I also encouraged Seth to post this email after he forwarded it to me on my request. It wasn't like Seth even asked Lou to email him in confidence - he said "what is plan B?" and Lou said "I'll email you" rather than replying on his talk page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lou_franklin&amp;diff=53258631&amp;oldid=53258139" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lou_franklin&amp;diff=53258631&amp;oldid=53258139" rel="nofollow">SM</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lou_franklin&amp;diff=53260549&amp;oldid=53258631" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lou_franklin&amp;diff=53260549&amp;oldid=53258631" rel="nofollow">LF</a>).

<p>Ok, for what it is worth. If Lou wants to label himself as anti-gay by associating himself with those groups, his choice. If he even has the faintest hope it will get him somewhere, let him dreaming. There have been much more serious fights (think <a href="../../../j/y/l/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy_7433.html" title="Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy">Muhammad Cartoons</a> for example) fought out here, so I do not see a big issue comming up. The worst thing that could happen is that the conservative media gets a confirmation that wikipedia does not fall within their approved moral standards. Big deal. Not! <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 23:43, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the <i>worst</i> thing that could happen is that some groups get the idea that the way to get things changed around here is to apply political pressure. But yeah, I don't see this as anything serious either, more as a suggestion that Lou still doesn't get it. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Smahoney</a> 23:55, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>We have been trolled. Have a nice day.</b> Either Lou's threat is a bluff, in which case it should be ignored, or it is a very weak threat — which should be ignored.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Lou is welcome to edit within the bounds of the restrictions imposed by ArbCom. Based on his performance to date, I suspect he will fail at this, but until he does I strongly recommend <i>not</i> giving him the attention that he seems to be so desperate to get. Any course of action beyond enforcing the terms of his parole and continuing to edit as normal would seem to suggest that we can be successfully trolled and bullied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and if scraggly band of homophobic nutjobs do picket Wikimania, we should be pleased—it will provide lots of material for Wikinews. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 00:06, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm trying to guess what group he contacted. The most obvious group (given that even Lou think they are "insane") is that of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Phelps_24e6.html" title="Fred Phelps">Fred Phelps</a> which could be amusing. More seriously, while we don't normally care about what happens outside Wikipedia, this indicates 1) an unwillingness to abid by Arb Com 2) A generally disruptive attitude. I'm also somewhat worried about what the other three planned events are. Even making this sort of threat seems to me to be close to exhausting the community patience, and if any of his threatened/hinted at actions do occur, I would support a very long, if not indefinite block. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:10, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He's currently on personal attack parole, and he's used up one of his five strikes already. (He's currently on a one-week block.) Further, he's got a three-strike parole that restricts his editing of the articles and talk pages related to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Societal_attitudes_towards_homosexuality.html" title="Societal attitudes towards homosexuality">Societal attitudes towards homosexuality</a>, which is where he was involved in the most conflict. I understand he's already burned his first strike there.</dd>
<dd>Either he shapes up <i>really</i> soon, or he's going to be blocked for a year anyway. About the only way he can cause trouble is through his talk page. If we refuse to be trolled there – though remember, the personal attack parole also applies on that page – then he really doesn't have an avenue to make a nuisance of himself on-wiki. We can ignore him until he shapes up or self-destructs; I don't think a community ban is necessary yet. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 03:31, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm concerned about Mackensen's premature closing of disscussions at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion#Template:User_blogger" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion#Template:User_blogger" rel="nofollow">[89]</a>. Not only did the closing action not reflect the building consensus (which, so far was to keep the <b>template</b>. as the discussion was on the <b>template for deleation</b> page, <b>not</b> a 'content for deletion' page), but the discussion was closed after only about 10 hrs. I would like to see the template restored and the debate reopened so that TFD can run its course. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_McGregor_%28Can%29_39a4.html" title="User:Mike McGregor (Can)">Mike McGregor (Can)</a> 11:26, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm concerned that this was brought here before politely asking me to undelete–which I did. Given that there's currently a new policy discussion underway (<a href="../../../m/a/c/WP%7EMACK_60e9.html" title="WP:MACK">WP:MACK</a>), I'm halting all further administrative action on my part regarding userboxes. I encourage Mike to take a gander at the proposal. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 11:31, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Obviously this is related to the item immediately above. Mackensen and Cyde have been both nominating and closing userbox debates (which isn't process) prior to usual expiry (which isn't process) and with delete actions regardless of the consensus (which <i>definitely</i> isn't process). As to bringing this here 'first'... there was a discussion on the TfD talk page that was quickly growing heated between the 'follow procedure' and 'admin opinions count more' (yes, someone actually said that) crowds. Bringing the growing problem here was not the 'first' thing done. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 11:43, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I wasn't part of said discussion. Please note that the Pi boxes, at least, are on deletion review already (where they belong). Please also note that admins have always been expected to exercise their own good judgement.

<li>Then we'll make better bots&#160;;). Anyways, I've apologized elsewhere for apparently misleading people; I can only say that I honestly tried to make the best judgement call I could in the interests of the most people here. If you've been offended, I apologize for that. To that end, I've crafted a new policy proposal which is, at the moment, attracting support from all sides.

<li>That's not a failure on my part. My point was that the proposal was garnering support from both sides--which it is. There is opposition yes, but there's also support. The big thing is that I'm trying to get people to talk. Talking is good. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 13:18, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not involved in this issue, I don't care one whit positively or negatively about user boxes, but I do care about consensus, and I would like to ask people to try and work cooperatively and in the spirit of consensus. I will assume good faith and agree that Mackensen was trying come up with a position that could "garner support" from both sides, but that apparently was not how it was seen. Perhaps in situations like this where a compromise position does not have obvious broad support, the best tactic would be for the closing admin to keep the discussion going and ask if there is consensus with the emerging position, while keeping the debate open for another week. I have seen this work very successfully in other situations. There is no need to rush to a conclusion. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 18:25, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
