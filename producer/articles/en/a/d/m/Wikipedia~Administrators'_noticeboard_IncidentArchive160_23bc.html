<dd>Cyde has the right explanation, but I'm not impressed by his personal attack: "... who really have nothing better to do than get offended ...".

<dd>Good. BTW, I was referring to the username as being not-<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, not the user's behavior, which was under <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. And please, I'm getting a little sick of coming here, reporting a username which is POV, and having to answer 3 questions before it is finally blocked.

<dd>Personbally, I wouldn't have blocked that user name indefinitely. Unless it is flagrantly offensive (such as User:Fuckbeans or User:Jimbo eats poop out of dead men's bums), or an obvious sneaky impersenation of an existing user, <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a> suggests maybe trying to talk to the person first and suggesting the change their username. That is clearly not happening enough. There are too many admins blocking for usernames when they should try actually communicating. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 10:56, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After Thebainer blocked Husnock for a month, Husnock unblocked himself six minutes later, and clained that Thebainer was abusing his admin powers.

The block arises out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ALaw_in_Star_Trek&amp;diff=92706084&amp;oldid=92704939" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ALaw_in_Star_Trek&amp;diff=92706084&amp;oldid=92704939" rel="nofollow">a comment</a> made last week by Husnock, that was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AStarfleet_Security&amp;diff=94029909&amp;oldid=94029340" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AStarfleet_Security&amp;diff=94029909&amp;oldid=94029340" rel="nofollow">misinterpreted</a> by <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">User:Morwen</a> as threatening. A lengthy discussion ensued on the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive66_0599.html#Death_Threat_Accusation" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive66">Administrator's noticeboard</a>. Several editors and administrators, including myself, made an effort to reach an amicable end to a situation which clearly began with a string of misunderstandings and had snowballed from there. Husnock was resistant to efforts to peacefully resolve the dispute, but ultimately a resolution was reached and the community moved on, regarding the dispute as closed.</p>
<p>Recently Husnock has been further pursuing the matter by posting an message on his userpage in which he continued to maintain that the situation was something else than a misunderstanding, which is what the community had recognised the incident as. Even allowing Husnock some latitude to post a reasonable message stating his reasons for taking a wikibreak, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Husnock&amp;diff=94260096&amp;oldid=94217374" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Husnock&amp;diff=94260096&amp;oldid=94217374" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> signalled to me an intention to pursue the dispute and retreat from the peaceful conclusion reached several days ago. After warning Husnock several times that I and several other members of the community consider this pursuit of the issue to constitute <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html#Disruption" title="WP:BP">disruption</a> within the meaning of the blocking policy, Husnock <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AHusnock&amp;diff=95029334&amp;oldid=94988981" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AHusnock&amp;diff=95029334&amp;oldid=94988981" rel="nofollow">once</a> and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AHusnock&amp;diff=95031312&amp;oldid=95030737" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AHusnock&amp;diff=95031312&amp;oldid=95030737" rel="nofollow">twice</a> replaced the message.

<ol>
<li>If User A claims that User B made a death threat against them when they didn't, and the only response User B gets is that he should apologize (for something he did not do), do admins see it disruptive that someone takes a vast amount of offense at this?</li>
<li>The block on Husnock was for disruption. "Blocks for disruption should only be placed when a user is in some way making it difficult for others to contribute to Wikipedia." Can someone tell me what exactly he did to make it difficult to contribute to Wikipedia with a message on his user page?</li>
<li>If several people <i>consider</i> something to be disruptive, yet others do not, is the fact that <i>someone</i> finds it disruptive enough to block them for a <i>month</i>? --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 05:37, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm asking what the parameter is for a death threat accusation. If someone accuses me of making a death threat when I didn't, I see that as disruptive. I see that as basically a very vicious form of attack and rules-gaming. If I get upset over this, and people are telling me <b>I'm</b> in the wrong for getting upset, I want to know if the act of being upset is disruptive, because this is what this is all about. Husnock didn't feel he had made a death threat and was vastly aggravated that no one appeared to care about his side of the story. His being upset lead to the message on his userpage that people appearantly feel is disruptive. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font></dd>

The images I asked him about have been available from a collectors website since the mid 90s.. After reviewing the recent history, I'm shocked that he hasn't been permbanned over the copyright issues alone, much less the other problems with hostile behavior.

<dd>I will - the 'disruption' was for a threat allegedly made by Husnock, which stated "<i>I would be very careful telling a serving member of the military they cannot edit articles</i>". Husnock didn't mean it, I believe, in the manner of "<i>I have access to guns and could kill you if you stop me editing</i>", he meant it along the line of "<i>I am serving my country in real life and should get special dispensation</i>". Neither sentiment is particularly admirable when expressed by an admin. Morwen took the first meaning to be the one Husnock meant. This was unfortunate, and Husnock was asked to clear this up and apologise for any percieved threat, which would have resolved the whole unfortunate mess.</dd>

<dd>Husnock, instead, threw a hissy fit on this board, trying to get Morwen censured for feeling intimidated (utterly unacceptable). Husnock then refused to apologise until he was asked to by about thirty different people - even if he truly meant it in the second way, an apology would have calmed things down. He then made one of the most evasive apologies I've seen outside of Japanese Prime Ministers, but Morwen accepted the apology, and all was right with the world. Until Husnock decided not just to let things lie, and decided to insist he was right all along (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Husnock&amp;diff=94260096&amp;oldid=94217374" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Husnock&amp;diff=94260096&amp;oldid=94217374" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). This was disruptive, and once again not good conduct. I think a month's block for this, however, was very excessive. But Husnock then decided to unblock himself, which is wheel-warring, and, unfortunately, I can only see this ending up at <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">WP:RFAr</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 10:50, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">User:Proto</a> for what it is worth. It's sad this whole situation got to this point over what was a simple misunderstanding that could have been diffused early on with a simple apology. It's even sadder that this is still being discussed when the last AN/I thread was left at a place where everyone could have just chalked it up to a misunderstanding and moved on. I will also say the Dan Rappaport message/Husnock login is a rather curious postscript to this whole thing and unfortunate because it didn't have to get to this point.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:38, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gang, what just happened on my user page is absolutely outrageous. Three to four days ago I left editing Wikipedia articles due to some serious issues with the site. I have stayed around only to answer talk page messages and participated in an AfD by invite. The issues which caused me to leave the site were a real world Wiki-staking incident where someone sent e-mails out into the real world trying to find out who I was and then sent a semi-threatening e-mal to my wife. The second incident involved a user stating I had threatened her and that she was in fear of her life. That was resolved but still disturbed me greatly. So, I departed editing Wikipedia articles and posting a statement as to the reasons. Bainer then arrives and removes these statements from my user page, in effect censoring what I ahd to say. I explained to him these were not personal attacks, but simply my stating why I had left. I also was confused why he removed the Wiki-stalking statement since that didn’t even reference an actual user, just an event that had taken place in the real world. I restore my user page, Bainer removes the material again and then proceeds to block me for an entire month. At this point, not only has he removed material from someone else’s user page but he has blocked another user which he was currently involved in a dispute with, clearly something no one should ever do. My user page is not making personal attacks, it is stating why I am leaving this site. For a user to remove this material and then block me when I had a problem with that is against everything we stand for here. And, P.S.- what is this business about uploading “fake” images? I’ve done no such thing and that is a baseless accusation. Someone who states such a thing without evidence should be doing an investigation as it won’t be impartial. P.s.- to Gaxwell, I answered your query as to where the images came from and gave you a name and phone number to verify this Whats the problem? -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 05:51, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If administrators really weren't to unblock themselves under any circumstances whatsoever, the MediaWiki software would be configured to prevent them from doing so. A blocked administrator could unblock an IP address to remove an autoblock, but he/she would not be permitted to unblock his/her own username. That being said, it would seem that self-unblocking would be properly limited to truly extreme circumstances -- i.e. if one administrator uses a bot to frivolously block a large number of administrators, preventing unblocked administrators from responding to the situation, the blocked administrators may unblock themselves. Such a justification for self-unblocking does not seem to be present here. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 06:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

However, in the policy it also syas that when you are in a dispute with someone you shouldnt block them to keep them quiet or to stablize your own version of a pge, etc. Prior to my reviewing the policy, I thought my self-unblock was justified as a response to an unfair block in the first place Apologies all around.

<dd>Husnock, Your hostility with respect to copyright wasn't towards me, but rather it was towards Durin who asked you questions about the same images and you treated him with large amounts of hostility. I've looked into your claims more, but I'm simply having a hard to believing you: you somehow managed to upload the images in the same order/groupings that is used today on the website which claims to hold the copyright, while the archive.org history of the site makes it clear that the images were added over time and that the grouping evolved. Your claim that even if they images are the work of Mr. Ploessl that he has no copyright in them is incorrect (he can hold the copyright on the sketch of the images even if the underlying artwork is the PD work of the US Government). Furthermore, the number you provided me with is simply a generic number to a HR department. They don't know anything about CDs of images of emblems, nor are they authorized to give me any useful contact information for the name you mentioned.</dd>
<dd>I hadn't responded to you any further because you'd told me your version of events, so I had nothing more to say to you... and after reading the history of your interactions with Durin, I must say that I was afraid to say anything else. I'd like to assume good faith but a view of your recent history and your decision to unblock yourself (even after 'leaving') is making that rather difficult. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 06:17, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Durin and I have made peace (I think), and the core of my upsetness was that during that dispute there was some real, very scary, wiki-stalking going on where my wife was getting strange e-mails threatening her. Its been resolved, but it would upset anyone. As far as these images to which you refer, I've already said I got them from our image database at <a href="../../../n/p/r/NPRC_0e60.html" title="NPRC">NPRC</a> which has links to IOH and Randolph AFB among dozens of others. The CD I spoke of I got from Pat Ratzel. 314-801-0800 isn’t a Human resource number, its a customer service number. Did you call it and actually speak to someone? Depending on who it was, they should to at least have been able to tell you images of military medals and badges are free to use by anyone, and they should have been able to give you the number for either Randolph or the Air Force Liaison Office. If I was there, I could investigate what you were told and by who but am deployed. And, yes, I should just leave this site but this is all a bit unsettling. It seems the original problem with a block by another user in a dispute who censored my talk page has now mutated into discussions about being truthful about where these images came from. I can only state what I know. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 06:39, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As Greg says, self-unblock is a nice trap door to snare admins who don't know better than to not unblock themselves. I'm sure a surprising number of admins would fall for it. It would have been better to bring the discussion about days old disruption here first, allowing Husnock and anyone else to discuss it before the block was made. Husnock has acted poorly for weeks, and thebainer did the community no favor by blocking first, talking later. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature12_b3bf.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature12"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 06:39, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As stated above, I mean talk it out with the community, there was no cause for bainer to take the community's burden upon himself when there was no immediate urgency.

<dd>Pray enlighten me as to what <i>was</i> really special about this occasion? The community trusts few of the users as administrators for a reason; that is they <i>are expected to exercise good discretion</i> and <i>show understanding of the policies and the process</i>. There is a very good reason why the policies and the guidelines exist. Husnock has demonstrated in a very exemplery way how admin accounts can be abused.

<p>Dear Wikipedia-</p>
<p>My name is Dan Rappaport, I’m a Lieutenant Colonel attached to CENTCOM currently serving in the Middle East. In real life, I know who Husnock is and he is a pretty great guy. I’ve been on Wikipedia off and on over three years and I saw this conversation after hearing about it from Husnock. I had at first sent a strong worded letter to “Morwen” who started this thing by saying Husnock wanted to kill her. It was pretty sad that this was removed from your website as an “attack” when my point was to show to Morwen how ridiculous it was to state that a United States Naval officer, stationed in the Middle East, would want to kill her. Also, it was a slap against Husnock. The man is married and has a kid on the way. Why the fuck would he go to England to hurt some girl because she posted some crap about Star Trek? Right after all this, Husnock decides to leave this site but gets beat up even for that. His webpage is messed with, blocked from the site, and it seems the same people are showing up over and over again to run him down and say he’s wrong. Now, lets take a look at what’s happened in the last few weeks. My understanding is limited to what I can find, but here goes: 1) Husnock gets told by a guy named Durin that he’s been uploading bad images for months and he will be investigated and then he is asked to hand over addresses and phone numbers of everyone he’s talked too, including his dead grandmother or something like that. That same day, he learns that someone’s sending e-mails trying to find out who he is and then a week later his pregnant wife gets threatened when’s he overseas. Yeah, that would piss me off, too. 2) Okay, so the Durin affair ends and then he gets drawn into these articles about Star Trek. I took a look and it seems he came around about those. I don’t know your policies that well, but the whole point with that nonsense appeared to be references being called false and then, yeah, people got pretty mean with Husnock. I saw a couple of edits where he’s called names and one where he’s called crap. So, point 2, yeah that might piss me off too. 3)Now, here we are with this whole death threat bullshit. Husnock threatened no one. He told a punk kid in the UK that she had no right telling a United States armed forces member that he couldn’t edit this site. Good for him. The girl then posts for anyone to see that Husnock threatened her life and she now fears him. News flash since folks don’t know, that drew real world attention and Husnock was talked to by some authorities, including NCIS. After all, a citizen of the United Kingdom posted on a public website that a U.S. Naval Officer had threatened to kill her. Maybe you all don’t see how serious that is but I do and, you bet, that would ROYALLY piss me if it happened to me. 4) Last we come to Husnock leaving. He says he’s leaving, he tries, but again gets beat up since he came back to vote on one of your pages and then someone screws with his webpage. He tries to stop them, gets blocked, and then here we are all, beating him about it, going back to the death threat issue, and saying things about those stupid images, half of which I think Husnock deleted from your site. So, where do we stand? I think you guys have treated this fine man like total shit. But, hey this is a website, not real life, and I talked to Husnock at lunchtime he was cool with everything. He knows this is not real, do most of you? He is gone now, he really is not coming back. I just wanted to stop in and share my thoughts. I hope everyone is proud of themselves because you really have run him off for good. That’s my two cents. God Bless the USA. -Dan</p>
<p>P.S.: Husnock gave me his account password so I could post this letter since half the ip addresses in Dubai are blocked by this site. You guys should really do something about that. No one can log on or create a new account. -Dan</p>

<dd>For the record, the above is true. The account isnt compromised since I can change the password and I am leaving anyway. Please consider this as part of the conversation on the issue. It isn't vandalism and it isnt trolling. Its just someone wanting to post; I was kind of shocked to see the letter reverted in less than a minute. Also, the Dubai ip thing really needs to be looked at. Noone can create an account from an American computer system right now as there are so many ip blocksthat it makes it impossible.

<dd>It doesn't matter if you can change the password. You have given another person access to your sysop-privileged account. That is very serious. You are constantly doing something wrong and then covering up with some lamehearted excuse. You apologized for Morwen's feelings about your statement, but you only begrudgingly expressed something of an apology for the statement itself. You unblocked yourself, which is a grave abuse of admin privilege, and again gave something of an apology for what you shouldn't have done in the first place, and which you should have known not to do. Now this.

I don't know the previous accidents with the user Husnock, and my personal feelings on this are that nothing bad happened, since his admin powers haven't been abused. Since Dubai is blocked, this was (not the only one, but it was) a way to overcome the ban. In any case - please move this request to your local Arbitration Committee. Once again - if Husnock or his friend will abuse their admin privilages, please contact us - we'll desysop him for precaution right away. <a href="../../../d/a/t/User%7EDatrio_e56e.html" title="User:Datrio">Datrio</a> 12:19, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Guys, this is low Wikidrama and needs to be curtailed before it gets any more absurd. Husnock's made it pretty clear he doesn't want to be a sysop any more, so he should just make the usual statement on his Talk so we can get the sysop bit disabled, it's then up to him whether he leaves or stays around. It's be a shame ot lose him but clearly RL is too much right now so a Wikivacation looks like a great idea; he can reapply on return to normality (whatever that is). I don't feel we're doing Husnock or ourselves any favours right now. I don't think we should burn his boats for him, he's obviously been a good contributor in the past, let's just quetly walk away shall we? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:32, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Much of this reads like a comedy of errors, but there is also consistently a deeper issue. I can see Husnock being offended at the idea that he meant to harm someone... but consider his failure to understand how his threat (and it WAS a threat, of <i>something</i>) could be taken that way short-sighted. I can see Husnock's desire to 'clear his name'... but think that continuing to grouse about it on his user page, after <i>everyone</i> had agreed he didn't intend a death threat, was petty and vindictive. I can see Husnock feeling that edit warring on his user page and a one month block were inappropriate (indeed, I agree)... but can only see it as a failure of good sense to then unblock himself. I can imagine that Husnock claimed to 'not know' Dan Rappaport to avoid accusations of meat-puppetry... but giving out his password even to this 'close RL friend' was incomprehensibly unwise. I understand Husnock not knowing all the intricacies of copyright... but not his failure to drop everything and review/resolve any potential violations when the first were pointed out. I can come up with reasonable / non-malicious motivations for all these things... but a solid and trustworthy admin this is not. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 14:15, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think if someone thinks Husnock needs to be desysopped, they will start an ArbCom case request. Otherwise, once any account compromise issues are resolved, Husnock will be unblocked and be free to proceed as normal. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature12_b3bf.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature12"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 14:16, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Giving out your admins password is really bad judgement, it does not matter if you trust the person, the community decides who is trusted with admin powers.

<dd>The community decides who is trusted with admin powers, but the community (including admins) cannot desysop. That has to be done by stewards, who generally only act in an emergency or on instruction from a wikipedia's ArbCom. Sadly, it looks like this whole case will now have to go to ArbCom, even if Husnock voluntarily gives up his admin bit. There are several important issues here that I, for one, would like to see ArbCom rule on. Also, I think that Husnock, even if he doesn't seem to be listening to the concerns of the community, might react better if ArbCom ended up saying that he was wrong to do many of the things that he did. So the only question now is whether anyone is going to file an ArbCom case? Can uninvolved, third-party observers file an ArbCom case because they want the issues resolved at that level, or does it have to be the partioes involved that file the case? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 15:33, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Generally it would be one of the people involved. I'm pondering raising it myself, although that I wasn't directly involved in any of this recent actual blocking/unblocking drama/wheel-warring drama. Should I do this or should I leave it to one of the users who tried to talk to him?

<dd>The best solution would probably be for Husnock to request de-sysoping, be unblocked, leave as he intended, and then come back when/if he wishes to. Failing that an ArbCom case seems the only option and thus I have been drafting one - even though I am a largely uninvolved party. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:13, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

Giving out his password (or sockpuppetry, whichever is the case) is just the last straw. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:20, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He does not need to be unblocked to participate in arbitration. A blocked user may email statements, etc. to the arbitration committee's mailing list, to any arbitrator, or to any arbitration clerk, and they will be added to the case history. Unblocking him should be decided upon based on an estimation of his likelihood to cause further disruption, and not to defend any purported right he has to participate in arbitration (as he has none: nobody has a guaranteed right to participate in an arbitration case). <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 16:49, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A valid argument but... already did it. Further, I was not invoking some 'right' or rule in citing 'so he can participate in the ArbCom case', but rather noting my own motivation. The 'rule' for unblocking is simply the fact that the preventative purpose of the block no longer exists... Husnock's admin abilities are gone and therefor the danger of them being used by someone who has not been authorized to have them is now nil. He was earlier blocked for 'disruption', but that was IMO a questionable case and notably not restored by any admin even though Husnock had removed the block himself. As to hypothetical future disruption... I go with 'assume good faith' and deal with it IF it happens. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 17:02, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whether this Colonel is a real person or not, the entire issue boils down to the fact that an admin account's password has been compromised.

User :Mael_Num has claimed a consensus for deletion of the cited information based on a discussion in the talk page that has lasted only a few hours, and with only three contributors out of many, which is not acceptable. He has warnings for civilty on his talk page. He can be possible SPA by his contributions <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mael-Num_d733.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mael-Num">Mael-Num|contribs</a>.</p>
<p>I kindly request the admins to mediate and offer a acceptable solution to this long running (&gt;13 months) edit war. I would also request for a checkuser to be performed on <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMael-Num_eb75.html" title="User:Mael-Num">Mael-Num</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupreme_Cmdr_e687.html" title="User:Supreme Cmdr">Supreme_Cmdr</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarHawkSP_5e39.html" title="User:WarHawkSP">WarHawkSP</a> to see if there is any violation of the blocks placed under WarhawkSP and SC.<a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerr_avon_f75a.html" title="User:Kerr avon">Kerr avon</a> 01:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I mirror Kerr avon's stated concerns. Except the check user is much more complicated. Besides the 3 usernames, there are also anonymous IP addresses that have recently appeared editing the Derek Smart article and it's talk page. They all purport the same viewpoint, share writing styles (mostly) showing uncanny similarities to recently blocked WarhawkSP and Supreme_Cmdr, and always agree with each other. The IP addresses are 63.28.69.164 and 63.44.66.100, which are both Fort Lauderdale IP Addresses, where Smart lives and runs his business. Also, it should be noted that these violations may fall under <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAuto_aa00.html" title="WP:Auto">WP:Auto</a> policy because it is likely the person is Derek Smart himself. --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffness_f8de.html" title="User:Jeffness">Jeff</a> 02:19, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Addendum: I don't believe Mael-Num is a sockpuppet. Supreme_Cmdr/WarHawkSP and the IP Addresses are.

<p>I'm concerned as well. I'm concerned that there is organized off-wiki attempt to push a POV on this article that removes cited sources. As mentioned above on this page, WarHawkSP and Supreme Cmdr have been single purpose accounts blocked from editing due to this. There have been numerous more single purpose accounts and now a rash of anon edits. Checkuser is inconclusive, but did not rule out the possibility that these are socks. I mentioned above, this edit war does not appear to show signs of slowing down soon, and I believe it will likely continue until everyone is 3RR blocked, or it goes to ArbCom. We absolutely need some administrator intervention. Users are misquoting policy, especially BLP to remove cited, reliable material.

<p><b>Note</b>: I'm working with Mael-Num to try to keep him civil and try to find a reasonable solution to this. I guess you could call it informal mediation. However, I do think this case would be good for a formal mediation attempt, which I have neither the time nor the interest for conducting myself (not to mention I'm not AMA). I agree with InShaneee. This page needs to be full protected, a mediation needs to be conducted, administrator oversight towards those who continue to be uncivil needs to be enforced with short blocks, and hopefully this can be fixed without the time and frustration of an ArbCom case. Unfortunately, I think that it will end up coming to that otherwise.

<p>I've fully protected. It's getting hard to keep track of all the <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">SPAs</a> on that article. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">Steel</a> 12:48, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm requesting a moderate length block on WarHawkSP: after agreeing to mediation, and after the article was protected, WarHawkSP is now deleting comments off the user talk that disagree with his position. He cites WP:BLP as his validation, and calls it vandalism, but the comments he deleted were a) opinion and not subject to libel, b) nothing that would even be considered a personal attack if you were to subsitute a wikipedia editors name in, and c) directly related to the validity of inclusion of a link in the article, which is why the page is protected in the first place.</p>
<p>WarHawk is a single purpose account, that has been blocked for 3RR on this account. It's inconclusive as to whether he is a sockpuppet or not. I'm requesting a block length of 48 hours so that further talk page discussion can go on undisrupted by him. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 01:54, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as I know, reverting someone's opinion on a talk page is considered bad taste, and to do so while WP:BITING them by declaring them to be vandals, and this is a continuation of his prior behavior on the page which is full of personal attacks and incivility (not that there hasn't been that on all sides). It's one thing to be incivil, it's another to be incivil, remove someone's valid talk point opinions, and then call them vandals over it. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 09:54, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I am posting this in order to solve the problem of overload of edits by uncooperative editors on the NLP article. I believe a helpful warning to stop editors making ridiculous amounts of edits in a day will help. And if it is deemed that meatpuppets or sockpuppets are an issue, then take the appropriate action. The NLP article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> seems to have been under attack from either sockpuppets or meatpuppets of user Comaze. User Comaze runs a company (Comaze.com) in Australia promoting strategic ties with NLP companies as is in evidence on his userpage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Comaze" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Comaze" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>[ <a href="http://www.comaze.com/links.html" class="external free" title="http://www.comaze.com/links.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.comaze.com/links.html</a>][ <a href="http://www.comaze.com/biography.html" class="external free" title="http://www.comaze.com/biography.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.comaze.com/biography.html</a>]. The activities involve pushing for the same POV (deletion of relevant views on the talkpage using the same language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>). They have also been removing relevant scientific views from the article on a regular basis. This also involves removing criticisms from the opening thus creating an unrepresentative opening <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;offset=20061214133745&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;offset=20061214133745&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=94060030&amp;oldid=94054773" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=94060030&amp;oldid=94054773" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>[ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=93542877&amp;oldid=93534538" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=93542877&amp;oldid=93534538" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=93542877&amp;oldid=93534538</a>]. The strategy seems to be one of confusion and they have made a vast amount of undiscussed edits over the past few days. They also seem to be resisting efforts to calm down in a quite uncivil way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=94455739&amp;oldid=94453370" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=94455739&amp;oldid=94453370" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. Comaze seems to be using the anonymous editors: 210.50.221.248 and 58.178.102.143 as meatpuppets or sockpuppets which both seem to be Australian IPs according to an IP check, or are using the same editing pattern as Comaze <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=94060030&amp;oldid=94054773" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=94060030&amp;oldid=94054773" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. They seem to be only editing on the NLP article and have arrived only recently to support Comazes promotional pov. The situation makes it impossible to edit constructively on the article and indeed the evidence shows Comaze and related suspected sockpuppets/meatpuppets to be highly uncooperative. The incivility and uncooperative editing seems to have pushed an editor away already and I am pretty much sick of it also. A well placed warning may well prove to be a good solution but its all up to you. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 04:55, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In reply, compare the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=94646692&amp;oldid=94645724" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=94646692&amp;oldid=94645724" rel="nofollow">now</a> with a version from few weeks ago I think you'll find the current one is of much higher standard. As AB states I have collaborated with the other editors including 210.50.221.248 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_210.50.221.248_6297.html" title="Special:Contributions/210.50.221.248">contribs</a>), 58.178.102.143 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.178.102.143_2e16.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.178.102.143">contribs</a>) over the last few weeks. I think the page is improving. I believe these editors arrived affter the AN/I, checkuser and request for page protection that I requested on <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">AlanBarnet</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlanBarnet_dbcb.html" title="User talk:AlanBarnet">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AlanBarnet_1aca.html" title="Special:Contributions/AlanBarnet">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_AlanBarnet_6e07.html" title="Special:Blockip/AlanBarnet">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>). In response to the allegation that I have sockpuppets. This is unfounded. While the IP locator shows those IPs are located in Australia. I have no idea who they are specifically. I was surprised how well we work together though. When we had disagreement we would find a comprimise and move on. We have worked together to check the current document. Fix all the references which were broken, provide links so we could check facts. AlanBarnet claims that I have a NLP promotion business. While I have been involved in a the NLP Research Project (Australia, 2006) and have trained in NLP. My business is primarily in freelance web design and programming. I am also a student studying cogntive science. I really do not enjoy the adversarial that AlanBarnet has taken. It makes wikipedia less enjoyable and scares off legitimate professionals and academics. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComaze_7cd3.html" title="User:Comaze">Comaze</a> 07:35, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This in addition to the overdose of edits (that involve compromising the integrity of the article) over the past few days is going to make reasonable discussion or editing impossible. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 08:12, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did nothing of the sort. I that editor to email me to to make suggestions on how to make the article more critical (as in objective/wikipedian). While this editor was banned for incivility (including for defamatory remarks directed on me and for personal attacking the mentors). He did make some well-research critical contributions to the article in the past. I really don't think the collaboration of the article over the last few weeks has "involve[d] compromising the integrity of the article". As I said it has improved and has sparked additional research. I'm trying to extend good faith here. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComaze_7cd3.html" title="User:Comaze">Comaze</a> 09:02, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am user 58 and 210, an independent editor to Comaze. There is no checkuser evidence nor edit-style evidence to assert otherwise. I've been editing at wikipedia since early 2005.

Just resistance to direct quotes and Comaze and other IP numbers adding lots of argument to promote NLP or to negate science views. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 04:19, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello this is Fainites, the only editor currently on the blighted NLP page not yet accused of sockpuppetry although probably now about to be accused of smugness. 1)There is problem with substantial undiscussed edits being put in over a short space of time because it upsets other editors. However, this partly arises because half the editors are on the other side of the world to the other half so everybody is on different timescales. However, Comaze has always been amenable to discussion, consensus and changes to edits as far as I can see and alot of the edits on that occasion filled in stubs giving everybody something to work on. 2) There is a problem with bad temper and assumptions of bad faith leading to ill thought out reversions to much older versions resulting in alot of hard work on sources and verification being removed. One recent example of both these problems together was the removal by Comaze of the second half of the Research Reviews section at 12.09 on 13.12.06 to the NLP Science article and the subsequent reversion to a much older form by AlanBarnet losing agreed edits and leaving the whole section a mess of half sentances, non sequiteurs and duplications. However, on a positive note, AlanBarnet agreed to put back the more recent edited version and when I sorted out the duplications and whatnots, the removal of the research has not been repeated. So there is hope. 3)Everybody appears to agree that sources need to to be verified. This involves alot of work as there are still past inaccuracies in references and POV statements hanging around in the article. However, the bad temper and accusations and large undiscussed edits not only slow work down but have just frightened off a valuable new editor who was a science researcher and very adept at hunting down and verifying scientific sources and quotes. 4)I think in the context of this article it is unwise for AlanBarnet to put in old negative views from old disputed versions from banned editors, with references, stating it has all been checked and verified but not providing evidence of what the source states at the time. It was inevitable that this would lead to accusations of sockpuppetry, whether they are justified or not. It would be better to assess the source afresh and agree an addition based on that with other editors. 5) alot of good collaborative work has gone on recently. Lets try and keep it that way. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFainites_e96a.html" title="User:Fainites">Fainites</a> 14:29, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Having compared the version from December 1 with the current version, it seems to me very much as if Comaze and a few others are promoting rather than documenting the concept. The article becomes more promotional with each batch of edits, and the fundamental fact that NLP is essentially a cult with no scientific validity is more and more obscured. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 15:31, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The fact that something has no scientific validity does not make it a cult. That's a seperate question. If you have any verifiable evidence that NLP is a cult, please come and put it in, in the section that already contains reputable views to the same effect. As for promo, the section marked 'views of supporters in various disciplines' is empty and has been for a while, whilst the sections marked 'research', 'views of critics' and 'mental health' are full of nothing but criticism and views to the effect that there is no scientific basis to NLP. The article needs watching to ensure it is not taken over by either camp. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFainites_e96a.html" title="User:Fainites">Fainites</a> 21:43, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Two things. Firstly, NLP is fundamentally a seminar and consulting based personal development field (and it is definitely unclear whether it is also a cult, a psychocult, a good idea, a bad idea, a pseudoscience, a protoscience, a dangerous practice, therapeutic magic, or anything else). Secondly, <a href="../../../c/a/b/WP%7ECABAL_ad8b.html" title="WP:CABAL">there is no cabal</a> of editors in either camp. Please treat editors as individuals.

<dd>Hello Guy. Thanks for your input. I've been editing on various articles I know something about or have access to sources such as journalism articles and various historical and geographical areas. I've been removing any argumentative phrasing (usually very little) from those articles and found no resistance at all. I spent a lot of time having to remove a massive amount of argumentative and overblown phrasing from the NLP article during the end of Nov and early Dec. I met nothing but resistance from Comaze and other numbers who scream bloody murder over the simple NPOV correction. They're still making a massive amount of edits per day. I don't see how anyone can conduct proper cooperative or rigorous verifications in such a way. I'm pretty much done with it. I have WPjournalism articles to edit with editors who are willing to collaborate and I know I'll get cooperation. I really hope things can be resolved on the NLP article. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 04:28, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I din't mean to imply that there were existing camps now on the site but there clearly have been in the past and may well be again. It sems to be a subject about which feelings run high.<a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFainites_e96a.html" title="User:Fainites">Fainites</a> 13:21, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Guy pointed me to the conflict of interest policy. I have read it and agree with it in principle. It does suggest that editors should dislose their interests where there may be a conflict. My interests are written on my talk page. And aim to base my edits on reliable, verifiable literature. The current editors all know that I am a student of NLP. I am also a student of cognitive science and computer science with an interest in psychology. That does not stop me from editing on the cognitive science or computer science articles. Nonetheless, I will hold myself to a higher standard for verifiability, and reliability of evidence. While being an student in the field is not required, it can help. I intend help write a balanced article by collaborating with the other editors who have different views to arrive at a balanced article. Keep in mind that I have gone through mediation, arbitration and mentorship and have learnt alot about wikipedia policy. I have read the conflict of interest article and will be more critical in my writing on those articles especially where there may be a conflict. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComaze_7cd3.html" title="User:Comaze">Comaze</a> 02:46, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sandcat_fec8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sandcat">Special:Contributions/Sandcat</a>. They have about 50+ images (of about 150 total edits), all which appear not to be used anywhere on Wikipedia, or possible to use on Wikipedia. They have 5 edits to article namespace (I'm not counting sandboxes). Worse, these images appear to be used as part of a website, as there is a 404 image and a "news" image and other such items. Lastly, this seems to clearly be a child/teenager so handling this with kid gloves should be mandatory. I don't really want to clog up IFD listing all these, nor spend the time listing 50 images, which is why I'm here. I'd like someone to leave a note saying this isn't appropriate for Wikipedia. They could also suggest taking a graphic design or computer graphics class. I say that not because of the poor quality, but because she (guessing) appears to have an interesting in computer art and it would be encouraging. I'm worried I cannot write a polite or neutral enough message. Lastly, I would want all of the images deleted per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a free file host. If I do need to list all these I will.

<p><i>(edit conflict)</i> I've seen this guy revert war on several templates, and I've seen him be uncivil to another user about one. He had the block coming; he's been warned enough about his incivility on other pages by other users. He chose to continue. Because of that, I felt a one week block was justified. I'm not going to blame anything on the first block because how a person behaves is up to them.

<p>Tasc already had three civility warnings on his talk page (I did not count inside the archives) when he began the exchange at <a href="../../../l/g/b/Template_talk%7ELGBT_cad2.html" title="Template talk:LGBT">Template talk:LGBT</a> that earned him his fourth. This is also not counting the civility warning by J Di at 19:03, 12 December 2006 (UTC) on the template talk page. So the civility warning that Tasc flamed in response to was the second one regarding this particular situation. The whole incident began out of Tasc's decision to revert war instead of seek consensus, behavior for which Tasc had been blocked at least five times previously (plus one earlier civility block). In light of the earlier civility block and two directly related civility warnings, after demonstrated disregard for consensus, I do not think that the week-long block was excessive. Upon viewing the block log and noting that so many previous shorter blocks had failed to get the point across, a week sounds like a very reasonable next step. I also don't think that apology for a death threat should reduce the block. If indefinite blocks are given for <i>anything</i>, what is more serious than a death threat? — <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 19:42, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So many previous shorter blocks? I have no personal interest in this case, I don't know Tasc and had never heard the name before reading this thread. But I think it worth pointing out that before the incident described here, Tasc's bloc log consisted in tutti, since March 2006, of three 3RR blocks plus one 24-hour block for edit warring, plus one--count 'em--<i>one</i> 48-hour block for "incivility, removing tags". This, which was also his latest previous block, was logged in May 2006. Tasc has been blocked for incivility once since joining Wikipedia. His block log has been clean from May to December. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 00:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC).</dd>

Tasc is being very rude and angry, yes, I don't like that, OK, but please focus on the timestamps here:<br />
18:10, JDil: Remain <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>. You won't be warned again.<br />
18:14, Tasc: Find yourself a better job, than putting those terrible colours on my talk page.<br />
18:15, JDil: You've been blocked for a week.<br />
18:17, Tasc: Go fuck yourself, idiot.<br />
18:19, JDil: Your block has been extended to two weeks.<br />
18:22 Tasc: What part of "Fuck off" don't you understand? (This is the one with the edit sum "one more signature on my talk page and I'll fucking kill you")<br />
18:23, JDil: You have been indefinitely blocked for making threats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Etcetera. From civility warning to indefinite block in 13 minutes. I have to feel sorry for the guy without the power in this exchange. That's not to accuse JDil of deliberate baiting--I'm sure he was simply angry himself, too--but those admin responses are just much too quick. I would ask any admin issuing warnings to not do it with a machine gun, but give the user a real chance to cool down between bursts--to make pauses. This escalates much too fast.</li>
<li>Secondly, no, I don't agree that "I'll fucking kill you" is a death threat. OK, "I'll kill you" is a death threat, but with "fucking" in there, it's not, it's just an expression of anger. It's a <i>technical</i>death threat, but hands up, anybody who's actually scared by it. Heck, I scare real easy, and even I'm not frightened.</li>
<li>Thirdly, I don't like to see an indefinitely blocked user with a fully protected talkpage. That means a full gag. Tasc has not specified a valid e-mail address, and now that he's blocked, it's too late, he has no way of doing it; in other words he has no means of e-mailing JDil or anybody else to argue, or to apologize. The page has remained protected for a day and a half; if the user is ever going to cool down, he probably has; I appeal to JDil to unprotect and invite himto apologize for his angry outbursts. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 10:16, 16 December 2006 (UTC).</li>

<dd>Bish, since you asked me to comment, here goes: I disagree with you about there being an appreciable difference between saying "I'll kill you" and "I'll fuckin kill you."

<dd>I want point out that the 18:10 civility warning was not the first one in this incident, it was the first one on tasc's talk page. See my comments above "Objections" for the details. And consider that "I'll kill you, motherfucker" is also a common expression of anger, but the intent of the statement still rings clear. Whether the expletive is inserted at the end or in the middle of the sentence is merely a linguistic curiosity. — <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 19:53, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that this escalated very quickly, and the block for a week because Tasc said "Find yourself a better job, than putting those terrible colours on my talk page," was perhaps provocative.

<dd>The Israel-Lebanon conflict is a different matter, I daresay. While death threats are bad and certainly merit an indef block, I believe that blocking one's opponent for a week for "Find yourself a better job, than putting those terrible colours on my talk page" was a sort of baiting and did not conform to our blocking policy. When you are young and feel powerless in a dispute, you tend to use very strong language. I advise to leave the indef block in force but to unprotect the talk page. Then we'll be able to see whether Tasc regrets his unacceptable behaviour. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 17:31, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't block tasc for that comment alone, and I wouldn't block anybody over something so trivial unless they'd already been uncivil towards other people.

I am rather concerned that this will be a waste of everybody's time and energy, and be unnecessarily demoralising for Sarah, who I think is one of our better admins. Canuckster's case seems to be that Sarah ought to apologise to him for saying he was anti-American, when even a very casual trawl of his contributions revealed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liberal_Party_of_Canada_leadership_convention%2C_2006&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83835936" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liberal_Party_of_Canada_leadership_convention%2C_2006&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83835936" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<p>If my suspicions about this account being a sockpuppet of Ottawaman turn out to be unfounded, I will be the first to apologise.

<p>I think this person's behavior shows a resemblence to Hollow Wilerding/Eternal Equinox/Velten: he has some kind of obsession with <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Ignatieff_85c9.html" title="Michael Ignatieff">Michael Ignatieff</a> - he probably thinks that he can somehow "own" that article by edit warring, attacks, etc. Furthermore, Ottawaman claimed to "quit" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ottawaman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86488188" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ottawaman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86488188" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ottawaman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86488234" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ottawaman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86488234" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, but since this has now been disproven above, I think it is highly likely that he will (at least attempt to) come back under a new identity and begin this whole cycle over again.</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, I'm not exactly sure if a community ban is necessarily needed at this point. Since I noticed that the vast majority of this person's edits are to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Ignatieff_85c9.html" title="Michael Ignatieff">Michael Ignatieff</a>, I'd suggest the following: (1) restriction to only one registered account; (2) ban from editing <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Ignatieff_85c9.html" title="Michael Ignatieff">Michael Ignatieff</a> and related articles, and (3) prohibition from interacting with Sarah Ewart &amp; other users he harasses. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScobell302_092b.html" title="User:Scobell302">Scob</a><a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScobell302_Esperanza_f3d2.html" title="User:Scobell302/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScobell302_906e.html" title="User talk:Scobell302">ll302</a> 09:45, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>FWIW, I would prefer a community ban over restricted editing. Eternal Equinox at least tried to improve articles. Ottawaman, on the other hand, has shown a singular focus on smearing Michael Ignatieff. Some of his accounts have even been used for vandalism (eg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Michael_Ignatieff&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83754145" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Michael_Ignatieff&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83754145" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>). I don't believe his contributions this far justify allowing him to edit at all and I don't think that he will honor any restrictions anyway. <b>Sarah Ewart</b> 22:48, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not an admin, but have contributed to the Ignatieff article for the past while and watched the article closely even longer (I have an interest in human rights and humanitarian law). For the longest time these sockpuppets (Ottawaman / Neutralizer / 64.229.*.* / 67.71.*.* / 70.48.*.* / Etc) often "contributed" badly written POV edits on the article and bullied other editors with accusations of "sanitization" or being "PAID PRO-IGGY ORGANIZERS" when balance was attempted in content. The sockpuppets were easily identified by their editing style: pov plus multiple reverts with capitalized accusations such as "REVERTING PRO-IGGY EDITS!!". Some edits contributed by these puppets were, as Sarah points out, clearly smears, such as the instance where some ridiculous content about "Ignatieff" popping up in the "Yahoo searches" for "pornography" was added<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michael_Ignatieff/Archive2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michael_Ignatieff/Archive2" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>; this was not mere vandalism, each of the above sock puppets contributed to the discussion attempting to feign consensus to have the content added. On another occasion, a story was fabricated on Wikinews and used as a source to add content about Ignatieff's private life, including his divorce and children. Outrageously, one editor (Joel Bastedo) who attempted to stop the smear was accused of working on the Ignatieff campaign! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michael_Ignatieff/Archive5#Joel_Bastedo_might_work_for_Ignatieff.27s_campaign.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michael_Ignatieff/Archive5#Joel_Bastedo_might_work_for_Ignatieff.27s_campaign.3F" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> This sort of thing continued for months until Sarah had the courage to do something about the abuse and she has apparently suffered accordingly. I commend her for that. This sort of conduct really undermines the credibility and useability of wikipedia; it must be dealt with effectively. I can't see how a simple edit restriction would do the trick. - <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinnegans_wake_2c5a.html" title="User:Finnegans wake">Finnegans wake</a> 16:45, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have had a look at about 20 different pages regarding this. It would seem that if anyone had a very clear conflict of political interest here it was you. You have some sort of irritant with these people and are clearly opposed to them. I therefore think you should not be leading the comments on this. As you say, "at the time", but it apears from what I have read he was not personally in a position to threaten anyone, so presumably he was warning others. Surely that sort of thing should be taken in the spirit it is offered? In any case it was all a long time ago.

<li>No. The problem here was that Sussexman and a bunch of other anonymous IPs started making legal threats against myself and other users without any attempt to play by the Wikipedia policy. I recieved a solicitors letter and was labelled as 'scum' by a small core of this users assosciates, something which I did not enjoy.

<dd>I understand Earle's bafflement, but I also understand what Essjay is trying to say. The problem lies in explaining the degree of certainty, which if not expressed well can lead to confusion.

<dd>Ummm, actually, it's pretty basic that a significant number of IPs are statically assigned, or only semi-dynamically (that is, they stay the same for months on end).

<dd>It is Ottawaman/Canuckster/etc. However, he uses dynamic Bell Sympatico IPs and comes straight back with a new IP soon after being blocked. For this reason, I've always tried to use short blocks. I think even a week long block will have collateral damage. <b>Sarah Ewart</b> 00:56, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"I must say that I agree with Guinnog that the downside completely outweighs any minor positive contributions Ottawaman might make. If he was going to become a productive editor, I think he would have done so by now. He has shown here and on Wikinews that he has no interest in following policies and simply has an anti-American, anti-Ignatieff agenda to push. An interesting block log [104] and edits from the same ISP [105]. Sarah Ewart 01:09, 17 December 2006 (UTC) - - I'd like to note that the vicious attack above was entirely unprovoked. Sarah said she would gladly unprotect my user space. She did not. She said above "And I'm warning him now that this is his last chance"; now she says she does not want to give another chance; she accuses me of having an "anti-american agenda" which is a blatant lie and she makes all kinds of other crazy accusations. The anti-american slur is particularly libelous and, these days, a potentially harmful accusation to make. I did say that Ignatieff's allegiance to the US should have been in his article but at most I am anti-Bush foreign policy. Perhaps Sarah thinks Cindy Sheehan is also anti-american. It is shameful that here on Wikipedia I am having to defend my political opinions in this way. I came to this noticeboard to ask for help with the userspace protection issue. That has been settled by an admin. who unprotected the space. I then tried to remove this incident report that I placed here but was told I could not. If Sarah (or anyone else) wishes to be making ongoing and false accusations I am willing to engage in dispute resolution but I do not think this is the place. In the meantime I hope her supporters here will encourage her not to continue with the libelous namecalling. Canuckster 02:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC) - I didn't unprotect your pages because you didn't actually ask me until after I had gone offline and when I came back and received your message, it had already been done. I never said I would "gladly unprotect [your] user space". What I said was I would have if you'd bothered to ask me. Please stop twisting my words. As for whether you get a second chance, I'm leaving that in the hands of the community. As for you being anti-American, the evidence is in your edits. Sarah Ewart 03:25, 17 December 2006 (UTC) - Please show us my "anti-american" edits. I'll call that bluff. Canuckster 03:29, 17 December 2006 (UTC) - I've no interest whatsoever in what you want and I'm not going to be trawling through the contribs of your various accounts for diffs. You've wasted more than enough time over the last six months and I'm not wasting anymore on you. The edits made by your various sock puppets have indicated a deliberate intent to smear Michael Ignatieff and a decided anti-American slant, something which contributed to you being community banned from Wikinews.

<dd>This brings up an issue which I believe needs addressing. Blocking users with usernames that could be deemed offensive (excluding trolls) happens very frequently and at the judgement of of the blocking administrator only. I believe (and I have been guilty of this myself) that far too often, a potentially useful user with a username that is deemed mildy offensive is blocked without warning within seconds or miutes of registering. Indeed, with some of the obscurely offensive usernames that get reported to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> sometimes, it seems like some of those trawling the user creation log are playing a giant game of whac-a-mole. I propose that except in the case of usernames that are deemed wildly offensive (including but not limited to swearing etc), the user with the offending name has a politely worded template added to their talk page with a request to change their username (or just get a new account) and newbie friendly directions on how to do so. This template should also have a category in it or some way for a bot to organise them so any usernames that have not been changed after a set period (say a week) get dumped to another page where they can be blocked by admins and the {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameblock_b304.html" title="Template:Usernameblock">usernameblock</a>}} template be added. If this proposal gains some momentum/support, I ask that someone with skills mock up an appropriate template to fit the above. It would also be good to approach one or more of the bot owners with bots that currently complete tasks similar to that which I have outlined and ask them if they would be willing to add this task to their bot. (once again - none come to mind, but I am sure someone will think of some)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To expand on the "whats deemed offensive" issue. We need to establish some sort of consensus as to how far we take the potentially offensive boundaries. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, so it could be argued that outside of the troll accounts like Christians are fags (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Christians_are_fags_2465.html" title="Special:Contributions/Christians are fags">contribs</a>), no good faith account that doesnt violate the other <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a> rules like non-commercial or non-latin characters (for example) should be blocked for having an offensive username, even if they are encouraged to change it and don't. However as current policy precludes <i>"Inflammatory usernames"</i> we need to work out some sort of system to determine what exactly is inflamatroy and what is being over-sensitive or rigidly enforcing the rules for no good purpose. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:10, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I second this. The indef-blocks with no prior warning have a bite-like effect and are unnecessary in most cases. I'd also extend that to other criteria such as the non-Latin characters one (that rule will need to be reviewed soon anyway, once we have wikimedia-wide single usernames). <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 09:27, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Any figures on the "very frequently"? Last time I did any looking into this the number of blocks based on username over a 24 hour period was less then 1% of all accounts created. I didn't look further to exclude the very obviously offensive, but I would guess that the borderline cases were a small fraction of that. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 10:45, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree on the BITE issue; <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a> already says but should be emphasized: <i>Co-operative contributors should normally just be made aware of our policy via a post on their talk page. Voluntary changes (via <a href="../../../c/h/a/Wikipedia%7EChanging_username_3d5c.html" title="Wikipedia:Changing username">Wikipedia:Changing username</a>) are preferred: users from other countries and/or age groups may make mistakes about choosing names -- immediate blocking or listing on RfC could scare off new users acting in good faith.</i> <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2006-12-18 10:11Z</small></i></span>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure I entirely agree, without reference to this precise case: Immediately reverting a new users edits may scare someone off, a bite like effect, if that edit is unsourced rumour in a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">BLP</a> situation it is exactly the right thing to do, similarly a truly inappropriate (offensive, confusing etc. etc.) is still inappropriate no matter who owns it or how long it has been created gor. As with <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> isn't a call to look the other way. To my mind immedidate (i.e. point of creation) blocking in many cases is preferable to blocking after an edit or two, provided the situation is explained and creation of a new username simple, then it isn't the rather emotive "Biting", but good housekeeping. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 10:39, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think immediate blocking to be in order, because I think it quite probable that a user so encumbered upon his initial attempt to contribute (under an account) to the project will not readily appreciate why his account has been blocked and will be unlikely to return. Except in such cases as a username is plainly inflammatory and disruptive (e.g., User:Jewish people suck ass, as against User:Jewish), it is, I imagine, as Viridae and Quarl seem to suggest, appropriate that we instead welcome the user and suggest concomitantly that his editing might go more smoothy were he to change his username. If an editor whose username is troublesome is indeed here to disrupt or in any event to contribute other-than-constructively, such tendency will be borne out in his reply to such a suggestion or in his editing, and we ought not to risk the loss a prospectively good contributor because we apprehend some nebulous tendency to disrupt in his name and (as sometimes seems to happen) impute to him malign motive. If an editor contributes constructively but is particularly unwilling to change his username and if such username has seemed to be disruptive or inflammatory, surely an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html#NAME" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC#NAME</a> should be in order, and surely a constructive editor will straightaway change his username upon the community's expressing a preference for such change. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:48, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"upon his initial attempt to contribute (under an account) ..." and how is that not true of reverting the unsubstantiated, potentially libelous rumour they add to an article? <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> isn't a permission for new accounts to ignore policy, or a call for us to walk on egg shells. Yes we need to be sensible and proportionate, but lets not lose sight of the project and its purpose. There are 1000s upon 1000s of usernames created everyday. A small amount of those get blocked as blatantly inappropriate usernames a very small number of those are arguably borderline cases. My own experience has been those I've queried a blocking of (those which seem at worst borderline), often the blocking admin has quite a different take on the name to my view and so doesn't even see it as borderline. Context of creation is also important, we have for instance one user who mass creates socks created relating to WTC, anti-jewish etc. etc. so a name which normally may be borderline might be merely caught up in the middle of such a session etc. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 13:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There actually is a <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristian_3dad.html" title="User:Christian">User:Christian</a>, which doesn't seem to have caused any controversy. (Of course, in that case "Christian" actually does seem to be the guy's real first name.) If "Christian" is acceptable as a username, why not "Jewish"?

<dd>The difference between Jewish and Christian is that Christian is a first name, and that this user Christian probably had no religious connotations with his name.

<dd>While I'm all for blocking users based on usernames that are offensive (e.g., User:Nigger, even though it might be a self-identified black, User:God, or even User:Osama), perhaps we ought to give a rehash on whether we want to block any user with a religious part of their username unless the editor is patently editing against that perceived bias. For example, I believe User:Allah was around to push anti-Muslim propaganda. But if User:Jewish is indeed Jewish, then he/she should not be blocked. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 15:05, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

If wiki is to make assumptions about reader intelligence at that level, we'd get nothing done. I think what is really at the core here is certain activist admins busily spreading their political views around Wiki have a problem with anyone writing anything which might potentially disagree with their party line, yet appearing to come from the same community.

<dd>A new user with a name confusingly similar to an admin shows up out of the blue at the admin's talk page to complain about the block of a sock puppeteer. I may be missing something here, but why is that an unjust block?

<dd>Look I just wanted to say that it is painfully obvious to all that have looked into it that I am not a sockpuppet of Enknowed. It isn't fair to damage my reputation by making random claims. I asked a question (I'm sorry I didn't make this clear above) about a certain user and I was fairly pleased with starblind's response. However that in no way should make me a sockpuppet that get's no explanation. A nice a message somewhere saying that it was because my username and had nothing to do with my edits, would of been nice and much well recieved. It seems to me that my reputation has been damaged. Is this what administrators do?? You ask a question about one of their blocks give a nice answer then block you almost immediatly as a sockpuppet of the user you were asking about?? It points out my comment to starblind in the first place, he blocked Enknowed for being a sockpuppet too. It seems if you don't love a user it is easy enough to claim he is a sockpuppet. I remember reading about the case, and starblind or another user saying that though the edits were close together after Silentbob got blocked and thus his ip that he could of run down to the library and started vandelising wikipedia around 30 mins after his block (this dosn't seem probable too me). It just seems to me that it has become way too easy for admins to say someone is a sockpuppet of another user without any evidence, except weak links. This was my complaint in the first place. Block a user for reasons not for weak sockpuppet links!!! Instead of starblind getting this point, instead he blocks me for (in part) being a sockpuppet. Well I am sorry for trying to make a constructive point about wikipedia. BTW look at his response to my comment he then gives a nice response without any indication of the impending block on me. It just dosn't seem fair, and those 20 edits were fairly big (including 2 article creations) and I don't really feel like wasting more of my time creating a reputation. This may be the end of the line for this user.--<a href="../../../1/5/1/User%7E151.204.56.2.html" title="User:151.204.56.2">151.204.56.2</a> 23:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Ok I have calmed down a bit though I still believe I was wrongly done by, but I have a new humorus username TheWikipedianFormallyKnownAsStarblindy I hope this doesn't upset anyone and I will recieve no more problems from administrators. If I am blocked again for being a sockpuppet of Enknowed as I will be making very obvious that I am the same user as starblindy, who according to starblind is the same user as Enknowed, well lets just saying stuff will happen.

<p>I wonder how many of us remember the process to create an account. if our first choice of name fails, and only then, we get this message:</p>

<p>Simply choose a username and password and click "create account". All usernames must begin with a capitalized letter. Do not use an e-mail address as your username. You are not required to share your e-mail address, but providing one is the only way to retrieve a forgotten password. Your username must not contain:</p>

<p>The salient part is <i>names of celebrities, notable world figures or events, or known Wikipedians</i>. I suppose that means that one should not then choose a prefix or a suffix of one's rejected user name, but it really ios not clear. We have plenty of registered unknown wilipedians. I place myself in that category!</p>
<p>If the user name registers without a hitch I assume no such message appears.</p>
<p>So, ignoring totally any accusations of sock puppetry for Star... what shoudl he have done in the first case, assuming his registration went through straight away? Under those circumstances a block (etc) does seem unfair and cliquey.</p>
<p>If we ignore the individual for the moment, surely the process is incorrect. My user ID, for example. <i>Timtrent</i>. What if someome registers <i>Timothytrent</i>? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 13:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We should <i>never</i> ignore the individual. I can't think of names off the top of my head (someone can help me out here), but we've had a number of editors with very similar usernames over the years. In general, where those editors have both been useful, productive members of the community, we leave them be. Coincidences happen, after all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, in <i>this</i> case, Starblind<i>y</i> went and posted a critical message on Starblind's talk page as his <i>eleventh</i> edit. Even if this were an innocent coincidence, it would be darned confusing to have Starblind and Starblind<i>y</i> arguing back and forth. There's a near-infinite number of possible usernames out there; it's not that difficult to choose another one. (And to choose one that isn't making a point.)</dd>

<dd>Let me turn your last question around.

Third, after changing his username to User:TheWikipedianFormallyKnownAsStarblindy he was clearly <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">illustrating a point</a>.

<dd>I think it is important, in this and any case, to ignore the user until there is a true reason to investigate properly and with the correct tools. The reason is because the user's actions and the user's name must be considered different things. Thus the user's actions dictate whether a block (etc) is appropriate, and the user's name identifies that user as a unique editor unless proven otherwise.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Taking the question about a user with a similar id to mine arriving at my talk page, or anywhere I have edited, the first reaction is mild perplexity. The correct next reaction is <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">the assumption of good faith</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is nothing to stop me from questioning that user politely, and nothing to stop me from asking fellow editors for their thoughts, but, unless and until proven otherwise, I believe that editor has the right to an id similar to mine. I must assukme, because those are the guidelines withun which we work, that there was no malicious intent. That other editor has as much right to question me and my actions as I have to question them and their actions.</dd>

<dd>I have read the thread in detail, yes. I see that there are issues, but cannot be clear if they were caused by assumption, or are real. I am not an admin and do not have access to the admin toolset.</dd>
<dd>I am concerned that the admin who made the initial block is the one with a similar username. I am not accusing that admin of anything, please let us be clear on that. I simply see it as not best practice to block yourself someone with whom you are in disgareement. My first thoughts were I that admin, would be to ask my fellow admins for a review of my actions, and present my reasons.</dd>
<dd>The remainder hangs upon that review. I believe until proven otherwise, that the user must be considered innocent and good faith assumed. Thus, if the block is rescinded, all else must go as well. That block should be viewed as a causative element to the rest of the behaviour by the user. I agree that this behaviour was not of the best, but I can also see that they coudl feel agrieved at an unjustified block.</dd>
<dd>If the initial block is upheld then the user's behaviour should be examined, as should the subsequent block on the humorous user name. That block seemed to me to be rather hastier than desirable. It was humour, rather than malice if we assume good faith.</dd>
<dd>From a non admin's perspective this user does not appear to be a sock puppet. Assuming good faith can be hard when there is a user of few edits who makes a complaint to an admin about a sock puppetry blocking. But we should also look atthe quality of that user's edits (I have not done so) as well as the quantity.</dd>
<dd>When things blow up like this it is important to be seen to be even handed and open minded. This means that, whiel actions must be taken fast to protect wikipedia from an assumed malicious user, those actions must be open to scrutiny and documented well. These look less than well documented, and more like a battle in which the user is the underdog. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 14:36, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is worth bearing in mind that choosing a username <i>is</i> an action. That username wasn't given to him by his parents at birth; it was a deliberate choice made by this person. Coupled with some of his other behaviour, it is difficult to sustain any further assumption of good faith. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 14:21, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is true, but often usernames are fashioned from experiences and interests without regard to the context in which they are being used; for instance, someone who really really liked Tom Jones music might want 'LoveTJMusic' as a username - it's not fate, but it's influenced by things so outside the context of Wikipedia that it might as well be considered fate in some cases. Nonetheless, it is a choice and <s>inflexibility</s> flexibility on the part of an editor in altering a username something that should be expected of a good-faith contributor. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 14:39, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not disgaree with you, and yet I still see separate compartments here. A username is a username. It is a unique key valu einthe database and distinguishes one person from another. It may not be desirable that his user is is one character different from another user, but it is not "unlawful"</dd>
<dd>The other actions must be considered as other actions.

<p>I swear this will be the last thing I'll say on the subject: in regards to impartiality, if Starblindy registers a new name XOPOPOREHRITRIX and three months down the line finds XOPOPOREHRITRIXTER has registered an account and who contacts XOPOPOREHRITRIX in XOPOPOREHRITRIXTER's 5th edit to make a comment about a user that it is unlikely XOPOPOREHRITRIXTER (being a new user) would have had contact with I will do my utmost as a wikipedia administrator to protect XOPOPOREHRITRIX from impersonation.

<dd>the user ID is a key to the database. The edit histories etc are different. If in stead the user used a nickname to look "the same as another user, that would be true impersonation. Let is say I altered "Fiddle faddle" to show up as "Syrthiss", and started to post where you post and to look as like you as I can. <b>That</b> is impersonation. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 15:24, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Noble? No. Pragmatic. Were I an admin I imagine fondly that I would have tools to investigate a suspicious circumstance which I would investigate <i>while assuming good faith</i> (in other words, silently) until I reached a conclusion (either no action and remain silent, or action and rationale for action). That is fair and reasonable. The circumstances are, at best, unusual. But I would also want to make the work I had done totally transparent when and if I chose to take blocking or banning action. The respinsibilities of an admin are far greater than any apparent priviliges, and they are to show beyond doubt that their actions are like Caesar's wife is meant to be. I am making no slurs, casting no aspersions; this comment is for all who are admins whether part of this mini saga or not. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 17:16, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is simple. I find it strange that the guidelines are not applied with uniformity. But, since you know that I will leave the topic alone. Please don't do the capital letters thing. It is not common sense one way or the other, and using capitals does not make it so. Please do not take lack of a further reply as agreeing with you, I have said my piece and have not seen any reason to alter my thinking. I think the user behaved in a foolish manner, but that is the sole conclusion I can draw from what is in front of me. I understand your very human reaction to the behaviour, but that very humanity is a weakness when dissecting an issue like this. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 17:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry about the caps but it's common sense and that's been argued by to all admins involved. I don't see why we should let this user edit w/ an account so similar to another user and especially that he doesn't want to cooperate. Wikipedia needs people who are willing to do compromises and not a user who wants to illustrate a point. The compromise offered from our part is that he still can edit w/ another username regardless of his prior indef block. That's a compromise Fiddle. Are we looking for a solution? Yes. So that's the one. The ball is in his camp. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> - <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 17:48, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been watching this article for some time with interest. I want to point out some things I've noticed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>1. I've noticed multiple "NPOV" disputes on this article. I need someone to explain to me how factual information, photographs, and related newspaper articles going as far back as 1921 can have a "point of view" attached to them. If the facts about a specific issue are condemning, then they are condemning. It IS NOT a point of view issue just because someone pointed it out. Point of view as it relates to photos and newspaper articles from eighty years ago is not relative, as the photographers and journalists responsible for the photos and articles are not currently editing Wikipedia.</p>
<p>2. There were multiple complaints about the quality of some of the uploaded images. I noticed that the images were replaced with higher resolution scans as requested by multiple users, and subsequently deleted without a trace or a debate. Can someone explain?</p>
<p>3. Certain users on here have entirely too much time on their hands. Edits get reverted sometimes within MINUTES of their occurance. It does, in fact, makes someone wonder if there are people on wikipedia who do this for a living. Who exactly sits in front of their computer and mashes f5 while looking at an article about such a seemingly insignificant holiday? People with stake in said holiday, thats who.</p>
<p>4. User: Miracleimpulse's information seems completely factual. I don't understand why factual and highly relevant information would be removed from the supported topic in an encyclopedia article. Is it really possible to have "too much" information about something? He seems to be the only supporter of facts editing this article. I haven't yet witnessed a single person disputing his content, only his format. I see multiple users supporting the removal of content, and only one supporting the addition of content. Why? There is absolutely no reason to delete the content unless you have something to suppress. Suppression of information is not permitted on Wikipedia. A small group of editors is talking about arbcom-ing someone for posting facts. It's not right, and its not the spirit of free information upon which Wikipedia is based. Stop focusing on the syntax and format and start focusing on the information in question.</p>

<p>When he alludes that I am a "POV pushing troll" on another admin's talk page (even though he didn't reference me by name, anyone who saw his vote page knew who he was talking about) <b>I am going to defend myself.</b> Is that stalking? JzG continues to go around complaining to other admins about this "POV pushing troll" who is "stalking him", but he's the one who continues to tell blatant lies about our long-standing dispute. Why is he bringing me up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=94978336&amp;oldid=94972433" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=94978336&amp;oldid=94972433" rel="nofollow">here</a> in a completely unrelated discussion?</p>
<p>See, it's like this: if I <b>don't</b> defend myself against JzG's accusations, then it looks like I'm guilty. Then, fast forward a month when JzG asks MONGO or some other admin for help with the dispute: of course, that admin might remember JzG's unchallenged version of events, and (s)he comes on the scene with a <i>preconceived notion</i> that I'm still "POV pushing" or "stalking JzG". The fact that a respected admin (and friend) has called me a POV pushing troll (and now a stalker) will inevitably color their interactions with me from the start.</p>
<p>For a casual editor like myself, <i>I have no choice but to defend my reputation</i> in the face of groundless accusations from a respected admin.</p>
<p>Now, I've <i>tirelessly</i> documented my reasoning in voting against JzG - I've provided at least a dozen diffs to support my case. JzG has not only repeatedly insisted on his version of events <i>which is entirely contradicted by my evidence</i>, but he has also not provided <i>one single diff</i> to prove his assertions about me. Am I to keep my mouth shut and allow him to spread lies about me (yes, lies - look at my evidence) to all his admin friends? <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 15:59, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Guy, you did refer to ATren (unnecessarily) on Mongo's talk page before ATren showed up there. But ATren could have stayed out of it, and is taking his attempts to contact/irritate/influence you to fairly drastic levels (I note that over half of his last 200 edits are about you in some way). However, Guy, it might be better not to provide any further temptation, and just ignore his provocation, if you view it as that. If he is a troll, don't feed him. If he is not a troll, then ignore it or file an RFC. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 16:13, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Proto, I am defending my reputation. He continues to insinuate that I am a POV pushing troll, and I have to defend myself against that <i>completely groundless accusation</i>. What do I do here? Do I ignore it and watch my reputation get tarnished in the admin community, or address it and risk being called a stalker? I choose the latter, but for a casual user like myself trying to defend himself against an admin spreading lies, it's "damned if you do, damned if you don't". You will note that most of my so-called "trolling" and "stalking" is me defending myself when JzG misrepresented the dispute on AN/I or elsewhere. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 16:36, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nope, "my version" happens to be the truth, <i>backed by diffs</i>.

<p>As I am engaged in a <a href="#Controversial_moves" title="">somewhat similar situation</a>, I can sympathize with the issue here. I'd tend to agree with Physicq210 and also suggest a DR. Nonetheless it seems like a case of 'bad start getting bad': I have seen JzG, who is otherwise an experienced admin who often helps resolve other dispute, be sometimes too quick with labels like 'trolling'. If ATren got annoyed with this - as I once did - well, I can see the situation going downhill. So before a lenghty RfC, may I suggest you 'rollback' all the personal comments between you to the very first time you started interacting, and see if perhaps you both would like to <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREFACTOR_6166.html" title="WP:REFACTOR">WP:REFACTOR</a> your comments?

<dd>One, that's not a technical solution, and two, that does nothing to stop sleeper socks. The template vandalism to the FA the other day was done by sleeper sock accounts old enough to upload images.

<dd>The featured articles review page has a listing of what article is going to be on the main page each day a couple of weeks in advance. If this is an area of interest for you, you can improve the templates for FA's a couple of days <i>before</i> they will be on the main page, which would not only be consistent with stopping the vandalism, but would make sure the most people saw them with the improvements you introduced. :) <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:44, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I still don't 'get' what the problem is. Sometimes it sounds like people are complaining about offensive images getting onto the main page itself through an overlooked template... which would seem like it should be easy to prevent by just going through the templates listed when you click 'edit' and protecting each / unprotecting the next day. There can't be too many templates used in those little 'article of the day' blurbs. Other times it sounds like the offensive images are on the featured article itself... which just sounds like normal vandalism that we have always had and handled by reverting, blocking, and protecting the page for short periods if needed. Presumably there has to be more to it, but I've read three of these 'something must be done' threads now and still haven't seen anyone spell out <b>exactly</b> what the problem is. Like... citing the template that was vandalized? The username that did it? Also, why aren't people just reverting this stuff? If a vandal has access to DO it then every user on Wikipedia has access to UNdo it. Each time it seems like multiple people complain about seeing the image... why didn't the first person get rid of it so that the others wouldn't? In short... I don't 'get' it. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:43, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>CBD, in the amount of time you spent writing this post you could have done the research yourself and found out exactly what is going wrong. But since you didn't do it, I'll do it for you. For two weeks now we've had some image vandalism on our featured articles. They place images inside of noincludes in templates used on the articles. This takes awhile to figure out and remove from the article. In the meanwhile, hundreds of people are seeing disgusting and vile images and turning off a good proportion of them from Wikipedia. This is a <i>huge</i> problem, and it isn't nearly your "run-of-the-mill" vandalism. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 11:47, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Interesting: on today's vandalism (thread below), I mentioned specific templates and users. I guess you didn't read the entire page. Why didn't I do something about it? I did.

<li>After some searching I found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:EFareCards&amp;diff=95079224&amp;oldid=94491491" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:EFareCards&amp;diff=95079224&amp;oldid=94491491" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit (see, a <i>specific</i> example) which apparently created the vandalism complained about above. This would not have appeared on the Main page and thus must be different than other complaints about vandalism there in another section below. The vandalism to this template was reverted, restored by another username, and reverted again within minutes before the template was protected. Seems like normal 'article of the day' vandal fighting to me except that we actually protected the template and left it that way... which we normally wouldn't do if the vandalism were on the page directly. This page used seven templates, five of which have been protected for a long time, one of which was vandalized, and one of which was (and still is) only semi-protected... but the vandal apparently overlooked. It took me all of a minute to check the protection status of those templates. If people really don't understand how to track vandalism in templates (which doesn't seem the case here as it WAS reverted quickly) then we could easily have protected the handful of templates used on this page. However, there is nothing preventing the same images being placed directly on the page and restored by multiple accounts in the same way. The only 'twist' to this seems to be that it may be a little more difficult to locate the vandalism for people who aren't very familiar with how templates work. If the problem is really as bad as people say (though in this case the offensive image was present for a grand total of 12 minutes and 11 seconds) then temporary protection as 'SOP' seems like an easy enough solution. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:18, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>From what I've seen of this, it is vandalism of templates within templates, and sometimes something involving vandalism involving redirects pointing at templates (I won't go into details in case copycat vandals are reading this thread). Tracking down templates within templates is a bit more time-consuming, and as for the length of time: 12 minutes and 11 seconds is <i>far</i> too long. Huge numbers of people will view the page in that time. I would like to see all vandalism of main page articles reverted within a minute or less. As for specific examples, I have one involving templates on the talk page of the main page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Main_Page/archivelist&amp;diff=93798250&amp;oldid=91072544" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Main_Page/archivelist&amp;diff=93798250&amp;oldid=91072544" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Main_Page_discussion_header&amp;diff=93798036&amp;oldid=93797938" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Main_Page_discussion_header&amp;diff=93798036&amp;oldid=93797938" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Main_Page_discussion_header&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93797086" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Main_Page_discussion_header&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93797086" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> (note the deceptive edit summaries), which is discussed <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_Page_Archive_85_5df4.html#WHAT_IS_GOING_ON.3F" title="Talk:Main Page/Archive 85">here</a>.

<dd>Geeze, "The username that did it? Also, why aren't people just reverting this stuff?" Like I wouldn't if I could have figured it out? It should be pretty obvious now that with vandal patrols and the like, the reason people aren't just reverting it, like most simply vandalism to the FA, which often gets RV in the same minute it is created, is that it's not simple vandalism. Over the course of this vandal, Wikipedia has probably exposed thousands of potential users to offensive pornography, and these users will warn their friends not to use Wikipedia, to keep their children off of Wikipedia, yet it's been going on for weeks. <i><b>Wikipedia also needs to apologize on its Main Page for not taking this seriously from day one.</b></i> <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 18:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>sorry gang, but I've got a whole range of IP's to play with. If user Atlant does not wish to be called, he should not list his number. This started as an attempt to sincerely improve the wiki.

<dd>So, it's ok to block my IP for disputing an admin, and ok for another admin to tell me he "is a rouge and fuck process" (that's a quote) but not okay for me to call a publically listed telephone and submit a concern privately and civilly? Nah. We aren't even dicussing the merits of the inclusion of the link anymore. Now, this is about the egos of the Admins.

<dd>I'm sure Atlant is very interested in proposing these addresses for blacklist. His ego is on the line. This all began when I posted one line of text as a link to the Burlington, Vermont article that led to a Burlington news resource. Thus far, Atlant has made up stories about me, accused me of wikilawyering, harrassment and blown this waaay out of proportion. Yes, you have a problem child here alright, but it isn't me. Now, instead of banning me and all the other people who use my IP, could we just go back to discussing whether the link belongs on the article page? This is getting absurd. I can keep coming back no matter how many times I get banned, but I have no doubt the others who use the IP's would appriciate some civility and a resolution. I have not vandalized, used foul language nor disrupted any article on wiki. KR 66.252.245.106 22:47, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(after 2 edit conflicts) Where have you been for the last two weeks :-) The vandal attacking the templates and images associated with the main page featured article. The one that is there today is beyond description. Has no one yet found the source? All of the main page article templates are not protected. Is this the source of the problem? If so, it hasn't been protected yet. {{<a href="../../../h/a/r/Template%7EHarvard_citation_534f.html" title="Template:Harvard citation">Harvard citation</a>}} It was up for several minutes. Even I don't want to keep coming to the main page if I'm going to see that, and I'm not a newbie. This is going too far. I've seen what the main page template vandal has done for two weeks, this is going too far, no one should have to see that, and there should be a practice in place now of protecting EVERY template and image on the main page FA. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 01:37, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I'm not going to click on and read the main page FA any more after this morning's encounter. When I first read about it, I started avoiding the articles, then I assumed it had been cleaned up. At this point, I must assume the vandal is doing exactly what he/she hopes to accomplish: turning users off of Wikipedia by the hundreds. I would have never come back if that was my first encounter. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 01:42, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know; it was just disgusting and I have deleted it. Just disgusting. Anyway, we just need to be more certain that we protect templates on articles linked from the Main Page.

<dd>Pat, and others, please... give us some credit here. Everyone has been trying their best to prevent this stuff from happening. No one notices when we prevent a vandal from introducing this type of vandalism to a page, but when it begins to happen, suddenly it's <i>why aren't you all doing anything?</i> Things <i>have</i> been done, but no one's perfect; things sometimes get overlooked. Note how several templates were protected by <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy">Pilotguy</a> (<a href="../../../p/i/l/User_talk%7EPilotguy_51fb.html" title="User talk:Pilotguy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pilotguy_7bd6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pilotguy">contribs</a>) just prior to the 00:00 (UTC) switch. I double-checked later on to ensure all templates were protected. However, the common ones such as the ones vandalized today were overlooked by both me and him. But, no... that's not <i>doing something</i>; we're just sitting around letting people add shock images to pages because we find it funny. Seriously, discussing (and implementing) new ideas for trying to prevent this is in fact a worthwhile exercise. However, the <i>stop talking and start doing something</i> attitude with no indication as to what that <i>do something</i> is contributes nothing to the discussion and serves only as a slap in the face for all the people who are doing their best (which comes down to just about all of us). -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 09:01, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think protecting rather than substituting is the way to go here because {{<a href="../../../m/p/r/Template%7EMprotected2_1683.html" title="Template:Mprotected2">mprotected2</a>}} adds a category which lists all the affected templates and is helpful when its time to unprotect. Subst'ing doesn't create any central log and is more likely to get forgotten. While its nice to ask the mailing list for info, I think this is a serious enough problem that we need to start hashing out a solution now. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 02:06, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>All this talk brings up two good points: templates should be more strictly semi-protected, and semi-protection should be <b>edit-based</b> not <b>time-based</b>. No one with less than 50 edits should be able to edit semi-protected articles. After all, even our semi-protection policy is fairly strict, so I don't see one negative to making it edit-based (or both). -- <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenesis13_6b6b.html" title="User:Renesis13">Renesis</a> (<a href="../../../r/e/n/User_talk%7ERenesis13_5466.html" title="User talk:Renesis13">talk</a>) 02:55, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I won't mention how due to <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>, but it should be simple enough for vandals to get around a 50 edit semi-protection restriction. In fact, getting around it would probably be even faster than getting around the time-based semi-protection. Perhaps a protection mode could be made that would not only protect the article, but present a version of the article with templates included <i>as they were at the time of protection</i> to the reader. This way we wouldn't have to worry about forgetting one little template transcluded by another which is referred to be a redirect on an FA. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 07:13, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"High risk" templates are fully protected. I think the requirements for a template being "high risk" need to be broadened. If it's used on the main page, it's high risk. If it's used on hundreds of pages, it's high risk.

<p>Coming in late to the conversation and there's a lot of it scattered around so forgive me if any of these have already been suggested:</p>
<ol>
<li>A bot that produced a list of the the templates transcluded into the main page, the templates transcluded into those templates, etc., etc. would be a good idea. It seems that most of the problem now comes from humans trying to track down a heirachy of transclusions, something a bot could do faster and better. I'm not talking about a bot with admin rights, just something to produce a list that some dedicated admins can go round and protect.</li>
<li>Per Renesis - although it would be easy to evade a protection based on x number of edits, combining it with the time limit would increase the effort required to create a vandalism account. If as a vandal, I have to do 150 <b>mainspace</b> edits to get three vandal accounts for tomorrow, I'm at least going to have to spend some time thinking (and I might hit puberty in the meantime).</li>
<li>Create a fully subst'ed version of the current main page as soon as it gos up (or before), save it and then revert it. That gives us a safe copy to revert to while we track down any vandalised templates, rather than leaving the main page in a state until we can find out which template of a template of a template we missed. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 12:15, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You don't need a bot for the first item above. Go to the Main page. Click edit. Scroll down. A list of all transcluded pages is displayed. It doesn't break it into a tree structure, but it lists everything which goes into making the page. Cyde above claimed that the problem was on the featured articles, but you are now back to saying the Main page... if it is the latter then it would seem simplest to check the particular section the vandalism is in. If there is a penis in the 'picture of the day' you go to that page, click edit, and check the handful of transclusions which are listed. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:33, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unless you see something I don't, that only shows one level of transclusions, which means protecting sublevels involves clicking on the link of each template, hitting edit, clicking on the link of each template, hitting edit, clicking on ... until you reach the end of the tree. Repeat until all templates are protected and hope you haven't missed any (you can always check by repeating the process). Wait 24 hours, unprotect all the templates that don't feature on the new mainpage items...hmmm...probably best to get a list of all those on yesterday's list and then compare them one by one with today's, excluding those that were already protected beforehand. Doesn't look that simple to me, and the fact that templates have been missed every day would suggest it isn't. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 13:00, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please cite an example of a 'sub template' which is carried up to the Main page, but not listed when you click 'edit' there. I cannot find any. My recollection is that the list goes down several levels (to the point that you will rarely encounter transclusion so deep as to not be displayed). So far as I know the 15 transclusions listed are the ONLY ones used... and of those only four change on a daily basis and thus might introduce new sub-templates. Nor have I been able to locate any actual examples of vandalism to templates appearing on the Main page. Most of the complaints have centered around the 'article of the day', but I checked that and for the past week it has introduced no new sub-templates. Thus I'm not sure if there really is a 'vandalism on the main page' problem. There IS an issue with vandalism on the article of the day itself... but not that I can see on the blurb for such which is displayed on the main page. HAS vandalism been appearing on the Main page? Specifically where and when? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:29, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I shall eat humble pie (although if the recursion of template listing is limited to x levels it is perhaps more of a hinderance than a help, as you still need to check through all the links to make sure there is nothing transcluded beyond x levels). I still think the minimum mainspace edits coupled with the time limit would be a good idea though - the time limit only deters the spur of the moment vandal,whereas a minimum mainspace edit count would at least involve more effort on their part. You'd have to be a very sad individual to run up 50 edits a day just so you could put a nasty image on an article for a few minutes. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 15:56, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Running up 50 edits by using a bot or AWB-type system would be trivial. With the current setup, it would be simple to do this in a way which would be completely undetectable as a bot. I could without too much difficulty write a proof of concept which would be able to register an account, make over 50 edits, and then automatically find unprotected important templates, upload images, and add them. This system could be embedded in a worm to create a botnet which would make it impossible to stop by IP-blocking. If all FA-transcluded templates were fully-protected, then the vandalism could be done to templates on other main-page-linked templates, or to articles linked to from main-page-linked articles. I think that <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> has a tendency to make people overly complacent about these issues. Of course, I might be overestimating the abilities and resources of the vandals.

<li>Per a request above <a href="../../../d/y/k/Template%7EDYKbox_17f9.html" title="Template:DYKbox">Template:DYKbox</a> has been protected. Why? This is a box which displays a list of shortcuts to 'did you know' working pages. Obviously, that does not appear anywhere on the Main page. Presumably people are thinking that because this box appears on <a href="../../../d/y/k/Template%7EDYK_11c4.html" title="Template:DYK">Template:DYK</a> and THAT appears on the Main page that both must be protected... but that isn't the way it works. 'DYKbox' is displayed within 'noinclude' tags on DYK... which means that when DYK is displayed on the Main page the DYKbox is not 'sent along'. Ergo, <a href="../../../d/y/k/Template%7EDYK_11c4.html" title="Template:DYK">Template:DYK</a> needs to be protected to prevent it being used to vandalize the Main page, but <a href="../../../d/y/k/Template%7EDYKbox_17f9.html" title="Template:DYKbox">Template:DYKbox</a> does not.

<li>Interesting again. I reported two specific templates involved in today's vandalism, and gave a site showing the images inserted. If this isn't helpful, I should probably stop trying to contribute - but since today's vandalism was up for seven minutes unnoticed (click the link above if you want to see how vile it was), it certainly seemed to be worth raising the issue where admins would take action. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 13:46, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I looked at the 'harvard citation' and 'for' links you cited and can see that they were vandalized... but not that they were transcluded onto the main page. What are we trying to do here? Keep offensive images off the Main page? If so then protecting 'DYKbox', 'harvard citation', and 'for' does <i>nothing</i> to accomplish that. Thus, I am getting the sense that there really isn't a problem with the main page itself and we should really be talking about vandalism to the 'article of the day'. Correct? If so, that is an age old problem that could only be completely prevented by protecting the article itself and all content transcluded onto it. Which is against the longstanding tradition of that article being editable to draw in new users. As some people have more trouble locating vandalism in templates and the new users we are trying to draw aren't going to know about/understand templates it might be reasonable to protect all templates used on the article... but that isn't going to prevent offensive images being added. They can always do it directly on the page... or on a completely different template which they then add to the page. We'd have to lock down everything related to that page for the day (either by protection or 'stable versions' when those are implemented) to completely prevent this. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:30, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, I think you are right that we are talking about the article of the day, not the main page itself. It is an old problem, and yes, they can always add it directly to the page, but when done directly, it's likely that will be reverted in a matter of seconds. In the past few weeks, the template vandalism has often lasted 5 minutes or more, causes many more users to attempt to contact Wikipedia about it, and turns away from Wikipedia however many other users that we don't even know about. Vandalism that lasts a matter of 10 times (or more) longer than typical article-of-the-day vandalism is indeed a problem we need to fix <i>now</i>. -- <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenesis13_6b6b.html" title="User:Renesis13">Renesis</a> (<a href="../../../r/e/n/User_talk%7ERenesis13_5466.html" title="User talk:Renesis13">talk</a>) 18:40, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, what we are talking about is articles linked to from the main page, CBD, most often the main page FA. While it's easy to say "just revert it!", but it's obviously not that simple to anyone who actually works on the main page FAs. I know from experience it takes 4-10 minutes to actually find the vandalized template and revert the vandalism... since they do it in such a way that you have to look at each template's code. Discussion of protecting those templates in advance is ongoing. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 18:48, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Some tips for tracking and reverting vandalism to templates more quickly:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Get the smallest applicable list of transcluded pages you can. If the vandalism is in a particular section of the page then edit just that section... below the edit window there will be a list of items transcluded for <i>that section only</i>. In most cases this will be only one or two. Note that you can also click on those links to go to the template... I use the popups script, popup the history from those links, get a preview of suspect edits in that history, and go from there... can usually find the problem in just a few seconds without ever leaving the original page (article of the day in this case).</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with the permanently protected 'high risk' templates. In most cases these cover all but a very few of the templates transcluded onto a page. If you exclude those it's alot easier.</li>
<li>Look (or search) for '{{' to find the template which is located at the exact point in the text where the vandalism is appearing. That's the vandalized template. Sometimes difficult with infoboxes and the like if they are 'stacked' atop each other, but you can usually get in the ballpark.</li>
<li>Don't look at the template code - look at its page history. If there are no edits to the template that day then you have the wrong one. If there ARE edits you can quickly get diffs and see what was added... if it is an image inside 'includeonly' tags then that's likely it.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Obviously this would still take longer than just looking at the history and reverting back to a clean version, but it can still be done very quickly. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 20:59, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think CBD is right though. I haven't seen any vandalism on the main page itself, and I use that pretty much constantly throughout the day. The vandalism is occurring on the featured article. It is a static version of the featured article you are after, I suspect, but that would negate the "let anyone edit" thing.

<dd>I think HighInBC means a page that just uses no templates, i.e. everything is substituted in (subst:). It could be unprotected, and the templates could be too, but sneaky template vandalism would be impossible, unless someone added the template they vandalized, then it would be easilly reverted.

<dd>Alternatively creating a static version, saving it and then reverting back to the dynamic version would allow anybody to edit but give a "safe" version to roll back to if any sneaky vandalism did occur. You could then hunt down the offending tranclusion without having it on the page while you did so. You wouldn't then need to reconvert the static page back to a dynamic page the next day (which you would have to do with a purely static version unless no useful edits were made during the day it was featured). <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 19:01, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

I keep telling myself to leave the issue alone—"most people don't care"—but I can't. Something must change regarding TFA editability. It's not "giving into vandals".

(Does one not buy home insurance because it's "giving into fires"?) –<a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutriggr_fee9.html" title="User:Outriggr"><font color="#112299">Outriggr</font></a> <a href="../../../o/u/t/User_talk%7EOutriggr_67e3.html" title="User talk:Outriggr"><i>§</i></a> 01:08, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We are supposed to use Wikipedia and the internet for educational purposes.<br />

We just want to start over and start a new leaf!! On the weekends we edit Wikipedia and surf the internet. That Bobabiba character is my older sister, I told my mom that she is causing trouble on the internet durning school time (8:30-5:00), my mom "banned" her from using the internet.<br />

<dd>I know, but I mean the I<i>S</i>P (Roadrunner ISP) instead of IP. That is probably a rather drastic step, however.

<dd>Yes... that is a hugely drastic step. Roadrunner is a big, big, ISP and that would effect a whole lot of people not involved with this.

<p>Hello Schneelocke. I have received a few emails from a person who claims to be using this IP address. It has been blocked indefinitely and perhaps rightly so. However, the girl seems to be pleading not to block the IP indefinitely as she uses Wikipedia for school-projects and other assignments. In case you agree, can we unblock the IP for a temporary period, giving her time to register a username and then blocking it with an anon-access block preventing further account creation? That way, she can edit using the account, while her sister (who she claims has been trolling) cannot. Can we work this out, please? — <a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_ae26.html" title="User talk:Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington"><font color="black"><b>Nearly Headless Nick</b></font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Sir%20Nicholas%20de%20Mimsy-Porpington" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Sir%20Nicholas%20de%20Mimsy-Porpington" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Contributions"><sup><b>{C}</b></sup></font></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Sir+Nicholas+de+Mimsy-Porpington" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Sir+Nicholas+de+Mimsy-Porpington" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin logs"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 14:45, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are two separate threads on this at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>. Bobabobabo's use of sockpuppets is the reason for her ban. I asked that Raul654 run a checkuser on an IP that was known to be this user, and Titanicprincess was proven to be this user through a study of her contributions and uploads. I requested that he block her, and I went about tagging her creations per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G5" title="WP:CSD">G5</a>. The original blocks on the IP that she requests unblocking were blocks for disruption, and then when that IP was checked, upwards of 70 accounts of all the same edits were found. We have determined that this is Bobabobabo's home IP address, and every other address that she has been using afterwards are open proxies.

<p>OK I am really upset now after having my first account suspended for suspect reasons as discussed above under User:Starblindy I conceded that though the reasons were not all valid and my reputation had take a severe attack, I would change my name and continue.

<p>1) Names that can be confused with other contributors - look if anyone thinks that a signiture TheWikipedianFormallyKnownAsStarblindy is the same as Andrew Lenahan Starblind has got problems, I see no way a below average user could get confused.</p>
<p>2) Wikipedia Terms - There are none to my knowledge</p>
<p>3) Well-known persons name - Know one to my knowledge has a real name "The Wikipedian Formally Known As Starblindy" If so I would like to meet them or at least read about them.</p>
<p>4) Random Sequence of Numbers/Letters - This random sequence is called english</p>
<p>5) Extreamly Lengthy Usernames - I stress extreamly while it is on the lengthy side I don't think it is extreamly lengthy, plus it is a weak reason and not the one given.</p>
<p>6) Inflammatory Usernames - I don't think so</p>
<p>7) Harassing Usernames - I don't think I have offended anyone</p>
<p>8) With Non-Latin Charaters - No Problem there</p>
<p>9) Closly resemble Vandels Usernames - No problem to my knowledge</p>
<p>10) Usernames that promote a website or company - No problem to my knowledge</p>

<dd>I apologize if I seem a bit angry but I have done this so many times. Now look here no one is getting confused between me and starblind I don't see any part of <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a> that indicates that this username is inappropriate. This is the last straw I swear I will take action otherwise. I am a constructive user and I shouldn't have to go through this. I have been victimised as if I am a vandel with the intent to bring down the entire wikipedia. If I don't get unblocked this time I will act the way I am treated. There is nothing wrong with that username and there is nothing wrong with me. I am sick and tired of trying to mend wikipedia into a useable resource while also being attacked by the so called "administrators" who were voted in from what I see to try and make sure that this project stays were it is now, a place for them to flex their muscle. I started off as a good user with strong belief that I would have a good reputation and that no harm would come to me. But I see that no matter how good a user you are you get abused and attacked continually in a relentless effort to stifle the popularity of wikipedia in order to maintain thier "club". The upsetting thing is that this wasn't the "dream" of wikipedia or any wiki project. But users have come in from other backgrounds and created a "boys club" were they can get off on their own "power". It all is sickening. Unblock me, for the good of wikipedia and those who read this, understand, it can happen to you. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by User:151.204.56.2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7E151.204.56.2_f742.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:151.204.56.2">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>I agree with my colleagues. While a million monkeys at a million typewriters might someday type out 'starblind', there is no valid reason I can discern for permitting you to continue with any username that has any obvious mix of 'starblind'. I managed to register a username 1.5 years ago that is mostly random letters that miraculously has no similarity to 'starblind'.

I meant that I would act like I have been treated. Considering how little trouble I have had, I guess that means that I would start writing long complicated useful articles again, right?? Here is one question did it fool any of you for a second my name?? Did anyone look at it and say that is Starblind well I better go off and give this guy another barnstar for being the greatest administrator that ever lived?

<dd>Sorry, but if you're more interested in arguing with administrators than in actually improving the encyclopedia (which you can do as an anon), I don't think anyone will be particularly inclined to do what you want. Just register a new name that in absolutely no way, shape, or form resembles another existing editor's username, and be on your merry.

<p>Just making a report here that administrators may wish to moderate some of the comments made on the talk page for the article <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Bedfordshire_7fde.html" title="University of Bedfordshire">University of Bedfordshire</a> by Alfred Vella, a user who clearly has an axe to grind against his former employer. In the past he has made very POV edits to the article (eg. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Bedfordshire&amp;diff=79713063&amp;oldid=79709667" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Bedfordshire&amp;diff=79713063&amp;oldid=79709667" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>), though he stopped that some time ago. However, the talk page continues to be filled with unsubstantiated rumours of "dishonest behaviour" by some of the university's staff; comments like, "The lives of many thousands of those who entrusted their education in the University have had their futures blighted," and risque remarks such as "Why do you not ask Ebdon what happened to the Head of technical services in 2000?" I would consider that some of these allegations could risk exposing Wikipedia to libel action.</p>
<p>I have warned the user that Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia and not his soapbox on numerous occasions, and tried to reason with him, but he seems unwilling to listen and I am now sufficiently exasperated with the debate to withdraw myself. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDWaterson_1985.html" title="User:DWaterson">DWaterson</a> 00:17, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Here, for example, E104421 accuses Tajik of something, provides diffs and evidence, but another user who is a friend of Tajik's jumps in, just like they did against me, and accuses E104421 of stalking Tajik, with no diffs, no support, nothing, just throwing accusations around.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3APersonal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=94939400&amp;oldid=94922357" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3APersonal_attack_intervention_noticeboard&amp;diff=94939400&amp;oldid=94922357" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> Tajik simply throws around accusations of stalking, in fact, he is, like a classic stalker, using his accusations as an effective stalking weapon, and administrators ignore it. As I said, when I provided diffs, when I supported my accusations, just like E104421 is providing, I was ignored by administrators, in favor of baseless unsupported accusations against me, as is currently happening on WP:PAIN--accusations against Tajik are simply ignored by administrators, even after a proclamation of going rogue on Tajik, his incivility is completely ignored. Bias--pure and simply bias, Tajik's computer sophisticated and a longer term user, therefore he must be right and protected in everything. Again and again. I use Wikipedia dispute resolution techniques, and Tajik blasts me for them, and uses them against me, and administrators allow it, I support my accusations, Tajik throws around stalking charges with no supporting evidence, and administrators support him. It's nice to see that I'm not the only editor that administrator Tajik bias impacts so severely. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:48, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree a statement comparing a user to a "classic stalker" could be offensive. However, this user does not appear to have even received a warning, judging from the history of the user's talk page.

<dd>I've been in contact with KP Botany. KP feels very slighted and, looking at the evidence, I'm inclined to agree. KP has provided diffs for what s/he considers bad behavior, and has been met with apathy and silence. InShaneee's block of KP, I have to say, was <i>incredibly</i> inappropriate; InShaneee also apparently has a history of writing of contrary opinions as rants<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AInShaneee&amp;diff=84934772&amp;oldid=84934517" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AInShaneee&amp;diff=84934772&amp;oldid=84934517" rel="nofollow">[67]</a> (the email I got from KP claims that InShaneee's portrayals of the emails sent is false), so I'm inclined to believe KP's innocence in this. KP's statement above <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=95454897&amp;oldid=95454702" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=95454897&amp;oldid=95454702" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> was removed as a personal attack, but upon review, I think that's a bit of a stretch, given the fact that this is a dispute about the editor in particular.</dd>
<dd>All in all, there's some pretty shitty behavior about, and I'd like to see some actual dialogue, rather than just "I don't like what your saying you go bye now" kind of actions. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 18:41, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I must say I partly agree with EVula here. KP Botany was upset and, yes, giving vent through somewhat long-winded and repetitive posts - call them rants if you must - but I don't think they seriously crossed the line into personal attacks, in a way that would have made a block necessary. There could have been far better ways of dealing with his complaints. Incidentally, I wouldn't have blocked Tajik either, this time, because he had actually been making a start at behaving better recently. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 18:48, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Administrator Khoikhoi abused and continues to abuse administrative privileges to promote his personal POV on Wikipedia via edit wars--something that this administrator has been blocked for plenty of times, and never gave up, and now abuses his authority as an administrator to maintain and support his POV on articles, and his blind allegiences to certain editors, namely Tajik."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"It is outrageous, but not surprising, given as much leeway as Khoikhoi has been given to continue edit wars under the quise of an administrator, and as much as he continues to provide Tajik with leeway to do as he wants, that anyone seeking to get others to look fairly at what is going on with Tajik, would be attacked by Khoikhoi. However, it is outrageous, and it is doing a lot of harm and wasting time at Wikipedia."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Khoikhoi should admit his bias and stand back from issues concerning me, issues concerning Tajik, and issues concerning anyone he has displayed personal bias towards or against--it is simply not fair to editors to have to come up against administrators who abuse their administrative status to support someone they are biased towards--it creates a hostile atmosphere, not just for that particular victim, but potentially for all others who realize their complaints will be unheeded also, and they will just wind up being attacked now by an administrator (Khoikhoi), in addition to an editor."</li>

That Bobabiba character is my older sister, I told my mom that she is causing trouble on the internet durning school time (8:30-5:00), my mom "banned" her from using the internet. May you please unblock my IP 72.177.68.38. I noticed that user: JzG an admin wrote a rude and disrespectful message on my talk page. See multiple threads on admin noticeboards and talk to Dmcdevit.

Guy ( Help!) 15:40, 19 December 2006 (UTC) I also noticed that my IP has not vandalized. ==PRIVATE== O.k. that Bobabobabab is my sister Grace, she was a "good" editor. She loves anime, Yu-Gi-OH and Pokemon. So she was trying to improve the Pokemon episode lists by uploading alot of fair use Pokemon images, she also was creating seperate episode pages, but the conflict started when A Man in Black opposed the images via discussion on the Pok¨¦mon Collaborative Project and change the template which included the images, so Grace created sock puppets to keep the images on the template, which User: Ryulong got involved. Which Grace and Ryulong became enemies: Subject Re: Wikipedia e-mail Sent Date 11-15-2006 11:03:02 PM From Ryulong &lt;ryulong67@gmail.com&gt; add to black list add to white list add to Address Book To "Aywana Tokiwana" &lt; aywanajp@lycos.com&gt; Listen. I don't care if you are 13, or whatever. Stop vandalizing my page at the Japanese Wikipedia. It's your own fucking fault for impersonating me TWICE and I got my user name changed to the one that I should have had in the first place. Go edit Bulbapedia. I couldn't care less what you do over there. If you want, bring up your ban to the ArbCom at the English Wikipedia, but then all you can edit is your case. Just LEAVE ME ALONE YOU GOD DAMN CHILD.</p>

<p>I probably had the first set of run-ins with Mactabbed due to his edits on the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtney_Cummz_1674.html" title="Courtney Cummz">Courtney Cummz</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexis_Malone_3f51.html" title="Alexis Malone">Alexis Malone</a> articles. There he kept replacing known free-use pictures with fair use ones that he uploaded, saying that his choices were better, even after it was pointed out to him that Wikipedia inherently prefers free-use over fair, and he also added those fair-use pics to his own user talk page, even after it was pointed out that fair use does not extend to the talk pages. As a result, I am absolutely no fan of Mactabbed.</p>
<p>Now having said that, I will grudgingly admit that he has made <i>some</i> constructive edits, specifically on a few articles related to classic mainstream films. <b>IF</b> Mactabbed is saying he'll behave, <b>IF</b> Mactabbed voluntarily limits his edits to only film-related articles where he has shown (at least until his bonafides are firmly reestablished) and <b>IF</b> Physicq210 is willing to act as guarantor for Mactabbed's conduct, then I will hold my objections to Mactabbed being unblocked. <b>IF</b> he is unblocked, he should have one and <b>only</b> one last chance to get back into the collective good graces of people. If he screws that chance up, my personal opinion is that Mactabbed should be so thoroughly locked out of editing Wikipedia that not even Jimbo Wales can restore Mactabbed's editing privileges. And by one, I mean Mactabbed should not even get the luxury of getting warned that his actions are wrong - if he screws up at all and in the least, he's blocked then and there. <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 06:38, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I don't care about this editors behavior nor am I stating an opinion on the appropriateness of a reference to ED on a dab page; but please don't go overboard on a mis-interpretation of the ArbCom ruling. A reference to ED, without a link, seems to be acceptable. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 16:46, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd say leave it as status quo for the moment. If I interpreted things correctly, both socks are indefblocked...and he blanked the sock notices, but they've been restored? Then protect the sock notice pages (I'll be happy to if you feel you are in conflict with the user). If he continues to be disruptive and / or creates more disruptive socks then we can give him the boot. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 17:28, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was the one who posted the sockpuppet report. Since I assume it's way too late for a CheckUser, the evidence is circumstantial, but I think extremely strong. I hope everyone can see that this guy walks, talks, and quacks like H.E. I considered waiting a couple more weeks to gather even more evidence, but he was already starting up again with his incivility and trademark preemptive accusations of wild anti-Muslim bias and conspiracy. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 19:11, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

With respect to the AfD, although it might have been a bit out of the ordinary, Striver's actions seem logical (particularly in light of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>). Also there's no policy against a user maintaining a developmental copy of an article in their userspace. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott"><span title="Leave me a message.">→</span></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey" title="Go to my userpage.">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 20:32, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

On the other hand, considering that Striver had added the link in his original article, it's hardly as if it was sneaky or anything. If it is indeed a copyvio, delete the article, and ask Striver for an explanation: a block seems to harsh in this case. he doesn't seem to have had a prior history of copyvio's or copyvio warnings. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:47, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some of the contain so little text that it is hard to argue that the original writer has a copy right on that small amount of info, and even if they had, it would easily pass as fair use, specially considering that a link was provided.</p>
<p>Other cases can not support that argument, on those cases i apologies and refer to the long time elapsed (1.5 years), and to the fact that i was a much less experienced editor at the time.</p>
<p>Regarding <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Siege_of_the_Banu_Qurayza_ef59.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Siege of the Banu Qurayza">the afd</a>, considering that Beit Or was the one nominating it for delesion, im sorry if i robed him of the tension of having the judge announce "delete" by deleting it myself... but i found it in wikipedias interest to have the afd process speedied in such an obvious case, and to spare wikipedia of me going to del:rev and requesting to have it userfied, specially considering that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Striver/Siege_of_the_Banu_Qurayza&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Striver/Siege_of_the_Banu_Qurayza&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">only other edits was</a> IMHO some bad faith redirects by Beir Or and two bad faith reversions by Beit Or's friend. Yes, i am aware of the AGF guidline.</p>
<p>Obviously did Beit Or find it in wikipedias interest to spend some of ANI's time on evaluating that userfision and also gave some 18 month old editions to strengthen his case of me being a vandal... Anyhow, i am a more experienced wikipedian now and have a better understanding of the copyright issues, although it's still not flawless. I imagine that anyone <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_Contributions_c7de.html" title="User:Striver/Contributions">with many edits</a> makes mistakes, and it's even possible that i have might have made more mistakes than the average person.</p>
<p>Regarding <i>"under the false premise that he had been the only contributor"</i>. You should check your facts before accusing me of such things, i did no such claim. You stated that you <i>"do find Striver's action extremely disruptive and disrespectful of other editors"</i>. If you could elaborate what is bothering you so much, and i don't mean the action, rather your perception of it and why it makes you feel that way, i might have a better chance of avoiding it in the future.

<dd>Btw, can a admin tell if Beit Or is right in refusing to remove the tag after i <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hind_the_wife_of_Amr&amp;diff=95379595&amp;oldid=95376315" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hind_the_wife_of_Amr&amp;diff=95379595&amp;oldid=95376315" rel="nofollow">stubified this</a> article, and on top of that coming here and claiming i am a vandal? If ´he had not opposed the stubification of my 18 month of article, i would have stubified the rest, but on the other hand, he could'nt have complained here if i had done that, right ?--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:38, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not an admin, but seems fine to me. The copyright page specifically says that if there's a clean version, just revert to that. The "do not edit this page" requirement was meant to say, "don't play with the copyrighted text". IMHO, and I don't see why policy would be any different. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 22:01, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking at <a href="../../../u/m/m/Umm_Kulthum_binte_Uqba_00f3.html" title="Umm Kulthum binte Uqba">Umm_Kulthum_binte_Uqba</a> and then see the main page of <a href="http://www.themodernreligion.com/index1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.themodernreligion.com/index1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.themodernreligion.com/index1.html</a>, and it says, "No Copyright: Any organisation or individual wishing to reprint or copy the contents of this website may do so unless otherwise stated on specific articles. The information, names of authors and sources are to be kept in its original form. An acknowledgement to this site would be appreciated."</dd>
<dd>Technically though having no copyright doesn't allow them to say that "The information...etc etc" i.e. they can't place information into the public domain and then try and control how it is copied. My call is that the intent of the author wanted "No Copyright" more than that 2nd sentence which is maintaining the attribution. I don't see how this can be a copyviolation worthy of a wikipedia editor being blocked.</dd>

<dd>When I look at the "edit-war" diffs that were going on with <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hind_the_wife_of_Amr_80d2.html" title="Hind the wife of Amr">Hind_the_wife_of_Amr</a> I think that this is a such waste of time; the article is so darn short !!!! e.g. just look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hind_the_wife_of_Amr&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95359324" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hind_the_wife_of_Amr&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95359324" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hind_the_wife_of_Amr&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95359324</a> To tag it copy violation is showing very little common sense. <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">WP:COOL</a> really needs to be read.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Other articles (glancing at random) seem equally short. Heck someone with a reasonably good memory who was really into the subjects could probably read the web pages and then "accidently" edit this into Wikipedia (not saying that has happened). We're not talking pages and pages of data here but almost empty shells of articles on eseoteric subjects. I think I've had a bit of difficult edit consensus with <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> but thats because I choose contentious articles. My response to contentious articles is to start posting to the talk pages so some discussion can start. Has <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">User:Beit_Or</a> done this ? Not that I can see (OK neither has <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> but then he didn't start this mess; <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">User:Beit_Or</a> started the tagging and reverting the tags without clear talk.</dd>

Attention of an admin familiar with RM is needed so this mess is fixed, hopefully allowing us to do a proper RM (I am not going to do it as I am engaged in the content discussion, and my attempt to fix the situaton by tagging forks with merge has already been reverted; a neutral party must step in).

<dd>You don't need a RM specialist to fix double redirects. Anyone can do it. If you dispute the appropriateness of the moves, it is a different matter. I find the moves totally sensible as no "invasions" and "massacres" where introduced into the titles like is frequently done by Piotrus. In fact, the titles that would have included "Polish invasion" or "intervention" are widely supported in sources but were not used for the sake of the world's peace while we have all sorts of the "invasion" and "massacre" titles for the Polish articles when those are <i>of</i> rather than <i>by</i> Poland. Interestingly, Piotrus himself said earlier that he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APolish%E2%80%93Russian_War_%281605%E2%80%931618%29&amp;diff=28096861&amp;oldid=28085853" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APolish%E2%80%93Russian_War_%281605%E2%80%931618%29&amp;diff=28096861&amp;oldid=28085853" rel="nofollow">did not object</a> to such move. So, I wonder whether this inflammatory post is intended to make more drama or indeed somehow avenge the user for the RfC about user:Piotrus. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 21:28, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, I see you raise the same concern about my old post that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARequested_moves&amp;diff=95586242&amp;oldid=95585656" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARequested_moves&amp;diff=95586242&amp;oldid=95585656" rel="nofollow">I addressed at the talk RM</a>, there is no need to fork the discussion about it here. And what inflammatory drama? Why didn't you comment about inflammatory drama when Ghirla brought my RfC on completly unrelated cases such as the FAC page? Oh well. Admin intervention <i>is</i> required to deal with merging <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscovy_%28Grand_Duchy%29_712f.html" title="Muscovy (Grand Duchy)">Muscovy (Grand Duchy)</a> (redirect with long history) and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow_14da.html" title="Grand Duchy of Moscow">Grand Duchy of Moscow</a> (new article with no history). Also, most RM specialists are admins, and we need one to decide if we should leave the articles at their new names and start RM back to old ones, or as belive is the SOP, revert contested and controversial moves and start a RM from old names (which, especially in the case of FA <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish%E2%80%93Russian_War_%281605%E2%80%931618%29_277d.html" title="Polish–Russian War (1605–1618)">Polish–Russian War (1605–1618)</a> gained acceptance of the community months ago and are disputed only by you and Ghirla. As for your comments on invasions and massacres, it's quite OT, and rather unsupported by reality, I am afraid, as had been discussed <i>ad nauseum</i> on relevant pages (sources, at best, ae split 50/50 for the latter periods, and show preference for Muscovy for the earlier... but this is OT here).--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus"> Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus </a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;"> talk </font></a></span></sub> 21:43, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Piotrus, as for bringing up your RfC, there is no single space in WP (except perhaps main) where you haven't yet brought up the Ghirla's RfC, so please no pot/kettling here. Now, you also do not make it clear whether you find the article's names inappropriate or not. You can't claim that the new arrangement is somehow inflammatory in any way. Article names are historically correct. One article is split into two. The other is moved to a non-controversial title. There is also a new term article. Where is the mess? Merging histories would be a good idea but that alone is no reason to whine. As for the "massacre" stuff, it is not off-topic. You created a whole bunch of massacre and invasion titles. Here we get moves to the titles that do not involve any of this stuff. Merging histories can be done of course, but I see no emergency to bring the issue here except if the goal is to harm your perpetual opponent in the <i>content</i> disputes. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 21:57, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Irpen, please don't take this thread OT, we are dealing with controversial move and followup requiring admin (preferably an RM admin attention). All the other stuff is irrelevant, a disclaimer about RfC is a sign of good will from my part (to let others now of the big picture and my possible bias). I brought up Ghirla's RfC only during relevant DR proceedings and in a few cases where it was relevant - I never stalked him, inserting notes of his RfC to every place he posted that had anything to do with me or articles I edit. I don't mind some of the changes Ghirla made (split up the article); I mind others (new name which is not supported by majority, and the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscovy.html" title="Muscovy">Muscovy</a> stub with unreferenced claim the term is mostly used by Polish scholars - a claim which is quite evidently false for anybody who goes to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Print_0627.html" title="Google Print">Google Print</a>. This is however OT here, so once again, please stop bringing irrelevant matters here. We have two articles in need of review by a RM specialist with admin powers, and an editing behaviour (making controversial moves) that may need to be commented upon. Please don't bring everything else and a kitchen sink into this thread, RfC has enough of that.

<p>I certanly agree that the moves are controversial, and had to be discussed first.</p>
<p>As a side note, a quite intriguing part is <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a>'s response to the moves. Just yesterday <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a>'s wrote <i>"unproposes moves are generally a bad idea, but particularly inflammatory are the controversial moves made without proposal"</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hillock65&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95395843" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hillock65&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95395843" rel="nofollow">[91]</a>.

<dd>The point is that I don't see those moves controversial in any way. No inflammatory terms were added to the titles at all. I would have proposes such moves first, true enough. But I object to calling them "controversial".

<p>I found the article Mangeshda with a speedy delete tag that had been there for a day or two. It did not seem appropriate to the article, so I replaced it with an AfD tag. The original editor who placed the tag, <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerminator_III_f34c.html" title="User:Terminator III">User:Terminator III</a> put a vandalism notice on my talk page in response,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AA_Ramachandran&amp;diff=95405230&amp;oldid=95244916" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AA_Ramachandran&amp;diff=95405230&amp;oldid=95244916" rel="nofollow">[95]</a> removed the AfD and replaced it again with db-spam. Since the AfD was already started, I put the AfD tag back, and the user put another vandalism notice on my talk page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AA_Ramachandran&amp;diff=95604618&amp;oldid=95429418" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AA_Ramachandran&amp;diff=95604618&amp;oldid=95429418" rel="nofollow">[96]</a> I don't think I've done anything wrong here and consider this to be harassment.
