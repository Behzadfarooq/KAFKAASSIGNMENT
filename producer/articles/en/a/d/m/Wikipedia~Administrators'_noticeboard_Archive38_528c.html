<p>I am trying to shed light on so called facts given on this website which clearly are not true. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> has been spreading lies throughout this website and it is quite easy to prove that he is lying. He claims to be the great-nephew of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annie_Besant_ef44.html" title="Annie Besant">Annie Besant</a>, however if he were he would be over 90 years old. However on the Justin Besant page, (<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> is Justin Besant) he makes not that he is a high school student with a few albums recently put out. There is no possible way that these two facts could both be true. Also, all of his albums are named things like Stuart or Nubice, which are both inside jokes from his high school. When searching up Justin Besant on google, you will find that the only records of him are on sites which are self-editable such as wikipedia and last.fm. There are also recent pictures of him on his last.fm website which will help support my claims. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> has also been deleting talk from the discussion pages in order to keep these truths about him from being put out. He is continually deleting all evidence that proves that he is not who he claims he is. He has also tried to spread his lies and prevent the escape of the truth on other pages such as <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Young_9315.html" title="Neil Young">Neil Young</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevie_Wonder_c1f2.html" title="Stevie Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href="../../../z/u/m/Zuma_%28album%29.html" title="Zuma (album)">Zuma</a> and The Cortez Trio. His edits to these pages and to the Justin Besant page should all be deleted as they have no truth to them. Thank you. Yofoxyman 19:47, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you know him personally, perhaps you'd like to take it up with him personally, over a beer or a carton of milk? If not, then take it up with him on his talk page - the sensible thing to do would be to leave a trail of evidence for others to see, noting <i>with proof</i> the crimes of the other party. Swinging by here as a first port of call and shouting "foul" won't force others to do research into him, it'll force others to do research into <i>you</i>.

He has made personal attacks against various users, including myself, and vandalised a series of talk pages. He has been warned multiple times by various users, but has ignored all warnings. I do not know who he is, but he seems to be out to get me (as seen by his posts above) and other users such as Johnleemk. I have been trying to avoid getting into an edit war, but vandalism is not acceptable on wikipedia so I revert it. I have never delt with such large scale vandalism before and am not sure how to handle it.

<dd>This is all pretty much a lie. We know each other pretty well as we go to high school together. And the vandalism he is refering to his posting on the talk pages of various websites the truth about his posts. I wouldn't want some kid doing a project on [Neil Young] somewhere to think that he inspired a "popular Canadian band" [The Cortez Trio], when in reality it's just three kids playing at a high school music night. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> has been trying to spread rediculous things like this on various pages mentioned above and I was just trying to say that these things weren't true on the talk pages. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> had no right to delete them just because it was exposing him for the fraud he is.

<dd>Anyone who takes a look at the history will quickly come to the conclusion that it is Chinamanjoe who is behaving badly here with his deletion of questions from talk pages and his refusal to discuss his edits. While Yofoxyman's edits have been characterised as personal attacks, they are really accusations rather than simple attacks.

<p>I have closed this AfD: Personal rapid transit/UniModal, which as nominator I would not ordinarily do, but <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFresheneesz_6a7b.html" title="User talk:Fresheneesz">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fresheneesz_d7d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fresheneesz">contribs</a>) first removed the "silly" AfD header, then chastised me for using AfD instead of the article Talk page which he asserts is the normal place to debate deletion, then created a "vote here" section which for some unaccountable reason accumulated a lot of "do not delete" input from anonymous or no-other-history accounts, on the basis of which he stated: <i>The vote unanimously acted to not delete this page, therefore I have removed the tag.</i> So he removed the AfD tag again and put this at the top: <i>With a unanimous vote of disagreement by many many more people than I thought cared (see below) - this discussion is closed. Article will not be deleted and I'll remove the tag now. Fresheneesz 07:14, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</i>. Note that unanimous in this case means including <i>only</i> the "vote here" section and and ignoring prior input from <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">User:Lar</a>, myself, <a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvidor_6e12.html" title="User:Avidor">User:Avidor</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker">User:Lurker</a>. In other words, there is unanimity qamong those who agree with him, provided we ignore those who do not.</p>
<p>So I have gone back and looked at the AfD debate. I have summarised the inputs here: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Personal_rapid_transit_UniModal_bbd5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Personal rapid transit/UniModal">Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Personal rapid transit/UniModal</a>. 2d/2m/1k. Since I was nominator and will also accept merge, I have merged what little is verifiable and redirected to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_rapid_transit.html" title="Personal rapid transit">personal rapid transit</a>.</p>
<p>Reading the input, at least one of the people who "voted" in the "vote" section is actively engaged in political lobbying for PRT. As you will see from the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_rapid_transit.html" title="Personal rapid transit">personal rapid transit</a> article, this is a largely untried concept, and the Unimodal system, subject of this artivcle, has no objective existence in reality at all: it is the dream of one Douglas Malewicki, who acknowledged that as yet "there ain't no such thing". Unlike some other PRT schemes this has not even made it to prototype yet, but it is still being used to "sell" PRT (sometimes to the detriment of more conventional transit systems). Malewicki is clearly trying to attract investors, as the website makes plain. Unimodal (aka SkyTran) is the system illustrated in the PRT article, with an image released by malewicki for use on WP. It is unrepresentative of any of the current projects in prototype.</p>
<p>Sorry to ramble. I am posting it here because I expect some fallout, and I will admit to a moderate level of irritation at <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> - if you're going to start asserting that AfD can't be started before there is discussion on Talk, it's best not to round that off by trying to turn AfD into a vote, which it is not, and then ignoring all input <i>other</i> than the vote, to say nothing of twice removing the AfD tag. I venture to suggest that I may have participated in one or two more AfD debates than he has. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:18, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you did the right thing. First of all, we establish policies to keep wikipedia workable, and if people diagree, they can go to the appropriate places to discuss that and change those policies.

<dd>There is evidence that JzG is sympathetic to Avidor and his views. There is also evidence that JzG is acting at the behest of Avidor's anti-PRT political motivations.

<dd>Since I have been accused by both sides of being biased towards the other, I would suggest this assertion does not stand up. It is interesting that my decision to close as merge (which was <i>against</i> my preferred solution) is considered problematic, but Freshneesz's own purported closure ignoring all inputs other than the new and anon users in his own "vote here" section is apparently fine. For the record I don't mind havi ng this sent to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> or running a second debate.

<dd>Skytran is not fictional, and the mere fact that you continue to say that it is, is proof positive that you are sympathetic to <a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvidor_6e12.html" title="User:Avidor">User:Avidor</a>'s extremist views on this issue. Skytran is a proposed system grounded in scientific analysis and fact, and you are killing it based on the words of a single editor whose best argument against it is that it's not actively being built. Neither he nor you nor anyone else has presented one iota of evidence that anything in Skytran is "fictional" yet you continue to say it. JzG, I've asked you repeatedly to cease editing PRT pages because your self-professed admiration for Avidor and his cartoons has clouded your judgement, and yet you continue to make detrimental changes to these articles. Please cease your activity on the PRT pages or I will ask for formal arbitration. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 21:24, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not fictional? Really? Then the article's complete failure to detail all the installations of this technology was a significant failure which undoubtedly contributed to the fact that the AfD showed a clear consensus not to have a separate article. Where are the installations? VCan we see some photographs of them? Or at least of the test track?</dd>
<dd>As to admiring Avidor - well, as a cyclist and sustainable transport enthusiast how could I not enjoy <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadkill_Bill_93cb.html" title="Roadkill Bill">Roadkill Bill</a>? But that doesn't mean I agree with Avidor on every issue. As I have stated several times, I am a graduate engineer and a big fan of all forms of alternative transportation. The <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_rapid_transit.html" title="Personal rapid transit">personal rapid transit</a> article is, I venture to suggest, considerably better as a result of the changes I have made. All ofwhich is <i>completely irrelevant</i> to the closure of this AfD. I voted delete, but I closed against that view. That is in stark contrast to Freshneesz, who invented his own process in defiance of <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> and chose to take the inputof the friends who, it must be suspected, he invited along, rather than the established editors who had contributed within the supported framework of AfD. In fact, Freshneesz <i>excluded</i> their input and pretended there was unanimity to keep. If you look on my Talk page you will see that I have chosen to ignore most of Avidor's comments. Althoguh I am well-known for assuming good faith well beyond the usual limits, I still consider Ken's views as representing an extreme. By the same token, your views are also not neutral (nobody is ever truly neutral). Ken is open about his bisases, you assert bias on the par tof others but I have not seen yo acknowledge your own biases. PRT is an untried concept. Unimodal is an untried implementation of an untried concept.

If the vote went against the discussion that went on above it, I would not have tried closing the deal myself. You however, *did* discount people.

<dd>Kash seems to want the page renamed Metal in Iran, something he could now do as the existin MiI page has been deleted. However, there is really nothing in the article, and no evidence that this "scene" is really notable or contains notable (WP:MUSIC friendly) bands. A merge with <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_rock_and_alternative_music.html" title="Iranian rock and alternative music">Iranian rock and alternative music</a> has been suggested and would probably be a good idea, especially to attract new editors to the topic.

However, Cantus persists in:</p>
<ul>
<li>editing articles (recently) from which C. is banned: e.g., <a href="../../../d/e/v/Developed_country.html" title="Developed country">developed country</a>;</li>
<li>editing articles or insinuating changes into them without discussion or edit summaries, or labelling corrections as rvv: e.g., <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_aeea.html" title="List of countries by GDP (PPP)">List of countries by GDP (PPP)</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_population.html" title="List of countries by population">List of countries by population</a>;</li>
<li>over the course of weeks, reverting to prior article versions that adhere to some ineffable personal standard and without justification: e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_aeea.html" title="List of countries by GDP (PPP)">List of countries by GDP (PPP)</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_total_area.html" title="List of countries by total area">List of countries by total area</a></li>
<li>moving articles to prior locales – viz. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_and_outlying_territories_by_area.html" title="List of countries and outlying territories by area">List of countries and outlying territories by area</a>/<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_total_area.html" title="List of countries by total area">List of countries by total area</a> – being warned about <i>carte blanche</i> changes, and (recently, in response) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_by_total_area&amp;diff=49554733&amp;oldid=49553741" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_by_total_area&amp;diff=49554733&amp;oldid=49553741" rel="nofollow">rehashing my warning and taunting me with an arguable personal attack</a> (e.g., I'm not sanctioned and have not been, as C. has noted)</li>
</ul>
<p>As an editor of some of these articles, and not necessarily a policeman of them, I find Cantus' behaviour wholly frustrating and counterproductive. And, despite prior sanction and warnings, it doesn't seem that Cantus is either willing or able to modify his behaviour. I request that this editor's behaviour be reviewed and, as prescribed in the ArbCom ruling, that some corrective actions be taken; in the very least, the article recently moved (point 4) should be returned to its prior locale.

<p>I was wondering what to do about actions I consider as <i>vandalism</i> done by an administrator. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a> put up the article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Personal_rapid_transit/UniModal&amp;oldid=49250676" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Personal_rapid_transit/UniModal&amp;oldid=49250676" rel="nofollow">SkyTran (links to old article)</a> up for deletion, but when I called for a vote it was a unanimous vote of around 8 people I think. Some may have been sockpuppets (that has been claimed, but I don't know how to determine that), but in any case JzG took the fail of his proposition to mean that he would <i>merge</i> the article into another article. This basically means he redirected it to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_rapid_transit.html" title="Personal rapid transit">PRT</a>, without much merge (only merging a sentence or two out of a large article). I don't know what I can do about an admin, which is why I'm asking here. If anyone could help with this situation, it would be much appreciated. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 23:03, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just because <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a> is an administrator doesn't mean that you need to find another administrator to discuss editing with him or her.

<dd>He already has reverted it, twice. The fact remains that the balance of input from editors with an edit history (even including the bogus "vote here" section) was for there not to be a separate article. We don't usually have articles promoting fictional commercial products, and I can't see why we should make an exception here. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:29, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Its not an exception if theres no rule. Besides, there are plenty of articles on fictional universes, characters, stories, etc. Its a *theory* not a fantasy.

<dd>No, it's not a theory, it's a commercial proposition which has (as yet) no objective reality but for which the proposer is trying to achieve funding and support. There is a difference. Nobody is trying to attract investors to make the <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firebolt.html" title="Firebolt">Firebolt</a> - and even that is a redirect althoguh I venture to suggest that rather more people have heard of it.</dd>

<dd>Well I suppose it depends on your definition of theory, but its a proposal at least, and one that many people are intereseted in. The firebolt, however, is not a proposal.. so I don't really see the point of your example. If there was enough detailed information about the <i>firebolt</i> to warrent its own page (like the amount that SkyTran has), then I would think it would have its own page. 68.6.112.70 18:39, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, merging does not inherently require discussion before-hand.

<dd>I agree, and i've merged without discussion plenty of times - however it was 100% obvious that people wanted this as a stand alone article - and I myself have called for discussion more than once (well more than 3 or 4 times actually). <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a> doesn't seem to think that discussion is neccessary even tho many people disagree with him.

<dd>Actually it was 100% obvious that people <i>didn't</i> want this as a stand-alone article. I brought the AfD closure here for review, and that backed up my judgment on this. The people who "voted" in your ad-hoc "vote here" section (AfD is not a vote) were all new or unregistered users, which appear to be the result of external vote solicitation. To discount such input is normal in closing AfDs. Especially when they admit to a political vested interest, as one did. The close went against my preferred action (delete). As stated before, we typically do not have articles on promoting hypothetical products; this is an encyclopaedia, not a place for making investment pitches. Skytran <i>does not exist</i> in any meaningful sense - there is no prototype, let alone any implementation. The discussion in PRT is more than adequate to encyclopaedically cover one man's pipe dream. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 17:42, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>JzG, you *didn't* merge. How much info did you take from SkyTran and put it in PRT? Like 2 sentences. Thats not a merge. And I don't understand why "external vote solicitation" matters. If people care enough to solicit votes, thats perfectly legit.</dd>
<dd>If you had *actually* merged significant amounts of info, then I wouldn't be complaining here so much - but you didn't. You went through with deleteing it, and redirect it to PRT. Why can't we discus this more before doing that merge? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 20:18, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Most of it was already in there (including the picture). I left out the fiction and speculation - it has taken forever to get the speculation and fiction out of the article as it is.

<dd>I really wouldn't say thats much of a merge. You can obviously argue that most of the SkyTran article was "fiction", but I beg to differ. Most of the SkyTran article was information on the design *idea*. Why is that sort of information un-fit for wikipedia?

<dd>Ok, StabiloBoss, but this is an argument about the deletion or undeletion of a page. We aren't arguing the integrity or trustworthiness of either me or JzG. I really just want a merge or delete to be discussed before happening. The discussion that was had wasn't about merging, and there are more people than just me that don't want SkyTran merged with PRT.

This is outrageous behavior. My life as an editor on Wikipedia has nothing to do with my academic career. Something needs to be done." I asked Southwick if he could provide proof to me that this occurred and he has. I can provide the evidence, but I am trying to protect the emails of those involved. <a href="../../../w/s/i/User%7EWsiegmund_987c.html" title="User:Wsiegmund">User:Wsiegmund</a> is on my watchlisted editors and I saw that he was also involved in this situation in a mediative role.

<p>I questioned Cap_j about this email and told him I needed verification.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Cap_j#Question" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Cap_j#Question" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> I also subsequently recieved a copy of the email that Southwick had sent by way of email to me. In the version that Southwick provided, the wording "You do not know who you are messing with. Feel free to contact me here." does not exist. I asked Cap_j to send me the copy he recieved and the address to Cap_j is different than the address that Southwick actually used to email Cap_j...the times of transmission are also different. In a nutshell, Cap_j did indeed contact Southwick's place of employment in regards to an editing dispute in Wikipedia...that is the primary reason for the block. Secondarily, Cap_j misrepresented an email that Southwick had sent to him, when questioned by myself and by Wsiegmund. Without being unilateral, I request further advisement, and I also want to point out that I am rather itchy about this off wiki harassment as of late, but regardless of that, I am inclined to permanblock Cap_j for his actions.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 05:06, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is the <i>English</i> wikipedia - non-English links are what interwiki linking is for. If you are looking for Korea in Korean, try the Korean wikipedia. Besides, we have enough problems making sure English language articles and redirects are NPOV and not slanderous without this. The problem with redirects esp in non-latin languages, is that, few editors would be able to read them, and so there would be little chance of problematic redirects being caught. We could be redirecting God-&gt;George Bush, or someone's name-&gt;asshole and never know. I'd say delete all but the most obvious ones. However, <s>perhaps</s> this is not the forum for this debate. Can someone point to a better place, existing policy or debate, or open up a centralised discussion. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 20:25, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>The body of each article, preferably in its first paragraph, should list all common names by which its subject is known. When the native name is written in a non-Latin alphabet this representation should be included along with Latin alphabet transliterations and English alphabet transliterations. For example, the <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> article should mention that the city is also known as <a href="../../../p/e/k/Peking.html" title="Peking">Peking</a>, and that both names are transliterations of the name <a href="../../../%E5%8C%97/%E4%BA%AC/_/%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC.html" title="北京">北京</a>. It is also useful to have multiple redirects to the main article, for example <a href="../../../s/v/e/Sverige.html" title="Sverige">Sverige</a> is a redirect to <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>. If there is a significant number of alternative names or forms it may be helpful to keep only the most common two or three in the first paragraph and a list of them in a separate section to avoid cluttering the lead; see <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freyr.html" title="Freyr">Freyr</a> for an example of this.</p>

<dd>I also deleted a fair percentage of these, using CSD-R3 (stretched somewhat). I also put the {adminbacklog} tag up to call in reinforcements to help with the deleting. However, an unwritten rule of CSD should be that Speedy Deletes are used for things that are assumed to be non-contraversial to everyone (except perhaps the original creator). When I was told that this wasn't a non-contraversial matter, I undeleted all of my own deletes. I'd happily delete them all again, but feel that clarification is now required. As such, it's best to undelete now and debate the matter, then delete again afterward; possibly the only time you'll hear me say that as generally I believe in delete-and-perhaps-recreate-better (with caveats on this entire policy that I won't go into here so please don't judge).</dd>
<dd>I think that we need to decide where a line lies - if Pokemon is likely to be searched for as "ポケモン", then that redirect should exist. But there's little or no need to redirect "英語" to "English", if nothing else than because the result will be an article in English that the searcher won't understand (the Pokeman searcher may be looking for what ポケモン means on the packet their game/toy/card/something came in, after all). In other words, a redirect to a Proper Noun is, er, proper. A redirect to a simple noun (or a verb etc) is useless.</dd>

<p>At <a href="../../../p/n/t/WP%7EPNT_42b9.html" title="WP:PNT">WP:PNT</a>, I often redirect duplicate articles with foreign-language titles to the corresponding English-language title. Of course I tag them {{<a href="../../../r/_/f/Template%7ER_from_alternate_language_7b65.html" title="Template:R from alternate language">R from alternate language</a>}}. I don't think foreign-language redirects should ever be speedily deleted unless the deleting admin understands the redirect and knows that it is inappropriate; at least the redirect should be given the chance to have a speaker of the language look at it first. For example, we could make a rule that you should ask at <a href="../../../p/n/t/WP%7EPNT_42b9.html" title="WP:PNT">WP:PNT</a> whether a foreign-looking redirect makes sense. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 14:09, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because of past disagreements between Nandesuka and Alienus over the content of <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a> related articles, in my opinion it is inappropriate for Nandesuka to use his position as an administrator to block Alienus. In the interest of fairness, Nandesuka should excuse himself from any administrative action involving Alienus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also in the interest of fairness it should be noted that Alienus edited the offending comment cited by Nandesuka when he realized that that it had been posted. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=49911874&amp;oldid=49911496" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=49911874&amp;oldid=49911496" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> -- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanBlackham_ea8d.html" title="User:DanBlackham">DanBlackham</a> 20:03, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it were a content dispute, I'd agree, but this is user conduct, on pages that are totally unrelated to circumcision. I think that Nandesuka was right to raise the issue here, since as he points out he has a history with Alienus, but as far as I can tell his actions were appropriate.</dd>

<dd>You know, many anti-circumcision activists have made this claim, but none have ever been able to show me a single example where I have ever a) advised a prospective parent to circumcise, or b) said that circumcision is advisable in general.

<dd>The conflicts usually start out as a content dispute, then when an editor like Alienus responses in an intemperate way, the focus changes to the user's conduct. People's attention is thus distracted from the real source of disagreement which is content.</dd>

<dd>I also completly agree with Nandesku's actions. I don't think N is involved any more than anyone else that has come into contact with Alienus. This user is so rude and uncivil that it is probable that anyone that has edited on the same page as him will encounter some of his innappropriate comments. In this case it was perfectly appropriate to act as Nandesku did.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 07:34, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was a fairly stable article titled <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_liberalism.html" title="American liberalism">American liberalism</a>. Somebody moved it to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_social_liberalism.html" title="American social liberalism">American social liberalism</a> and then moved it again to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_liberalism_%28United_States%29_05f8.html" title="Social liberalism (United States)">Social liberalism (United States)</a>. On the talk page, several people opposed the move and nobody supported it when it turned out that the person who made the move had not bothered to fix redirects. (I was willing to go along with it, but have now joined the others who oppose the move.) I tried to move the article back, but it wouldn't move because of the double redirect. So, I'm afraid I made matters worse by trying to move <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_liberalism.html" title="American liberalism">American liberalism</a> to American liberalism scratch, to free up the name for the article to move back. That didn't work. I read some advice in "help" and now realize that I should have moved the article back one step at a time, but apparently it is too late for that now, though I have managed to move it back from Social liberalism (United States) to American social liberalism. There it sits.</p>
<p>Since the main article on <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> links to the article <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_liberalism.html" title="American liberalism">American liberalism</a> I think that title is the most stable. If you are willing to help by moving American social liberalism back to American liberalism, and delete American liberalism scratch, American social liberalism, and Social liberalism (United States), I will take on the job of fixing all the links.</p>

<dd>Is there no way of finding PRODs due for deletion that actually works? I clicked on some at random from the Interiot list just now - not just the bottom three - and two had already been deleted, while one had had its PROD tag removed. Hell, I was about to post this, then I did it again - all three were fairly near the top of the reds, and all three had been deleted already. That is not good odds for someone who wants to spend their time productively.

<p>Could we make a bot that automatically adds articles that are past their prod time to the CSD list?

<dd>I disagree with making such a bot. When I first became an admin, I was chastised multiple times for deleting articles that did not fit <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD criteria</a>. CSD'ing <i>all</i> old PRODs would result in lots of admins all of the sudden speedily deleting articles against policy. In fact, when I scan through <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a>, I routinely find articles marked as CSD that shouldn't be. When I find such an article, I either AFD it or PROD it.

<dd>Sceptre initially reverted the template because there was a discussion in #wikipedia about how it wasn't working.

We could use a bot to to check the date when the prod was added but it's going to be a fairly big pain in the ass if we're going back to one system or another. (most of the code I should be able to nab from Tawkerbot2, it might bot be as big of a deal as I think) -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 04:55, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems like Rory was doing what he (and apparently others) thought was the consensus decision... which was also what the template itself specifically instructed. I haven't kept up with the whole 'broken prod' mess but there was obviously a good deal of confusion. Some people are <i>still</i> suggesting that what Rory was doing was beneficial or, at worst, only that Tawker's bot could have done the same thing more efficiently if Rory hadn't been doing it manually. Trying to 'fix' something and other people subsequently deciding to 'fix' it a different way doesn't seem like any kind of 'bad act' to me. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 11:16, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kelly was wrong here. She has not provided any evidence that there was a dispute over Rory's actions (diffs, someone else confirming, etc.) and diffs and the PROD talk page testify that there was support for Rory's action. As I see it, the block was simply and planinly incorrect, unless Kelly or someone else can provide such evidence. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 00:48, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll just lay this out in point form for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>One of your admin reverted a change with no comment. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cuba&amp;diff=49968466&amp;oldid=49967025" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cuba&amp;diff=49968466&amp;oldid=49967025" rel="nofollow">rv</a></li>
<li>The admin reversion was immidiatly undone, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cuba&amp;diff=49968923&amp;oldid=49968466" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cuba&amp;diff=49968923&amp;oldid=49968466" rel="nofollow">You are supposed to be an administrator! Remember, I'm not a "communist" --we can discuss this, my changes follow policy!</a>.</li>
<li>I then added my image <a href="../../../4/0/8/Image%7E408px-Che.jpg_2b19.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/8/8a/408px-Che.jpg/12px-408px-Che.jpg" alt="" width="12" height="18" longdesc="../../../4/0/8/Image%7E408px-Che.jpg_2b19.html" /></a>.</li>
<li>Finally, your admin locked the page, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cuba&amp;diff=49970205&amp;oldid=49969974" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cuba&amp;diff=49970205&amp;oldid=49969974" rel="nofollow">Protected Cuba: Stop edit war, allow discussion [edit=sysop:move=sysop</a>)]] and reverted it all (my image included!)

<li>So far, there has been no efforts at discussion. But I did recently leave a message at the admins userpage, so give it time</li>
</ol>
<p>Also Note: The previous time this admin sponsored a revert war (after welcoming me by calling me a coward/sock puppet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACuba&amp;diff=49557696&amp;oldid=49557397)" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACuba&amp;diff=49557696&amp;oldid=49557397)" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, the admin brought this up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BruceHallman&amp;diff=49461797&amp;oldid=49459999" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BruceHallman&amp;diff=49461797&amp;oldid=49459999" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZleitzen&amp;diff=49559205&amp;oldid=49558926" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZleitzen&amp;diff=49559205&amp;oldid=49558926" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>). Now I still have no hard feelings, but this admin is really standing in the way of fixing up the article. I understand in the admin's world view, Castro represents things that I can't understand... I just want someone to help out here. (disclosure: the anon involved is me)</p>

<li>Since he was also involved in editing the page, it was likely not appropriate for PMA to protect the page. I'm also not sure why he felt the need to roll back to his version while the page was protected, as it seems a bit petty. However I would advise against making substantial changes to contentious articles without testing for disagreement on the talk page. The actual content of his edits seems quite reasonable, but he probably should not have mixed in admin tools. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 03:26, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No real need to defend yourself...based on his edits I assume that Mystork is probably not a super-easy-to-get-along-with kind of guy. But it would probably be better to leave protection (at least protection related to content disputes) for uninvolved admins.

<dd>I have to disagree here PMA violated #1 &amp; #2 of the protection policy and should have to defend his actions. A uninvolved admin should have been asked to step in, the page should NOT have been reverted, and PMA should NOT have protected the page himself. Users are expected to respect policy and admins should also respect policy. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Mike</a> <sub>(<a href="../../../o/n/t/User_talk%7EOnthost_6d42.html" title="User talk:Onthost">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Onthost_a9ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Onthost">C</a>)</sub> <a href="../../../s/t/a/Image%7EStar_of_life.svg_5f65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Star_of_life.svg/20px-Star_of_life.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../s/t/a/Image%7EStar_of_life.svg_5f65.html" /></a> 18:04, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd gotten <i>that far</i>, but I needed my beauty rest (Trust Me!). I figure one reason he's done this is because of all the fancy interlinking, which if they were in sandbox mode would require him to then fix those cross links once the articles were moved to article space. I'll do five or so, if a few others will take on as many, he can't get too resentful.

<dd><i>Please!</i> I'm the original worry wart when it comes to political edits and Wikipedia as a campaign tool, but this case is quite different. The editor resolved to an IP <i>at her office</i> (her being Cathy Cox), and the edits were embarrassing but true information. I'm not for either politician, as I haven't made up my mind about whom I support in the race, but, as much as I fear (and as often as I sang songs of woe about the coming use of Wikipedia in politics), it's one thing to say "We will revert any political usage of Wikipedia and protect pages that are being used for campaigning" or "We will put disclaimers on pages indicating that our open editorial policy renders them unstable" and quite another to say, "We will tell anyone who asks how to use WHOIS." I don't object to Mark Taylor's office running WHOIS or reading the History tab. I object to "Wikipedia confirms that the edits came from Cathy Cox's office." It turns out that such was not the case, quite. It appears that Jimbo was asked to confirm that a given change was the insertion and that WHOIS did give a particular ownership. I guess I would have preferred his saying, "That appears to be the case" or "You have read the history correctly" and overtly tried not to give the newspapers grounds for saying "Wikipedia says," and, of course, the Georgia Public Radio newswriters made things much worse. It's a game of telephone by the time it gets to their hacks, but I do wish we weren't confirming or appearing to assent to searching out the origins of non-libelous edits. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:28, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think user talk pages should be deleted under any circumstances, and <i>most particularly</i> I don't it's proper to delete one's own user talk page. It seems to me to fall under the same category as using blocking privileges to enforce your own Wikibreak, which is strictly prohibited. I can easily see people leaving the project (with the serious intention of going away for good) during a particularly nasty exchange, deleting their userpage, then coming back sometime later and 'forgetting' to restore it. Similarly, I do seem to recall that in several past arbitrations, an admin's deletion of their own user talk page (during one nasty exchange or another, granted, and after they'd said things they'd obviously rather unsay) became one of the central issues against them. Basically, if an admin wants to leave the project, I see no reason why they can't settle for merely blanking their user and talk pages like anyone else... permanently deleting other users' legitimate comments strikes me as something to be avoided and discouraged whenever possible. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 09:44, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I strongly disagree with prohibition of deleting user pages. Every one has a right to decide about his pages. Just blanking is not enough. Otherwise everyone should be warned: "If you post anything even on your own page, it cannot be deleted." -- Vít Zvánovec 10:08, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That warning is inherent to everything added to Wikipedia, and is indeed presented to you before every edit; that's part of what it means when it says that "you agree to license your contributions under the GFDL." No one has the automatic right to utterly retract anything that they add to Wikipedia, even on their own talk pages; it is not even within a normal user's <i>capabilities</i> to permanently delete their talk page. Indeed, a normal user who requested that one of their submissions or comments be hard-deleted simply because they desired it would (rightfully) be laughed off of whatever forum they requested it on. Granted, admins <i>are</i> given the ability to "permanently" delete things under a limited subset of circumstances in order to help run the encyclopedia, but I see nothing in the rules that would extend this to grant them the discretionary ability to delete their own talk pages, nor any reason why it <i>should</i> be extended to grant them that right. Deleting your own talk page has nothing to do with the maintenance or smooth functioning of the encyclopedia, which is supposed to be the sole purpose of an admin's abilities, and goes against the principals of openness and respect for the comments of others, both of which are essential to Wikipedia's functioning. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 11:07, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is obvious that a normal user cannot delete his or her page by himself or herself. But the petition for that should be done without reluctance. Has anybody to be forced to have personal attacs on his or her own talk page?</p>

<dd>Personal information is a special case. Users can always have personal information about themselves specifically excised, provided it isn't already common knowledge. (You could get your username changed, by the way; I know of at least one other longstanding user who had his name changed for that reason.) I should note in passing, though, that I was talking about the wholesale deletion of user:<b>talk</b> pages, not the user pages themselves or the removal of specific troublesome edits; the issue with deleting user:talk pages is that it invariably involves deleting the comments of numerous other users, which is normally against policy. We do it when deleting an article, sure, but in that case the discussions are unlikely to remain relevant. With a user's talk page, though, they remain relevant for, at the very least, as long as the flesh-and-blood user those comments were directed to could conceivably continue contributing to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 03:26, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems that a user has taken exception to something I've said or done; his complaints are rather incoherent so I can't say more. He has expressed himself a number of times on my user page; an admin thoughtfully placed it under semi-protection. Now this annoyed user, via a succession of socks, has turned to my <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reid_5801.html" title="User talk:John Reid">talk</a>. A number of admins have taken time out from their busy rounds to stem the tide. I apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
<p>I'd like to suggest that so long as this user confines himself to experimentation on my user page he is not a danger to the community. I'm sure we would all rather see him better directed, perhaps away from the project entirely; but it may be most efficient to permit him to enjoy himself on one page in this project that is of little or no concern to anybody. I don't consider my user page to be any sort of showplace; it's merely a collection of useful links. History provides me with usable versions on demand; this user's expressions are a minor inconvenience even to me. Meanwhile he expends his energies harmlessly.</p>
<p>I would appreciate if admins who notice such play be sure to add each new sock to the appropriate category. However, I'd prefer my user page <i>not</i> be protected and, for that matter, that no admin take time to revert changes to it. I'm sure I appreciate the attention but it's really not needed.

<p>The edit warring on this article was getting out of hand yesterday. I was informed on my talk page about this by an anon ip editor. On reviewing the AfD the article had gone through (resulting in no consensus) the discussion leant towards it being moved to <a href="../../../o/i/t/OITC_fraud_57e1.html" title="OITC fraud">OITC fraud</a>, which I did last night. The edit warring continued for a while on both pages, eventually ending with 3rr by both parties for which I blocked both editors for 11 hours. Both appeared to accept this positively but edits to the article today (and absence of same to talk page) show no attempts in talking it out.</p>
<p>The anon claims it is all a big hoax, the named editor(s) claim it is genuine and that the wiki is being used for defamatory purposes. There has already been some mention of liturgation by the named users. I have moved the talk that was posted on my talk page to the article's talk page. I would like (a) more experienced admin(s) who knows their way round these points better than I to take a look at both the article and the talk page, and give me some idea what needs doing from here. Thanks. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_alf_522c.html" title="User:Wiki alf">Alf</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWiki_alf_56f1.html" title="User talk:Wiki alf"><font color="green">melmac</font></a></sup> 18:07, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alf, I am wondering what to do about the persistent vandalism and menaces directed agaist the above mentioned article and against the authors of the original article thereby filed. I would not initiate another persistent copy and paste, but I would be thankful if this issue can be referred to someone at Wiki.</p>
<p>I and some friends have worked hard in the article, furnishing as many sources as possible and in general giving hard and verifiable facts. The people from the OITC only fill up the same recycled paragraphs they have used before in their dealings. Can something be done? Thanks in advance for your reply.</p>

<dd>I wouldn't block you, personally, and if I had blocked you without knowing of the self-revert, and you told me about it, I would unblock. I would say that it's not in the policy because it's a very rare occurrence, and when it does happen admins should be expected to use their common sense. Technically a 3RR block would still be valid, though I would guess that most admins would show leniency - but not showing leniency would not be a just cause to start filing 'admin abuse' RFCs. If that happened, it would be best to leave an edit summary clearly explaining what you're doing. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 11:10, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the past week alone, there have been around 15 reversions of anon vandalism (originating all over the place) with no significant content additions (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viv_Nicholson&amp;diff=50616092&amp;oldid=49453312" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viv_Nicholson&amp;diff=50616092&amp;oldid=49453312" rel="nofollow">week-long diff</a>) on <a href="../../../v/i/v/Viv_Nicholson_4f1a.html" title="Viv Nicholson">Viv Nicholson</a>.

<p>A user has asked me if he can have some personal information deleted from a talk page archive, which he regrets leaving. The trouble is that he made the edits in question months ago and never removed it, and the archive contains many more edits on top of it, all containing the personal information. So far as I can see the only way to delete the personal information altogether is to edit the page to remove it, then delete all the revisions leading up to it. Would that be acceptable? It's a talk page archive rather than an article, so would the signatures be sufficient to avoid breaking the GFDL? --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 18:40, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can another administrator, preferably someone with experience with image copyright tags, take a look at (warning: image is graphic) <a href="../../../j/f/k/Image%7EJfkautopsy.jpg_7c25.html" title="Image:Jfkautopsy.jpg">Image:Jfkautopsy.jpg</a>? The uploader, <a href="../../../g/p/s/User%7EGpscholar_4e15.html" title="User:Gpscholar">Gpscholar</a> (who has received several warning messages from OrphanBot already) has tagged it as public domain and gives this as his summary: <i>http://www.celebritymorgue.com -- this is a photograph of President Kennedy's corpse, taken at his autopsy and is, as such, in the public domain</i>. However, the photo has the website's name in the corner, and when I visited the website, it does not provide any source information and also says Copyright 2005, which makes me doubt that the photo is really public domain. All in all, the image triggered my "red flag" instinct, so I've gone ahead and removed it from the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F.

<dd>Well, the website rotten.com states they "collects images and information from many sources to present the viewer with a truly unpleasant experience." In this case, the question is what source did they get this from? For JFK, they state "The autopsy pictures, taken at Bethesda Naval Hospital on November 22, 1963." I think it's safe to assume they were taken by government employees there. Now, what context was the picture used in the article. Being graphic as it is, I know we allow such pictures, but I personally don't think this picture is essential in illustrating his assassination in the main <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> article. On the other hand, it's more directly pertinent to the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_755d.html" title="John F.

<dd>Thanks for the reply! I agree that the inclusion of the pictures is a separate topic. I'm just wondering, given that the image has the site's name in the corner and that the site does say copyright 2005, that the image does qualify as pd?

<dd>Sure. celebritymorgue.com didn't take the picture, so they can't copyright it. They can put their watermark on it, and they can stick a copyright notice on their web site, but that doesn't matter.

<p>Its the morning and I haven't had enough tea yet so forgive me for not remembering the rules regarding highly linked templates (ie how high is high?). Per CFD this morning we tossed a bunch of the templates from Category:Article header templates to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category%7EProtection_templates_850a.html" title="Category:Protection templates">Category:Protection templates</a> (because they were basically all protection templates). As I was moving them in my &lt; multiple tea state, I noticed that three of them weren't protected and protected two of the three...only to realize that the protection notice *was* the template. So I guess what I'm asking is: should they all be protected, or only {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProtected_7bf5.html" title="Template:Protected">protected</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../m/o/v/Template%7EMoveprotected_6276.html" title="Template:Moveprotected">moveprotected</a>}} as originally. I'm happy to go back and remove the protection I did on the other two, but figured it was better to get feedback here in case I accidentally did a good thing. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 13:13, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Schools seem to produce a rather large amount of vandalism- rather than just issuing numerous short blocks I was wondering if there was a better way? I am willing to try long term blocks in conjunction with school contact for the most persistent cases (I think Hall Monitor used this tactic before disappearing?), but I want to hear about any previous experience from more experienced admins first. Has anyone ever tried to contact schools regarding vandalism from their computers? If so what response did you get? Any other general advice on dealing with school vandalism other than the usual revert-warn-block routine? <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 19:33, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

His userpage said he was an administrator but he had <i>no talk page</i>, but then I checked and saw he had only <i><b>nine edits</b></i>.
