<h2><span class="mw-headline">Archiving guidelines</span></h2>
<p>Hi, can I get some feedback on how quickly to archive stuff on the main page here? (I think I've been doing OK so far, 'cause nobody's complained, but it would be nice to get something down so I don't have to rely totally on gut.)</p>
<p>In general my policy has been to try and keep stuff on the main page as long as possible, modulo keeping that page reasonably sized. (I.e. I don't move stuff off unless I need to, to bring the size down - better to leave it there in case someone happens by some days later and wants to add a comment.)</p>
<p>My sense is that with questions about specific pages/people, it's OK to archive them as soon as the situation appears to have been resolved, plus a few days grace (2-4). My reasoning here is that there's usually not a lot of policy lessons to be drawn, it's usually just very specific questions ("is anon a.b.c.d really a vandal"). If it's a question about abuse of admin powers, I leave them longer (a full week after the last comment), so as to avoid the appearance of trying to sweep evidence of admin power abuse under the rug before people can see it.</p>
<p>With the "here's something the community might need to know about" (e.g. the request for input on the Wiktionary link thing), I try to leave those as long as possible (modulo size) to give them as wide a visibility as possible. Eventually they are kind of stale, so after a couple of weeks I would move them out.</p>
<p>The general policy questions I try and leave the longest, because those seem to be the things where people seem to come by and add a comment, even after a considerable time has passed.</p>
<p>Does this all sound OK? Do people have recommendations for changes? <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 00:37, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Incident reports with policy discussion</span></h2>
<p>Some incident reports have extensive policy dicussions in them. (See, for example, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive2_098f.html#Critique_of_Finno-Ugric_and_Uralic_language_groups_3RR_violation" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive2">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive2#Critique of Finno-Ugric and Uralic language groups 3RR violation</a>.) I wish I could do something special with them, separate them out from the vast mass of ordinary incident reports. On the other hand, putting them in the General archive (the solution I've adopted up until now) doesn't seem right either. I was thinking of creating a third class of archive, "Notable Incidents", or something, but I worry that i) I'm getting a little too organization-happy, and ii) that it will make the archive navbox at the top of the page too complex. Am I worrying too much? Is this a worthwhile goal at all? Feedback solicited! <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:34, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sounds like a good idea, but I'd do it slightly different: I'd archive them normally, but set up another page, maybe /Policy precedents, from where one could link to the relevant discussions in the general archive. For instance, under heading "<a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Blocking policy</a>", we could have the entry "Blocking for uploading inappropriate images (pedophilia, pornography, etc): see /Archive 3#More inappropriate image-loading".

<dd>There's nothing inherently wrong with uploading pornography; It would be quite appropriate in an article about pornography for instance. Uploading images without using them in an article is always a problem ofcourse. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 14:50, 2005 Jan 12 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My entry was just an example and the wording could be improved, so let's not get into a discussion whether an encyclopedia article on pornography needs explicit examples&#160;:-) If you read <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#More_inappropriate_image-loading" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#More inappropriate image-loading</a>, you'll see what this was about. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 15:12, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, so I've taken a first crack at this, and produced Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incident index. It's a bit thread-bare at the moment, additional layout/formatting welcome.</p>
<p>There are only a few links on purpose - I'm trying to filter out only the most interesting discussions. I.e. I considered adding these as well:</p>

</ul>
<p>which are moderately worthwhile, but I decided not to, because if we kept this level of stuff, in a few months the index would have an amazing arount of stuff on it, and people wouldn't find it useful. So I only selected out the very best discussions to add to the Index.</p>
<p>Anyway, see what y'all think. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 01:01, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">what belongs here?</span></h2>
<p>we seem to get more and more general requests for attention here. I see no reason for '172+Gzornenplatz contribution to the Polish-Soviet War' and 'Rhobite's Misuse of Administrator Blocking' here. this is not rfc. At best, we could have a section with <i>simple links</i> to such issues, but the arguing should take place elsewhere. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>·õè</b>)</a> 09:22, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>The first one I agree with. This isn't the kindergarten monitoring team.</dd>
<dd>The second one I am much more sympathetic with doing here, because I think it's worth having a step less formal than a full-blown RfC when you think an admin has stepped over the line. It's good for both sides, actually, because if it's a frivolous complaint which is intended to do nothing more than harass the admin, it's good for the admin to hear a lot of other admins say "good call". On the other hand, if an admin has been a bit excessive (and we do see some of that), it's good to have a less formal way to let them know a little more gently than an RfC that they went a bit too far.</dd>
<dd>Still, a paragraph at the top saying "this isn't the place to bring disputes over content - we aren't referees, work it out yourselves, using the procedures Wikipedia lays out [here] and [here]" would be a good addition. Why don't you do one and add it? <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 12:53, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Navboxes</span></h2>
<p>We're shortly about to fill up the first four "Incident" archives, so we have to decide what to do about the Navbox. We can either add a line of four more, which will only put off the day we have to do it again for two months or so (at the current run rate). If we keep adding them, we'll eventually wind up with a huge navbox.</p>
<p>My suggestion is that we have two versions of the navbox - one (used on the main page, etc) which only list the <i>four most recent</i> Incident archives, and the other (used on the various archive pages) which lists <i>all</i> the archives. (I suppose if I were really clever I'd figure out a way to do it with one template that takes an argument, but I'm not sure there is a way to do that, is there?) <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:47, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The suggestion sounds good, as for ways to do it with a single template the only thing I can come up with is an ugly hack whereby you pass (parts of) &lt;!-- to the template, which it inserts around the older entries you don't want to display. I'm not sure if that'll help clarity much. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 18:21, 2005 Jan 22 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have gone through and done most of the changes discussed above: made the longer Navbox, and switched the archive pages, and the Incident Index page, to use the longer Navbox. I have decided to hold off tweaking the short Navbox to refer to Incident archives 3-6 (I decided it would be too much of a hassle to update it for every new archive, and thought I'd do it two at a time) until I actually start putting stuff in 5. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 02:50, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, now that I think about it some more, even the longer navboxs will eventually be pretty huge (at least for the IncidentArchives, which really crank up), so I think the in long run the right answer is to have a chronological index at the bottom of Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incident index. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 16:23, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't mind having sup-pages, but I'd rather not transclude them. Yes it makes editing easier (less chance of a conflict), but it makes the main page slower to render (an issue these days with the overloading - try looking at VP, it takes forever to load - it works for VfD because many people go straight to the sub-pages), plus to which there seem to be caching issues, and you don't always get the most recent version of the sub-pages anyway when looking at the top page. Simply linking to sub-pages (as opposed to transcluding) would still get you the feature that you'd see the top page listed in your watchlist when a new item was added. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:15, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC) <i>[Contribution reformated &amp; repositioned to its proper logical place by <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 23:59, 2005 Jan 26 (UTC)]</i>
<ul>
<li>Let's be clear: transclusion per se does nothing to ease editing, and sometimes interferes. What happens on VfD is that
<ol>
<li>Transclusion was reasonably promptly enhanced to handle included sections consistently, and</li>
<li>Nominators of VfD pages have done a good job of remembering to start with a section heading.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>To edit anything placed above the heading, you have to
<ol>
<li>Get over your confusion about not finding it when you link via the "[edit]" lk next above it;</li>
<li>edit the section next below it;</li>
<li>either hit
<ul>
<li>"Save page" and then "Edit" on the resulting (full) subpage, or</li>
<li>edit the browser's URL to remove "&amp;section=1" and hit Enter or "Go" (with MS IE).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>(Similar considerations apply where a subpage gets additional sections (which BTW are usually created at the wrong heading-level).)</dd>
<dd>The amelioration of ed-confs is solely from use of multiple pages (sub- or not). Transclusion actually makes it harder on slow-pipe users, by permitting total-content growth to continue without being reined in in response to ed-conf pressure.</dd>
<dd>Thus all discussion that confuses transclusion with other multiple-page techniques is misguided.</dd>
<dd>Noel is quite correct in criticizing transclusion for compounding the problem of loading the rendered page. (Not everyone will be comfortable with my technique of <i>editing</i> the page instead of viewing it, finding the sub-page i'm interested in, and then viewing or editing <i>just</i> that sub-page. (I don't call that convenient: i call it <i>inconvenient</i>, and no better than dramatically less inconvenient than waiting for the full rendered page to load.)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sections and Subsections</span></h2>
<p>I finally figured out why many people (esp. newbies) were always adding new sections (i.e. with == around them) instead of subsections (i.e. with ===, which we'd always have to then go fix. Simple: the "leave a message" link at the top of the page used "&amp;section=new", which automatically creates a new section! Alas, there doesn't seem to be a "&amp;subsection=new" directive, but I shamelessly ripped off some magic from NickJ's Redirect project stuff and tweaked the "leave a message" link so that it does something which, while very ugly and kludgy, is a little closer. If that hack is so ugly it makes you want to barf, feel free to revert it, but I thought I'd at least give it a try! <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 03:39, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Time to split up the board into separate pages?</span></h2>
<p>Well, I'm wondering if the time hasn't come to split up the board. The problems I mentioned above ("the page is bloating .. the edit rate is very high" continue), and deciding what to archive to control the bloat is becoming more difficult. I'd <i>like</i> to leave items about admins up longer, to prevent any claims that we are "sweeping complaints about admins under the rug quickly", but I'm just not sure we can afford to do so any more.</p>
<p>I am also still worried that people are tuning out because of the rapid churn, etc, which would really be a bummer, because it would void one of the reasons this board was created in the first place.</p>
<p>I have carefully reviwed the discussion above (at <a href="#3RR_reports" title="">#3RR reports</a>), but I didn't detect a consensus about what to do. How about the following suggestion: split the board up into three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>One for reporting 3RR violations;</li>
<li>One for other Incidents;</li>
<li>The current board would retain only the current "Tasks/General" sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest three sections rather than two to try and get ahead of the growth of traffic through the page, and because if we're going to make a change, and get people used to a different scheme, lets only do it once.</p>
<p>I do not suggest using separate pages for each subsection (and therefor possibly transclusion, which is a separate but subsidiary issue) because I'm not sure there's enough traffic to warrant a separate subpage for each incident, plus to which there is the issue of people not wanting to watchlist sub-pages. 3 pages with fixed names would probably be reasonable, though.</p>

<dd>Well, TBSDY has <i>been bold</i>, so you've gotten your wish!</dd>
<dd>I will wait for the dust to subside a bit before dealing with the archives. (There has been a suggestion that maybe 3RR violation reports belong on a top-level page of their own.) If they do wind up staying here, I will create a third series of archives, for 3RR reports, and modify the Navbox appropriately. (I would also filter 3RR violation reports from the Incident archives across to the 3RR violation archives.) But let me wait and see what people decide to do. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 08:01, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now that I think about it, I think actually that if the 3RR stuff stays here, it's probably better not to separate out the 3RR/Incident stuff into separate archives. I mean, what use does it serve, really? As long as the stuff is there, what difference does it make? Separating out the general stuff makes sense, because someone might actually want to read through those archives, but who in their right mind would want to read either 3RR or Incident archives? Plus to which it will mean less files to maintain, etc. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 19:39, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now that I've thought about it for a while, I'm leaning towards keeping it here; it has to do with the point I mentioned above (at <a href="#Time_to_split_up_the_board_into_separate_pages.3F" title="">#Time to split up the board into separate pages?</a>) about only having a single set of archives. A lot of things fall on the borderline between 3RR and not 3RR - people get a 3RR block, then they start to edit anyway and get blocked for avoiding a block, etc. The difficulty in trying to categorize them was a big part of why I suggested above to only have a single archive. Really, the split into separate /3RR page and /Incidents page was in large part to i) keep pages small, and ii) reduce the churn rate - it's kind of a semi-artificial distinction, in other words. Hence my lean towards keeping it here. But I certainly wouldn't blow a gasket if we move it (less work for me&#160;;-). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 20:37, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If you want to change it back, I would be very happy with it - people seem to be confused by the current layout, and are putting stuff which to me seem like incident reports in the General section. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:14, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, for the record, here's an update of previous comment left elsewhere: I see two problems with doing it this way:
<ul>
<li>Clicking the edit link next to "Incidents", to add a new section, tries to edit the top-level page, so people will still have to go to the subpage to start a new section (and this probably also broke the "add a comment" link at the top of the main page; I have to go check it).</li>
<li>It makes the top-level page larger, and slower to render (a la VfD, and VP, both of which I refuse to visit any more because the load/render time is ridiculous); there are also the usual caching bugs when you transclude a page that changes rapidly.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In short, I'm not a big fan of this change, but I'll wait and see what other people say. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 16:11, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have terminated the transclsion of the /Incidents subpage - it was making life much harder for the archiving (incidents kept getting filed on the main page, and the rapid churn made edit collisions a constant occurence while archiving).

<dd>The problem I found when someone turned /Incidents into a transclude was that people got confused over which page to put things on, and the resulting confusion and page churn (and resultant editing conflicts) made archiving a lot more work for me, and made it really trying. At the moment, things have gone back to the relatively stable state they were in after we first split /Incidents and /3RR off as completely separate pages, and archiving has once again become a relatively simple, painless and fast operation. I'm really rather non-enthusiastic about anything that might upset that applecart!</dd>
<dd>I am also concerned about making yet <i>another</i> change to the organization after we just got finished with all that turmoil and change. I worry that we'd put people into reorg overload.</dd>
<dd>If you're concerned about the size of the main page, I can turn up the knob on the aggressiveness of archiving there a bit - I try and leave many things in "General" around for quite a while because people often drop in and leave comments after something has been quiet for a while (e.g. the recent comment added to <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Sockpuppet_detection" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#Sockpuppet detection</a>, and I see <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Images_protected_while_on_the_main_page" title="WP:AN">WP:AN#Images protected while on the main page</a> just picked up one too after a week or so of silence). Most of the entries are pretty small; only two (#Sockpuppet detection, and #Page-move rollback) are really long.</dd>
<dd>Would slightly more aggressive archiving be good enough? <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 04:04, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have a better idea. Why don't we place any large scale discussions of general into a sub-subpage of the AN? This way, any debate and/or discussion still going on can be either transincluded or left as an edit link. Archiving that one particular discussion would be not a problem, as all you need to do is link it, with a notice saying something along the lines of: <i>This discussion was separately archived due to the length of the debate. Please see this page, &lt;insert link&gt;, for the discussion.</i> -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 15:27, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I can step back to your initial comment for a second, while I was offline I had an afterthought I wanted to get some info about. I'm trying to understand what problem you were trying to fix by i) moving General to a sub-page, and ii) then transcluding it onto the main page.</dd>
<dd>It couldn't have been the size of the main page for displaying, because the transclusion means its the same size for that. It couldn't have been the size for editing, because the bulk of the page was the General section; e.g. of the current 43KB main page, the General section is 38K - in other words, moving it en bloc to a subpage wouldn't help there either. Similarly arguments apply to the rate of change to the page, either for editing, or for how often it shows up on a Watchlist.</dd>
<dd>I'm guessing from your most recent comment that you may have had similar thoughts, hence your proposal to break the page up into smaller pieces.</dd>
<dd>So what exactly is the problem you're trying to fix, by breaking General up into subpages, with separate subpages for the more popular topics? If I can understand that, that will help me better understand if this is the right solution. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 21:57, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What's the issue with 32K, other than the notice if you go to edit?(That notice could probably be removed now, I think; AFAIK there are no longer any browsers still able to function with Wikipedia that have this limitation, now that using Wikipedia requires HTTP 1.1, etc.) Is there some other problem that exceeding this size causes? Also, note that adding a comment to any section, or adding a new section, doesn't require editing the entire page, and thus shouldn't trigger that warning.
