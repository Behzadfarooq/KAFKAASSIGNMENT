<p>Different arbitrary POV tags persistently added by two users, promoting Russian POV.

<p>Some time ago, a user created several hundred pages about a day (e.g. Dec 16 2005, as opposed to our regular articles like <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">November 1</a>). These articles are redundant and ultimately unmaintainable, so it was suggested that they be deleted. Rather than creating several hundred noms, <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFram_1537.html" title="User talk:Fram">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fram_664d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fram">contribs</a>) created a single nom listing a handful, as linked above.</p>
<p>Now the point is that the arguments, and most people who commented, support removal of these articles. But, several people have argued that this is out of process. The problem with this line of thought is, that no matter <i>how or where</i> you want to discuss potential removal of these articles, there will always be people arguing that it was out of process. If you do it on AFD, people suggest CENT. Do it on CENT, and they'll request the village pump. And the village pump will ask you to get your {{<a href="../../../s/h/r/Template%7EShrubbery_e450.html" title="Template:Shrubbery">shrubbery</a>}} at AFD.</p>
<p>So I propose we look at the arguments rather than at whether or not it conforms to Da Rulez, close the AFD and remove these poorly thought-out articles. Thoughts please? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:12, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Damn, we've had this transclusion debate before with WikiProject Cricket. I'm sure there's a policy somewhere that says we don't transclude in the article name space. My initial thoughts are that we cut out the forum shopping, but maybe run this one over for another week making that point clear and hope to develop a strong consensus. I'll try and find all the cricket discussion, it's about 18 months ago, I remember archiving it all together. That was one that spilled out onto the pump and cent as well, from what I remember. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:25, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Analysis suggests that a redirect isn't necessary because there are little or no incoming links, and a merge isn't necessary because nearly all the relevant information is already in the more general articles like <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">July 2</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:41, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmmm, I've had a look at a couple and seen incoming links, maybe ten an article. Protected redirects might stop future occurrences. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:56, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>These pages are probably in the main namespace because <a href="../../../c/u/r/Portal%7ECurrent_events_bb60.html" title="Portal:Current events">Portal:Current events</a> used to be in the main namespace. Several of them are still transcluded on other pages. I have suggested to move them all to subpages of <a href="../../../c/u/r/Portal%7ECurrent_events_bb60.html" title="Portal:Current events">Portal:Current events</a>, as they might be archives of that page. Individual month pages like <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2005.html" title="December 2005">December 2005</a> (a page consisting mostly of transclusions of articles included in the AFD) could also be moved out of article space. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 14:47, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>This might be the best suggestion. They do seem to be part of the current events format as was, and they get pushed out of the article space where they clearly don't belong. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:56, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>yeah, they are a part of the current events portal, see <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2007.html" title="January 2007">January 2007</a>, that's made up of transcluded pages from the portal namespace. I'm leaning towards closing as moving to portal namespace on that basis. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 15:01, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>This does seem like the best solution, and is unlikely to be controversial or require further discussion since it matched the current practice. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 03:40, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yay. Proto has now closed the debate, stating that there is consensus to delete them, but we must nevertheless tag every single article and discuss it further in some other forum (which will undoubtedly also reject it as "out of process"). I find this a rather bureaucratic approach, and it will likely not be productive. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 15:15, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As stated on my talk page, someone will see a page is deleted they didn't know about, take all 1400 pages to DRV, and enough people would ask for them to be restored based on them not having been AFD tagged for them to be restored (as DRV is based on headcounting, inexplicably). If you want them to go through AFD, then tag them for AFD and do it properly. If you didn't want them to be AFD'd properly, why bring the articles to AFD? If you want them moved to the portal namespace, be bold and just move them instead of complaining about bureaucracy. I won't mind. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 16:23, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I just wanted to say that since I started this thing (the AfD, not the articles), I'm willing to take every step deemed necessary, be it starting a <a href="../../../c/e/n/WP%7ECENT_a4cb.html" title="WP:CENT">WP:CENT</a> discussion, posting on the Village Pump, or starting a new AfD with <i>all</i> (some 1,400) pages tagged: I'm also prepared to merge all articles into the month articles if that is the preferred solution, and to change all links to these pages (coming from article pages, not from user pages or talk pages) to better links (splitting in two parts usually). If any of these needs to be done, please drop me a note, and please also be patient since it is quite a big task obviously. I'm of course unable to do any of the needed admin tasks, be it deleting pages or merging histories. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:17, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>As mentioned above, one thing you could do right now that probably wouldn't be controversial is to just move datedatedate to Portal:Current events/datedatedate.

<li>But that would create cross-namespace redirects which would need to be deleted: further we would still need to decide what to do with all the redlinks this creates (in some cases correcting (i.e. dividing) the links, in some cases moving the parent pages (month/year) to the portal namespace as well. The latter would then necessitate the correction of several hundred redlinks per monthpage (e.g. <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2005.html" title="December 2005">December 2005</a> has approx. 600 incoming links). All this may be what eventually needs to be done, but I'ld like this to be quite certain and agreed upon before I embark on such a move / delete / correct party (which I'm still willing to do!). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:37, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm talking about images that are tagged as having no fair use rationale, no source, no copyright tag, etc. that are tagged for a week and deleted, then re-uploaded without satisfying the conditions required for keeping. An example I found is <a href="../../../d/a/b/Image%7EDabf162.jpg_37ac.html" title="Image:Dabf162.jpg">Image:Dabf162.jpg</a>, which was recently deleted as being tagged without a fair use rationale for over a week and then re-uploaded (by a different user), under the same name as the original, still without a fair use rationale. This would technically not be speedyable from my understanding since recreation of deleted content is only speedyable after an XfD, which images that are deleted via this process do not go through. On the other hand, if we allowed this it would be a loophole people could exploit to repeatedly upload an image and not have it deleted for a week. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 11:22, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, but for what? I haven't done all the work necessary to find out, but if the earlier blocks were as poorly justified as this one, I'd say that they were also unjustified.

<dd>Ahh this is here too. Just for the record, the block was for the compounded reasons that the user was fully warned(warning which were removed), had been blocked for the same thing in the past couple months 3 times, the several example of incivility were all from the last few days, and the fact that the user was uncivil right after being warned, while I was reviewing is contribs. Is 4 days really such a long block? It seems minor considering the week long block the user received in December for the same thing. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 17:21, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>Removing warnings from a User's Talk page is not a blockable offence.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter how many times someone has been blocked for an offence; even if the earlier blocks were justified, the new block has to be too. The definition of incivilty doesn't get weaker just because someone has been uncivil before.</li>
<li>Given that the comments are so mild, barely uncivil at all, the fact that they were made right after a civility warning is irrelevant. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 17:25, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>Per point 1, I agree, however it does reveal if the person was knowledgable of the policy. Per point 2, I disagree, a user being block for the same thing over and over is a clear indication of unwillingness to follow policy Per point 3, I disagree again, continued incivility past warnings is a blockable offense. You seem to be of the opinion that someone can be just a little bit uncivil as long as they want, I do think the amount of incivility plays a part.</p>
<p>My point is that a user that is ignoring warnings and continuing to violate policy needs to be blocked. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 17:28, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>With all due respect it's plAIN and simple!!! 1/0 is the point on the number circle directly across from 0 and where + and - infinity meet. I'm absolutely positively negatively sure of it for crying ot loud!!! Now if you think I had to do original research to figure that out then you have got to be kidding me. Do you think it's difficult or something? It's all spelled out for you in the incompleteness theorem and the real projective line (and the axiom of choice, etc. etc. etc.). It's nothing new, it's just that people are so pessimistic they don't care or they think it's bogus. But what are they afraid of???</p>

<p><a href="../../../o/d/e/User%7EOden_515b.html" title="User:Oden">User:Oden</a> is doing useful and unthankful job of enforcing our increasingly more strict policies of the fair use image by patrolling old images. It is a delicate task there it is critical to explain users that how their images that were celebrated catch just a few months ago now are considered shameful policy violations. Obviously, the users should receive all the explanations over the policy changes, be encouraged to find the free equivalents of the fair use, there should be an honest dialog over their reasons while the free images are unsuitable for the articles. The most important the users should not feel that tagging of their images is a sort of a personal harassment or a vendetta. I am not sure Oden is doing a right thing in this respect. He has chosen to patrol the fair use images based on the uploader. Often he has a disagreement with a user, then "review" all his her image over years. As a result the uploader feels harassed and persecuted even if Oden's claims are valid. From the point of view of stimulating the search for free images mass tagging of images by a single uploader are counterproductive: if tagging one..two images per week stimulate users to find free substitutes or releasing the images under free copyright licenses, mass tagging just lead to apathy.</p>

I wish to apply <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> but it is difficult not to see the usage of copyright issues as a weapon in a personal conflict, the thing a few admins including me specifically asked Oden not to do. Very similar methods are used by Oden in his personal conflict with Irpen. Irpen is not a problem user out of hundreds of the images he uploaded only a couple were found wrong but he does not take the stalking lightly. I specifically asked Oden to leave irpen's upload log along. Still after all these warnings Oden is still bragging about searching this log <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlex_Bakharev&amp;diff=99783806&amp;oldid=99685766" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlex_Bakharev&amp;diff=99783806&amp;oldid=99685766" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>.</p>
<p>Guys, Oden is a very hardworking user and I do not want to block him, but the warnings do not have any effects so far.

<dd>Following a trail of contributions to find more violations is not stalking, in my opinion. Again, IMO, it is pure and simple that Oden is not in the wrong here; generally, people who breach WP:FU once do it again,and so looking back through a user's log is beneficial to the encyclopaedia. It seems, well, silly that you would consider blocking someone for it. Jimbo Wales and WMF take a dim view on bad FU images, and so should we - it doesn't matter how you find them.

<dd><b>Comment.</b>As I've said before, Oden is one of the relatively moderate folks in the anti fair-use group. But it does seem more than a bit disruptive to specifically target the uploads of individual editors as he appears to be doing. Daniel: Jimbo's opinion on the matter is just another opinion. Jimbo himself has said that trying to support something with "Jimbo said" isn't a fair argument. The argument here isn't about bad fair use images but in how people are going about tagging them, and Machiavellian tactics aren't going to help promote goodwill and community in Wikipedia. It's rude and disruptive. Proto: By this logic, then if the police go and beat someone with truncheons and haul him off to jail, that automatically makes him guilty of crimes. It's not proper in a modern society to assume that if someone is punished, it automatically means that person was guilty. And regardless of whether an editor has uploaded fair use images, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> asks that we assume good faith, which you're not advocating. As has been mentioned many times and subsequently pooh-poohed by folks who want to implement RfU, a category page with an automatic list of all fair use images should be created and then whoever wants to go throug them can do so one by one. This would eliminate this semi-wikistalking thing, and if nothing else, would give the RfU taggers an out when someone complains about their image being tagged. Instead, folks seem to insist on doing it the hard way, making people angry, making them feel stalked and persecuted, causing disruption and seriously affecting efficiency and community. I don't know why this is, but it's very backward. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheQuandry_2564.html" title="User:TheQuandry">TheQuandry</a> 16:41, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you consider uploading fair use images after they have been removed and deleted because of breach of fair use to be vandalism, then there is no problem with his actions. When you find someone adding inappropriate external links to articles in your watchlist you usually check the user's contributions to see what else he has been doing. While I do not like "revenges" (in example, removing images because the editor who uploaded them has a conflict with you), if the images are correctly removed according to existing policy and the contributor reinserts them, he is also disrupting Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 17:47, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Until then, Jimbo has only shared his viewpoint and Jimbo himself has said many many times that it's not proper to invoke him like that. And as of this moment, neither Jimbo nor WMF have made a Foundation edict. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheQuandry_2564.html" title="User:TheQuandry">TheQuandry</a> 17:17, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's possible to stalk by making edits that would be perfectly reasonable under other circumstances, but which are being used to target and punish certain users. I'm not making any claims about this case, but just pointing out that if, for example, I were to be in conflict with <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a>, and then trawled through his edits, correcting all his typing errors, placing (perfectly justified) wikify, cleanup, etc., templates on articles he'd created, and so on, I'd be behaving badly. My edits would be being made, not with the intention of improving Wikipedia, though they might do that, but with the primary purpose of harrassing <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a>. This has been (rightly in my view) condemned as wikistalking in the past. It's not always easy to distinguish from the perfectly proper business of following up a problem user's edits to tidy up after her — though when it follows immediately upon an attack in either direction, it's hard to give the benefit of the doubt.</li>
<li>As I said, I have no real view about oden with regard to the stalking charge — but he <i>has</i> often carried out his purge of fair-use images insensitively and out of process, removing images from articles with vague edit summaries, and no previous warning message about the replacement of such images with properly licensed replacements, etc. He seems to have started taking his job personally, and that usually leads to problems. I don't think that he should be blocked or anything like that, but he does need to be talked to, and persuaded to slow down and behave towards other editors with proper consideration, and within Wikipdia policies. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 23:49, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>Oden's actions are definitively not stalking as per the letter or spirit of that policy. If a contributor doesn't understand image policy, it's likely that they've uploaded other images incorrectly and thus reasonable to go through their contribution history and take the appropriate action. Image tagging is quite thankless work, yet essential to the project both legally and in the spirit of a <i>free</i> encyclopedia. Alex, I would suggest that you focus your efforts on helping affected users understand the image policies rather than disparaging Oden, who has done nothing wrong, imho. It's neither rude nor disruptive to correct users who violate Wikipedia's image policies. If they upload 100 images incorrectly, then all of them should be dealt with in as polite a manner as possible. Oden should use appropriate edit summaries and <i>notify</i> users, but he doesn't necessarily have to "slow down" (i.e. only tag one inappropriate image per user per day). <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 05:44, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that you either ignored or dismissed what I said about stalking. Also, why do you think that "slow down" means only tagging one image a day? The point is that his lack of courtesy and proper explanation of his actions is probably the result of trying to do too much; if he slowed down, he'd have time to do things in a way that didn't put people's backs up.</dd>
<dd>In response to what was said in response to a previous discussion of this, I probably am a little out of date concerning the hysteria with which this issue is treated in Wikipedia now. Perhaps the hysteria is justified by the U.S. obsession with litigation, I don't know.* Still, the idea that, for example, an image that depicts the subject of an article is inappropriate for an encyclopædia, being "merely decorative", is so at odds with every encyclopædia that I've ever seen that I wonder if those involved have lost sight of what we're supposed to be doing, at least in their <i>explanations</i> of their actions.

<dd>I think the discussion here may have turned away from the topic at some point: we're not debating the right or wrong of RfU, we're questioning the behavior of an editor who, to my eyes, is pretty clearly using this RfU issue as a way to get back at perceived enemies. According to comments towards the top, if someone has uploaded one or two fair use images that can be replaced, they probably have uploaded more. Out of hundreds of images uploaded by Irpen, Oden found a whopping TWO that were questionable enough for him to tag.</dd>
<dd>I STRONGLY disagree with <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> telling Alex <i>I would suggest that you focus your efforts on helping affected users understand the image policies rather than disparaging Oden...</i> This is a misguided and out-of-touch argument. Just because you think Oden's results are in line with RfU, it justifies wikistalking, Alex should shut up and we should happily allow good editors with multitudes of mainspace contributions to be subject to retribution when they criticise someone's political motives? This whole thing is completely ridiculous. Apparently, the folks doing the "thankless job of tagging images" are incapable of doing wrong. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheQuandry_2564.html" title="User:TheQuandry">TheQuandry</a> 08:41, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have blocked Oden for 48 h after the new incidence of stalking. He was blocked by <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">User:Cburnett</a> for the 3RR violation. I have unblocked Oden, since he promised not to edit war. In minutes after my unblocking Oden started "examining upload logs" of CBurnett (see <a href="../../../c/b/u/User_talk%7ECburnett_2510.html#Lists_of_episodes" title="User talk:Cburnett">User_talk:Cburnett#Lists_of_episodes</a>) and started a lot of other activities harrassing CBurnett (just see the last seven sections of CBurnett's talk page). This is an exact definition of <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a>. Since Oden was warned by a number of admins (see my starting message) and since this sort of behavior was already discussed on a number of fora (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive153#Personal_attacks.2C_harassment.2C_baiting_and_pestering_by_user:Oden" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive153#Personal_attacks.2C_harassment.2C_baiting_and_pestering_by_user:Oden" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive154#Tag_vandalism_by_User:Irpen" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive154#Tag_vandalism_by_User:Irpen" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive156#User:Oden.27s_threats" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive156#User:Oden.27s_threats" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> something should be done. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">Alex Bakharev</a> 22:18, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. I wasn't aware that Oden has such a history of basically the same set of actions, but I think he took it too far with me.

<dd>I think the behavior has been overlooked and defended because Oden is seen as "implementing an unpopular and thankless task". Whether or not you agree with the implementation of RfU as per Oden and others, we must not ignore other problems or misbehaviors by someone just because they're seen as implementing an unpopular policy. Hopefully, Oden will take some time to reflect on this and implement RfU in a more evenhanded manner. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheQuandry_2564.html" title="User:TheQuandry">TheQuandry</a> 03:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

He has since moved said material to free hosting and has linked to it from his user page. Inclusive of this is a list of Wikipedians who he believes are Masons (self-identified or not), and a whole lot of disinformation and propaganda (which, he lists as "BANNED ON WIKIPEDIA" as if it were a personal issue rather than a policy violation on his part). I would also imagine that the other subpages he had here, which were also full of the same, have also been moved.

That's too bad. I didn't realize that quotes about Freemasonry by the likes of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Pike_b090.html" title="Albert Pike">Albert Pike</a>, <i>The London Daily Telegraph</i>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Salza_e498.html" title="John Salza">John Salza</a>; a list of religions that find masonry opposed to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>; and a list of Wikipedia Freemasons who all identify themselves as such and who even list themselves under a Freemasonry category would cause so much angst for you and yours. The page no longer exists on Wikipedia so your problem should be over. You believe that you are teaching me a lesson, I guess because you feel that you are so superior to me. Actually, you have taught me a lesson. Some Freemasons are <i><b>very afraid</b></i> of exposure!

<dd>I don't know how much you know about the whole issue. But as far as my page on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> went I had some collected notes on freemasonry. Some were quotes and some was info on what sects declared it incompatible with Christianity. I was hoping that some of this material would be allowed some inclusion in some of the various articles concerning freemasonry. However, I discovered soon enough that several editors of these articles were determined not to allow this information into the articles and would remove it. So I left it on my page. After noticing that these editors seemed to be defending freemasonry and trying to put it in a good light I started to see exactly wo they were and discovered that most of them claimed to be masons themselves. Now everything I learned about masonry says that they will not reveal what they profess and do within their temples. Further members are said to swear that tey will lie to protect the craft. This would seem to explain why any negative info that gets into an article is down played or refuted within the article. This explains why they won't allow links to webpages that were created by former members who tell what freemasonry is actually about. They try to discredit people and remove info they don't like even on te userpages. If they are deliberately shhaping articles to down play any negative info and to put their organization into a good light, then this is very apropos to my questions. They successfully removed my page which pointed out that members are sworn to lie to defend the organization. Did you know that members of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland_Yard_5bca.html" title="Scotland Yard">Scotland Yard</a> are not allowed to be Freemasons? This is because they are suppose to do the things I just outlined and are therefore not trustworthy. Apparently, Wikipedia admins don't care whether the information in these articles are accurate. Because I was reluctant to remove my Freemasonry page, my userpage was attacked by vandals like this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Dwain&amp;oldid=93274334" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Dwain&amp;oldid=93274334" rel="nofollow">LOOK HERE!</a> Whenever I wrote to and admin asking for guidence Ms Japan would follow and leave messages. These articles do not reflect reality, but reflect Mason propaganda. I think it is improtant to note this. They think it is important to prevent this info from coming out! Why? I don't stop people critizing my edits, or the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> or Bishops. But they will not allow me to bring up that Masons swear to lie and that the lower level masons are lied to as to what their symbols actually mean, so even if they break their oaths they might not be putting down accurate info. This is why even with all the harrassment from Ms Japan and the anons who have been vandalizing my pages is not going to stop me from getting the word out. In fact, it is making me more determined than ever. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwain_ef57.html" title="User:Dwain">Dwain</a> 20:26, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dwain can believe whatever he wants, but the arguments have been disproven in numerous sources, even those written by non-Masons. It is the obvious desire to push that POV on others and disseminate incorrect information (with other people's names on it) that concerns me. To say that whatever a Mason (or anyone in any group, for that matter) says about his or her own group is obviously a lie or propaganda because someone else doesn't believe it is a tautology. However, as Dwain isn't open to discussion on the matter, things end up here. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 00:39, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You have been caught lying twice now Ms Japan!

These are both false statements. For discussion and dialogue was forth coming from me here: <a href="../../../m/s/j/User_talk%7EMSJapan_0c77.html#Your_userpage" title="User talk:MSJapan">User_talk:MSJapan#Your_userpage</a> on November 7, 2006. <i>Both are lies!</i> And you wonder why I would question your edits? I tried to placate the numerous anonymous users as well as Ms Japan by editing things out of my note page on freemasonry but that wasn't enough. I moved my page off Wikipedia and still he's obviously afraid, hence this listing. It's funny that Ms Japan should fear the words of Albert Pike and John Salza both having been masons!!! <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwain_ef57.html" title="User:Dwain">Dwain</a> 03:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suggested once somewhere that RfC could benefit from having a group of neutral coordinators or clerks who could monitor ongoing RfCs, keep them civil, close them at some appropriate time (perhaps after a week without edits, or some other similar time period), and perhaps produce a summary of the comments made that could serve as a "result" of sorts for all parties involved to make use of. The way I see that, it wouldn't be an arbitration or a trial, but a sharing of thoughts that could benefit from someone helping to keep it tidy. Right now, as it's been indicated, it's a bit of a battle royal.

<p>Hello! The IP address 24.147.72.135 has been warned numerous times by several people. Yet, they continue to vandalize articles by adding speculation or rumors to those articles. Everyone has become extremely frustrated regarding this person because this IP address has not been blocked. Several people, including me, have used the correct procedures and policies. Yet, nothing is being done to stop this person from vandalizing articles. I am a senior trainer at SeaWorld Orlando and I am ensuring that the articles regarding SeaWorld remain accurate. It is rather difficult when you have an individual constantly adding speculations or personal thoughts not backed by reliable sources. Something needs to be done because this is rather annoying and taking up too much of my time. I reported this individual on WP: AIV and they suggested that I post this user on WP: ANI instead. Can you or anyone else help me with this particular situation? Thanks! SWF Senior Trainer 16:11, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a minor problem over at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>: an editor nominated an article for AfD last night... or rather, tried to. Apparently they were unclear on how to proceed, and instead of using the normal (and admittedly somewhat complex) method for doing so they simply tacked it onto the end of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2007_January_14_c0ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2007 January 14">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2007_January_14</a>. I pointed out that this was not the way to do an AfD and the user attempted to do it the right way, but apparently modifying the "log" page has created <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Vasile_Lu%C5%A3ac_a4b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Vasile Luţac">a badly formed AfD sub-article anyway</a>. (Which I've tried to at least make functional) The contested article itself has the proper template, so at the very least the notification to editors is working fine, but I'm not sure what kind of mess this might cause for the AfD side. I think an admin, ideally one with serious experience with the behind-the-scenes workings of AfD, should take a look at this and make sure AfD isn't going to explode when this is closed. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai">ramble</a></sub> <small>argue</small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai">check</a></sup>) 18:48, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Administrators, I have a current problem with a wikipedian named John Reaves. We got into a disagreement today over the kidnapping of Shawn Hornbeck then went to my talk page. After discussions and his "warnings", I expressed to him the desire that he does not contact me any more on my page. He continues to come back and respond, after warnings from myself on this matter. He even challenged me to report him. I want nothing to do with this person, and do not have a high regard to him after reading of some of his past encounters with other editors. Please see that this person no longer has any contact with me, as I now consider his behavior as harassment. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerusso_d23d.html" title="User:Kerusso"><strong><font color="red">Kerusso</font></strong></a> 03:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Doesn't look like <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reaves_5821.html" title="User:John Reaves">John Reaves</a> has Wikistalked or harassed. It would have been better to have used a boilerplate template for the talk page warning because the wording was pretty vague. Better still, a few polite words asking <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerusso_d23d.html" title="User:Kerusso">Kerusso</a> to be more civil might have been all that was needed. To Kerusso, any editor can post a warning to another editor's talk page. I consider this a level 1 caution - which is supposed to be a polite tap on the shoulder. Not much to worry about.

<p>I already brought this up without opposition at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ECategorization_31e1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Categorization">Wikipedia Talk:Categorization</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New users seem to have the idea that you add pages to categories by editing the category page itself. Could we add something to the boilerplate for editing Category pages, so it tells them not to edit in an article, but to add the category wiki-text to the given article? This would save me and many others a good deal of time in reverting mistaken edits to categories, and would therefore allow us to focus further on articles.</p>

<dd>I occasionally entertain myself by culling the pages that begin with symbols (which are usually garbage), either deleting, redirecting or moving them. I tend to lose faith in humanity by the time I've gotto the start of the '0's, but that first part is pretty well patrolled. Personally, I would allow unwatchedpages to be seen by everyone, as 90% of vandal fighting is done via recent changes, anyway, and the benefits of getting some of these cleared up (a lot of the unwatched pages are also garbage) would outweight the risks of letting people know which pages aren't watchlisted. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 13:22, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I did notice he said he added a paragraph "filled with links to the company's website", in other words, the edits he made were sourced and (presumably) verifiable. He also advocates discussion on talk pages when challenged, which is also good. The only troubling thing I saw was persistent use of the definite article with the name "Wikipedia".

<p>I'm not sure what to make of this whole situation. If it weren't for Carolyn's edit I'd contact Jossi and probably start drafting an arbitration request. Comments and suggestions are welcome. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge</a></i></sup></font> 19:34, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Whoa whoa whoa, straight to arbitration would be skipping a few steps. Has anyone tried mediation? Or maybe an RFC? --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 19:38, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is not so much content disagreements at the moment (I've found the long-time editors on this page intelligent and very willing to compromise), but the actions of a notorious banned user. I'm not going to speculate anymore on the alleged actions of this user (at least until the Wikimedia people clear some things up), but all the bizarre details are at the article's talk page.

<dd>I'd welcome your input Durova. Jossi was doing a GREAT job mediating until a notorious sockpuppeteer (now banned) started creating numerous sock puppet accounts to sway consensus and 'vote'. Although this user is banned, he is still affecting the article, and I believe he even might have contacted the foundation impersonating someone else and asking a Wiki employee to edit the article. Most unseemly. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">Fairness And Accuracy For All</a> 22:38, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Bear in mind that, although your accusation may be meritorious, frivolous charges of that sort far outnumber real ones.

<li>I've uncommented out the section, re-written it since it was copyvio in the form of a long quote easily summarised,added details to the bare html reference, and noted on the talk page that I've done so. I stress this here again: Verification is not negotiable. In teh absence of <i>either</i> a real source saying Walker didn't write the piece <i>or</i> some real indication that this was "official" then the citation must stand. It is worth noting that the Walker part of the article is only very small, and the came citation could easily be used without mentioning the guy. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> 00:16, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Endorse. Clearly has abused Wikipedia. Edit history on the latest article (before it was deleted) showed that when anyone else tried to edit the article, he immediately reverted or added a bunch of "yes, but..." text.

Michael Snow removed Primetime's copyvios from these articles on 18 May 2006, so I just browsed the diffs since then and nothing glaring popped up. Lmbjk and OK1900 contributed heavily to articles on Latin-American subjects, they could be the same person but I don't think it is Primetime based on the concentration of their editing. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go cash Guy's paycheck. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 18:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive71_ce28.html" title="Edit section: Johann Hari's entry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Johann Hari's entry</span></h2>
<p>I have tried for over three months to reach consensus on the entry for British journalist <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Hari_63ab.html" title="Johann Hari">Johann Hari</a> with a wiki user called ‘Felix-Felix’. I'm pretty concerned at the attitude and approach of Felix-Felix and I'd appreciate some advice.</p>
<p>Hari is a fairly well known young liberal journalist who writes a column for the Independent and has written for the New York Times, Le Monde and others. Felix-Felix appears to be motivated by extreme hostility to Hari, who he has described as “a little tyke”, a supporter of “genocide”, and in favour of "the destruction of untermenschen." He described the original wiki entry for Hari – which included accusations that he was soft on paedophiles, Islamophobic, anti-Semitic, “fat”, “a Stalinist”, and “naïve” – as “a love letter”, which gives you some sense of how low his opinion of Hari is.</p>
<p>I'm afraid this user has repeatedly tried to insert false and libellous arguments into the article. To give just one example, he has tried to claim that Hari – a left-wing writer from a working class family – went to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrow_School_01a8.html" title="Harrow School">Harrow School</a>, one of the most expensive and elite public schools in Britain. Even when it was pointed out to him that this was wholly false (Hari went to a nearby school!), Felix-Felix kept trying to insert this claim.</p>
<p>He also admits to inserting meaningless sentences into the article, "out of frustration".</p>
<p>Felix-Felix has a strange perception that Hari is some kind of right-winger, and has attempted to delete from the entry the copious evidence that contradicts this claim. For example, Hari supports total nuclear disarmament by the US, Britain and all other nuclear states, and is a vociferous campaigner on the question of global warming. Felix has tried repeatedly to delete these facts, on the grounds that these positions are “uncontroversial”. I pointed out that far from being “uncontroversial”, the idea of total <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_disarmament.html" title="Nuclear disarmament">nuclear disarmament</a> is widely regarded as a radical position and is supported by, for example, just 6 of 651 British MPs, and no US Congressmen at all. He refused to accept this and just kept deleting it, even when the polls he himself cited showed that almost half of Americans oppose disarmament.</p>
<p>He is presently trying to delete all the major criticisms of Hari in the entry from prominent right-wingers (presumably because they contradict his view that Hari is himself a right-winger). He has dismissed criticisms by <a href="../../../b/j/o/Bjorn_Lomborg_724d.html" title="Bjorn Lomborg">Bjorn Lomborg</a>, who was named as the twelfth most important intellectual in the world by Prospect magazine, and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Starkey_ce40.html" title="David Starkey">David Starkey</a>, who was later named as one of the 100 most important intellectuals in Britain by Prospect. He claims these figures are “spurious” and “unimportant”. However, he believes that a minor blog-based group called <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medialens.html" title="Medialens">Medialens</a>, who he happens to agree with, should be quoted at great length (without quoting Hari’s response).</p>
<p>I believe in quoting a range of critics from across the political spectrum (and as it happens I personally agree with the Medialens criticism of Hari). So I repeatedly offered Felix-Felix a compromise: we should quote Medialens at length, provided we quote other critics at length and quote Hari’s responses. He has consistently refused to do this. He insists that we quote the critics he agrees with, and almost none of the others, no matter how eminent, and give only a single sentence of Hari’s response. This seems to clearly contradict the rules on POV.</p>
<p>I am concerned that Felix does not even seem to have read Hari’s work, and offers summaries of it that directly contradict what Hari actually says. For example, Hari wrote several articles claiming he was wrong to have supported the Iraq war. He wrote:</p>
<p>“The lamest defence I could offer – one used by many supporters of the war as they slam into reverse gear – is that I still support the principle of invasion, it’s just the Bush administration screwed it up. But as one anti-war friend snapped at me when I mooted this argument, “Yeah, who would ever have thought that supporting George Bush in the illegal invasion of an Arab country would go wrong?” She’s right: the truth is that there was no pure Platonic ideal of The Perfect Invasion to support, no abstract idea we lent our names to. There was only Bush, with his cluster bombs, depleted uranium, IMF-ed up economic model, bogus rationale and unmistakable stench of petrol, offering his war, his way. (Expecting Tony Blair to use his influence was, it is now clear, a delusion, as he refuses to even frontally condemn the American torture camp at Guantanomo Bay).</p>
<p>The evidence should have been clear to me all along: the Bush administration would produce disaster. Let’s look at the major mistakes-cum-crimes. Who would have thought they would unleash widespread torture, with over 10,000 people disappearing without trial into Iraq’s secret prisons? Anybody who followed the record of the very same people – from Rumsfeld to Negroponte – in Central America in the 1980s. Who would have thought they would use chemical weapons? Anybody who looked up Bush’s stance on chemical weapons treaties (he uses them for toilet paper) or checked Rumsfeld’s record of flogging them to tyrants. Who would have thought they would impose shock therapy mass privatisation on the Iraqi economy, sending unemployment soaring to 60 percent – a guarantee of ethnic strife? Anybody who followed the record of the US towards Russia, Argentina, and East Asia. Who could have known that they would cancel all reconstruction funds, when electricity and water supplies are still below even Saddam’s standards? Anybody who looked at their domestic policies.”</p>
<p>Yet Felix-Felix tried to summarise this statement as “half hearted-apologising for Bush mucking up an invasion which he would have supported if it had been done better.”</p>
<p>Felix-Felix’s summaries of Hari’s arguments are consistently so far from what hari has actually said I can only assume he hasn’t read them, or is deliberately misrepresenting them.</p>
<p>It is hard to achieve agreement because, as looking through the archive will show, Felix simply denies facts which do not match his world-view. For example, Hari is a consistent defender of the Enlightenment tradition, and was nominated alongside Salman Rushdie and Ayaan Hirsi Ali by the National Secular Society as one of the best defenders of the Enlightenment in Britain in 2006. Felix-Felix, however, declared that Hari was not a defender of the Enlightenment and this was simply an attempt to big up a “trivial op-ed writer”. I tried to answer him by offering evidence which included Hari’s attacks on postmodernism, which prompted Felix to deny postmodernism opposed the Enlightenment. Even when I pointed out that the wikipedia entry on postmodernism included in its first paragraph that fact that postmodernism opposes the Enlightenment, he insisted it did not.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I have been keen to try to achieve consensus on the page with Felix in any way I can. In the archive, you can see over six instances in which I say, “I’ll compromise on this, what will you compromise on?” and receive no answer.</p>
<p>Some posters on the page have occasionally agreed with Felix, and some have agreed with me. I have compromised and engaged with those who agree with specific points by Felix. However, Felix by contrast has simply accused anybody who posts in agreement with me of being a sock-puppet and ignored them. (Indeed, he ignored me for a long time, claiming I was Johann Hari, until somebody who we both know pointed out that I am not). Several of the posters have become so exasperated with this that they have taken the unusual step of offering their telephone numbers so Felix can verify their identities – but still he continues to accuse them of being me. He has started attacking other people who post, and following them to their wikipedia entries and negatively editing them (see <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Badham_f3ba.html" title="Van Badham">Van Badham</a>).</p>
<p>He has also persistently ignored the wikipedia administrators who have intervened. For example, the archive shows Charles Matthews, an administrator, clearly telling him to “stop deleting well-sourced material for the sake of it”, and Felix proceeding anyway.</p>
<p>Last week I discovered that Felix-Felix is a defender of the notorious anti-Semite <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilad_Atzmon_eb06.html" title="Gilad Atzmon">Gilad Atzmon</a>, and denies it is anti-Semitic to write this: "We must begin to take the accusation that the Jewish people are trying to control the world very seriously...American Jewry makes any debate on whether the 'Protocols of the elder of Zion' are an authentic document or rather a forgery irrelevant. American Jews (in fact Zionists) do control the world." He has also written articles describing Israeli strategy called "The Protocols of the Edlers of Zion (part Two)".</p>
<p>It's pretty worrying; does anyone have any advice about what I can do to stop this guy trashing Johann Hari's entry? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by David r from meth productions (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_r_from_meth_productions_0fc1.html" title="User talk:David r from meth productions">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_r_from_meth_productions_670a.html" title="Special:Contributions/David r from meth productions">contribs</a>) 16:43, 17 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<li>David, it sounds like you have a good attitude towards this -- based on your description, you are trying to engage Felix on the specifics and (mostly) not personally. Have you offered to try the various stages of <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> with Felix, either with regard to your overall dispute or some specific issue?

<p>After seeing yet more of Cplots quite futile and "self-sacrificing" (ie - he's clearly doing nobody any good, including himself) reverted edits at VPP, and seeing it was the same account repeatedly, I went to his talk page. On seeing what at least appeared to be a little bit of gloating about "the admins" missing him this time around, I couldn't resist adding the following advice which I felt may be reasonable for him to note - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWalesOnTheEngangeredList&amp;diff=101365825&amp;oldid=101363439" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWalesOnTheEngangeredList&amp;diff=101365825&amp;oldid=101363439" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not generally one for incivility or any such thing, nor am I usually one for either failing to assume good faith or "feeding the trolls". I don't think I've done either, but I would appreciate it if somebody could just double check that I haven't said anything that's in any way inappropriate. As I say, I doubt it, but it's probably worth checking (for my own peace of mind if little else) that others see the message in the same way I intended it. I certainly hope that he see's the futility of it all (well, explaining the reality of it was worth a try! lol) <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsone_36a6.html" title="User:Crimsone">Crimsone</a> 17:45, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

What's interesting so far is that every hour it's run, it's had something to do (if the list didn't change, it wouldn't commit an edit). So the unblock stuff has a bit of a higher turnover rate than I would expect. I'll let this run for awhile, and we might get some good statistics out of it.

<dd>As for which have been reviewed, that is a bit harder to do.

<dd>Yeah, I'd say every 10 minutes would be a good balance between server load and lag time. I'm liking the CSd list too, but I'd prefer if they were listed chronologically instead of alphabetically. Can you set the thing not to include items already on the page, so that new ones are at the end and working down the list will be roughly chronological? <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 02:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorting chronologically is something entirely different than what I had in mind here. I could do it (might take a bit of work), but that would involve not only looking at the texts of all of the pages, but also their edit histories, to see when the template was added. That would involve downloading the texts of lots of revisions (sometimes many edits are made after the template is added). And pyWiki doesn't yet have code to parse out histories. <i>Or</i> I could have the bot run frequently, keep an internal state of which is on the list, and add all of the new items to the bottom.

<dd>The latter is what I was thinking. You don't need to run frequently either; just insert a horizontal bar or section break after each update and reload the old list to make sure you aren't adding dupes, then you have blocks based on which run they were added during.

<dd>I've never really looked at how many people are in the category/on the list at once. If it's 7, as it is now, I suppose it's no big deal for a reviewing admin to quickly skim each. If there are times when there are dozens of names on that list then adding the "already reviewed or not" functionality could be more helpful. As for sorting chronologically, we could ask the user making the request to fill in the time (of course that assumes the typical blocked user can speak UTC and would provide accurate information, which might be too much to ask). <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:00, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, a useful suggestion: if you add these two pages to your watchlist you don't have to keep track of the actual categories.

<li>It is obvious that Azer is not a vandal, so John's accusatory tone is inappropriate, as is his use of the "final warning" template.

<p>I have started removing images which I tag as copyright infringements or policy violations from the article pages. The reason for this is that our hard-working administrators sometimes forget to remove the images from the article pages before deleting them. Ever so often I encounter dead links to deleted images (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rakesh_Sharma&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100604865" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rakesh_Sharma&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100604865" rel="nofollow">diff</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greyhound_Lines&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100587995" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greyhound_Lines&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100587995" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). Leaving a red link for a month is not very pretty, and certainly must appear confusing for some of our readers. There is also the possibility that the deleted media will be uploaded again by a user following the red link.</p>

I will continue removing tagged images on sight, while still staying within <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> if the deletion is contested (except for egregious errors). --<a href="../../../o/d/e/User%7EOden_515b.html" title="User:Oden">Oden</a> 07:31, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

(1) What happened (that is something that KillerChihuahua can answer, or should have had the answers to before deleting) and (2) What the closing user stipulated should happen (that is something Azer Red could have discussed with the AfD closer before coming to WP:AN). Firstly, 'redirect', the term used by some of the&#160;!voters and the AfD closer is a vague term. 'Redirect' should be qualified by saying what happens to the content already at the page. ie. the two redirect options are <b>merge and redirect</b>, or <b>delete and redirect</b> (there is a third option of blank to a redirect, effectively keeping the content available in the page history, but not merging it). (1) If what was done was merge, then past revisions are indeed needed for GFDL attribution of the merged content. If no merging took place, then delete and recreation of the redirect (or blanking back to a redirect) is OK. Looking at the page history for <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll_%28Internet%29_ba24.html" title="Troll (Internet)">Troll (Internet)</a>, there is no edit summary for the dates concerned to suggest that any content was merged. KillerChihuahua might like to double-check that there was no mergeable content in the page that was deleted, instead of presuming that this was done (I find it is always dangerous to presume someone else has done something on Wikipedia). In all probability, there isn't any mergeable content, but those page revisions probably contain stuff that is no worse than stuff in the page history of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll_%28Internet%29_ba24.html" title="Troll (Internet)">Troll (Internet)</a>. (2) The AfD closer said 'redirect'. The question here is whether the analysis here should override any need to find out what the AfD closer really meant. Probably not, but I'll drop a note off on the talk page of the AfD closer. Finally, the talk page. I'll move it to the archives of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Talk%7ETroll_%28Internet%29_5ef4.html" title="Talk:Troll (Internet)">Talk:Troll (Internet)</a>, and link from the archive box on that talk page. Then someone can delete the redirect. I wonder if the AfD should be updated as well, to clarify what has actually happened? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 11:40, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Carcharoth is correct, I did not do the thorough due diligance I should have done (and usually do.) Lesson to me not to get lazy! I saw no merged content, but I could have missed it. I have added to Carcharoth's note on Yuser31415's page a specific query about any merged content. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 12:16, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hi. No, I did not merge any content, simply blanked and redirected. Was that against consensus? I think not. Also, it happened to be my purpose to leave it that way, instead of deleting all of the previous history to normal users. I'd appreciate if KillerChihuahua (is that spelt right? Template:Emot) undeleted it to my revision. Cheers. <i><a href="../../../y/u/s/User%7EYuser31415_e4ea.html" title="User:Yuser31415">Yuser31415</a></i> 19:48, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My concern is that the dreaded GNAA is linked from there, but if that is not seen as an issue, and if consensus is that the article should have been blanked and redirected rather than deleted and redirected, I will cheerfully do so. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 23:01, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are a few people who routinely remove <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">WP:SALTed</a> pages. This is fine, they are an eyesore and for the most part the original creator loses interest after a month or so. But some, like <a href="../../../p/i/o/Piotr_Blass_f131.html" title="Piotr Blass">Piotr Blass</a> above, get re-created every time the delete protected page is removed. And nobody seems to get notified when the protected pages are removed. Is there a list of formerly delete-protected pages anywhere, or if not can some botmeister create one? I look every now and then for bluelinks in my deletion log but with around 5,000 deletions on file that is a long job. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 18:09, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>People who deleted salted pages MUST take a good look at the history and work out what's going on first. Most can be deleted after a few weeks, but in some cases not. We've had slow-burning slanders re-inserted, and libellous redirects cropping up every few months.

<dd>I'm not a great one for raising artificial hurdles or excessive process. Most are not a problem, a few are a problem. If we can come up with a bot to list salted pages, and another bot to transfer them to an unsalted salted pages list when they are deleted again, then a few eyes down the list will be enough. HighInBC's idea has merit, or we could simply subst the template and recategorise them into a separate category for serial problem articles. Or put a comment in the list for those and ask Centrx and others to work from the list instead. Lots of ways to solve a minor but persistent problem. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It isn't process to ask people to look at the history of an item before deleting it, and to apply a little common sense. Indeed one should always do that before pressing the trigger. However, the ultimate solution to this has always been to nag the devs to allow us to protect actual deleted pages as deleted. Then they wouldn't show up in searches, and we could leave protection on them pretty well indefinitely, unless someone makes a good case for a real article. That would be a lot quicker and less process than your suggestion (which I could buy as a good interim fix, btw). It would also avoid silliness like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Undelete/Userbox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Undelete/Userbox" rel="nofollow">this</a> which was caused by people (with reason) insisting that we didn't have a long-term SALT, in the face of constant recreations (thankfully, a little creativity has now solved that particular problem).--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 22:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sure. I just don't think we need to formalise anything, is all. Many, probably most, are completely uncontroversial (although February is approaching). Of course if the logs show multiple deletions over many months, then deleting the salt is likely to invite trouble, that's not in dispute. I'm just trying to be fair, here, and emphasising that I do not imply any kind of censure of Centrx. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:05, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Without getting rid of them, there would be 10,000+ of these pages. As it stands, there are 1350. Hundreds of readers see them as results to <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">Special:Random</a>, and many inhibit the creation of legitimate articles. The vast majority are never re-created at all, and of those that are re-created some are created as legitimate articles or have been changed into redirects. It really does take hours to look at every log in the way you are suggesting—I used to do it, and I was the only one doing it. If other people want to help get rid of these pages, or to follow up on all the many pages they protected one day in May because one person was re-created some joke for 5 minutes, please do so. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 23:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Centrx, how likely is it that something would get salted if there seemed any good chance of a legitimate article following? And what's the cost/benefit between letting editors petition for desalting when necessary vs. relisting cruft for deletion and community banning the persistent cruftmasters? I guess you do what you do for good reason, but I'm not in your shoes and would like to understand the logic. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge</a></i></sup></font> 01:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A significant portion of SALTed pages are simply personal names, names which belong to several different people. That little Timmy created a vanity article about himself one day does not mean there is not a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Jones_1078.html" title="Tim Jones">Tim Jones</a> that can support an article, which is not going to be created if someone finds they have to go through a bizarre three-step process to create it; on Wikipedia, you do not need to "petition" to create an article. The second issue is that these are non-articles in the main namespace. They show up in <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">Special:Random</a>, so hundreds of average readers encounter them even when their number is kept to a minimum, they inflate <a href="../../../s/t/a/Special%7EStatistics_969e.html" title="Special:Statistics">Special:Statistics</a>, and they appear as A-OK blue links. They show up in <a href="../../../s/h/o/Special%7EShortpages_8301.html" title="Special:Shortpages">Special:Shortpages</a> where they need to be maintained in a special way or that special page becomes completely useless, so they probably affect other things as well. This has not been encountered as a big deal because the number of these pages has been kept low, but if thousands of active users and tens of thousands of average readers encountered these SALTed pages on a regular basis, and the article count was 10,000 higher than it should be, then 20,000, etc., the discussion here would not be "how could you delete those three pages that we had to re-protect again!" but "someone please delete these thousands of useless pages, by any means possible!" —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 02:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By default protection is harmful to the project. Salted pages included. In every case we need to weight the benefits of stopping recreation with the harm having it protected causes. We can't lose sight of that delicate balancing act. I think Centrx did the right thing for the right reasons and it is likely that only a few of the articles will end up being re-salted.</dd>
<dd>I think the best idea would be to create a new template... {{longtermsalt}} that must be substed and includes a timestamp and make the common practice only to un-salt those pages with a WP:DRV or after 6 months.

<dd>I hate to say it, but his former minibio looks almost as though he's refering to several notorious vandals, the first one is Antifinnugor[sic], the second the notorious Loyola dude, I don't know about orthodoxy, and the last is Bonaparte.

<dd>Oh come on... it's a fun thought in a somewhat eerie way, but let's be realistic. The guy has always be a brilliant contributor, and he's genuinely competent in his academic subjects.

<p>I have <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazrat_Ali_5e5f.html" title="Hazrat Ali">Hazrat Ali</a> on my watch list, because I did much of the work creating the article. There hasn't been much activity on it. Last night I saw someone had edited the article, and saw it had been scaled back to a stub.</p>
<p>Confusingly, when I checked the history, I learned that the article had just been created.</p>
<p>I contacted the administrator who deleted the original version, and the deletion was due to human error. A vandal blanked the page, an editor camed along and marked the blanked article for deletion because it was blank, without checking the history. And the administrator didn't notice the nominator's lapse.</p>
<p>The administrator copied the penultimate version of the original iteration to my User space, and I have merged it in to the current article. But they weren't able to merge the edit history from the previous instance with the current instance. My recollection is that this is possible. The administrator thought it was possible too. He just didn't know how to do it.</p>
<p>He suggested I ask here, for a friendly administrator to try to merge the edit histories. And I am following his advice.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, and after too!</p>

<dd>Beeing a bit too quick on the delete button I can understand, I am a bit more worried that he don't know how to undo it though. I know all the new buttons can be overwhealming for fresh admins, but I would sort of expect them to either, ask, "<a href="../../../r/t/f/RTFM_dd93.html" title="RTFM">RTFM</a>" or play around on a user subpage before they run off and start speedy deleting stuff (or at least try out the link that says "View or restore XX deleted edits?" when viewing a deleted page). No offense to this particular admin, but learning how the basic admin features work and how to undo them rely should be required learning for fresh admins.

<dd>Drive-by editors -- excellent way to put it. When I've cleared these, I've been fairly careful about it -- if somebody's only made 10 edits to their vanity bio, and <i>nowhere else</i>, and hasn't posted anything in months, it's fairly safe to say they're not coming back, no? Where people have been even minimally active, or anywhere inside at least a month or two, I usually play it safe (waiting or going for MfD, as appropriate).

<dd>Leaving aside the strong temptation to reply to the tendentious, and in some cases, patently false claims made by Randroide in his description of the situation, I would like to ask for some clarification. The contested changes imposed by Randroide were made after agreement had been reached to submit a mediation request, and in defiance of the disputed nature of the page. Also, the users (plural) who objected to these changes were not absent from the page when many of the changes were made – their objections were simply ignored. Is it not appropriate in these circumstances for these disputed changes to be reversed pending resolution of the dispute by mediation or arbitration? Is there any impediment in Wikipedia policies to this being done? What options are available to me to prevent further imposition of contested changes while the dispute resolution procedures are being exhausted? Southofwatford 09:19, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict)Ok, let me be more verbose. Enforcing the 3RR policy for a 2RR is legitimate if it is in the spirit of the policy. Using the word ban instead of block is more often a mis-choice of words than a lack of understanding about policy. And as for blocking someone to teach them a lesson, blocking is used for preventative reasons, not punitive, and blocking someone to teach them a lesson is a preventative from of block.

<p>First, a question. I have had two different administrators delete articles I was working, one of them doing so just a few minutes after I had created it. This surprised me. I thought administrators were only authorized to delete articles at the end of an {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}} discussion; five days after an uncontested {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}; or if someone had placed one of the speedy tags on it.</p>
<p>The administrator who deleted the article within minutes of my saving of the first draft, kept asserting that <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> was the policy document that authorized her to delete articles on sight.</p>
<p>The other administrator also assured me he was authorized to unilaterally delete articles. But he didn't cite which policy document authorized him to do so.</p>
<p>I spent a considerable time, going over all the many policy documents, procedure documents, and and guidelines that concern deletion, looking for the document that authorized administrators to unilaterally delete articles, without waiting for them to be tagged by another wikipedian. The closest I could find was a passage in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html#Speedy_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion process#Speedy deletion</a>. It doesn't say anything about checking that the tag the first wikipedian left was valid. And this could imply that authority.</p>
<p>So, is it really a standard, accepted practice for administrators to unilaterally delete articles, on sight, with no consultation or discussion?</p>
<ol>
<li>If it is, perhaps the policy documents could be amended to spell that out more clearly?</li>
<li>I've got to say that this seems to be very open to abuse.</li>
<li>Even if administrators are authorized to unilaterally delete any article, on sight, I'd like to suggest that they should still check the validity of the tag, if they are performing a deletion of an article because another wikipedian tagged it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I asked the seocnd administrator to move the article he deleted Jennifer Tharp, and its edit history, to <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_Guantanamo_Jennifer_Tharp_aea9.html" title="User:Geo Swan/Guantanamo/Jennifer Tharp">User:Geo Swan/Guantanamo/Jennifer Tharp</a>. He refused. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AManning_Bartlett&amp;diff=101699069&amp;oldid=101698447" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AManning_Bartlett&amp;diff=101699069&amp;oldid=101698447" rel="nofollow">Here is our exchange</a>.</p>
<p>I don't think asking for the article to be moved to my User space, so I can work on it, and see if I can turn it into an article that I feel confident would pass {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}} is an unreasonable request. Can I ask another administrator to move it to my User space? Thanks. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 03:42, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a common question, so clearly we need to work on making it more clear.
<ol>
<li>The first line of the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion page</a> says <i>The "Speedy deletion" policy governs limited cases where administrators may delete Wikipedia pages or media "on sight" without further debate.</i> The tags are intended only to bring the attention of an administrator, nothing more.</li>
<li>The first line of "Deletion process#Speedy deletion" is <i>Decide whether the page meets one or more of the criteria for speedy deletion.</i> It doesn't say anything about tags at all, please notice.</li>
<li>You're 100% correct, this means that administrators have wide (very wide) latitude here. The potential for abuse is proportional to the visibility of the articles, however.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I occasionally make a mass purge of various stub-classes, deleting as fast as I can push the button, and have never had a complaint... but ask someone else about the "biscuit wars" and understand that egregious mistakes (as determined by the community) are usually corrected in short order. Many eyes make light work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The general consensus is that the additional "paperwork" does not add increased "safety" in that for the (rare) times someone goes to far a squeaky wheel will laugh loudest. Or something like that.</dd>

<p>I know how much we all <i>love</i> unsourced images. Aren't they <i>great</i>?</p>
<p>Sorry, been reading <a href="../../../s/a/r/WP%7ESARCASM_0469.html" title="WP:SARCASM">WP:SARCASM</a>. Anyway...</p>
<p>I was browsing the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_24.html" title="Minor characters in 24">Minor characters in 24</a> article when I came across the entry for the character <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_24.html#Haas" title="Minor characters in 24">Haas</a>. I was a bit taken aback, because instead of the image that currently resides there I saw <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/1/16/20070118101613%21Haas.jpg" class="external text" title="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/1/16/20070118101613%21Haas.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a>. That did not strike me as how Fox might portray a man who assasinated a former president.</p>
<p>After doing a little poking I discovered that the problem was with the image Haas.jpg. Apparently V-Line (<a href="../../../v/-/l/User_talk%7EV-Line_4e54.html" title="User talk:V-Line">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_V-Line_1d19.html" title="Special:Contributions/V-Line">contribs</a>) uploaded an image of the wrestler <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Haas_5429.html" title="Charlie Haas">Charlie Haas</a> <i>over</i> the existing image; why they did this is unclear, though I think the numerous "no source/license information" warnings on <a href="../../../v/-/l/User_talk%7EV-Line_4e54.html" title="User talk:V-Line">V-Line's talk page</a> may be somehow related. Anyway, I've since reverted the image (though someone tried to do that once and was reverted in turn) and removed the link from the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Haas_5429.html" title="Charlie Haas">Charlie Haas</a> article. Unfortunately we are now left with two archival copies of the image of the wrestler, which was never sourced properly.</p>
<p>The long and short of it is that I'm guessing that the wrestler versions of the image should be deleted; they completely lack source information or a fair use rationale, to say nothing of the possibility of some well-intentioned but clueless wrestling fan thinking this was some kind of "24-fan conspiracy attack." Provided I'm right, could someone please delete these unneeded versions of the image with all manner of haste? -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai">ramble</a></sub> <small>argue</small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai">check</a></sup>) 04:01, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Done. This happens all the time. You might want to consider downloading the image and re-uploading it under a more specific name. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 05:24, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Over the course of quite a campaign this user changed references to link to a series of legitimate looking websites. He also created dozens of articles with these websites as the sole source. On the surface all of this activity seems like it might be good faith... however, every one of the dozen or so website he's linked too uses the same AdSense account.

<dd>Personally, I believe this is one of those cases when an exemplary measure must be taken. Be sure, he is not the first one to do it, nor will be the last one. And it took Wikipedia months to discover this. He was quoting WP:SPAM, knowing at the same time that what he was doing was morally wrong. We use warnings for people acting in good faith. This is a case when good faith just can't be assumed. <i>This guideline does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary.</i> -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 18:59, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I just noticed it can be misunderstood: Wikipedia is easy money for us all, as long as we follow a set of rules when using its content. The fact that the user wanted to make profit by setting up almost empty sites that were used as references is what really damages Wikipedia. So, in this specific context, easy money implies forging references and external links that, overall, decrease the quality of the encyclopedia and deliver a blow against our open community. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 19:28, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This does highlight the problem of spam in general. Don't think I'm defending the spamming, just that when it's been identified and removed, the banning of that user is a <i>bit</i> of a separate issue. I am glad to see people coming out strongly against letting spam go on. It's increasingly becoming a problem and we need to work on more advanced ways to fight it. With so many articles, not all are being watched (and can't all be watched in a coordinated manner), and more spam slips through unnoticed. Perhaps we should get some tools listing the number of links to certain sites, like what the spam reporter channel does, but keeping a cumulative list accross the project. Then when we see a certain site has 27 links to it over a few weeks it can be investigated. Ideally with legitimate sites like CNN with 27,000 links to it from articles we could take it off the tracking list, to leave only unreviewed potential problems. Perhaps also some tools to remove all links to a certain site in one go would help, for example a link in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch&amp;target=*.shaadibliss.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch&amp;target=*.shaadibliss.com" rel="nofollow">[148]</a> that would allow zapping them all in one go rather than reverting one by one. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 19:44, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, I've just come along to gloat, and to bitch, pretty much in equal measure.

<li><b>Endorse pernament community ban.</b> And I mean pernament. These kind of people are abusive of Wikipedia, and they know it, gaming the system to stave off bans to add a few more bad links to hit up their google pages. This is just ONE abuse, and it's something being dealt with at the <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmy_Wales_69a9.html" title="User:Jimmy Wales">highest levels</a> of Wikipedia.</li>

<dd>Other areas of abuse have also come up, to the point where some arbitrators have been helping us deal with them.

<dd>I find it almost kind of laughable that there was debate about the banning. These people know what they are doing, and citing the policy you break shows that they are acting in bad faith. People that are damaging the wiki willfully should not be permitted to be here. To me, it is really that simple.</dd>

<p>Ahh, yes, the sandbox -- makes interesting reading and I've played in it, too. I'm leary of warning new users ahead of time unless it's really friendly -- perhaps a modified {{<a href="../../../w/e/l/Template%7EWelcomespam_7a29.html" title="Template:Welcomespam">welcomespam</a>}} with a nice note mentioning the domains of concern. Here's a suggestion -- set up a user subpage with the domains and user IDs, then check them the next day. If you are handy with a text editor and creative use of find and replace, you can set up a page like this <a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._External_link_concerns_-_serious_9e8a.html" title="User:A. B./External link concerns - serious">subpage of accounts</a> I've encountered that are major spammers (as opposed to spam0 and spam1 types) or this <a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._pressreleasegold.com_7b5f.html" title="User:A.

Although Ms. Gavankar is the subject of the photo, she doesn't necessarily own the copyright, and in this case, it looks lik Ms. Kaltman and/or Showtime does. If Ms. Gavankar can get them to release copyright under a GDFL-compatible license, then Wikipedia can use the picture, but that may be difficult. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 20:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If she can establish that license, then you are completely right, and I shouldn't have jumped to the conclusion that the license was unobtainable.

<p>Today two admins overturned checkuser-applied hard blocks on IP addresses used by Cplot and replaced them with softblocks.

They undoubtedly affect some good users. However, they also act as free anonymous open proxies. And, as far as I know, registered users can be advised to use the secure server, like AOL addresses. So, I bring it here to the community to choose: Cplot or Starbucks. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 23:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Administrators should not undo any block that is specifically called a "Checkuser" block. Period. The Checkuser knows something that you don't. If the unblock template goes up you need to ask the Checkuser why the block is there. He might not tell you, but he will review the situation and decide whether the block can be lifted. It may not be obvious why that block is in place, but there <i>is</i> a reason. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 00:02, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would like to reiterate what Mackensen has said. Frequently, I've taken potential collateral into account when placing blocks, and as someone that can check the actual edits on an IP I can do that better than most, and taken into account things like how dynamic the IP is also, and still someone overturns it without consultation as soon as an {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} pops up.

<dd>Ok, but can you explain why it makes sense to block several good users to <i>not</i> keep out a single bad one? That is, if doing this prevented Cplot from getting in and doing his dance of disruption we could weigh that benefit against the harm of blocking innocent people. But... it doesn't stop him. He comes in from other IPs and messes things up anyway.

<dd>I believe the idea is that he will eventually run out of IPs to create accounts from, at which point anon+account creation blocks will be able to hold him at bay indefinitely.

<p>This image has been oversized <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolaas_Tinbergen_1ee4.html" title="Nikolaas Tinbergen">Nikolaas Tinbergen</a>, by <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunzil_51a5.html" title="User:Bunzil">User:Bunzil</a>, and now, since his or her edit, I can't figure out how to down-size it? Also, someone has been going around and resizing other bio images to 300px, larger than the original image? I have found and fixed about 5-7 of these so far. There's probably dozens more. --<a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESadi_Carnot_1e85.html" title="User:Sadi Carnot">Sadi Carnot</a> 02:32, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The image is fine. The problem seems to be that the infobox template, {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Scientist_9b28.html" title="Template:Infobox Scientist">Infobox Scientist</a>}}, will automatically upsize small images. I'd bring this up at <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Scientist_9c6b.html" title="Template talk:Infobox Scientist">Template talk:Infobox Scientist</a>, where there has been some discussion already. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 10:15, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
