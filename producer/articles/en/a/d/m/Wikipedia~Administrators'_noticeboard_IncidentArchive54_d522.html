<p>Just a little while ago, I protected an article about an American psychiatrist, <a href="../../../e/2E/_/E._Fuller_Torrey_5b99.html" title="E. Fuller Torrey">E. Fuller Torrey</a>, on the request of a user involved in an edit war that has escalated quite a bit over the past day. The user who requested the protection is a member of an anti-psychiatry group, User:Francesca Allan of MindFreedomBC, who has been edit warring with an anon user of a more traditional opinion. I have a feeling that protection won't work, and that when it's lifted the edit warring will resume, since soon after protection the anon declared "As soon as it is uprotected, I will restore NPOV. I can wait" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AE._Fuller_Torrey&amp;diff=29445963&amp;oldid=29445219" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AE._Fuller_Torrey&amp;diff=29445963&amp;oldid=29445219" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" rel="nofollow">m:The Wrong Version</a>) This subject is far beyond my personal knowledge -- if anybody's familiar with this stuff and has a minute to pop by to at least lend another opinion to the mix, it'd be welcome. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 04:17, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm. User:Francesca Allan of MindFreedomBC has clearly been making anti-psychiatry POV pushing without a great deal of regard for NPOV whatsoever; the character of the text inserted, and the nature of the prose, is strongly suggestive to me of a <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scientology_879d.html" title="Church of Scientology">Church of Scientology</a> connected advocate of some description, from my experience as having once been one. E. Fuller Torrey has been a Scientology foe in the past, although I can't quite remember why; a connection with the <a href="../../../n/i/m/NIMH_977b.html" title="NIMH">NIMH</a> I think was one reason. Note also digging through the history some past Scientology-related editors have made edits (<a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">User:AI</a> for example, who was banned by the arbcom for pro-Scientology POV editing, although admittedly he made only one named edit. Possibly the anon before looks like him). The page, as it stands, has got the definite mark of an anti-psychiatry slant, and although I hate to whine about <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="extiw" title="m:The_Wrong_Version">m:The Wrong Version</a> I think it might be wise to either revert to a version before Francesca Allen had anything to do with it, or rewrite it manually; I'd rather not touch it myself, though, due to neutrality issues. If there's any way I can help out, please do ask. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull"><font color="#906040">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></font></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 19:09, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The block was quickly undone, but this is not the first inappropriate block I've seen recently from Ed Poor. Ed, I know you've stated before that you will never give up your sysop privileges, so I won't bother asking you to consider that. However, I'd really like it if you'd agree to not use the block function anymore, as you seem to be having trouble knowing when it is or is not appropriate. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:00, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, according to <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>:</dd>
<dd><i>Sysops may, at their judgement, block IP addresses or usernames that disrupt the normal functioning of Wikipedia. Such disruption may include changing other users' signed comments, making <b>deliberately misleading edits</b>, and excessive personal attacks.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems a valid block - however, before we enter the realm of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilawyering_a5b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilawyering">Wikilaywering</a>, and start pointing out that an edit summary is technically not an edit, remember: <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_bureaucracy" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy</a>, and we have rules such as <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> in order to avoid bureaucracy. It all comes down to one simple question: was Duncharris being disruptive? If yes, then the block was justified - if no, then it was not. This question stems from this question: <b>is writing misleading edit summaries which contain straightforward lies about other users disruptive?</b> If yes, then the block was justified. Izehar 20:25, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Blocks for disruption are almost always controversial and Duncharris's edit summary barely qualifies as borderline disruption. It certainly should have been discussed here before a block was made. There's no way the block should have been for 24 hours. Furthermore, Ed is <i>way</i> too involved with Duncharris to making blocks like this. No matter what Ed's reasons were, it <i>looks</i> like a revenge block. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 20:34, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The key phrase is "disrupt the normal functioning of Wikipedia". One false edit summery does not really have a noticable effect on the normal functioning of wikipedia.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 20:35, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Got to agree with Carbonite and Geni - I know I wouldn't block anyone for such a reason, especially if I had a past history with them. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 20:39, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Given all the comments here and elsewhere, and the obvious implication that discussion with Ed on his talk page is not working, that the next step in the dispute resolution process should be taken - namely starting an RfC. I suggest that in addition to linking it on <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">user talk:Ed Poor</a> you also note it here and at Duncharris' RfC. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 22:29, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just for context - this is Ed's third block against someone with whom he was in conflict in 9 days. He said he was wrong to do so in Dunc's RFC, then did it again to JoshuaSchroeder, and now Dunc. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 22:36, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regardless of Ed blocking someone who he was in conflict with (or not, I can't really say), that has got to be one of the most absurd reasons for blocking I've ever heard.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean</a>|<a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black">Bla</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">ck</font></a> 00:01, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I strongly disagree with this proposal. Disruptive users often claim that an admin who acts against them is biased and "involved," which by definition becomes a "conflict." This proposal would strengthen the hand of trolls and bad editors. Admins should not block users when they are involved in a <i>content</i> dispute with them, which is what the policy already says. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 13:40, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>We depend heavily on human judgement in all editors, admins certainly included. As long as people are reasonable, we don't need extra rules that, as pointed out, could be helpful to disruptive editors. When inappropriate blocks are made, there's usually no shortage of editors willing to tell the blocker that the block was wrong. Any reasonably responsible admin will take such statements to heart and be more conservative in the future.</dd>
<dd>Personally, I think blocking is a big enough deal that anyone repeatedly abusing the block function should lose the ability to do it. The software doesn't currently support such a thing (AFAIK), but there's no reason the <i>community</i> could not implement such a policy. We'd be depending on the offender to <i>voluntarily</i> refrain from blocking, but if that didn't work out, we'd just continue through the dispute resolution process. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:31, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We've <i>heard</i> "Ed's side of the story" -- it is expressed in his talk comments, his conduct on the AfDs about his fork articles, his remarks to other editors. His side of the story is a matter of public record. If I recall correctly, it involves such high points as claiming that nominating his articles for deletion was grounds for being blocked as a POV-pusher; and celebrating having driven a "subversive" [sic!] editor away from the project. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 07:22, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The situation is complex. Meier is subject to a warning not to continue stalking Cool Cat, but in this instance it was Cool Cat who engaged in aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>More recently, Cool Cat has started moving material from the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a> article to the talk page and questioning its presence; this is in my opinion acceptable, but not advisable. Other editors have resisted this. Meanwhile Cool Cat and Karl Meier have resumed their edit war on <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a>. Both are ignoring advice given by the arbitration committee and specific warnings given by me over recent behavior.</p>

<p>This user has some few-dozen <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.92.58.111_5165.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.92.58.111">contribs</a>, and after seeing just a few of them I'm willing to bet they're all the same - inserting an ext link to some football website. It's not really vandalism in progress, because they've stopped for now, but it appears no one else has bothered to check it out or warn them. Well, I just warned them, but is there a quick way to revert their changes rather than manually checking each one?

The consensus among editors is that they should be called "wives," which I believe is the mainstream position among Islamic scholars. However, Zeno and Karl seem to want to emphasize that Muhammad had sex with slaves. Could an uninvolved admin have a word with them? They're opposed on the page by Grenavitar, Zora, Yuber, Irishpunktom, and myself.

<dl>
<dd>Hi Kevin,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm writing to you from the Political Science department at the University of Rochester.</dd>
<dd>I'm hoping you can help me locate an original article that has been deleted from Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>I'm presently in receipt of the deletion review but would really like to obtain the original entry and&#160;:author's name.</dd>
<dd>If there's a way for me to obtain this from Wikipedia can you let me know? I'm new to the site.</dd>

<dd>Brent Henry Waddington is the subject of the article and he's a student of ours--We'd like the article&#160;:for his records.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for any help you can give me regarding this matter.</dd>

<p>UofR's webpage confirms the identity of the sender. Regarding the article, it was a hoax article created by an otherwise legitimate user. The hoax was extensive and even involved amazon.com. Here is the missing article and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Brent_Henry_Waddington_b60e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brent Henry Waddington">its AfD</a>. My guess is that someone complained to them and they are trying to deal with it. But, I have no idea what the appropriate policy is. Am I allowed to email them deleted article? Should I? My inclination is to send it to them, but I thought I should ask. --best, kevin <b>[</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">kzollman</a><b>][</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">talk</a><b>]</b> 22:10, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no idea what he means "in receipt of the Deletion Review", but if the sender is from the University, as you assert, and they want it for internal procedures, there is no reason to deny the request. In fact, it should probably be temporarily undeleted in its entirety and protected, so they can see the edit history for themselves. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia%7ESemi-protection_policy_9387.html" title="Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy">did you read this?</a>)</sup> 22:15, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>I am very wary of granting this request - I see little benefit in Wikipedia creating a precedent of "turning in" contributors where the bulk of their contributions are good. That he made a stupid hoax is stupid, but does not in and of itself constitute reason to help him be punished outside of Wikipedia. I also note that his name is not on the article, nor is it his username, nor does he give more than his first page on his userpage, so the information being asked for isn't really available. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 19:14, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I actually don't know why they want the information. I didn't send any complaints to anyone, nor did <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">User:Pete.Hurd</a> (for exactly the reason you stated). But either way, if he's been "turned in" its already happened. Do you think it would be now appropriate to refuse their request? Here's my worry: we are increasingly sending complaints to ISP regarding persistant vandals. If they have some disciplinary process that they want our help in carrying out, is it a good policy for wikipedia to be uncooperative? Can we then legitimately ask their help in enforcing our bans in future? --best, kevin <b>[</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">kzollman</a><b>][</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">talk</a><b>]</b> 19:54, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I doubt a Dept'l chairs' Admin Assistant would chase down information based on some complaint from the internet about a hoax. I would assume that there is some process afoot at UofR dealing withan issue of importance to them. If they bother to initiate an active investigation, I would expect it to be for academic misconduct, or something else they feel is serious. I very much doubt that whatever it is, it has this sillness at it's focus (or that they are at liberty to discuss the details with us). <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 23:09, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

After asking him to cooperate in trying to resolve the dispute in some way or another (even inventing a more structured form of article rfc based on user rfcs), he denounced the attempt to cooperate towards a consensus version, thus retroactively activating the arbcom's PAP ruling on him in my opinion, which was at 3 days for an attack and I counted 20 on the talk page of <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_c079.html" title="Ward Churchill">Ward Churchill</a> since that case closed. Thus, I blocked him for 60 days. This might seem harsh, but from what i've seen of him so far, he has done nothing constructive on Wikipedia, and 60 days is "short" in my definition since his behavior to this point from what i've seen and heard indicates that he should be blocked for several years, if not forever. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 09:04, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

I shut down 63.19.128.0/17 for 48 hours again, which stops him, at least until he can get himself a new IP range. Occasionally he makes valid edits (about one out of every ten or twenty), and it is characteristic of him to squeal like a stuck pig when one of those is either deleted or reverted.

<p>This user continues to remove the IfD tag from this image, replacing it with increasingly bizarre claims about Iranian copyright law. First he tried to claim that it was "fallen into the commons domain". I <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_2005_November_28_5ca0.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2005 November 28">pointed out</a> that it was in fact a wire service photo (from <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agence_France-Presse_c913.html" title="Agence France-Presse">AFP</a>) and hence probably a copyright violation. He tried to claim that Iran has no copyright laws regarding photographs, which is nonsense; Iran does in fact have <a href="http://unesco.org/culture/copy/copyright/iran/sommaire.html" class="external text" title="http://unesco.org/culture/copy/copyright/iran/sommaire.html" rel="nofollow">copyright laws</a> which cover photographs, and in any case the photograph is copyrighted elsewhere. I said, and still say, that this claim is BS. He then tried to claim that "All pictures taken in the Islamic Republic of Iran belong to its sovereign power", again unsupported by any authority—only the assertion that "Anyone who knows anything about Islam could tell you that they [the copyright laws which I cited] are unislamic", and hence the laws I linked to did not apply. I'm having a great deal of trouble assuming good faith on this one; I believe his behavior to be either egregious foolishness or outright mendacity.

<dd>Iran is one of a small number of countries that is not signatory to the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berne_Convention_b086.html" title="Berne Convention">Berne Convention</a> on copyright. As a result, many works published in Iran are not protected by US copyright laws, and Iran does not recognize protections for most works published outside Iran. The copyright laws that do exists in Iran also have a number of significant differences from US laws. However, it is official policy of the Wikimedia foundation to honor the copyright laws of Iran as best as we are able even though we may be under no legal obligation to do so. All of which is irrelevant if it is an AFP photo since the US certainly does recognize the IP rights of France. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 04:40, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Blocks under this banning should be reasonable in length.

<p>From them flows a steady, deep, inexhaustible river of childish vandalism into the encyclopedia. After quite some time spent sampling, I haven't found one single good edit from any of them, though I can't swear that one isn't hiding out somewhere, obviously. All the warnings posted on all the talkpages by all the ambitious Wikipedians have an air of pathos, if you read them all together. Don't we have enough to do? If the range is indeed static, and the sole purview of enthusiastically scrawling children, can it be blocked wholesale, by someone who understands the art of range blocking? Or can somebody who's better than me at navigating the intarweb find their way to someone in a position of responsibility at the <b>UK Internet for Learning</b>? Or, does anybody have any other suggestions? Please? --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:03, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I received an email indicating that this block is also affecting some libraries in the UK. I still haven't heard back from the ISP and I asked the user that mailed me to try and get the IPs of the library computers to see if I can work round that range with the block. Is this worth maintaining if we're going to cause collateral damage? --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeL_c5a8.html" title="User:GraemeL">GraemeL</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraemeL_c70d.html" title="User talk:GraemeL"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:02, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds promising. They must divide that block of addresses up. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 20:15, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If we can get the library range (i.e. if the vandal fonts are, indeed, static), we can except them, but we need to be aware of the fact that libraries may be one of the sites of vandalism, and the only thing denied them now is the ability to edit. We're still good for researching on. The amount of spew the range was producing was truly staggering. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:02, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "other" edits are good-faith attempts to create content, or at least, aren't clear vandalism (some of them have been reverted, some have not). Many of them are reversions of other edits from this range. The overall pattern seems to me that of schoolkids teasing each other using Wikipedia, and some other people (older students?) reverting them and sometimes adding content. The vandalism seems to come in short spates, and I'm guessing the IPs might correspond to workstations in a computer lab or school library. My gut feeling is not to re-block the IP range, but since the vandalism doesn't come very fast, to block the individual IPs as needed for short periods (but without separate warning). <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 08:50, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can someone official, e.g. ArbCom or Jimbo or related, please indicate the <i>reasoning</i> behind not having an election for the next arbitration committee? I find it worrying that neither has so far been willing to comment on this. At present, the impression is that without having the proper connections, one cannot become an arb. There has been <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005_Straw_poll_4c77.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005/Straw poll">considerable opposition</a> to appointing an ArbCom rather than electing one, and ignoring this without bothering to comment on it will likely decrease community support for the ArbCom as a whole. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 19:51, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For those unfamiliar with ArbCom, answers to the following questions would also be helpful:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Has ArbCom been elected or appointed in the past?</li>
<li>Has ArbCom been doing a good or a bad job in the past, and how this is related to the change of election/appointment procedure?</li>
<li>How long are ArbCom cadencies?</li>
<li>Is it possible to remove somebody from ArbCom? If so, how?</li>
</ol>
<p>A possible solution might be to have ArbCom appointed one year and elected another. After several years we should be able to judge which method is better.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 20:53, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1.a mixture of apointements and elections at various times.</dd>
<dd>2.Imposible to objectively judge. Only one descission has been rejected by the community</dd>
<dd>3. in thoery 1 to 3 years. In practice untill they quit which tends to be a lot shorter</dd>
<dd>4.It could probably be done through getting the other arbcom memebers to vote them off or a descission by the board. It would not be easy. It hasn't come up yet though.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 21:35, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I should point out in relation to (2), that criticism of Arbs and the ArbCom has increased significantly since Jimbo's recent appointements. But the situation is more complex than that, it's certainly not a straight "post hoc ergo propter hoc". The answer to (4) is almost certainly "no", given that it's already next-to-impossible to get deadminned. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 23:27, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The AC cannot comment on this with any authority because we don't <i>know</i> what the procedure will be. All I can say without wild speculation is that if you'd like to be considered, you should probably put a statement on the candidate statements page. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 22:23, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Once again, that is more information than was previously known, so thanks. So who does know? Only Jimbo? The board? Some hidden discussion someplace? Since this affects the entire community, I think it's patently unreasonable to keep the entire community in the dark on this. I've seen several candidates withdrawing because of the uncertainty; it gives the appearance that most people putting up candidate statements will not actually be considered at all, with no reasons given. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 23:27, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>A very slight clarification of geni's comment, which I think bears explaining - the Committee has never been directly elected. There have been two times (out of five total) when Jimbo was appointing people to it where he asked the community to use the "voting" software to suggest who he should appoint; both times, he happened to appoint along the same lines as the "vote" suggested, but it wasn't an election <i>per se</i>.</dd>

<li>Hello to you all. I think we can assume good faith for Jimbo&#160;:) Besides that I 'd like to point out, a part of his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=26040916" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=26040916" rel="nofollow">statement</a> "with the appointments made in consultation with the existing and former ArbCom members and the community at large, followed by confirmation votes from the community requiring some supermajority". <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 23:41, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>assumeing good faith is one thing. Assumeing correct judgement is another.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 23:50, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Current suggestion is 50%, which is not really a supermajority. To my best knowledge, no consultation of the community at large has occured. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 23:51, 26 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If this wasn't clear - the steps I described above (where I mentioned the 50% number) is only my best guess. Jimbo has described the process informally several times, and if memory serves, he used supermajority in one description and majority in another. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 23:59, 26 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So even Jimbo hasn't decided what's being done, then? A little keeping-the-community-in-the-loop would be really, genuinely helpful. I wonder where he is planning to conduct the consultation with the community before announcing his choices, for example? Can the ArbCom tell us what discussions they have so far had (the message from MATIA implies some), and who they are recommending? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:52, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with Splash too (and I must note that the message I've cited was given in the previous section by Raul654). Reading that message (and unless or until something else is announced) I think that Jimbo will select some candidates (from the volunteers that would go for an election), and then a second selection will be done by JW, ArbCom and the community in general (that's what I understand, perhaps I'm wrong). I also think that within the next days some announcement will be made that will clarify the things better (WP is not a crystal ball, am I? ) <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 18:20, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think we should probably avoid elections for arbitrators altogether. They're just a bunch of people who make commonsense decisions when the normal dispute resolution process has failed. There aren't that many people both capable of and willing to do the job. Jimbo should just name some names of people that he would be happy with acting on his behalf, and we can forget about it for the next few months. The elections have been unnecessary and, in my opinion, probably only made things worse within the community. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:12, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

There's a large (and growing) consensus for direct elections; it'd be a disaster to carry forward with Jimbo only giving us his choices (and what happens if his choices don't get the majority vote needed; will he renominate them again or reconsider those he passed over, or will he leave that seat unfilled?).

<p>I think some people are forgetting that we are all here because Jimbo lets us be here. Electing arbitrators is not a right conferred to us by our citizenry in Wikipedia land. It's times like this that we should be thanking him for creating and maintaining Wikipedia, not making bold demands about how he should exercise his rightful authority over it. That said, I would like to echo Tony Sidaway's point. Given the trainwreck that was the last elections, I don't see the need for a repeat. Let Jimbo appoint some trustworthy folks so we can all move past the Wiki-politics and write an encyclopedia.&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 10:39, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>we are here because Jimbo lets us <i>and</i> because readers and community members donate money for the servers. I would definitely prefer some transparency here. If I began to feel WP was becoming a "self-perpetuating oligarchy" I would be less enthusiastic about investing time and content. If enough people felt like that, the project would be damaged (WP is, after all, about content). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:55, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Put another way, I think Wikipedia editors should not feel that their contributions to Wikipedia (monetary or otherwise) entitle them to a "Republican form of government" or anything else. Like MATIA said, we are volunteers, and donations are donations; they aren't payment for services. When someone donates to the foundation, she does not think she is purchasing a vote in a bureaucracy. If public elections for arbitrators are manifestly harmful, because they waste time and are highly contentious for no beneficial reason but that people tend to feel strongly about the Wikipolitics, then I would greatly appreciate it if Jimbo would "cut through the bullshit" as it were and just make appointments. I think these are the real questions in this disagreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are we "owed" anything by the WikiMedia foundation, in particular a vote in elections of officers? Why?</li>
<li>Given the high cost, what would be gained by public elections of arbitrators, anyway?</li>

<p>I think this thread is getting off topic a bit, the only real point of the election IMO is to select people who will make the arbcom into something into something users feel will be authoritative enough to trust regarding enforcing/interpreting policy in disputes, much like a court(if people didn't respect the authority of courts, they'd be ignored, as some users do regarding the arbcom). If this happens via election or appointment, i'm happy, but I think the outcry here is it'll only happen through election and Jimbo stays on the sidelines as an advisor rather than any kind of participant. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 22:56, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The style guide doesn't seem to say that about dates, that I've found—if it does, can you tell me where?

<dd>Well, he violated 3RR, but aside from that... The policy, as I said, doesn't seem to say either way how a disputed decision should be made. Thus I would expect consensus to be sought to change from the current version. But of course, there are many ways to seek consensus. He's not acting explicitly according to policy, but he's only doing something wrong (aside from 3RR) if edit warring is "something wrong". Which is is, in the sense that it is not the best way to make decisions, but not in the sense that it requires administrator intervention. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 19:41, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, it's not a sockpuppet of mine. However, MacGyverMagic is wrong, it's not a case of AE v BE - ArbCom OK'd wholesale unilateral changes to BCE and CE notation (à la Sortan et al.) and condemned reverting these changes.

<p>Hardly - you were reverting far more than me and against many editors, making aggressive edits, changing notation to your preferred form in articles that had previously been stable in another form and hide behind a sockpuppet role account. If the objection was to pure volume of reverts, you'd have been sanctioned too. It's more a case of ArbCom preferring the BCE/CE notation style (or maybe mostly Fred) and tuning its decision to meet that objective. They even refused to let me defend the accusations laid against me (which to this day, I haven't even read, let alone responded to), though, to be fair to Fred, he did make it clear that he would ignore anything I said on the matter anyway.

<p>Sam, it is crystal clear from his edits that Sortan is a sockpuppet account of a very prolific WP editor (possibly an admin). A number of other editors commented on this before me, and it prompted David Gerard to do a sockpuppet check, although, as often is the case, it came up without results. Sortan regularly reverts me very quickly when I make an edit other than of a cricket or featured list nature, and has done so now over a number of months. He has also very quickly commented on WP:AN/I after I first referred to Sortan on there (without logging in so he couldn't see it in my user contributions). In the role account's early days, Sortan also has displayed knowledge of WP practice far exceeding his WP experience. There is no reasonable doubt that Sortan is a sockpuppet role account. If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then in all probability, it's a duck!</p>
<p>I am probably most aware of this is that Sortan wikistalks me - the majority of Sortan's edits merely revert me, usually coupled with some personal attack. The only way I could be called a troll is in the technical sense that by making a non-cricket edit to the main namespace, regardless of what it is, Sortan will invariably revert it. Thankfully very few WPians have ever been wikistalked - it's not nice, and I don't recommend it. By the way, the only reason he knows under what other accounts I have edited because I have freely stated the fact - interestingly, he has repeatedly refused to come clean himself&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 21:21, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I truly find Jguk most perplexing. Good faith can be extended once, twice, and perhaps a third time, but it is foolish to continue to assume it despite all evidence to the contrary. I admit that I've made mistakes, but I've done my best to learn from them and move on, whereas Jguk was warned <a href="../../../j/g/u/User_talk%7EJguk_Archive1_2210.html#About_the_usage_.22BCE.27" title="User talk:Jguk/Archive1">more than a year ago</a> that using "consistency" as an excuse to change articles to his preferred date style was disruptive, yet it took more than a thousand reverts, hundreds of revert wars, dozens of editors, two arbcom case, and a direct banning by the arbcom before he stopped. Is that really reasonable behavior? He still fails to acknowledge any personal culpability, choosing instead to blame his banning on a conspiracy involving the arbcom. Reasonable? Sane? He has written volumes about how I've unilaterally changed date styles, but has failed to provide even one single diff showing where. He has accused me of wikistalking him, yet it is he who has constantly harassed <i>me</i> (for example, see my edit at <a href="../../../s/m/y/Smyrna.html" title="Smyrna">Smyrna</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smyrna&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19703233" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smyrna&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19703233" rel="nofollow">[117]</a> changing one inconsistent AD to CE and jguk's subsequent edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smyrna&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=19703233" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smyrna&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=19703233" rel="nofollow">[118]</a> changing all fourteen instances of BCE/CE to BC/AD, with a dishonest edit summary of "rv"). Incidentally, I do regret making the first edit, which while it was supported by the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">Manual of Style</a>, I found was still disruptive (mostly due to jguk). I've learned from my mistake and have never done anything similar. It took me all of one day to realize this and to stop. Jguk, on the other hand, still hasn't realized this after more than a year. Incidentally you will note that it was jguk who initially started making personal attacks at me in his edit summaries. Another instance of him harassing me is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_Era&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=21896500" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_Era&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=21896500" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where he states that all my edits should be "revert[ed] on sight".</dd>
<dd>It is most troubling that he continues in the same pattern of behavior regarding other issues, including the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Talk%7EROC_local_elections%2C_2005_5a27.html" title="Talk:ROC local elections, 2005">ROC/Taiwan</a> issue, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=28697862&amp;oldid=28693572" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=28697862&amp;oldid=28693572" rel="nofollow">US vs U.S.</a> (which is again more than a year old, and which the MOS unambiguously states should be U.S.), American English vs British English, styles for royalty, etc. In the past, it seems, others let him have his way because of his tenaciousness and constant revert warring, but I don't believe things are the same now, and this type of behavior is sure to land him before the arbcom again. In addition, he is testing the limits of his ban by continuing to remove references to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a> from articles, as well as continuing to indulge in conspiracy fantasies despite all evidence to the contrary. Some form of mentoring seems to be a perfect way to help him resolve conflicts amicably in the future without resorting to revert warring and name calling. <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESortan_7006.html" title="User:Sortan">Sortan</a> 00:22, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sam, thank you for your comment. Incidentally, I have never had time to read through the arb case, so am unaware of the comments - ArbCom closed it before I'd even read what I was accused of, let alone made a defence, but there goes.</p>
<p>There is a difference between "conclusive" and "beyond reasonable doubt". "Conclusive" implies 100% certainty, and absent Sortan admitting what his other accounts are, we're never going to get it. However, it is clear beyond reasonable doubt that Sortan is a sockpuppet role account used mostly for fighting this cause (interestingly he has never brought himself to deny that, although admittedly I wouldn't believe him if he did). Mind you having just looked at his user contributions again, it appears that he has become more concerned with hounding Chooserr than me for now. But let me assure you of one thing, Sam, Sortan is a bad faith account, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 21:47, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Likewise you are "beyond a reasonable doubt" trolling. Edits such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=21st_century&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30149492" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=21st_century&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30149492" rel="nofollow">[119]</a> designed just to remove references to Common Era, and to change American English to British English fit the definition perfectly. Do you really consider yourself acting in "good faith"? <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESortan_7006.html" title="User:Sortan">Sortan</a> 21:56, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sortan, an analysis of my edits will show that I have no fewer than six featured articles and am responsible for more featured lists than any other editor - indeed, I think there are only half a dozen or so editors with more featured material. It was me that helped spark the introduction of the portal namespace, and who has co-created the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Portal%7ECricket_1b4e.html" title="Portal:Cricket">cricket portal</a>, which has attracted many favourable comments. I am one of the two WPians responsible for promoting and failing featured list candidates; it was me who changed AfD from being shown by week to being shown by day (to the great relief of our servers). I have also copyedited a number of articles and been a strong advocate that articles, regardless of their subject, should use clear language, as free as possible of jargon, and as open to an international audience as possible. Notably, I greated improved the article on the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy_892f.html" title="Assassination of John F. Kennedy">Assassination of John F. Kennedy</a>, which was far, far too long, into a comprehensible, smaller version, supported by sub-articles. Remarkably for such a major edit to such a controversial page, it was accepted, and indeed welcomed (though, of course, later improved by others). The edit you cite is yet another example of my changing an article to make it simpler - ie more intellgible to more people. Yes, one part of this was to remove the reference to "Common Era", which is a little understood term, certainly by the worldwide general public, and therefore should be avoided, where possible, on those grounds. However, there were other failings - for instance, the rather irrelevant comment about millennia and the lack of explanation as to why some people think the 21st century began in 2000 and others in 2001. I also added a clarification that the century began on 1 January, and will end on 31 December (which avoids the possible misunderstanding that by saying it begins in 2000, it is meant to say it begins at the end of 2000). It's a good copyedit, which I expect to stand (subject to further future improvements).</dd>

<dd>By contrast, looking at the edits of your Sortan account, it is difficult to find anything there of any real benefit to the encyclopaedia. It's mostly full of reverts, not only of me, but of many other editors, of which Chooserr seems, somewhat unfortunately, to be your latest favourite revert victim. Your edit summaries have also frequently included the use of personal attacks, which coupled with your unwillingness to reveal what your main WP account is, have merely served to embitter the atmosphere (as if WP is not a bitter enough place as it is). Anyone reviewing your contributions will soon see that there are no significant contributions there: none that we can really say have made WP a better place.

<dd>As you mentioned, sock puppetry is not the actual offense. Therefore, I doubt that the tag's insertion would attract administrative intervention. Evidently, this page is the proper venue for reporting block evasion, so hopefully something will come of this discussion. —<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 03:03, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear fellow wikipedians, i myself have been a law abiding wikipedian.. but currently i have created a new article on "BORED", an organization that i founded with my fellow peers. It is an organization of 100 members worldwide, in cities such as LA, new York, Vancouver, Paris, London, Liverpool, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Sydney. But the user Shreshth91 keeps on deleting. Please give me permission to post it and protect it from deltion. Thankyou - --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarryau_bade.html" title="User:Larryau">Larryau</a> 10:22, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having just looked at the deleted versions, however, I do not think that you have much chance of it being undeleted. There is a high-bar of notability required for student organisations and one that has been in existence less than one month does not meet that standard. There is a small chance that some people <i>might</i> consider it worth a full hearing at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>, but I personally cannot see it surviving this. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 10:39, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The admin <a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar">Alkivar</a> has gone over the top in the abuse of his power. If you look at his edit history, you will see that he blocked a guy named CapnCrack without warning despite Crack's vandalism being relatively minor. I think a warning explaining to Crack the proper way to use edit summaries would have been plenty.</p>
<p>Next, Alkivar reverted the <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_Christian_University_6100.html" title="Oklahoma Christian University">Oklahoma Christian University</a> page and then page-protected it. If page protection is not an edorsement of the current state of a page, why did he revert a page that was not vandalized and then protect it? I don't know how to reach any other conclusion other than that he did not personally appreciate the the most recent edits.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Alkivar simply labels everyone a vandal who tries to talk with him about this matter, and he claims any argument regarding the matter to be vandalism. Look at his talk page. Any time someone brings up the Oklahoma Christian University article on his talk page, he just reverts it or claims it is a personal attack. At one point, Alkivar was simply reminded of the official policy at Wikipedia and how he was presently violating it. Alkivar's response was to remove that comment as "vandalism". (Are the Wikipedia policies <i>really</i> vandalism? Alkivar also removed one comment claiming that the conversation is over. However, the page-protection sign clearly states that the page is protected until a resolution can be reached. How can a resolution be reached if the conversation is over?</p>
<p>I don't want to have to go through whatever the process is here to resolve a dispute. I just don't have the time. I like to edit Wikipedia, and I like to read at Wikipedia. But I won't have time for a couple of weeks to be able to spend a ton of time trying to reason with someone through some bureaucratic process. Is there anyway he can be convinced to cool it and to restore the pages and parties he has offended? I can't see how anyone who is behaving like he is can be considered within the scope of appropriate behavior.</p>

<dd>I find it very suspicious, too. A guy with 5 edits is evidence that weighs heavily against a guy reverting acceptable edits, protecting pages to "win" fights, deleting user comments, blocking minor vandals indefinitely without warning, and referring to the official policy as vandalism. Thanks for bringing this error in my reasoning to my attention. 68.97.36.194 12:58, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dude, there was nothing in that last paragraph that resembled what most people call "reasoning"; rather, it resembled the output of a Sarcast-o-Bot: "Yes, &lt;repeat what other person said&gt;, &lt;add own, unrelated complaint&gt;." Two words for you: Matthew 7:3. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 13:18, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, let me slow this down for you then. Here's the reasoning I used. I like to call it a "balancing test". The evidence you presented - one possibly controversial fact. Here is the evidence I presented - five facts that went uncontested that show poor judgment on the part of an administrator.</dd>

<dd>Now, in the backwards world that I come from, that's reasoning. I've tried to tell the people I know so many times that this whole idea of making solid arguments backed with facts and logic, refuting opposing arguments, and then defending the original constructive arguments is getting outdated, but they won't listen to me. Now, here I am, being shamed into defeat because I took the advice of all those wack-jobs who thought that was the way to win an argument.</dd>

This is explicitly <i>not</i> in our protection policy, and for good reason. It goes against the spirit of Wikipedia. In fact, high visibility articles like those on the main page should remain unprotected to display what Wikipedia is to new visitors. In fact, there was minimal vandalism before the protection, and I suspect most were simply tests.

<p>This is a very long, tedious story. Short version: This user used to be on the Hebrew Wikipedia, but was permanently banned for filling his user page with tons of Hebrew words and characters, so that if you searched Google for anything in Hebrew, his user page would be ranked highly. From talking with the admins on Hebrew Wikipedia, I found that they also blocked him for pornography-related content as well.</p>
<p>Anyways, he moved over to the English Wikipedia, and did the same thing here. He was found out, the hebrew spam was removed from his user page, and an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Haham_hanuka_b9d0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Haham hanuka">RFC was brought against him</a>, though I'm not sure whatever happened in this case (back in May).</p>
<p>Several months later, and I check his user page to find that he has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AHaham_hanuka&amp;diff=30133449&amp;oldid=28401229" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AHaham_hanuka&amp;diff=30133449&amp;oldid=28401229" rel="nofollow">once again filled it with the same Hebrew spam</a>, only <b>he's made the text ultra-small, and colored it white so that it will be as unnoticeable as possible</b>.

<p>While, having reviewed some of Marsden's edits, I can understand why there was a block, I think it's a shame that SlimVirgin was the one to block him as she has been involved in disputes with Marsden in the recent past (at least on the page in question). I'd also question whether SV has been entirely fair on Marsden, for example, with this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005%2FCandidate_statements%2FJayjg&amp;diff=29732491&amp;oldid=29731605" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005%2FCandidate_statements%2FJayjg&amp;diff=29732491&amp;oldid=29731605" rel="nofollow">[126]</a>. Many of Marsden's edits may have been objectionable - but going overboard on the guy is also objectionable, and no doubt contributes to him going on the offence as a kind of defence mechanism, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 20:58, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Posting counter-questions certainly did attract attention to the fact that this editor had a score to settle with Jayjg.

<dd>Hi Jguk, far from going overboard with Marsden, this is the first admin action I've taken against him and it's long overdue. I'm not involved in any content dispute with him except in trying to keep that page free of NPA violations and disruption. Marsden has been involved in attacks against a range of editors since he arrived at Wikipedia. Several people have tried to reason with him but it made no difference, so people started warning, which also made no difference, then applying blocks. He has so far been blocked five times by five different admins, each time for the same type of behavior. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:40, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Marsden contacted me during the block and we exchanged e-mails in which I tried to persuade him not to post any similar attacks in future. He then posted our correspondence without my consent on his talk page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Marsden&amp;oldid=30428759#Text_of_conversation_with_SlimVirgin" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Marsden&amp;oldid=30428759#Text_of_conversation_with_SlimVirgin" rel="nofollow">[127]</a> which had the effect of repeating the attacks he was blocked for in the first place.

<dd>Bonaparte has called people "loosers", said they were "dump", has made fun of me for being gay, for being Jewish, and seems to think it's of some great importance that I'm 16 years old. He has constantly disrupted the talkpage so that nobody could get in a word edgewise, because he kept adding long passages of text in Romanian that nobody was going to read anyhow but which basically just rehashed his previously stated opinions, which he says over and over again. Additionally, he has pretended to be an admin on the talk pages of several anons. --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 21:39, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd><b>Jguk banned from changing BCE to BC or CE to AD</b></dd>
<dd>1) Jguk is indefinitely prohibited from changing BCE to BC or CE to AD in any article, for any reason.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Furthermore, there is a finding of fact which states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Jguk's campaign</b></dd>
<dd>1) Jguk has changed the era notation on hundreds of articles which he does not usually edit to reflect his preferred usage BC AD, see for example his edits to <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khazars.html" title="Khazars">Khazars</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khazars&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=25173597" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khazars&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=25173597" rel="nofollow">[129]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khazars&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=25224437" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khazars&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=25224437" rel="nofollow">[130]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khazars&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=25225165" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khazars&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=25225165" rel="nofollow">[131]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is the <b>exact</b> type of editing he has continued to do recent edits (most specifically here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paganism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30446958" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paganism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30446958" rel="nofollow">[132]</a>, as well as the aforementioned <a href="../../../o/l/m/Olmec.html" title="Olmec">Olmec</a> article). Is this allowed editing? Some sort of clarification would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>In my opinion, not only do his edits violate the arbcom prohibition, but in his quest to remove BCE/CE notation he introduces inaccuracies into articles. For example changing <i>3500 BCE</i> to <i>5500 years ago</i> (which is awkward phrasing, and might be correct today, but not so in 20 years), as wells as changing <i>start of the Common Era</i> to <i>1 BC</i> and <i>1 AD</i> (which changes general and vague phrasing to a specific date, which implies a precision that is not there).</p>
<p>Finally the arbcom case states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Enforcement by ban</b></dd>
<dd>1) Jguk may be briefly banned, up to a week in the case of repeated offenses, should he attempt to change the era notation in any article.</dd>

<ul>
<li>My opinion is that these edits (Changing "beginning of the Common Era" to "1 AD" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Olmec&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30408067" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Olmec&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30408067" rel="nofollow">[133]</a> and changing "500 CE" to "500" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paganism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30446958" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paganism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30446958" rel="nofollow">[134]</a>) are clear attempts to game the ruling and follow the letter of the law while violating the spirit. However, I am both a very new administrator as well as someone with a personal preference for BCE/CE notation in his own editing, so I'd ask someone else to have a look and perform a block in accordance with the arbcom ruling. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 16:38, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Changing "AD 500" or "500 CE" to plain "500" may actually be wise. I recommend that in cases where the discussion does not include BC[E] dates. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 16:45, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wise or not, <i>jguk</i> of all people should not be doing this. Personally I think that "AD 500" or "500 CE" look and read better than a plain "500" (and linking dates like "<a href="../../../5/0/0/500.html" title="500">500</a>" to make them stand out / look like dates is not an improvement as dates are far too over linked- there was a discussion on this at the MOS). <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESortan_7006.html" title="User:Sortan">Sortan</a> 16:57, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

However, we ask that if you do so then you do not edit Wikipedia until the matter of law is settled, one way or the other, to ensure that all legal processes happen via proper legal channels. If you do decide to proceed with legal action, you should deal with it privately with the user by e-mail. Do not thrash out the issue in a Wikipedia forum or talk page; you may find that other users take the side of the other party. (Would you really want to sue a group of users if that happened?)

You cannot source your false claims that I a Rastafarian. Please stop inventing things about me that are not true. We are talking specifically about signed comments and the sentence Cogniotion points out I edited was not a signed comment whereas he completely altered my signed comment, see the diff above.

<p>It may be POV (and I am trying to include it to counter the opposite POV, hence creating an NPOV page, real POV would have been removing <b>the abuse of which has been linked by blatant assertion to memory loss and schizophrenia</b> which Cognition had more provocatively put in as an unqualified statement about marijuana and then replaced it with my statement instead of adding mine as a comntradictory countwer statement) but I strongly disagree that it is factually incorrect, and I have no shame in expressing such an opinion as factually based (see some of the cannabis pages which I do edit regularly and whre a discussion of this nature reallky belongs). My contribs speak for themselves regarding my focus on this encyclopedia which is on editing main space articles. I just don't like to see my comments removed, having updated them the other day. My putting a POV comment elsewhere in the drug free page was no justification for that. I have no wish to see Cognition blocked but I did want him to stop removuing my signed comment and writing about the case here did indeed do that so I for one am satisfied with the outcome, and there is a heralthy discussion on the talk page. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 23:33, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

I replied that, yes, jguk has done so in the past. How do infer from that context that I in any way shape or form implied that Chooserr is jguk?

<dd>Clearly you did not mean it. However, undoubtedly it is possible to infer that meaning.

<dd>Oh good. That's the highest compliment you can give to someone comtemplating the law. I have said all along that I don't see you having accused jguk and Chooserr of being one and the same. The discussion was about Chooserr and people using sockpuppets, whereupon you brought up jguk. I can see why you did, but you can also see how that could raise thoughts, I hope? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 23:29, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you'd make a terrific lawyer. You certainly spend enough time trying to defend jguk and attacking those he disagrees with&#160;:) The discussion was most certainly not about Chooserr (if you'd read the <b>heading</b> and the <b>first post</b> you'd see that they referenced only about jguk). <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">User:Jkelly</a> was the first to bring up another ip address, and I actually stated the in my opinion it was <b>not</b> jguk.

<p>While Jguk has been testing the boundaries of the remedies in other ways (e.g. removing C.E. or the phrase "Common Era" from articles), there is no indication that Chooserr (or his many sockpuppets) are Jguk, nor do I believe they are Jguk.

<p>What should be done about User:Paranoid Pete? Other than creating a nonsense article earlier today which has been deleted, and an edit to his talk page, he has only edited the Sandbox, but his contributions there are very strange. He seems to be using the Sandbox as a place to write whatever he wants. I have asked him to stop adding nonsense on his talk page and someone else has as well, but he has not responded. Should he be left alone as long as he is on the Sandbox, or should something else be done? <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">Academic Challenger</a> 01:50, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Apologies for not logging in, I'm in a hurry. But I don't find it surprising he's disagreeing with the arbcom, his probation didn't say anything about that.

Honestly, at this point, I just would like to see a short block as maybe a wake up call so he can change his ways. Because right now, it's the same old stuff with him. He doesn't take any responsibility for his actions. And for Price-Anderson, he entered right in the middle of an edit war and joined it despite the fact that he was warned about it. And now he's doing his usual thing of claiming that the other side is doing massive NPOV violations and that people are not being genuine...and he's also suggested a conspiracy of some sort. Same old stuff. So that's why I'd like to see a short ban here. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 14:24, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am going to float an idea, which may just be crazy (and don't be afraid to say so), but how about some form of psuedo-protection. For example, protect the GWB page, but create a GWB/temp page that is an open copy of the page and have admins frequently incorporate the useful changes into the real GWB page. This wouldn't accomplish very much (since vandals might just as well attack the temp page), but it would ensure that the main GWB page consistently presents a good face to the world.

<dd>Semi-protection as suggested above, is quite a good idea as it opens up editing to pages in more of a wiki-manner to pages that were fully closed before. There's a few things to iron out, though.
<ol>
<li>A certain type of protection could give someone an advantage in an edit war. One person can be locked out with the other continuing their editing. You can punish an admin for editing a protected article during an edit war they are involved in, but it's harder to block someone for editing an article someone else protected while you were unaware.</li>
<li>The tabs still doesn't show whether an article is fully protected or just protected from moves. If we were to make more levels of protection, one need to be easily able to see how an article was protected without slugging through logs and stuff.</li>

<p>At this point, the article is protected without as much as a "protected" template. This is not acceptable. If you protect it, say it is "temporarily proctected due to vandalism". If the vandals persist, "temorarily" may mean "for a longish time", but that's still temporary. It's just Wikipedia as usual. I agree with permanent protection of the Main Page, since that's a special case, but there is no reason to extend this to individual articles. so, "hell, no", from me too.

<p>Brief Summary: This user, who does in fact make useful contributions to the encyclopedia, seems to enjoy stalking porn stars. By doing "research" on obscure web forums, college directories, blogs and other sites, he claims to have discerned the real identity of several porn stars whose professional work appears exclusively under a psuedonym. (For example, in the case of Tawnee Stone his primary line of evidence is a forum post where someone claims to have known her when she was a waitress at IHOP and offers a real name.) Nor does he stop at identifying a porn star's name, but proceeds to include details on their family, hometown, current place of residence, current place of employment, etc. All very stalkerish.</p>
<p>Sometime ago (see above AN/I link), it was decided this was a Bad Thing and the unverifiable information was deleted from several articles. 2004-12-29T22:45Z was well aware of this and apparently decided to see whether he could come back months later and sneak some of it in again.</p>
<p>The message I left on his talk page said I would unblock him if he promises to stop doing this. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 03:25, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mr. Bryant is not exactly innocent in this matter either. He consistently ignores Wikipedia rules regarding reverts, neutrality, and use of stage/proper names for entries. He has also in the past changed people's comments in his own discussion page to make it appear they are saying something else. He edits his discussion page so that any warnings posted by Admins are deleted (which is his right to do, but it just serves as an example). He also categorises any reverts he does as "repairing vandalism" even in situations where it is obviously NOT vandalism. He and rspw-poster have waged their personal feud on many entries. Both of them need to settle down. One only needs to look at his posting history and read his talk page history to see what exactly is going on. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a></p>

<dd>Fuck yes you overstepped. Chadbryant is vandalising user pages with his baseless sockpuppet accusations. Call me crazy but last time I checked I thought only Wikipedia administrators had the final call on that authority. How would you like it if next you logged on some crazy son of a bitch had torn up YOUR user page with something like that? This, and the fact that he's constantly abusing the Wikipedia definition of vandalism means that there is more going on here than some idiot with sockpuppets removing the sockpuppet accusations from User pages. You, as someone with the ability to block users, should have at least investigated. Sure, it's Wikipedia, with thousands of users making thousands of entries and changes on an hourly basis, but you should have at least checked around -- as it seems you have done on here. You overreacted, you didn't even bother to mark my talk page, and you are a jerk for doing so. <a href="../../../t/w/e/User%7ETwelveOfAllTrades_024a.html" title="User:TwelveOfAllTrades">TwelveOfAllTrades</a> 01:20, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This latest DinkSock has toned down his behaviour slightly, but is still deleting items from my talk page, and reverting articles to previous versions which contain multiple errors. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadbryant_f5a9.html" title="User:Chadbryant">Chadbryant</a> 21:28, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Chad, as I asked on your talk page, could you please stop using {{DinkSock}}? It serves no purpose other than to provoke your opponent. I also think your use of the term "dink" is namecalling, and it would fall under the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">no personal attacks</a> policy.

<dd>Good catch, DreamGuy. (How <i>do</i> you find all the spammers?) I'll support wholesale reversion of this guy's edits as long as he continues to add in the linkspam. If you have the time, restore any legitimate corrections he's made, if any exist. Looks like he's stopped for now; the non-uniformity of the edits leads me to believe this was not a bot. If he starts up again, he should be blocked indefinitely. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 13:28, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've got a number of low-edit articles I have no interest in on my Watchlist that I also know are high target spam space (like <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortgage.html" title="Mortgage">Mortgage</a>), as well as a few that are natural targets for spam this season (<a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>). Mainly it's just whenever I see anyone adding links that look suspicious to me I pull up their contribution history.... And I guess this guy pissed me off enough that I went through and manuaully removed the link everywhere this particular user name added it... unfortunately, as reported below, I think most of these spammers are smart enough to do it under multiple accounts and anons, and by warning a user (like I am supposed to) it just means they change identity... It'd be helpful to have spam-fighting tools and block lists for sites, though that'd just be extra overhead on the already-taxed system. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 07:27, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My goal was to try to promote our website. Believe it or not, we're trying to do something good. Celebrities are the most searched subjects on the internet; however, there's no real good site for celebrity news. Wiki... IMDB... TV.com are all good sites for finding biographies, filmographies, etc about people. But where do people get news from? If you take a minute to look over our site, you'll find that the pages that we add links to on wiki are very relevant. Sure, Wiki has a policy of not using the external links section for commercial purposes, but just about every link that you see in these "external links" sections directs one to a commerical site - imdb.com, tv.com, nfl.com, espn.com, etc. It shouldn't matter who actually posts the links; rather, the link taken down solely based on the content of the linked to site. I really did think a lot of our pages were relevant to Wiki users. For instance, if a Wiki user is looking up Paris Hilton, I'm sure that they're very interested in finding current events about her. We facilitate this. I would love to hear what you guys think. Best- jpstackmoney</p>

If you are trying to promote your website, then you are certainly nor working in the best interest of Wikipedia. IMDB, ESPN and etc. are commercial sites, but they are also proven valuable resources in their fields as agreed upon by thousands of people. If you ever get that level with your website, then other people will automatically list it and you won't have to. But you can't go ahead and try to use us to promote your site, as every webmaster out there can decide to do just the same thing with the same argument. I've seen many a page on your site now, and it doesn't strike me as a professional looking resource for valuable information so much as a blog spam bot attack trying to earn money off of Google ads that peoplpe click because they see links there to what they thought your site would have had based upon the links you had here. There's really nothing at all about your site that would make us want to link to you, and the fact that you go around linking it everywhere is more than enough for us to not want to see it anywhere. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 12:18, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that template will attract even more vandals (and more of WoW's socks). IMO the best way to deal with vandalism is to quickly revert it, block the offender and then pretend it never happened. That template will make readers think that Wikipedia has a serious problem with vandals and that this compromises the accuracy of its content.

<p>Striver has created a Template:Muslim conflicts, without any input from any other editors working on the Islam-related articles, and has applied it some fourteen articles so far. I reverted some five or so of them and then gave up in despair. Is there any way to do this as a mass reversion? The template, in my opinion, is completely useless, and the title is hopelessly vague. This is much better handled by a category tag, particularily as there are hundreds if not thousands of battles in the early Islamic expansion, not to mention the many thousands of battles that occurred in later centuries. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:02, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is hardly any real edit history there; most of the history of both pages is filled with redirecting one article to the other and back. So I don't think a merge of the histories is needed/possible/desirable. I have just "protected" the location of the article at the location with the most useful history; see the talk page. (Actually, I protected the redirect at the other location, so the article cannot be "moved" back there. It can still be edited.)

<p>I have blocked <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">User:Pigsonthewing</a> for 48 hours for violating his personal attack parole both on his talk page and in edit summaries. Specifically, in the edit summary to his addition to User talk:84.45.217.185, and for his implication that User:Evilphoenix was not acting in good faith on his talk page. This is a higher standard than I would apply to a user that is not on probation. But then, that's exactly the point of probation. In the interests of full disclosure, I will observe that I am in a (minor, low-intensity) edit war with POTW on <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Clarkson_04d7.html" title="Jeremy Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a> over the presence of an NPOV tag.

<dd>That's almost certainly the North Carolina Vandal; about twenty of those fake WoW accounts have names which echo the NCV's interests.

Currently he has one active account (User:Ahshi) making semi-legitimate edits, but remember you always can shut him down by blocking 63.19.128.0/17 (unless he is editing from a school computer, which he probably does for edits around 1500-2000 UTC). <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 00:11, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
