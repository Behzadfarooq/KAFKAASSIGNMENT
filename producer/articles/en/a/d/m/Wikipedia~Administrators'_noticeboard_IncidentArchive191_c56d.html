<p>It would seem that <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">User:Rjensen</a> has used two sock puppet accounts (<a href="../../../o/b/o/User%7EObow2003_8c92.html" title="User:Obow2003">User:Obow2003</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/z/User%7EJozil_200f.html" title="User:Jozil">User:Jozil</a>) several times in votes to create the illusion of consensus. All the edits of Obow and Jozil have been in votes in which Rjensen also voted (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AConservatism_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=101859977&amp;oldid=101757130" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AConservatism_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=101859977&amp;oldid=101757130" rel="nofollow">diff</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abraham_Lincoln&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88843782" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abraham_Lincoln&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88843782" rel="nofollow">diff</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAmerican_Revolution&amp;diff=68199855&amp;oldid=68195239" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAmerican_Revolution&amp;diff=68199855&amp;oldid=68195239" rel="nofollow">diff</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FDemocrat_Party_%28United_States%29&amp;diff=58279926&amp;oldid=58157713" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FDemocrat_Party_%28United_States%29&amp;diff=58279926&amp;oldid=58157713" rel="nofollow">diff</a> for examples), and their language and style of writing style suggests that they are the same people. Even if they are not, it is obvious that Rjensen has asked these people to vote (making the accounts meat puppets). However, it is my belief that they are all sock puppets of Rjensen. The accounts have absolutely no edits in the main space, so this is the only logical explanation. A more detailed report is filed at <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Rjensen_3e24.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Rjensen">Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Rjensen</a>, but there is a huge backlog there, so I posted here in hope of getting a quicker response. -- <a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">Ci</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">lomobile</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/i/e/User_talk%7ECielomobile_a41e.html" title="User talk:Cielomobile">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cielomobile_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cielomobile">contribs</a></sup> 06:55, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Rjensen is a problem. He tried to purge the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Ford_8fe5.html" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a> article of any association between Ford and Hitler - In the face of ALL reason and established RS-V sourcing. His justification was that he had *one* book that he thinks says everything there is to say about Hitler that didn't mention it. In fact he just tried the same edits again this week. This in spite of voluminous sourcing I found, and posted to talk. I am not the only editor of the article who opposes this revisionism, either. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 03:55, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Pro nlp editors seem to have changed tack and decided to move - remove - or delete any discussion relating to the long term goals civility. Despite encouragement by at least one admin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlanBarnet&amp;diff=102873371&amp;oldid=102872150" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlanBarnet&amp;diff=102873371&amp;oldid=102872150" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> towards NPOV summarization - domination by pro nlp editors is currently virtually absolute. Mediation by a neutral mediator seems to be more relevant - though these ANI notifications seem to at least be preventing the more basic facts from being removed from the article. The main critical views remain obscured through minimization - crowding out with non-criticisms - and selective editing. The can be fairly easy to present encyclopedically so long as editors work to summarize according to NPOV policies. It seems that the pro NLP group is strongly reluctant to allow this activity.</p>
<p>User Comaze is removing any information from his talkpage and from the NLP talkpage concerning his known COI <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AComaze&amp;diff=104531211&amp;oldid=104525560" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AComaze&amp;diff=104531211&amp;oldid=104525560" rel="nofollow">[25]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AComaze&amp;diff=104289043&amp;oldid=104288737" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AComaze&amp;diff=104289043&amp;oldid=104288737" rel="nofollow">[26]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104287606&amp;oldid=104286853" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104287606&amp;oldid=104286853" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. He also seems to be deliberately dominating the talkpage – restating other editor’s headings – accusing me of 3RR (no evidence) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlanBarnet&amp;diff=104289173&amp;oldid=104289021" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlanBarnet&amp;diff=104289173&amp;oldid=104289021" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> and again removing any goal or intention relating to solving the suppression of information issues <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104287606&amp;oldid=104286853" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104287606&amp;oldid=104286853" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. Comaze’s activities seem to me to be deliberately disruptive.</p>
<p>Comaze and user 58.178.144.161 are dominating the NLP article by removing any critical information placed there – and by restoring argumentative writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104301653&amp;oldid=104299778" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104301653&amp;oldid=104299778" rel="nofollow">[30]</a></p>
<p>In order to circumvent COI and meatpuppetry issues they are continuing to accuse me of sockpuppetry when evidence of sockpuppetry is completely absent (I am clearly working on my own and discouraging sockpuppetry – meatpuppetry – or any other such group domination behaviour). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104301653&amp;oldid=104299778" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104301653&amp;oldid=104299778" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104531663&amp;oldid=104526750" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104531663&amp;oldid=104526750" rel="nofollow">[32]</a></p>
<p>They are also resisting peer review recommendations to add images and so on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104301653&amp;oldid=104299778" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104301653&amp;oldid=104299778" rel="nofollow">[33]</a></p>
<p>They seem to be uninterested in/dismissive of getting along with editors of a different view. In the interests of encouraging discourse which enables editors of all views to get along and be civil long term I don’t suggest a community ban on Comaze or 58.178.144.161. I will apply for mediation from a neutral mediator if the dominating group are interested. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 04:30, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would give him time to correct his mistake though. I believe its important to adopt an atmosphere where editors can see sense and foster long term civility whatever the worldview or interests.

<p>Hello Comaze. I'm glad you took the opportunity to discuss. I see no reason why any editor should legitimately have any problem at all with discussing the peer review and Cleanuptaskforce recommendations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlanBarnet&amp;diff=105024965&amp;oldid=104289802" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlanBarnet&amp;diff=105024965&amp;oldid=104289802" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. I also see no reason why an editor should legitimately be worried about discussing how to edit in a way that the "various views and the subject as a whole are presented in a balanced manner and that each is summarized as if by its proponents to their best ability." according to the information suppression section of the NPOV tutorial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial#Information_suppression" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial#Information_suppression" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>.</p>
<p>You now seem to be sending mixed messages. You retracted this comment which seems to me to mean that according to you I am supposed to prove good faith before you accept a 3rd party opinion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104813072&amp;oldid=104811487" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=104813072&amp;oldid=104811487" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. Does this mean now you are assuming good faith and wish a 3rd party opinion? That would be fine with me - but I first want to give you the opportunity to show that you can be a party willing to resolve disputes without the need for outside help.</p>
<p>I am encouraging civil discourse with you and the other pro NLP editors using these ANI messages because so far they seem to be doing some good (mostly by showing that at least one editor welcomes the scrutiny of administrators on the NLP article long term). As far as I understand - admin prefer to be patient and allow disputes to resolve with the help of willing involved parties. I intend to be constructive in this way long term as long as there is no objection from admin - and I encourage other editors to do the same.</p>
<p>You and other members of the pro NLP group have accused me of sockpuppeting eg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;curid=67147&amp;diff=105025704&amp;oldid=105007809" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;curid=67147&amp;diff=105025704&amp;oldid=105007809" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> (actually only four regulars (you, 50, Doc pato, and Fainites) and only user 58 has been doing this disruptively and uncivilly on a regular basis). Here is the policy on sockpuppeting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppet" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppet" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> which shows the reasonable intention behind the sockpuppet policy. The pro NLP group may well be considered a kind of sock or meatpuppet group. But if you are willing to work with editors who have other worldviews to yourself - such as myself - without trying to dominate - disrupt - or be uncivil - and as long as you work towards NPOV policy without suppression of information or argumentative editing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;curid=67147&amp;diff=105025704&amp;oldid=105007809" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;curid=67147&amp;diff=105025704&amp;oldid=105007809" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>- then I believe administrators may be more accepting of your presence as a group with COI issues.</p>
<p>I noticed on the NLP talkpage you mention that there is now consensus on the need to summarize the research on NLP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=105031528&amp;oldid=105010814" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANeuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=105031528&amp;oldid=105010814" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>. So feel free to discuss how to summarize according to NPOV policies. Also - feel free to discuss other issues relating to peer review - Cleanuptaskforce recommendations - or solving the information suppression issues either here or on the NLP talkpage. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 07:43, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The only reason editors are careful about summarizing research or other views is because it makes the site more vulnerable to the activities of longterm abuser HeadleyDown, known for misleading summaries, false citations and false references - still a problem with sockpuppets. Full accurate quotes from researchers (nearly all of which are critical of NLP by the way) are more difficult for sockpuppets to falsify (as shown by recent attempts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96222128" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96222128" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>) because all the other editors have access to the research papers. The extension from accusations that Comaze has a COI to an accusation that anyone who thinks AlanBarnet is a sockpuppet is part of a COI 'group' is bizarre.<a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFainites_e96a.html" title="User:Fainites">Fainites</a> 17:45, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cyde, there's no need for straw men here. The "Are you still beating your wife?" question only works as intended when the response is limited to one word, "Yes" or "No". In fact, a response of "I've never beat my wife. Do you have any evidence or is this completely baseless" will cause it to backfire in short order. Werdna can respond however he wants to this question, so I see little need to remove it. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChazBeckett_1565.html" title="User:ChazBeckett">ChazBeckett</a> 17:41, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This question reads to me like a distasteful attempt at poisoning the well, and an abuse of the RfA system. RfA exists solely for the community to come to the best decision about a candidate. It is not a place to get your kicks in. To that end, if you disagree with someone, make a dispassionate remark to that effect. If you truly have a question that you need answered before you can know whether you will support, ask it reasonably. If it's a damning supposition that you found with a Google search, but you still, for some reason, feel you <i>must</i> ask it, use some tact and ask by email or talk page. Posting unqualified speculation at the top of an RFA i the kind of thing you do if you want to derail an RFA, not decide where you stand, and it's the tacit acceptance of such behavior because commenters should be free to say or ask whatever hurtful things they want without challenging that's kind thing that makes RfA such an unnecessarily stressful and nasty place sometimes. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 22:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>For the record, Phil reverted <i>five</i> times (twice via administrative rollback). I was in the process of typing a 3RR report when he blocked me (one of the editors with whom he was engaged in the dispute).<br />
I suggest that Phil's block be extended slightly (not as a punitive measure, but to prevent him from causing further disruption at the RfA before it closes). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 23:09, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not happy with some aspects of Philwelch's behavior, including his quickness to block and the wording of the block summary, but would support unblocking him now to participate in this discussion given that he has now promised at <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">User talk:Philwelch</a> not to further edit Werdna's RfA. As a process point, David Levy's observation about five reverts may be true, but when there is an active discussion underway at ANI, I submit that any related issue should be brought that that discussion, rather than somewhere like 3RR where it may come before someone who is unfamiliar with the overall controversy. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:17, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Clearly, "accusations of impropriety" should be based upon a user's edits and linked to as such.

<dd>2. Yes, it's possible that the logs were forged. No one has claimed otherwise.</dd>
<dd>3. Firstly, I don't assume good faith on the part of the ED people, but that doesn't automatically mean that the log is inauthentic. Secondly, I <i>do</i> assume good faith on the part of Werdna.

<dd>1. I can't get inside Konstable's head, but I see no evidence of a "vindictive character assassination." Konstable clearly and unambiguously noted that this may have been a case of impersonation.</dd>
<dd>2. The log appears authentic because it contains very specific information (including technical specifications) to which few people are privy. Nonetheless, it may have been altered or fabricated in its entirety. Konstable didn't even imply otherwise. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 01:27, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lots of people seem to be laboring under this misconception that this was a good faith editing dispute. The "question" was completely out of line. Posting it on the RFA is, as Dmcdevit noted, an attempt at poisoning the well. If we can just post <b>completely unsubstantiated accusations</b> on RFAs as "questions" and demand candidates to answer them, and leave those questions visible on the RFA while voting is ongoing, the entire process is invalidated. Posting the question in the first place was so incredibly disruptive that keeping it off the page is a justifiable use of administrative privileges, no different from reverting libelous article content. I did what I considered necessary and proper to protect the RFA process, and used my administrative powers for the betterment of the project. I don't apologize for being extraordinarily bold in doing so. My persistence and dedication to the project are limited, however, which is why I dropped the issue and was reluctant to post this full explanation. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> 23:45, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, this was not an "accusation," nor was it pulled out of thin air. While the website in question is far from the most reliable, the log appears to authentic. Nonetheless, Konstable didn't claim that it is. Konstable calmly and politely inquired as to its accuracy (while explicitly noting that it might be a case of impersonation).</dd>
<dd>Regardless, you blocked me (an editor with whom you were engaged in an editing dispute) for "trolling." You know darn well that even if I was wrong (which I obviously dispute), I honestly believed that I was right and was acting in good faith. To block me was an egregious policy violation. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 00:23, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be more accurate to say that I blocked you for disrupting and tampering with the RFA process. As the question was written when I saw it, the accusation was completely unsubstantiated. It apparently could not be substantiated without linking to Encyclopedia Dramatica, which is apparently disallowed. Either way, either an unsubstantiated or poorly-sourced accusation of making certain remarks on IRC has no place in RFA. And it was an accusation, followed by a demand to confirm or deny it. It's inconceivable to me that intelligent people would not understand this. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> 00:43, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well in this case the stout monk, rather than taking you aside for words, has protected your userpage which is more or less the same. But that's really a touch of colour to sell the analogy; the point of making the analogy in the first place was to illustrate that if you consider certain Wikipedia policies to be broken, by all means "expose the matter reasonably". Just don't get contumacious, and furthermore, don't get indignant when people take the contumaciousness poorly. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 09:10, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Point taken. Again, I underestimated some people's ability to detect sarcasm, and the blame for that rests solely on my shoulders. I obviously need to keep in mind that comments are easily misunderstood. Despite this, I think having templates placed on my page for personal attack, 3RR, etc. amounted to bullying by an out of line editor, and having the page locked was a bit draconian. - <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWeniWidiWiki_b655.html" title="User:WeniWidiWiki">WeniWidiWiki</a> 17:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Would someone review his over-zealous attitude to image removal from articles, please? His Talk page indicates just how much bad feeling he's stirring up. Instead of the normal process of tagging an image as fair-use that could (in some bizarre Wikipedia use of "could") be replaced by a GDFL image, and placing a tag at articles where it's used, he simply removes the images from teh articles. He does this, indeed, even when warning templates have been placed at articles, with deadlines a week away. There is no advantage in this; Wikipedia is not in imminent danger of being sued for using fair-use images on pages about actors, singers, etc. All that he's doing is getting a lot of people very angry and frustrated.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting that he stop his no-doubt valuable work in stripping the encyclopædia of images, just that he slow down and try to apply some judgement. Hos activities no longer verge on the obsessive; they've overstepped that line. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 22:26, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You know what? I don't have a problem with him removing the fair use image.

<p>Look at <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mika_%28singer%29.html" title="Mika (singer)">Mika (singer)</a>, for example. As I said at the beginning, I was expecting a list of things that he's done of which people approve; that's irrelevant to my point.</p>
<p>I might add that this tosh about an image's being repleacable by a GFDL image really needs to be reflected upon. First, artists and their PR companies put out images to be used by magazines, Websites, etc., in order to illustrate and identify the people involved. We've got terribly neurotic about using them in the way that they're specifically intended to be used — not because our use is improper, but because someobody else who uses our material might misuse them. Frankly, that's their responsibility, not ours. Secondly, the claim that an image mustn't be used merely to identify the subject of the article: why on Earth not? That's the point of most images of people in most reference works. Thirdly, the idea that a fair-use image can be replaced; who says? It can only be replaced if somone editing Wikipedia has taken or is able to take such a photo. Who is in a position to know that? The person going round Wikipedia removing fair-use images from articles, or the editors themselves? This is a use of "can" that's peculiar to Wikipdia, so far I'm aware, and it's irritatingly inaccurate.</p>
<p>In addition, the fact that people are allowed to up-load fair-use images, and even provided with a licensing template specifically for such images, only to see their work undone on the basis that they were wrong to up-load them in the first place isn't winning Wikipedia any friends.</p>
<p>Still, that's all beside my main point. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 13:13, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a>, in reference to your comment--obviously you think your way is the only way, and anyone elses does not matter and does not count. With that attitude, I think it violates working out to an argreement. I already stated why I believe the P-51 photograph should be left. The context of the subject matter. Is the P-51 used in airshows? Sure, but when was it made and when did it see military action for what it was designed to do? Used a military fighting aircraft in the skies of World War II, not paraded as an antique relic of a goneby era. Obviously you tend to think this matter is a closed and done deal discussion. Since you decided to change the photograph with a disucssion or dialogue of the matter, and the excuse that the photograph that was previously on the page was of "poor" quality. Is a poor judgement and reason for changing it. So who is right? Obivously you think you are, and vice versa.</p>
<p>In reference to the B-36 photograph, I've already made comments on the dicusssion page. Just a FYI, the United States Air Force owns and operates that museum. The photograph I provided is of better quality and better representation of the aircraft in lieu of <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerd_6b4d.html" title="User:Rogerd">Rogerd's</a> photograph which he provided.<br />
1. The image is at an angle<br />
2. There is a spectator of the musem in the image<br />
3. The quality of the photograph is poorer than the one I supplied and<br />
4. The photograph I provide shows much more of the aircraft versus what he supplied which mainly focuses on the fuslage and not the entire subject matter<br /></p>
<p>Again, this beckons back to the original problem...who is right? It's stated in the Wiki Guidelines that Wikipedia is not a democracy. -<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESignaleer_fa6e.html" title="User:Signaleer">Signaleer</a> 18:42, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Additionally, in reference to the P-51 edit, the user <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> took it upon himself to make the initial change <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=P-51_Mustang&amp;diff=103326453&amp;oldid=103321047" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=P-51_Mustang&amp;diff=103326453&amp;oldid=103321047" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=P-51_Mustang&amp;diff=103326453&amp;oldid=103321047</a> Please see this initial change of the info box image.

<dd>You're missing the point. You can argue all you want, and though WP isn't a democracy, it is consensus-driven. Other editors have weighed in on the issues you mention, and the consensus went the other way. Don't feel bad, all of us have been on the loosing side of consensus now and again. The point is to respect others, respect the consensus and get on with life. Working well with others means that sometimes you have to realize that things don't always have to be done <i>your</i> way, and you're not the only one with a valid opinion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And though you didn't mention it in this comment, I'll include this here, because it's valid for this overall discussion: Your attempt to deflect attention from your edit warring and make it look like I'm the edit warrior as you did at <a href="../../../w/o/m/Talk%7EWomen_Airforce_Service_Pilots_c1b3.html" title="Talk:Women Airforce Service Pilots">Talk:Women Airforce Service Pilots</a> is not appropriate, either. The point here isn't to win a battle, it is to conform our edits to Wikipedia policy and guidelines, and insisting on adding undocumented material and calling it "notable" flies in the face of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and then to call the editor who removes such undocumented material and "edit warrior" is, well, a sad way to try to justify yourself. If the material you've added is notable, as you said, all you have to do is document it. A brief note on <i>how</i> the pilot is notable, along with a citation, is all that's required to meet policy. And, it would have been a lot faster than all the griping. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 20:42, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The actions of Signaleer Seem to me to be escalations of conflict at every demonstrated turn. He's clearly going against the consensus of numerous editors, he has threatened editors, shown increasing incivility and probable threats, and his recent contribution to this very thread is either a <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">legal threat</a>, or a physical threat, which is probably both more severe in seriousness, and less likely to come to pass.

<li>This is <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">JzG</a>'s point of view, and not a consensus among the editors of this article. What matters, as far as writing the article on <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passive_smoking.html" title="Passive smoking">Passive smoking</a> is what the experts and public health authorities think. It appears that they overwhelmingly agree that passive smoking <b>causes</b> death. The position of the public health authorities, worldwide, is expressed in the four documents referenced in the summary of <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passive_smoking.html" title="Passive smoking">Passive smoking</a>, in particular in the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which has been adopted unanimously by the representatives of 192 countries. Article 8. of the FCTC states clearly that passive smoking "causes death, disease and disability". The US Surgeon General offical position on the subject is "Secondhand smoke exposure <b>causes</b> disease and premature death in children and adults who do not smoke." The position of the Californian Environment Protection Agency is similar. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, the world leading authority on cancer, is no less categorical: "There is sufficient evidence that involuntary smoking (exposure to secondhand or 'environmental' tobacco smoke) <b>causes</b> lung cancer in humans." We all know that lung cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, with a very poor prognosis of survival. To suppress the word "causes" is to amputate the text of a key, fundamental element and to water down or minimize the true health effect of passive smoking, as evaluated by the public health experts of the world, without any justification.<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDessources_33f6.html" title="User:Dessources">Dessources</a> 16:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It should be noted that AFD is not a vote- and the editors in question have left perfectly good and reasoned comments on the deletion discussions expressing why they beleive these articles should be deleted.

<dd>(in response to Astrotrain) If someone had pointed to reasonable precedents, then the "Delete" arguments would have held more weight.

<dd>Right... I'm not trying to beat a dead horse here, but which delete opinions contain "perfectly good and reasoned comments"?

<dd>The problem is that your argument isn't a deletion rationale... we don't do conferred notability (or non-notability) and the status or existance of other articles is no rationale for deleting or keeping this article. Either the subject meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or he does not and right now I don't really see any credible argument being made that he doesn't meet it.

I understood your previous posting to be that you did not understand the argument of memorialisation, not that it was not a good cause for deletion. I suggest that the problem that Wikipedia faces is this: that there are a series of linked articles, all of which display slight but significant bias, and which are set up and maintained by persons prepared to devote the considerable amount of time necessary to this task. I do not agree that this individual merits a dedicated page; the only significant aspect of his life was his accidental shooting by the Police, and there is nothing to stop the manner of his death being reported in a suitable article.--<a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajor_Bonkers_92c3.html" title="User:Major Bonkers">Major Bonkers</a> 20:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Normally articles like this would be nominated for speedy delete (<a href="../../../n/n/-/Template%7ENn-bio_82c9.html" title="Template:Nn-bio">nn-bio</a>). It should also be noted that Administrators recently had to speedy delete and blank a page about an alledged IRA member after Vintagekits added unsourced allegations about murder and terrorism.

<dd>I think that it is part of the same argument.

<dd>Agree- he could be mentioned in a list of People killed by the British police or something- but is not notable enough to have an article in his own right. Its not even clear if he was even in the IRA- the Telegraph says he was an IRA suspect, and there is no evidence from a reliable source if this was confirmed. The only source for being in the IRA are unrelaible Republican forums. These articles are dangerous to the credibility of Wikipedia- we've arealdy had to delete a similar article after libelous information was added by Vintagekits. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 23:07, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, the <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">User talk:Derex</a> page is being used by its user to conduct a rather bizarre personal smear campaign against myself. Whenever, I try to engage him in a discussion and respond to his accusations he deletes my posts and threatens me not to return to his talk page or else he'll have me banned. I would be happy to stay away from this individual as I very much dislike him, but he has conducted research into 6 and 7 year old posts I made on a previous website and posted them on his user page in some weird attempt to discredit my work here at Wikipedia. Frankly, I find this all rather disturbing. He is entitled to his opinions and I am entitled to mine, so long as we do not put our opinions into the articles we write. To do what he is doing smacks of McCarthism or a witch hunt and needs to be quickly knocked down and knocked down hard.

It's absolutely filled with innuendo and leading phrases. See this edit I just made for a good example. I used to think the facts were ok, but just a little overly-spun. However, I started factchecking another article by this author, and in at least 5 cases the refs did not actually say what the article said. It also has very serious WP:OR problems; it's an embarassment this made it to the main page. I think this thing needs to go before a peer review or something. Derex 23:10, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>All right, I'll respond as an admin to cut out the crickets. I can't guarantee I speak for all the others but for me, your complaint is rather hard to understand, and seems disjointed. Is your complaint that Derex posted links to articles you wrote in the past? If so, that's neither a personal attack nor a smear - it's not based on your affiliations, but your actions, and it's not exposing you to any outside persecution. Is your complaint that he is rude to you on his talk page, and deletes your posts from his talk page? Well, yes, I would say he could be more civil, but if this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Derex&amp;diff=103531369&amp;oldid=103530370" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Derex&amp;diff=103531369&amp;oldid=103530370" rel="nofollow">[76]</a> is an example of your posts that he deletes, I would have to say that your posts aren't as polite as they could be either. Is your complaint something else? Then I guess you could make it more clear. But, if I may, rather than try to get admins to hurt each other more, let me offer some unasked for advice. May I? Please? <i>Try to make peace.</i> That does not mean "I'll stay off your talk page if you stay off article X" as I think one of you wrote to the other. Instead try to make article X reflect that both views exist, and give proper references: <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. And try to keep in mind that you are both here to give the world a free encyclopedia, with no personal benefit except a nice warm glow. That's a pretty good thing, implying that you are both likely to be rather good and well meaning people, if you would just stop calling each other names. Instead, try to respect what the other is doing. The encyclopedia will actually get better if the article properly reflects both views. Honest. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 20:05, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the reply. You're missing out on a bit because Derex has a habit of deleting anything he says after the fact. Basically, my complaint is that, instead of helping to improve the article <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_United_States_campaign_finance_controversy_bed5.html" title="1996 United States campaign finance controversy">1996 United States campaign finance controversy</a>, for the last 4 months he has been obsessing about a couple posts I made at a different web site 7 years ago. He has also continuously been mischaracterizing those old posts, at one point saying I was a crazed Clinton hater who accused the president of murdering a few people. When I brought to his attention that if he actually read the posts from the other site he would have seen that I said something quite different. The fact remains, however, we are not supposed to be commenting on editors here at Wikipedia and instead are to be commenting on the edits. His continuing albeit lame attempt to smear me clearly violates Wikipedia policy. With that said, I never had any intentions on requesting him to be banned or blocked. I just want my name "Jayzel68" removed from his talk page. He can keep the links all he wants, I don't care. He should also be given a warning to remain focussed on the articles and not concern him with others' personal opinions or beliefs. Thanks again. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayzel68_b0f1.html" title="User:Jayzel68">Jayzel</a> 00:00, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Example 1 of smear</b>: "pathetic and bording (sic) on pathological obsession", strong words from someone who spends his free time researching and posting Clinton "Body Count" articles.

<dd>As an outsider to this particular dispute I must say that while there are severe <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> issues, I don't see the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">BLP</a> problem. The heading <i>The footage provides an uncensored insider's view in major mainstream mosques</i> before all of the comments strikes me as the most problematic, because it endourses the thesis of the documentary. This is an article about a documentary, not about the people who appear or are quoted in the documentary. Consequently, I would think there would be no problem with saying "<i>Undercover Mosque</i> generated controversy when it claimed Sheikh Al Faisal advocates for the killing of non-Muslims and quoted him as saying, 'You have to bomb the Indian businesses, and as for the Jews you kill them physically.'"

<dd>what do you think about the following statements: "<i>Sheikh Al Jibali advocates the beating of children</i>", "<i>Dr Bilal Philips sanctions marriage with pre-pubescent girls</i>", "<i>Sheikh Al Faisal advocates for the killing of non-Muslims</i>". these are comments which have been inserted by editors, intending thereby to summarise the quotes; and the article was declaring these analyses as factual. in my eyes, this is a clear BLP violation because it implies they are encouraging legal infringement. even then, such commentary comes across defamatory. you can't use "quotes" to justify these OR conclusions, especially when the accused are complaining about how their words have been misinterpreted. your alternative seems reasonable on the condition that the programme explicitly forwards the specific claim. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 18:44, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I would like to bring your attention to the talk page of the Azerbaijan article where several users (all of whom are probably the same person) continuously make personal attacks, even when told not to and told about Wikipedia NPA rules: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Azerbaijan#Block_Azerbaijani" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Azerbaijan#Block_Azerbaijani" rel="nofollow">[78]</a> Notice how many times I have referred them to Wikipedia rules and asked them to stop with the attacks. I suspect that one reason for the attacks is so that they can avoid discussing the main issue. Typical comments include ones such as this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Azerbaijan&amp;curid=759619&amp;diff=105155693&amp;oldid=105155165" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Azerbaijan&amp;curid=759619&amp;diff=105155693&amp;oldid=105155165" rel="nofollow">[79]</a> Also note their false accusations. Looking at my contributions, you will not find one instance of POV pushing, original research, or removal of sourced information without good reason. However, I urge you to look at the contributions of these users (who, again, are most likely the same person) and notice their editing habits. This is the third time I have had to file a report, and now I ask for some punishment for their bahaviour. Here is what Wikipedia rules say:</p>
<p><i>Although editors are encouraged to ignore or respond politely to isolated personal attacks, that should not imply that they are acceptable or without consequences. A pattern of hostility reduces the likelihood of the community assuming good faith, and can be considered disruptive editing. Users who insist on a confrontational style marked by personal attacks are likely to be handled through the dispute resolution process, possibly including the serious consequences of arbitration, and may become subject to a community ban.</i></p>
<p>Note, these attacks have been continuous, and I have tried both ignoring them and responding politely by referring them to Wikipedia rules and policies. Nothing has worked and they have shown the exact same pattern of hostility and personal attacks. <b>This is the third time I have had to post here about such personal attacks</b>. As per the paragraph above, this is disruptive editing.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 19:26, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, it is a lame thing all in. However the IP user was determined to make that statement, regardless of it having nothing to do with the article is was attached to, or having any suggestion for improvement. Article talk pages are for discussing the article and it's improvement, not for dicking around with general pontification. If the user wants to say something, and has a proposal to make then there are many places to do that productively. I only got involved in this matter after an earlier request on ANI.

<dd>Thanks Jpgordan! I am not surprised at all. But my next question is: is this actionable? He was trying to fool you guys, after all. He must have known I would have caught him out on it, so I assume he must have hoped maintenance would have deleted the report before I noticed it. But he should have also known I would have checked page history and noticed the sock anyway, so he must either be a total idiot to think I wouldn't have done that or this must be his way of saying "Hey admins, I'm a sockpuppeting vandal and I don't care who knows it!" --<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a><sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 05:46, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did look through it, twice in fact (this issue was posted here a week ago, I think), and I'm not so sure about the blocks on the IP address, or whether the comment is really so out of line. The comment is the user's personal view on whether the article is appropriate for inclusion in Wikipedia - that's a valid point for discussion, and obviously has been one in the past since the article was AfD'd. The comment is polite, to the point, and doesn't attack anyone, and I don't see it as outside of the limits placed by <a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">WP:TALK</a>.

<dd>It isn't a tenuous block as there are at least 5 editors who have agreed that it is not an acceptable thing to post.

<dd>In my opinion, the 5 of you are wrong and you should let the question stay. Also, I don't see why the anon doesn't give up and go away. Life's too short and all that. But you're within your rights to ignore his question, and he's in his rights to ask it again, all within 3RR. This is one of those occasions where (IMHO) the only sensible thing to do is say "everyone involved is displaying suboptimal behaviour", apply the rules and move on. So I'd support a block if there's a 3RR violation, but not otherwise.

<p>I was the first person to remove this user's comment (but have not removed it at all since then). To provide some context, the article in question was nominated for deletion in, what I now believe to be based on activity of the nominator since, bad faith. The votes for deletion were not grounded in policy, and there was no consensus to delete, yet the AfD was closed as delete anyway (and the closing message made it clear that the admin didn't think there was consensus, either, but...). The deletion went up on DRV and the consensus was overwhelmingly in favor of overturning. Following the restoration of the article, a lengthy thread appeared on the talk page denouncing the article, talking about religion and censorship and how Jesus would never have engaged in ass to mouth (no shit?), etc. I removed that entire thread (with no complaints). Nearly immediately afterward, this comment appeared. While significantly more polite than the first comment, my gut instinct was that this was the same user attempting to start another flamewar in a way that wouldn't be immediately deleted, so I removed it.</p>
<p>I'm more liberal in removing content from talk pages than most. I realize some disagree with this attitude, but if a particular thread or comment is not actually constructively related to writing the article in question, then I'll remove it per <a href="../../../r/t/p/WP%7ERTP_e98e.html" title="WP:RTP">WP:RTP</a>. Again, I realize that some disagree with this. Hindsight being what it is, I certainly wish that I had left the comment alone rather than starting this ridiculous edit war.</p>
<p>However, I do firmly believe that this user is not in any way attempting to contribute constructively to Wikipedia and rather is editing <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disruptively to make a point</a>. I, and many other users, have attempted to engage the user in discussion on his/her talk page to determine what he/she thinks could enhance the article or Wikipedia in general, and have been entirely ignored each time without fail with the user insisting that he/she has the right to say whatever they want because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a> (and attempted to evade their block for 3RR but found themselves unable).

<p>Deathrocker continued the personal attacks while blocked on his user discussion page. That page has been protected for 48 hours. Any further violations should result in a much longer block, in my opinion. This person has 20 blocks (some of which are extensions) in just a little over a year. Clearly a problem editor and perhaps some time away from the Wikipedia may be beneficial. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 05:33, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
