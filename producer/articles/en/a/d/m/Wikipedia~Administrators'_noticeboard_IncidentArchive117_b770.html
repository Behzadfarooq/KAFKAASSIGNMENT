<dd>I have read the way Ip adresses work on AOL, but still, This adress repeatedly blanks pages, and I have yet to see a constructive edit. If someone has a problem with it, they can create an account. If there was a reason to believe that this IP was helping Wikipedia, I wouldnt request this, but within an hour yesterday, they blanked the same page 5 times, in 2 waves. Once 3 times in 30 minnutes, then waited a few minnutes, then continued to blank it. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalse_Prophet_d778.html" title="User:False Prophet">False Prophet</a> 23:40, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But that's the problem - they can't just create an account&#160;:) Logged in users will still be hit by AOL IP blocks (at least under the current blocking system, see <a href="../../../b/p/p/WP%7EBPP_ddbe.html" title="WP:BPP">WP:BPP</a>). We can't say that IP isn't "helping Wikipedia" because that IP changes ownership every few minutes. That's the big problem with AOL and their proxy system - no one can be held accountable for their edits (even more so than regular anon edits). <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornhj_aa00.html" title="User:Bornhj"><font color="#336699">--<b>james</b></font></a> <sub><font color="green">// bornhj</font> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBornhj_2497.html" title="User talk:Bornhj">(talk)</a></sub> 02:32, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I don't think Mo-Al should have to put up with that, so I've semiprotected his talk. Mo-Al, please let me know if the person migrates to your userpage (very common move in my experience), then I'll protect that as well. I don't care about most kinds of vandalism to my pages—least of all a blanking—but if some particular kind of idiocy starts to get to me, then I sprotect for a few days. (That reminds me, time to unprotect my pages.) Admins can do that, and a regular user should get to make the same call.

I have all ready voiced my opinion on <a href="../../../b/p/p/WP%7EBPP_ddbe.html" title="WP:BPP">WP:BPP</a>. It isnt like this editor is trying to hide the fact their vandalizing. Their recent edits have listed the text they replaced the article with.

<dd>An indefinite block is uncalled for, although it's fairly obvious he's evading the block right now. Frankly, I thought a month was too much, too, but that's within reason. Bazzajf has shown a complete inability to remain civil, but I don't believe he's beyond help yet, and he does have some value to the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 17:48, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think we pussy-foot around far too much with people who are consistently and unrepentantly grossly offensive to others. I've blocked the IP address for a month too, since it only ever seems to have been used by him. This is his sixth or seventh block for edit warring or personal abuse (depending on whether you count the penultimate one) in the month he's been here. The last time he was blocked for personal attacks it was for a week, I don't see that a month is at all excessive as a further step. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 20:04, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey George, I was pleased to see you talking about me like this. Now that my block is up, I just want to tell you, that you are the most civil admin, an example for all editors, calling me "peevish person", and I wanted to say I am sorry I tried to be clever. Using the same way of argumenting like Mark used when he blocked me (check yourself) you are telling that I am stupid, right? I shouldn't have tried to be clever, my bad, I will never try again. And.. yup.. many thanks for the belly flop story, that also made me happy. How is that that <b>you</b> can be uncivil and call people "trying to be clever" and you don't get blocked?</dd>

<p>I think the block is ridiculous. Calling someone an "edit warrior" gets you blocked for three days? Bizarre.

<dd>You sound just like Alienus. Will made it quite clear that it is the pattern of incivility, not that one incident that resulted in the block. Alienus's constant pattern of incivility and then claims that the rest of the project just isn't assuming good faith at his behavior was likely to exhaust the patience of the community sooner or later. As for the conspiracy against him, yes, there is a conspiracy here against uncivil users, and he is one of them. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:47, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That one incident <i>is</i> what resulted in the block. Yes, context was also cited, but not explicitly - it's all rather vague. There are a number of warnings and overturned blocks for trivial or nonexistant offences on his talk page. Not much substance there, just a lot of hot air.</dd>
<dd>I sound just like Alienus? What's that supposed to mean? Is that a <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passive_aggresive.html" title="Passive aggresive">passive aggresive</a> personal attack?</dd>
<dd>Considering you and Lar were recently involved in an altercation with Alienus, no wonder this appears to be personal. Your posting here to vehemently defend a ridiculous block certainly affirms such an impression.</dd>
<dd>You say you are against users whom you consider uncivil (rather than incivility itself), and that Alienus is one of those users. Therefore any infraction, no matter how slight, should be used to get rid of him.

From previous experience none of them have shown the impartiality or clear thinking necessary to fullfil this role in a just manner. They exacerbate situations also - but this is much more worrying as they should be examples of conduct as admins. Al is an easy target as he does say the wrong thing sometimes and has upset some powerful admins by disagreeing with them on their pet topics. I avoid conflict where I possibly can but I'm becoming increasingly convinced that this is just giving in to the "playground bullies" and a bit of digging my heels in on controversial subjects would help to remove some of the <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">systemic bias</a> that is so prevalent. Al works on the sort of subjects that get heated and to be honest the level of comment I've seen is nicer than your average political party spat. As long as it doesn't get completly out of hand a bit of "growing up" on the part of some editors wouldn't go amiss. We make a big thing of the fact that Wikipedia isn't censored for minors and then get all squeamish about words like "edit warrior". <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 20:19, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are talking about an editor here whose favourite thing is to point out how people are hypocrites, yet he is one himself. Its the hypocrrite calling the hypocrite a hypocrite, which is not terribly original. Admins are not perfect, and nowhere is that a requirement of the job or is that claimed, however, they have been around long enough to show that they make logical decisions most of the time. If they don't, so what? If their judgement is terribly off, the community will correct it and that is the exact same for regular editors. I am really sick of the us vs. them mentality being shown here. Of course the inmates in a prison claim they are all innocent and the victims of a conspiracy and that the guards are abusing them. Never mind most of them are guilty as sin. As for "I have not been impressed with the conduct of any of the the admins that have so far commented on the block." Please show me where <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">User:sannse</a> has done anything questionable.<a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:25, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think anyone could have said it better than Sophia. There is a pattern of incivility here, that's true. But that pattern appears to be that Admins can say whatever they want and nothing is done. When an outspoken editor says one little thing that an Admin (who already has something against the editor) doesn't like, wham! Slapped with a big ol' BLOCK. This has been going on long enough, and it is about time that people start to speak up! Until recently, I, like Sophia, tried to avoid conflict. But right now, I just can't imagine letting this go. If Wikipedia is going to be worth anything in another few months, trigger-happy Admins <i>must</i> be curbed. We need more people to tell it like it is, and Alienus is being punished repeatedly for doing just that. In the past couple of weeks, my impression of Wikipedia's Administrators has been going seriously downhill. I <i>really</i> wish that someone could show me that it doesn't have to be this way, but this has not happened yet. And I am beginning to think that it never will. There are serious problems here, and one editor who sometimes gets himself into heated situations is <i>nothing</i> compared to the bigger picture. These problems really need to be addressed, before we lose our best editors.

<dd>My analogy is quite obvious for editors who don't follow the rules repeatedly, not the ones who behave. Oh noes! trigger happy admins! Oh the horror! I'm sorry but wikipedia will be the sum of human knowledge, which means that somewhere, someone else has the same knowledge as you, so I don't buy the "we are going to run off our best editors" shtick. If only one person knows something, it isn't verifiable anyway, and certainly not published. We shouldn't run off good editors, but no one here is irreplacable. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:46, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pschemp's apparent lack of concern for editors is somewhat disturbing. We are all volunteers here. We give our time freely to help build a great encyclopedia, and without us, there would be no Wikipedia. Abusing us is, in the end, only going to hurt the project. Exhibiting a disregard for issues of justice, as well as viewing editors as nothing more than knowledge-producing machines is quite troubling as well, especially coming from an Administrator who is supposed to be setting an example that the rest of us can follow. Editors, especially good ones, are valuable because they make decisions, they use their judgement to decide what knowledge should go into an article, and what should be left out. They avoid inserting POV, and they attempt to curb POV pushers who would only twist or censor an article. It seems to be these editors who often are most heavily targeted by Admins, particularly the trigger-happy, apathetic ones. I find it sad that certain Admins would exhibit inflamatory, uncivil, rude, and unsympathetic tendancies when their motives are questioned. It's true that we all make mistakes. It is a virtue, however, to be able to admit to such errors in a civil manner. I simply don't see this happening here. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomarin_f0a3.html" title="User:Romarin"><i>rom</i></a><font color="green"><i><b>a</b></i></font><a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomarin_f0a3.html" title="User:Romarin"><i>rin</i></a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/m/User_talk%7ERomarin_fbee.html" title="User talk:Romarin">[<i>talk</i> ]</a></small> 22:15, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re: <i>He doesn't say, for example, "those edits promote a certain POV", instead he says, "you're an edit warrior".</i> That's not the context at all. Alienus was discussing ideas on how to reduce edit warring on the 3RR policy talk page.</p>
<p>Since nobody appears to have examined the context, and since the context is being misrepresented by the blocking admin, here are the relevant bits:</p>
<p>Alienus:</p>

<dd><i>Jossi, if edit-warring is, as you say, a bad thing, then you should lead by example. Start by walking away from your edit war to hide all mention of the view that Objectivism is a cult.

</dl>
<p>Alienus:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Yes, and this policy is about averting edit wars, so the fact that you're an edit warrior is relevant.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Three-revert_rule&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61638388" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Three-revert_rule&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61638388" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></dd>

<p>Alienus:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Anyone taking a look at your contributions as of late will see a much clearer picture of an edit warrior. You seem eager to strike the word 'cult' from every article you touch, including the one about your Maharaji.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Anyhow, my point remains. You're here arguing about how well the rules stop edit-warring, yet you're edit-warring yourself and no rules stop you. You're an admin, so you should be an exemplar of proper behavior. Instead, you're a role model for how to succeed as an edit warrior without getting caught.

<p>So we have a user and an admin, who are both admittedly engaged in a content dispute, calling each other edit warriors. One user is blocked for three days, while the admin doesn't hear even a whisper of a complaint for engaging in the very same behaviour. It appears that the admins are held to lower standards that the inmates.</p>
<p>And is this even a personal attack? The fact is, if you are engaged in an edit war, you are a de facto edit warrior. In <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a> cases, "statements presented as fact must be false to be defamatory". <a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_807e.html" title="User:^^James^^">^^James^^</a> 17:32, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a big difference between saying, "That edit is incorrect" and "You're a liar!". One addresses the problem edit, the other is a personal attack. This is not a libel court. A personal attack may be true and still be offensive. As for Jossi's remark, I don't see it on the page as it was apparently removed. If Alienus had been as diligent about removing personal attacks then his comment wouldn't have come to my attention. Instead of withdrawing his attack, he repeated it. I don't see how I've misrepresented the matter. As I've said, the context of the block is the continuing incivility of Alienus. I'm not sure what content dispute you are referring to - the discussion was over a policy proposal. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 17:47, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Huh? Are you now claiming Alienus called someone a liar? This just muddies the waters. Please stick to the relevant facts. You misrepresented the matter when you wrote: <i>He doesn't say, for example, "those edits promote a certain POV", instead he says, "you're an edit warrior".</i> That was not the situation at all. They were having a discussion about reducing edit wars, and it had nothing to do with a POV edit. No, this isn't a libel court. But to simply state a fact, even if it reflects poorly on someone, is not a personal attack. You haven't made a case, and now you apppear to be relying wholly on some vague and unspecified "context", which could be used to justify anything. <a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_807e.html" title="User:^^James^^">^^James^^</a> 18:06, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alienus has repeatedly, both before and since his block, stated that jossi, an administrator who presumably practises TM, is a member of a cult. This is an unacceptable personal attack, at any time, on Wikipedia. After his block, I observed, catalogued and cited about half a dozen personal attacks made by Alienus <i>even while blocked for personal attacks</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=61753567&amp;oldid=61753410" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=61753567&amp;oldid=61753410" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. It was for that reason that his talk page has been protected.

<dd>I have been trying to keep silent, as Alienus is not able to respond until his/her block expire, so I would only suggest to read my interactions with Alienus in <a href="../../../a/y/n/Talk%7EAyn_Rand_7154.html#Cult_censorship" title="Talk:Ayn Rand">Talk:Ayn_Rand#Cult_censorship</a>, as well as the non-so-veiled attacks on his talk page after the block was enacted.

<dd>Tony: So now it's a shell game. If one charge doesn't stand up, simply level another... as long as Alienus gets blocked. When you treat someone blatantly unfairly, you are sure to provoke an unpleasant reaction. To then use his reaction as a new justification for the block seems disingenuous. Perhaps Alienus will wise up to this possibility. But I do think it's difficult for him to have good faith in the process when administrators are ganging up on him so vehemently on the basis of such a flimsy charge. It's only human to get a little upset.</dd>
<dd>As for the "cult" charge, Jossi states very clearly that he is a proud student of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html#_ref-84" title="Prem Rawat">Maharaji</a>. Here are some relevant tidbits from the wiki article:
<ul>
<li>"a number of ex-members became critics of the movement, attacking it with charges of brainwashing and mind control"</li>
<li>"In the aftermath of Jonestown, Mishler and Hand felt compelled to warn of similarities between Guru Maharaj Ji and Jim Jones. They claimed the potential for another Jonestown existed in the Divine Light Mission because the most fanatic followers of Maharaj Ji would not question even the craziest commands..."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If wikipedia describes this religious movement as a cult, if reputable sources describe it as a cult, why is it wrong for Alienus describe it as a cult? This is what their edit war was about apparently: Jossi removing or hiding "cult" references. <a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_807e.html" title="User:^^James^^">^^James^^</a> 19:03, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>James, there is no dispute that some critical ex-followers have leveled accusations of cultism agaist Maharaji. But that is very different from a fellow editor calling you one. It is unnecessary. It creates animosity and it is by all measures a personal attack: "<i>Racial, sexual, homophobic, ageist, religious or ethnic epithets directed against another contributor. (Disagreement over what constitutes a religion, race, sexual preference, or ethnicity is not a legitimate excuse</i>). Do you believe that it is OK to use pejoratively your sexual, religious, sexual preference or any other personal affiliation, as a way to make your point in content disputes? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 19:20, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That happens all the time on wikipedia. You happen to be a student of Maharaji, a cult leader according to some. And the edit war you were involved in had to do with you removing "cult" references. So his statement is both arguably accurate, and relevant. Yeah, Alienus can make snarky comments at times. But the point is that he is being held to impossibly high standards, standards not even expected of admins, who merely get a mild "that's not helpful" in response to far more blatant and mean spirited ridicule, here in this very thread! The fact is, admins are now left splitting hairs in an effort to maintain some semblance of justification for this block. Remove it, show some good faith, and perhaps Alienus will be less snarky in the future. <a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_807e.html" title="User:^^James^^">^^James^^</a> 20:11, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You have been blocked for it before repeatedly, and I will block you again if necessary." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=58978947&amp;oldid=58975191" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alienus&amp;diff=58978947&amp;oldid=58975191" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>.

<p>There is a question that several editors have asked that has so far gone un-answered. Alienus and jossi <i>both</i> called the other an edit warrior. Alienus has been blocked; <i>nothing</i> has happened to jossi. It appears as though jossi is trying to help at this point, and I am sure that is greatly appreciated by many. However, the point remains that there was incivility attributed to both parties, and only one is being punished. Please, please will someone just answer the simple question of <i>why?</i> I understand that Alienus is also being charged with multiple incivilities; fine, but that's not the point here, so please don't just come back (like many have so far) with that statement. This is about one instance, and there is one legitimate question that (unless I missed it, in which case I am sorry) has not been answered by anyone.

<dd>In answer to your question: 1) Jossi's remark seems to be saying that the ad hominem argument of Alienus is invalid and hypocritical. 2) He seems to have realized that it was unnecessary and removed it promptly. 3) Jossi does not have a talk page full of complaints, unlike Alienus. 4) Jossi has never been blocked for anything before, unlike Alienus. 5) I sent a private note to Jossi regarding his remark, so it did generate an admin response. 6) As I explained to Alienus, the block is not a punishment. Instead it is an enforced break from Wikipedia, a "time-out" or "cooling-off period", so that Alienus can calm down. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 21:13, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Removing protection of Alienus's talk page;</li>

<dd>That's generally acceptable to me. However, since I believe that he doesn't thinks he has committed any personal attacks, a promise not to make anymore is perhaps empty.

<p>Pending an email discussion with Alienus, I have undone the original block as I do not fully agree with the reasons. From the talk page, the original reasoning for the block is that he called jossi an edit warrior which can be personal attack, but to be fair, jossi responded by suggesting he was also an edit warrior. I feel there is some major inconsistency there. However, because Alienus did call jossi a "long-time cult member", along with the consistent attacks on other admins on his talk page, something absolutely insulting and not to be tolerated, I have reblocked him for 48 hours. I realise the undoing may not sit well with some of you but I feel this is much more justified. However, if any of you think this is not reasonable, feel free to undo it. I will not argue. <b><a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch</a></b> <a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">c</a> 00:57, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm at a loss how to assess this new block - the language used above is couched in lovely PC terms but the net effect is Al has yet block in his list and is also now blocked for even longer. Can <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch</a> please confirm whether this was his intention and why he thinks any admin may be uncomfortable with him adding to Al's "crime list" and blocking him for longer than he was? Is this at all motivated by the impending Arbcom case and can I ask what happened to the RfC that should precede this move? Are we skipping the "trial" phase and fast forwarding to sentence (and execution no doubt)? <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 17:48, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Being totally ignorant of the actual facts involved in the article, I don't see how you can assert either of those are "vandalism only accounts". They've only got one contribution (repeatedly, of course) between them, and it's a content dispute, not vandalism. What's "clearly false" about what's being added? Of course, it makes sense for me to defer to you -- I assume you are knowledgeable about football players, and I am not; but I can't see how asserting that a player refuses to sing the German national anthem is "clearly false". I don't want to argue it -- I'm just talking from the point of view of an observer. The edits violate 3RR, and seem to be against consensus judging by the talk page -- are they defamatory? Are they provably wrong? If either of those, sure, they could be vandalism. Anyway, most editors deal with situations like this by asking for help rather than risk violating 3RR themselves; article RFC's and AN/I can be useful to get the attention of unbiased third parties. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 05:57, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Same old story, students from the school are adding nicknames of the headteacher, photographs of penises drawn in snow outside the school and other nonsense to the article, claiming they have a right seeing as they go to the school. It's in my watchlist so reverting vandalism isn't a problem however I have a personal interest in keeping the article clear of rubbish aside from the norm.

<dd>I've dropped a note on his talk page, and will ask him nicely to desist. Note that he is continuing to restructure the talk page into an extremely counterintuitive format, despite having 7 editors opposed to the restruturing, and not one (other than Teemu) in favour. He's being disruptive, knowingly now, and if he continues, the next step is a short block. I don't want to do that as he's plainly a good editor, and well-intentioned, but continually and unilaterally going against the wishes of his editors because 'I am right' is not acceptable. However, note that <i>editing</i> (not moving) other user's comments violates policy/guidelines. Refactoring of talk pages (when done with approval, either explicit or tacit) is not the same as editing someone's comments. But continuing to do it when he has been expressly asked to stop is disruptive. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i><b>/</b>/<b>/</b></i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 10:11, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've initiated a request for comment relating to Teemu's activities on the <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> talk page, here at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Teemu_Ruskeep%C3%A4%C3%A4_d514.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Teemu Ruskeepää">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Teemu Ruskeepää</a>. Teemu has been given many opportunities to acknowledge that both his talk page restructuring and additional lengthy polls do not have consensus. Each request seems to expand the resistance. The talk page is now dominated by his activity - and related fluff - to the detriment of any progress.

<li>I know the block was a bad move, but I'd been doing a mad run to get an admin to act and all the while the editor continued to revert changes to bad versions. As for the revert you cite, that's a more than legitimate edit, but maybe not rollback-worthy. Sjakkalle, with the user now blocked for 24 hours, do the articles still need to be protected? The revert war only existed between him and me, and I'm not going to make any changes other than to restore the correct version on Oprah and hope this dies away. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harr</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">o</font></a><b><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarro5_1808.html" title="User talk:Harro5">5</a></b> 10:33, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because he is disruptive, sneaky, amends articles subtly using a multitude of sock puppets to adhere to his POV, and then, when he doesn't get his own way, descends into tirades of hysterical abuse in language that would make a pimp blush. He has been particularly vile when 'communicating' with female editors. Amorrow is a poisonous troll. And keeping him at arm's length - which is all we can do until someone has a real word with AT&amp;T to get him kicked from their service - benefits the encyclopaedia by making participation a lot less painful and frustrating for everyone else.

<p>OK, let's just look at that last little update that happened:</p>
<p>67.121.147.25 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.121.147.25.html" title="User talk:67.121.147.25">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.121.147.25_77c4.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.121.147.25">contribs</a>)</p>
<p>Go to the talk page and click on the RWHOIS America link:</p>
<p><a href="http://ws.arin.net/whois/?queryinput=67.121.147.25" class="external free" title="http://ws.arin.net/whois/?queryinput=67.121.147.25" rel="nofollow">http://ws.arin.net/whois/?queryinput=67.121.147.25</a></p>
<p>Fairly small range:</p>
<ul>
<li>64.175.40.0 - 64.175.43.255</li>
</ul>
<p>BUT, it seems that my circuit is also being served undocumented subnets. The only info that ARIN has about some of my previous IP's are this very course information. Note: these ranges do have some documented subsets, especially at the beginning of these ranges, but those are not the IP's that I have been served These new numbers tend to cluster at about the sizes I had before with those 71.* addresses, but now the starting numbers are all over the place:.</p>
<ul>
<li>67.112.0.0 - 67.127.255.255 (16 class B's)</li>
<li>67.182.0.0 - 67.182.63.255 (64 class C's)</li>
<li>75.0.0.0 - 75.47.255.255 (48 class B's)</li>
</ul>
<p>So maybe you can complain to AT&amp;T that they are not updating the ARIN database with every little subnetting that they are internally doing with these huge ranges they own. Those three ranges above are all huge and I am probably only being served small subsets of them, but only AT&amp;T knows the details. Maybe you should complain that they are not updating the ARIN database to your satisfaction. That is not about me, that is about AT&amp;T. If you just tell that the info is vital for your tracking needs, then they will probably do something about it. I am sure it does not really take a lot of work to update the ARIN database and, since the change was in the past month or so, maybe they have just not gotten around to doing so yet. Really, I did not change anything on my end. I am simply not being served that narrow range of 71.* addresses anymore. This is just FYI. It is about ANYBODY in the USA that uses AT&amp;T whom you might need to track. -- 75.25.183.52 23:15, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and remember to specify PPPoX in the San Francisco area, SNFC21 and PLTN13. Those are the ranges you want finer-grain and up-to-date data on at ARIN. -- 75.25.183.52 23:41, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hah, an anonymous user just informed me of this, so here I am ... Yes, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have responded to GeorgeMoney like that, but then again, he could've acted better himself, an edit summary of "rv. troll" isn't appropriate. And as for the homosexual accusations ... lighten up. As a matter of fact, I simply found it absurd that awards were being solicited for a successful RFA, when the real award is actually the new shiny admin buttons, so I went off looking on <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_Weird_pictures_1285.html" title="User:Cyde/Weird pictures">User:Cyde/Weird pictures</a> to find something surreal to turn into a "personal user award".

<p>So far as I'm aware, VandalProof does not have the ability to retrieve warnings that are not present in the current revision, and I'm not sure how one would go about developing such a "feature" without overwhelming the poor, abused servers and wasting a lot of user time. In other words, simply deleting the text of the warning should suffice, and so in the future there's really no need to request deletions of such revisions from history (in fact, I believe such deletions should be discouraged). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 02:12, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to point out that what happened, as I see it, was a miscommunication caused by parallel discussions on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WT%7ERFA_66f4.html" title="WT:RFA">WT:RFA</a> and IRC — those not on IRC, such as myself, were unaware that Danny was going to use his OFFICE prerrogative. Yes, this shouldn't happen, and this is why we should not be making Wikipedia-related decisions on IRC, but this situation was most unusual, and very grave. Danny, Lar and everybody else were only trying to find a smooth resolution to the problem, all the while showing HolyRomanEmperor, his family and, well, the whole situation itself, the due respect. It happens, and it pales in comparison to the possibility that a long-standing Wikipedian might have died. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 04:25, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like to commend you for having the decisiveness and courage to clarify something that was becoming a drawn-out confusion, where nobody knew what was going on and nobody was willing to do anything about it. That is what admins are appointed for—to take such responsibility when necessary. These are extraordinary circumstances, and I have no doubt your actions were with the best interests of wiki in mind. I find that this alone justifies them. The fact that you were acting on instructions from OFFICE means there should be no further debate involving you. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 04:28, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If this is true, and it does appear there is reason to believe so: May I be the first to suggest the typical "memorial effort" idea for this situation? That is, of granting him status as a administrator, blocking him, and subsequently having a developer acting to further prevent a login? While I don't know much at all about MediaWiki, I'd wager that there is a way via database manipulaton (such as ruining the password hash?) and that a developer would do it (or try to) if asked by Danny. --<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvillia_e750.html" title="User:Avillia"><font color="#228B22">Avillia</font></a> <a href="../../../a/v/i/User_talk%7EAvillia_20cb.html" title="User talk:Avillia"><sup><font color="#228B22">(Avillia me!)</font></sup></a> 05:16, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The not memorial policy applies to articles. That said, there should be other ways to honour one besides posthumous adminship, especially given that in life adminship is supposed to be "no big deal." <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 06:01, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well... How? Throw up a giant statue to him at Wikimania? There are limited avenues to be taken for any kind of memorial effort; Considering the repeated attempts to gain adminship, it seems like <b>a</b> option. If the option to use those administrative powers is removed, it becomes a title. A ceremonial title, and a title which quite likely will be the most fitting thing the Wikipedia community can do, whether it is for his memory, for our mourning... Whatever. --<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvillia_e750.html" title="User:Avillia">Avillia</a>14:42, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>seeing the user's history, I would have considered this a clear case for a block. This user has been skimming a permaban as a troll from the beginning, and has been all bother ever since. I'll not override your warning, but I might issue a permaban in the (likely) case that the trolling continues. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 16:14, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just posted a rather long drawl on <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">User:ARYAN818</a>'s talk page... it seems to me like he didn't quite understand what he was doing wrong, but kept getting angrier/more frustrated as people warned him.

<p>What looks like a spambot has been making numerous posts to <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Abramoff_37c3.html" title="Jack Abramoff">Jack Abramoff</a> recently, replacing an entire section with links to prescription drugs. Every edit has been from a different IP, but they all share several key features; they try and place html &lt;a href= links instead of Wikipedia links, and they generally put something about "great site!" or so forth in front of their additions. I assume that this is a bot intended to post to messageboards and guestbooks that has somehow followed a link to Wikipedia.

<p>We have a problem with <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_Apartheid_380e.html" title="Israeli Apartheid">Israeli Apartheid</a> again. As some may recall, activity on this article has generated considerable controversy. A few weeks ago, the page had to be locked for a time, and one user is banned from editing it.</p>
<p>One of the several controversial issues pending is whether the article should be moved to <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a>. There's a formal request for move poll in progress on this at <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentral_discussions_Apartheid_3261.html#Poll:_Rename_.22Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa.22_article_to_.22Allegations_of_apartheid_outside_South_Africa.22" title="Wikipedia talk:Central discussions/Apartheid">Wikipedia talk:Central discussions/Apartheid#Poll: Rename "Apartheid outside of South Africa" article to "Allegations of apartheid outside South Africa"</a> with a start date of 26 June 2006. The poll hasn't yet been closed, and no consensus has emerged.</p>
<p>Today, we have this action: <i>20:11, 4 July 2006 <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> (<a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Humus_sapiens_ea7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Humus sapiens">contribs</a>) (moved Israeli apartheid to Allegations of Israeli apartheid: NPOV title)</i>.

<dd>I've moved it back. I agree entirely that the move was out of process and improper.

I've already expressed my concerns to Humus on his talk page (see <a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html#Bantustan_again" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">User talk:Humus sapiens#Bantustan again</a>) regarding his conduct on an article linking to this one. As I said on Humus's talk page:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>You clearly have a strong POV on the issue but you as an administrator, of all people, should know by now that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>: "Wikipedia articles are not propaganda or advocacy of any kind." It's simply not our job to "refute a slanderous accusation" [as Humus claimed - CO] or for that matter to promote it. All we are here to do is to describe neutrally what others say about the issue. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#A_simple_formulation" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#A simple formulation</a> states it better than I could - "assert facts, including facts about opinions — but don't assert opinions themselves".</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>This is really basic stuff. Frankly I'm surprised and dismayed that I'm finding myself having to explain it to a fellow administrator, even a relatively new one. Wikipedia has more than enough partisan editors - as administrators, we should be pushing for objectivity, not pushing our own partisan POVs. If you hold a strong POV on an issue, that's all the more reason for consciously trying to avoid letting it colour your editing.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think some people need to take a refresher course in what the NPOV policy requires. It's not surprising that some editors might not understand the policy, but if <i>administrators</i> don't understand it (or worse, don't want to follow it) I have to question whether they should <i>be</i> administrators in the first place.

As for my "neutrality", believe it or not, I <i>am</i> genuinely neutral in this matter - I don't think the move is particularly consistent with other articles on pejorative political terms but I don't much care what the outcome is. What I <i>am</i> concerned about is an apparent attempt to short-circuit an ongoing move poll. I'd be just as concerned if the proposed move was from Allegations of Israeli apartheid to Israeli apartheid. You have one POV and other people have another.

<dd>Chris, you're moving titles and then protecting, and you opposed the move on June 26, so you're an involved editor. This situation is a farce, and has been for weeks, since a series of "apartheid" related articles were created to make a political point against Israel. The allegations of apartheid are widely and hotly disputed, and it's therefore accurate to call the article "allegations of ..." We shouldn't need polls or long drawn-out discussions, because it's a question of common sense, and I have to question the good faith of anyone who argues otherwise. This is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not a propaganda sheet, so please allow the article to be named in a way that allows the article to exist, but with a title those who oppose its existence can at least live with. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:25, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SlimVirgin, as I explained in my vote, my opposition to the move was purely because I felt it was inconsistent with the way we treat other pejorative terms, not because I have a particular POV regarding the issue. I genuinely don't have a dog in this fight - I'm a Balkanist, not a Middle Easternist. <i>Of course</i> the issue is widely and hotly disputed, and that's all the more reason for going the extra mile to find a compromise. Consider this: if you short-circuit the ongoing move poll, which has <i>not</i> found a consensus (a 16-12 vote plainly isn't a consensus), you're only going to aggrieve the opposing side and you will end up with months of arguments about "unfairness" (not from me though, because I'm not getting involved). You'd feel exactly the same way if the opposing side did the same thing to you. If you want to get over this hurdle you <i>have</i> to come up with a solution that both sides can accept. Take it to <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERFM_dd02.html" title="WP:RFM">RFM</a> if you wish. Short-circuiting a move poll, especially on such a controversial issue, is just a bad idea. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 22:38, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Shortcircuiting whatever's going on is a very good idea when it's causing as much bad feeling as this. The article must have a title that accurately reflects the situation. There is as a matter of hard, cold fact no apartheid in Israel. There is a situation that some people want to say is similar to some aspects of South African apartheid. It is an allegation, and a highly controversial one. Stop to think: why is one "side" so opposed to calling it an allegation? It seems to me that some people are simply delighted at having caused so much ill-feeling. I'm asking everyone involved in this to step back and reach a compromise: namely that the article exists (and it's not at all clear that it ought to), but that it be given a title that is more accurate and less offensive. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:03, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that there's clearly a political agenda behind it - of course there is, it's a political slogan. The term "Israeli apartheid" is used by its proponents as shorthand for "systematic racial/religious discrimination in Israel". Now, there are two separate issues here - one is what the slogan means, who uses it, where it comes from and how it is used (in other words, the <i>nature</i> of the slogan). The other is whether the slogan is in fact justified by the facts (i.e. the <i>substance</i> of the slogan). The <i>substance</i> can be dealt with in an article called Allegations of discrimination in Israel or something like that. The <i>nature</i> of the slogan can be dealt with in the existing <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> article - and is in fact already mostly tackled by that article - treated along the same lines as other political slogans (see <a href="../../../p/o/l/Category%7EPolitical_slogans_82db.html" title="Category:Political slogans">Category:Political slogans</a> for examples). Any discussion of whether the slogan is justified, other than perhaps the briefest summary of pro and con arguments, should <i>not</i> go in this article but should go to one on the issue of discrimination.</dd>

Reading what you and Humus have said about this, I get the very strong feeling that your complaint is that the slogan is offensive. Of course it is, but that's irrelevant - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not censored</a> to spare readers from "things they may consider objectionable or offensive".

My <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standing_operating_procedure.html" title="Standing operating procedure">SOP</a> in such situations is to revert to the <i>status quo ante</i> and tell the would-be movers to reach a consensus (as per <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a>) through a talk page discussion or move poll. If they continue to move the page without consensus, I revert to the <i>status quo ante</i> and protect the page to force them to discuss the issue. I would do this with almost any article, excepting those which have such problematic titles that the great majority of people would consider them unacceptable (and I've not come across many of these). It's this approach which I've followed in this instance - actively defending <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<dd>Actually, the discussion between both Grandmaster and you had little to do with the conflict about the content of the article, it was only generated noises, and relevant discussions were being lost from it, Golbez could have gone further by removing them. His implication and his reaction you are reporting, is the sort that is actually giving results. Insteed of having a politically correct administrator who will do nothing other than distributing warnings for few displaced words, he is jumping in the conflict and trying to put some orders. Chasse Golbez out from that article with imsignificances like this, and good morning the unmoderated street fighting. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 00:12, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Both he and Grandmaster were using inflammatory language, and Golbez' intervention was the only way to stop it getting out of hand. I found Golbez' comments just and moderate. Golbez has demonstrated before his tendency to be a through, proactive, and neutral moderator, so I find this accusation out of place.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 00:54, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am sorry you all feel that way. I was never uncivil nor have a breached any rules. I do not appreciate being threatened or told to shut up. As for user:Grandmaster, I have nothing against him, but he has made several attacks against me and accusations. So I can not say I appreciate the comments left by <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">user:InShaneee</a>. While I am here I must admit that the pause on the page has been lifted and results are beginning to show on the editing work and I am pleased about that and I personally thank all edits, even user:Golbez. However, I do not appreicate being told I do not like another editors or the term "budding fighting," meaning a fight that is going to develop. This is assumption and uncalled for. As for <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">User:InShaneee</a> I find it unusual that he has voiced his opinion on this as I have no involvement with him/her aside from rebutting some accusations GM has been making to him about me. Once again I have no problem against GM, but he does have some sort of a problem with me and has accused me of trolling, sockpuppeting, being another editor or actually four, being anti-Azari, and etc. I want to edit in peace and have never been inflammatory or uncivil to any user.

<p>Golbez was just trying to ease an editing dispute where these two users had gotten more than a little uncivil (<b>both</b> parties, not just the anon - comments like "You talk about the things you have no idea about" (--<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">User:Grandmaster</a>) are also unacceptable).

<p>This was my reaction to GMs uncivil behaviour;</p>
<p>Please remain civil, we want civil discourse here. I am sorry that you are getting upset, but you do not need to address others in an aggressive tone. Your comments were not civil.<b>Your statment:</b> <i>"You talk about the things you have no idea about,"</i> <b>was not civil.</b> Keep your comments directed to material or editing, not to individuals. I do not need to warn you as you already know the guide lines for orderly behaviour. I will overlook your uncivil comment and give you a warning. As for the issue; I am fully aware about the issue at hand, one can be excused for coming to the conclusion that maybe certain editors do not know what they are talking about in Wikipedia or maybe they do, but want edits in articles based on POV. <b>In practice NKOA is not a part of the Republic of Azarbaijan (Arran).</b> <b>Once agains, if you want the introduction changed GM, you must demonstate that NKOA is not an independent state (in practice), please.</b> Demonstrate it and the introduction will be changed.

<dd>While I don't have the time to pick out specific diffs, accusing users of being straight out POV editing is usually seen as uncivil. There is a difference between being incorrect and being POV-pushing. There seems to be a distinct lack of evidence on the article's talk page, so this might be the root of your problems. If you go back to the talk page and lay out your evidence (no, "everyone in the world says this" is not evidence, I mean external websites, books, etc.) without accusing other users of pushing a POV, you might get a better response. If you don't get a good response to that evidence (and you were civil in presenting it), then you're not at fault. This is (probably)) what Golbez is trying to get across.

<p>I've just spot-checked some of the IP addresses in this block -- there are probably more offenders. There are also a handful of legitimate edits from IP addresses in this block of IP addresses. The block is registered to Bell Canada's large <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_Sympatico_bf0f.html" title="Bell Sympatico">Bell Sympatico</a> operation. I get the feeling that this may be one editor with a dialup connection -- there will be a block of edits on one day from one IP address, then another day's worth of links will come from another IP address. This has been going on for over a year. Many of the links are to angelfire.com or ipfox.com URLs</p>
<p>Some pages linked to are semi-benign, others are pure commercial junk, but all are intertied and contain advertising in what appears to be a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spamdexing.html" title="Spamdexing">Spamdexing</a> scheme. (Particularly annoying is that some of the linked pages are slow to load and have mulitple pop-up ads.)</p>
<p>I have tried to revert some edits, but there are a lot of them. Here are my questions/requests/suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some way to quickly screen all 256 addresses in this block to see which have been sources of edits.</li>
<li>It would be nice to have some sort of bot that would just crawl these users' contributions and delete. There are about 75 left; if I have to, I will go through them manually.</li>
<li>Is there a way to monitor user contributions from addresses within this address block on an ongoing basis?</li>
</ol>
<p>One other observation: There was one edit from User:64.228.225.54 -- this editor cast the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_David_Kam_8561.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/David Kam">lone vote</a> for an article, David Kam, that was viewed by others as a vanity article submitted by <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianartist_0e31.html" title="User:Canadianartist">User:Canadianartist</a>. The user at 64.228.225.54 manually signed his post "[[Canadianartist]]" (forgetting the "User:"). Most of Canadianartist's edits were links to www.artsmovements.org. There may or may not be a connection between this user and the anonymous users in the 64.228.225.xxx block. These links created some heartburn at the time; see <a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimonP_Archive_2_f215.html#Art_Movements" title="User talk:SimonP/Archive 2">User talk:SimonP/Archive 2#Art Movements</a>. Kam also later resurfaces in <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Thinkism_28f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Thinkism">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Thinkism</a>. User:64.228.225.96 made several edits on David Kam's behalf in 2004.</p>

<p>The new, most pressing safety issue in the world, brought to you by Davidwikipedia (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidwikipedia_bc9d.html" title="User talk:Davidwikipedia">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Davidwikipedia_297b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Davidwikipedia">contribs</a>), who is surely not employed by Fingershield, whose spam has been removed once or twice from <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safety.html" title="Safety">Safety</a>. <i>Two articles</i> on door safety (<a href="../../../d/o/o/Door_safety.html" title="Door safety">door safety</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/o/Door_guard.html" title="Door guard">door guard</a>)? Spammed all over the project? Or am I just being paranoid?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Doors are a big safety hazard and deserve an article! I once crushed a friend's pinky finger with the hinge side of a door, I should have bought a fingershield. But alas, the current edition of the article does not have the links you spoke of and I can't buy them. <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapinmies_aa85.html" title="User:Lapinmies">Lapinmies</a> 12:32, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I would like to make a two points before people get confused: David was a former employee of Fingershield and also links were put on but they were disallowed as it was said to be a form of advertising which shocked me. However, Fingershield as a door safety product does stop finger trapping accidents in the door and i will agree with you on that point.</p>

<p>The image in question is <a href="../../../k/u/z/Image%7EKuzma.jpg_998b.html" title="Image:Kuzma.jpg">Image:Kuzma.jpg</a>. I'm not sure if that qualifies as vandalism, so I'm referring to this page. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELuka_Ja%C4%8Dov_c97d.html" title="User:Luka Jačov">User:Luka Jačov</a> removes the {{<a href="../../../p/u/i/Template%7EPUIdisputed_b6fb.html" title="Template:PUIdisputed">PUIdisputed</a>}} which says the image is listed on <a href="../../../p/o/s/Wikipedia%7EPossibly_unfree_images_5fcf.html" title="Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images">Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images</a> for some reason. It is in fact listed there, but he claims to have received a permission (he has not shown it despite my constant requests).</p>
<p>I was even blocked for 12h by <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJaranda_ee94.html" title="User:Jaranda">User:Jaranda</a> in connection to this activity of Jačov. Jaranda may have been very likely mislead by Luka Jačov. I first reported Jačov's 3RR (four reverts), then he reported me claiming I had made six reverts, when in fact they were three (this can clearly be seen), the other three he listed being other edits to the page. What's more, I wouldn't have ever made a fourth edit, because this would mean breaking the rule, and I'm perfectly aware of it.</p>
<p>In addition to this, he keeps inserting several images (Image:Pasadur.jpg and the already mentioned <a href="../../../k/u/z/Image%7EKuzma.jpg_998b.html" title="Image:Kuzma.jpg">Image:Kuzma.jpg</a>) with undetermined copyright status to the FA <a href="../../../l/a/s/Lastovo.html" title="Lastovo">Lastovo</a>. Due to copyvio issues, the article's appearance on the Main Page was postponed until they're solved, but this has proven to be very hard. Jačov claims to have received permissions (and has indeed received one for a text) and keeps inserting the photos without being able to prove them being free (presumably for now, until the licenses are shown). His attitude to copyrights can be made clear by this statement: '<a href="../../../u/v/o/User_talk%7EUvouvo_2bd8.html#Lastovo" title="User talk:Uvouvo">i come from country where we dont care about copyrights</a>'. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 16:08, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is going to vague but (and I'm clearly I'm not assuming Good faith) I need the advice of some old lags. I first encountered this user when I noticed that his userpage was full of fake awards and the like (Claim of 2,500 edits, claim of Vandalproof usage). Besides some interaction on a couple of list articles - his whole presence seems to be about promoting a barnstar award he's come up with and he's now started adding it to various category lists (which I have removed because if we allowed people to advertise their barnstar awards all over the place we would soon be in a real mess). My previous interactions with him have been frosty (it does not help that I have been systematically removing content from the French-american article he created because it seems to be mostly OR), so frankly I'm loathe to get into with him on his talkpage. What's the best way to proceed?</p>

A complaint had been registered. I was one of those involved in an edit war with him. No admin seemed to be available to deal with the situation. He reached 5 reverts with no intervention, while taunting other users that he could still keep reverting while they, obeying the rules, would not go beyond 3. To stop the situation spiralling out of control, as no other admin was available I intervened to impose a 24 hour block. I would not normally do so as I had been party to the edit war. However I believed that someone had to intervene quickly and no-one was available to. I am putting this message here to ask another admin to review my block and enable them if they wish revert it and then impose their own. As I said I would not normally do so but in this case in the absence of anyone else I felt I had to act. I would offer not to edit the page any more tonight until someone else reviews my actions, but it any case I have done 3 reverts. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></a><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:25, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
