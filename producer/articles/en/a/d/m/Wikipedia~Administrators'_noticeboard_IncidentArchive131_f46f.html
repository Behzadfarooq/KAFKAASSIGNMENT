<p>About three weeks ago Maru was blocked indefinitely by me for a fairly serious BOT useage violation. The incident was discussed here but is now archived. Maru has now requested the block be removed, which I've done, as he's given a promise <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Marudubshinki&amp;diff=70327287&amp;oldid=70119356" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Marudubshinki&amp;diff=70327287&amp;oldid=70119356" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> that he won't do it again. -- <a href="../../../i/40/n/User%7EI%40n_586b.html" title="User:I@n">I@n</a> 00:53, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This has become a most serious and depressing affair.</dd>
<dd>Quite a while ago, Maru was blocked indefinitely for continually running an unregistered bot that constantly misbehaved. He unblocked himself, claiming that the bots were shut down, then resumed running his bots that same day.</dd>
<dd>Some time later he was blocked again, for the same reason, and during the discussion around this later block it was discovered that he had previously unblocked himself on a pretext. He was then warned in the strongest of terms that he must not unblock himself. IIRC, Essjay even threatened an emergency de-sysopping.</dd>
<dd>As I@n says above, Maru has now promised not to run any unauthorised bots, and requested an unblocking.</dd>
<dd>However, now things get really sleazy. Maru has just disclosed on his user page that he sometimes uses another account, <a href="../../../r/h/w/User%7ERhwawn_f1df.html" title="User:Rhwawn">Rhwawn</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AMarudubshinki&amp;diff=70337026&amp;oldid=70336882" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AMarudubshinki&amp;diff=70337026&amp;oldid=70336882" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Nothing wrong with that, and kudos to him for making it public, except...</dd>
<dd>He created this account three days after he was blocked, and has made over 700 edits with it. If blatant evasion of a block isn't bad enough, most of Maru's edits through the Rhwawn account are unauthorised bot edits!</dd>
<dd>This has gone on too long. I am going to apply indefinite blocks to both Maru and Rhwawn, ask Essjay to look into an emergency desysopping, and request a CheckUser.</dd>

<dd>Endorse permanently banning Rhwawn as an unauthorized bot account and sockpuppet. Endorse indefinite block (in the sense of to be determined) on Maru.

<p>FYI As far as I've been able to gather (from Marudabshinki), he *is* using the pywikipediabot framework, but he's using a manual or semi-auto tool.

<dd>Um, like the original block was really dumb? I think the separate account is for when running the bot... (as long as he possibly declared it) , and requesting unblocking is always ok. Granting the request is something else.</dd>
<dd>I'm not saying that I'm nescesarily right, but it does still seem possible to assume good faith in this instance.</dd>
<dd>If Marus story is true, then perhaps we could think about desysopping someone else. There's some decent ways to determine the truth though.</dd>
<dd>We could have an admin or two unblock him, and watch him carefully for a little while. Is that ok? Worst case he messes up, and they can block him again. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 02:12, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the first case, Maru was blocked indefinitely, explicitly told not to unblock himself, and told that he would be unblocked once he agreed not to run an unauthorised bot. He unblocked himself, with edit summary "bot shut down", then started up the bot again the same day. That is unblocking on a pretext; its pretty hard to argue with that.

<dd>Blocking is a means to protect the wiki. Not a punishment. Unblock right away, but keep an eye on Marudabshinki for a while so everyone stays happy.

THey were good edits. We're supposed to judge by results, not mindlessly follow process; that's what IAR is all about, and we keep it around for a reason. Does de-sysoping, an indef blocking (with an apparent intention of making it truly indefinite and infinite) truly seem proportional to my actual offenses?

<dd>Zscout has unblocked citing "reducing duration to time served".

<li>He was blocked again because the bot was making mistakes, with the understanding that he could unblock himself if he stopped running the bot. He unblocked himself, and started running the bot again.</li>
<li>The bot was deleting pages, using Maru's sysop bit. Quoting Essjay, <i>This is greatly concerning, as the use of bots with admin privs is opposed very strongly on en.wiki (with the possible exception of Curps, though his is not without it's critics, and may or may not still be running) and by the Foundation (an adminbot on another wiki was desysopped by Anthere not too long ago).</i></li>
<li>He was blocked again with instructions <i>not</i> to unblock himself. He did anyway, and started running the bot again.</li>
<li>He was blocked a third time and told to stop running the bot.

<p>I'll let the rest of you make the decisions.

<dd>I've just come back here after an hour off-line and see the sh*t has hit the fan. I'm in total agreement with Snottygobble - I'd thought that his last block was his last chance. Maru must have been awfully close to being de-sysopped after he was exposed for unblocking himself to continue using an unauthorised admin-bot. We now find he was using a sock in order to to evade the block. I'd assumed good faith in unblocking him but clearly that was misguided - Maru was cheating his block all along.

<p>A lot of people seem to be saying that an indef block is too harsh. But I haven't heard anyone actually propose an indef block, so I'm not sure who you're arguing against. I hope you people don't think my reinstatement of I@n's block was intended to be a final solution; as I stated on Maru's talk page, I reinstated the block "while we thrash out the implications of you running unauthorised bot edits through an alternative account created to avoid an indefinite block applied for running unauthorised bot edits".</p>
<p>For the record, I also do not think Maru should be blocked indefinitely. But I am firmly opposed to him retaining his sysop flag. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 09:07, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indef block isn't appropriate given his good contributions, but unless someone is disputing the facts as laid out above, he has clearly abused the admin tools, and thus should not retain them. Just remove the problem and allow the good contributions. Then block later if it becomes becessary.

<dd>I think we should take you up on that. If you're willing to draw up the formalities for ArbCom, let it go there.

<dd>I said I'd do that <i>if there are further problems</i>. Have there been further problems? If not, I need to think and look a little more (and maybe talk to Maru a bit) before initiating a case personally; once started, they're hard to unstart.

<dd>To expand on my earlier comments: I do not think that <i>any</i> amount of quick-poll on this page is sufficient to justify the removal of privledges. Barring the making of a <a href="../../../r/e/c/WP%7ERECALL_844a.html" title="WP:RECALL">recall proposal</a> into policy, the only (normal) route to do so is through ArbCom. My statement of "support" before was based upon the presumption that a suficient such supports would give someone the stones to request opening an arbitration case. If no one else goes and does it, I'll will:
<ol>
<li>Go and confirm myself the substance of the statements above,</li>
<li>Create a scratch version of a request for arbitration in my userspace, and</li>
<li>Post a link here to allow it to be "tuned up" or "cast out" by consensus.</li>

<dd>I would say you should start the case if you think it's warranted. I think the case would be well-justified based on past actions; at the same time, confronting a valuable contributor who may now be turning over a new leaf is probably not good for the encyclopedia. So now you have why I'm not filing the ArbCom case. But, as I said, I don't think we should have an extra community discussion and a hanging committee to present the case to the ArbCom.

<p>I have drafted a RfAr statement at User:Snottygobble/Drafts/RfAr, and have advised Maru of my intention to take it to ArbCom.</p>
<p>Currently the only users listed as "involved parties" are myself and Marudubshinki. I think it is appropriate that I@n and SCZenz add themselves as involved parties and make a statement, but I won't insist. If anyone else considers themselves an involved party, now is the time to begin preparing a statement. Feel free to do so at User:Snottygobble/Drafts/RfAr if you want; just be sure to restrict your edits to your own section.</p>
<p>I have also begun gathering evidence at User:Snottygobble/Drafts/Evidence. You should feel free to add evidence there if you wish. But let's maintain a Brennemanesque insistence on neutral, verifiable facts, okay? This is not a vendetta; it is an invitation for the ArbCom to make a decision, so that we are not left to live with the consequences of a non-decision.</p>

<dd>This was merely an example of the tactics Jadger's been using against my good name for the last week or so (claiming I said something I did not and then accusing me of it on several pages).

<p>If you were truly sorry, then why have you never said so on my talk page? or anywhere else for that matter except for where you can be punished (here). it was not <i>"an example of the said tactics and not as a personal attack"</i> or else he would of stated so, and my statements on his userpage show that. As for accusing him of saying something he did not, on his userpage I cited from the talk page where he did indeed state what I was indicating.</p>
<p>I did not "understand it as such" as you can see by my statement on his talk page, (which BTW is what I have been told I have been warned for) as I am forced to tell him in the statement that his attacks on me are logical fallacies.</p>

<p>I want him warned simply for justice (or else I would ask for him to be blocked), not for a vendetta. when two people make personal attacks, they should both receive the same punishment for the same crime, or else it gives the illusion to Halibutt that he can continue to do so, which he has indeed continued to do on my talk page, now he has progressed to thinking he can order me around.</p>

<dd>Jadger, this makes no sense and is a loss of time. I asked you to remove your offensive comments. You did not and instead claimed that it's perfectly ok to accuse me of things I never said. Above you even claim that you provided a link in which I explicitly state that I <i>have been in a mood that I can revert anyone</i>, which is obviously a lie, since you did not provide any citation for that (no wonder since I neither said nor shown that anywhere - anytime). Anyway, after repeatedly asking you to stand by <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and getting nothing but further offences and accusations, I simply asked here for some intervention. You've been warned and I thought that solves the issue.</dd>
<dd>However, now it seems that this childish tit for tat is going on even further. You ask me why have I never apologized on your talk page? And why did you never state on mine that you misunderstood my comment? Anyway, if anyone believes I crossed the lines - feel free to punish me. I don't try to evade any punishment, but would like some basic respect from Jadger. That's what's lacking in his slanderous accusations and that's what sparked this entire discussion. Whether it was my fault to be offended by Jadger - I'm not sure. Whether he misunderstood my comment - I don't know. I did apologize the first second I realized he might be offended. I still await apologies for the offences Jadger has cast. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 18:30, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You asked me to remove my "offensive remarks" but I did not because I could prove that you did indeed say such things (and my remarks were thus not offensive), and I indeed did cite it on your talk page. perhaps you should stop skipping over the occasional line in paragraphs and read the whole article, rather then just what u want to see.</p>
<p>I never stated that I misunderstood your comment on my talk page because you have changed your meaning now (in order to cover your tracks), as you have done before elsewhere, and have been charged as such by others. If you were actually the <i>bigger man</i> as you pretend to be, then you would have done some actions (such as apologising) in order to end the dispute, instead of dragging it out here.</p>
<p>I am not apologizing for the "offences" i have committed because I firmly believe in what I said, and I have been punished for it by a warning which I feel is unjustified. You however have had the chance to end this by publicly apologizing to me on my talk page, which would end the "discussion" and add closure, but you have decided not to do that, instead you have decided to continue making up excuses on here in order so that you can pretend to be the victor . You will only get some "basic respect" from me when you have earned it, I have been brought up knowing that you have to earn respect, and so far you have not.</p>
<p>All Halibutt needs to do is apologize to me and admit that his statements were wrong, and this would be over, but he will not do that.</p>

<dd>You repeat that over and over again, yet you did not <i>prove</i> anything at my talk page. You did not prove that <i>I've been in the mood that I could go revert warring</i>, you did not prove that I <i>believe I could revert anyone for no apparent reason</i>, nor did you prove that <i>I think I can state anything I like and then prevent people from removing it</i>. These were your baseless accusations I asked you <b>politely</b> to remove. You denied to remove them and instead stated that it's all ok to suggest such things. It is not and you've been warned by an admin that it was not ok. I wanted that piece of filth removed as per <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, but you insisted on keeping it in, so instead I asked for some apology. And what did you do? You continued the same disruptive behaviour. Sorry, Jadger, this is just as much time I had to waste. Do not expect any more comments from me unless you apologize. I have a right to defend my good name and believe me I will.</dd>
<dd>You state above that you <i>firmly believe in what you said</i>. So you firmly believe that you know what I think, right? And that's a reason enough to state what you believe is true and then accuse me of it? I could firmly believe that deep in your heart you're a devoted Nazi, and then start casting such accusations here and there. Would that mean that it's perfectly ok to accuse you of Nazism just because <i>I believe I know what you think</i>? That's absurd and I'm not going to waste more of my time on it.

<dd>I'm glad you did that, as I was getting concerned about this account. He says he is nine, but the writing is sometimes a lot more mature than that, and on other websites, he gives different ages. He has concentrated his time here making contact with what appears to be a bunch of very young users, mostly girls or purporting to be. He said his father and aunt edited here too, and linked to two user names, one of which had made one edit, the other of which had made none, and in both cases, S-man had created their user pages. There was something decidedly ... odd, and I wasn't looking forward to trying to work out what it was. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:37, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been following most (though not all) of these users for some time. I have serious doubts that most of them are the ages they claim to be though I have been unable to come to a conclusion. I figured at least some of them may have been the ages they claimed to be. Anyway, I was uncomfortable enough to have most of them on my watchlist but apart from the occasional copyvio image upload and excessive socialising (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>), I didn't see enough for me to step in. I am concerned that the stated reason some of these users were blocked is because they are too young. My understanding is that we allow people of any age to edit the Wikipedia and simply judge them on their actions. However, it is possible the real reason for the block <b>is</b> their actions. One more note, most of these people claimed to be siblings. For this reason, a checkuser will show one group of people (six to nine users iirc) editing from the same IP. We don't generally ban for this if they really are separate people. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 00:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>However, their actions included <i>either</i> posting personally-identifying information about themselves, <i>or</i> being online child impersonators.

<dd>Wondering if anyone agrees with me on this. I think it's time to lock the user's page. It's being used to attack others and for others to attack the user. He had put up a couple of requests to go onto the suspected sockpuppet page. But it looks like he's finished now. At this point, I think it's time to lock the page and give him time to cool off before he and others make this situation even worse than it already is.

<p>In this case, it doesn't matter if it is a role account as it violates <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">WP:USERNAME</a>. We don't allow accounts that are the name of a company, as their signiture is tantamount to advertising. These names are usually blocked on sight. Spcifically here, "Accounts with usernames that advertise a particular website, company, etc. (e.g. "visit [name of url]" ) are discouraged and may be blocked." The use of this username is tantamount to advertising and has been blocked. I've blocked this account, as it has admitted to be belonging to an employee of the company. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 13:39, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>She seems to have characterised the contents of the article as libelous, but not threatened you or anyone particularly with legal action. If you read her later comments, she seems to be most interested in calling the contents libelous so that she could revert them without being affected by 3RR or other rules. In this, she is encouraged by the template at the top of the page which uses the words "Poorly sourced, potentially libellous material must be removed immediately." So I don't think this is a legal threat as such. Also note she calls herself a new user, so <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers</a>.

I changed the date format from International Dating (12 March 2004) to American Dating (March 12, 2004) in an article concerning an unambiguously American subject, and <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">an editor</a> has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Earl_Sheffield&amp;diff=70919097&amp;oldid=70866904" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Earl_Sheffield&amp;diff=70919097&amp;oldid=70866904" rel="nofollow">changed it back</a>!</p>
<p>It's not as if this user is ignorant of <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html#Date_warring" title="WP:ANI">the discussion</a> on this subject, so I'm wondering what's going on here?

<dd>The convention is to use Yankee spelling/punctuation/grammar on Yankee articles and proper spelling/punctuation/grammar on British articles and likewise on articles that would tend to derive from those linguistic origins. In this case, it's an article about an American, so the American date system is used. Note that because the dates are wikilinked, provided you have your <a href="../../../p/r/e/Special%7EPreferences_a6b2.html" title="Special:Preferences">Special:Preferences</a> set properly (see date/time) it will be rendered to you in the way you prefer. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 23:43, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Weeeellll, the American for Americans and British for Brits thing is more like a gentleman's agreement than an actual policy. Folks violate it pretty often, but the key thing is that, <i>if there is a dispute,</i> it's a guideline. People who war over orthography are pitiable to me. Warring over date formats would require an even greater bur in one's saddle. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:12, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, up to a point. What concerns me is an understandable focus by editors on editors as end users. In fact, most users of Wikipedia are readers who do not have accounts and thus do not have date preferences set. For far too many articles they see dates in the "wrong" format (and it goes beyond U.S. vs U.K.; most tof the world's nations use Inteernational Dating rather than American Dating), or worse, a confusing jumble of formats, including un-linked dates. We should be editing, not for our peers, but for the main users of the Wikipedia - the general internet public. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 06:55, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Surely everyone using the world wide web has already experienced this "confusion" and knows how to do the mental athletics necessary for converting? I don't see how this should be a big deal. Most of our users are readers, I agree, but Americans are still probably dominant among them, and, if they're not, they're close to a majority. If Americans are more insular, innocent, and possibly uneducated, then we would need to be more protective of them than other nationals, <b>if</b> we make the argument that discomfiture of the reader is a reason to change the editing rule. 12:24, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jimbo's recent comments at Wikimania about improving quality are particularly relevant here. Are we going to be happy with a slap-dash, more or less, bit of this bit of that, encyclopaedia? Or are we going to have something we can really be proud of?

<dd>With that last independent clause I disagree entirely. It is not a volunteer assembled encyclopedia if there is an editorial board enforcing style sheets. In many prestigious publications, essays submitted by scholars will have local variation (festschrifts, e.g.). Unless a person is actually <i>wrong,</i> I don't believe they should experience <i>correction,</i> and I also don't think that we will be "slapdash" by having variation in trivial matters like orthography (especially since the "American" orthographic reforms were all British reforms <i>until</i> Noah Webster made them and then suddenly were anathema) and date formats. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:37, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's unfortunate that you'd leave me a "warning" for objecting to Jumbo's changes. It's not at all clear that there's a consensus for his programmatic changes; in fact I'd say the discussion here tends toward the opinion of tolerance of different dating systems and against his unilateral Wikiwide program. There is no provision for such enforcing of uniformity in the manual of style. To be warned about this on an article on which I am the only substantive contributor, and which seems to have been chosen by Jumbo for precisely that reason, is particularly galling. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 00:55, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The question of consensus most emphatically <i>is</i> ambiguous because of the issue of quorum, which is always unsolved on Wikipedia. What tends to happen is that some of the wire-pulling topics (particularly MoS, but also images, copyright tags, etc.) grow contentious and then distasteful to the wide community. The result is that those who care, perhaps too passionately, about enforcing their will on these matters populate the discussions. If they manage to agree with each other, it's a blue moon, but it's also not representative. To some degree, the low participation rate in MoS debates is a testimony of the "no preference/no uniformity" position. The only people who will participate are interested first and foremost in a uniform presentation, so the broader question, "Should we all have to follow exactly one format?" is begged. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:05, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no consensus for Jumbo/Jtdirls actions, no matter how many times they say there is. The MoS talks about changing dates only for substantive reasons, and the idea that an article is American and therefore <i>has to</i> have a certain date format is not supported by the MoS, which speaks only about various considerations that might be made by those who write the articles, and does not envision or encourage programmatic changes simply to dates. It is precisely to prevent such arbitrary changes that the date formatting syntax and preferences were devised. It's also clear that Jtdirl's change to the article (to which I am the only substantive contributor) is <i>not</i> an improvement. As he has edited it, it is now rendered for me as "June 19 1793 – 16 February 1882" (The first date is in a format used by no one, as it has no comma.) This is <i>not</i> an improvement over "19 June 1793 – 16 February 1882", the way I wrote it and the way it's been for the past four months. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 01:22, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see no reason why Jumbo should not continue to do the valuable wiki-gnome work that he is doing in bringing date formats into consistency with each other and with our style. This has been discussed before on this very board, and it appeared clear that Jumbo was given the green light. We should accept that and move on. I've asked [User:Nunh-huh|Nunh-huh]] to drop this issue for 24 hours on a voluntary basis and then see how he feels - though he has not been receptive to the idea. I'm very reluctant to impose a block on a user with clean record, but I think it will be called for if he continues to disrupt edits that conform to good style and continues to revert pages to stylistically worse versions. Whatever he thinks of Jumbo's actions, there is never a reason (except in extreme cases involving banned users or whatever) to revert on an article on point of style to a worse version as defined by our own policies. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 01:27, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point is correct, but the main point is that it is <i>Jumbo'</i>s edits that are disruptive, and, as you have no doubt noticed by now, not universally approved of. His changing of perfectly acceptable format to one he prefers, in an article he's had nothing to do with, as part of a program to enforce style conventions that are in fact not "enforced" but merely suggested as possibilities by the style manual, is inappropriate, and certainly not supported by consensus. His choosing an article, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Earl_Sheffield_975e.html" title="Joseph Earl Sheffield">Joseph Earl Sheffield</a>, to which I was the only substantive contributor is, of course, to make a point, and not a very nice point, either. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 01:48, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hang on, isn't this just a basic edit war? Two valid formats. One is American, the other British. MoS supports both. Nunh-huh is reverting to one, and Jumbo to the other, but both are supportable by MoS. I write about British subjects, for the most part, but I use the date format that's natural to me, which is "American." I also prefer to link all dates so that monobook settings will magically make them seem natural to the reader, but we had a similar crusade against linking dates. I had to endure three or so people using -bots to unlink virtually every date, whether a person very much wanted to draw attention to it or not, and now, because they're all unlinked, we're going to get someone else changing from one acceptable format to another? Perhaps it's time for an RFC: "One format for all dates or not?" I'm not a believer in <i>either</i> format, but I have to agree that they're both acceptable, so coercing a change is at least a bit bullying. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:53, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To the extent that it's an edit war, it's one started by Jumbo who is running a jihad to change date forms. I am resisting the jihad, and agree with you that dates should basically be left as found, rather than changed in a systematic way. If you can think of some other way to discourage this jihad, I am open to suggestions. I had already suggested several times that he try to gauge the feelings of the community on his conformity program, but he decided he didn't need to do this. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 04:05, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Can we all please just get along? I'm not for one format or another, except that full dates should all be wikilinked so that they show up correctly in user preferences, and for those users who do not have prefs (which is most of the internet) the dates should be in the appropriate format for the article. Conducting edit wars on date formats as a matter of <i><b>personal</b></i> preference is just plain counterproductive. We should be working together on improving the quality of the project, and I'd like to see these sorts of issues thrashed out in the relevant MoS talk pages. My beef here is with people going around and reverting my careful changes because they think I'm on a campaign to change WP to my personal format. I'm not. I change jumbles of dates to uniform wikidates in the correct format as per the MoS. I'd like to have a lot more help in this, actually. --06:40, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's the latter part of your program (all articles <b>must</b> use the date format <i>suggested</i> by the MoS) that is controversial. There is no agreement that month, day, year <i>must</i> be used on so-called "American" articles, and no where else, and that day, month, year <i>must</i> be used everywhere else. The MoS does <i>not</i> assert that there is one "correct" format, and embarking on a program to enforce suggestions is not justified. The way we "got along" before you began your program is by leaving these things alone, and I once again suggest to you, as others have, that the way to "get along" is to stop making those changes. Change date formats only when there is a mish-mosh of styles. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 12:42, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, but <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> says that the date comes up for him in a non-standard form.

Is the problem that you are leaving out the comma? It seems to me that you have a fair bit of support for doing what you're doing, but it's hard to give you that support unless it's done properly (though why Nunh-huh couldn't have simply inserted the comma rather than reverting is mysterious to me). <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 09:34, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

The discussion thus far seems to me to indicate a far from unanimous support for the program you have embarked on. I encourage you to reconsider it. As for <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Earl_Sheffield_975e.html" title="Joseph Earl Sheffield">Joseph Earl Sheffield</a>, I wrote it, I didn't "change" it. It is you who "changed" it.

<dd>I changed a biographical article on an American so that it had wikidates in American format. That's completely in line with the letter and spirit of the MoS. If you are trying to assert some sort of ownership of an article, then please reconsider. Each edit page has a warning in bold: <b>If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.</b> My edits are in line with the MoS, which is the result of intense and detailed discussions. If you disagree with the MoS, then raise it there, please. The unpleasantness and edit warring over this issue is not something anybody should be happy with. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 23:42, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Instead of mischaracterising what I say, how about absorbing it and considering it. Your editing is not in line with the spirit of the MoS. I'm therefore doing what you should have done before embarking on your program: making a request to help gauge whether the community prefers the proposition "It is appropriate to embark upon a program to change all dates not in "American" articles to day, month, year, and all dates in "American" articles to month, day, year" over "it is not appropriate to change an article with a consistent date style merely to switch date styles from one to another". - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 00:31, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, not only is quoting Irey a legitimate part of presenting her (alleged) views; you continued to quote her in your version. The principal change that you effected was to collapse subsections into a single section (making the article somewhat harder to read). Second, if you'd tracked the actually history of the article, you would see that someone with my same ISP (unsurprisingly: me) had already made numerous changes to the “Political Views” section exactly to removed right-wing <i>spin</i>. Third, <i>as you well know</i>, many ads have used <i>selective quotation</i>. Fourth, it was <i>not</i> even just an excerpt from a pure transcription, but had been <i>tweaked</i> with such things as the (false) use of “conclude” to describe Matthews' final <i>quoted</i> remark.</dd>

However, at the same time, the original citation changed ( <a href="../../../h/u/m/Talk%7EHummer_H3_880c.html" title="Talk:Hummer H3">see the Hummer H3 talk pages</a>). <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctor_Octagon_1892.html" title="User:Doctor Octagon">Doctor Octagon's</a> other edits are very strange. <a href="../../../g/o/m/Gomco.html" title="Gomco">Gomco</a>, for example, does not manufacture a <a href="../../../g/o/m/Gomco_clamp.html" title="Gomco clamp">Gomco clamp</a> for performing circumcisions.

Though this is true, he is a sockpuppet, he has done absolutely nothing wrong since creating this account to get himself banned, plus I'm not sure that IP address should be capable of blocking with the amount of contribs it has made.

<dd>I figure since I saw Grandmasterka's message to DVDRW that I'll leave a comment too, as original blocking admin back in June. As Normy pointed out, Ozwrestle has had conflict with both himself and Moe Epsilon in the past, to the point of harassment (which was what my original indefinite block on the account was for). I'd just like to comment that DVDRW approached me for advice and I suggested a block as it's block evasion. The new account has also continued to harass Moe, so in my opinion a fully legit block. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 05:43, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As my summary indicates, I blocked this user for creating a new account to evade the outcome of his disputes in June. It was pretty obvious, after being brought to my attention, that this was the same user that was previously indef blocked for harassment.

<dd>Your comment, <i>I do not think your personal opinions are very interesting</i>, directed at the user you are complaining about, does not seem particularly civil either. While original research is not allowed on Wikipedia, no article could be written without the editors having some opinion on what should be included in the lemma, and this is what the two of you need to constructively sort out. Feel free to report any users that are being unilaterally uncivil, and they will be warned.

Lately he has started addressing me personally in response to posts I make on the Reference desks, asking me if/when I am going to 'forgive' him and 'talk to him again' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=71496686" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=71496686" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=71394994" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=71394994" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> there are more diffs but they're just a chore to find in the ref desks.</p>

<p>Maybe if you say "OK I forgive you. Please no more weird comments." after one of his ref desk asides? I wouldn't call it stalking as he didn't follow you to the ref desk-- you both have been doing more ref desk answering in recent weeks than anything else, and he seems to be enjoying the social interaction there with lots of people. There are several of us who answer lots of the same questions, and we should all be a little alarmed if it constitutes an appreciable portion of our social lives. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 02:31, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand your POV, and I'm not suggesting he's posting to the ref desks just because of me, but I'm not going to be pestered into giving him an insincere acceptance of his apology. Because that is what he is doing. I've told him several times I'm not going to have anything to do with him, and he continues to try in the most public way possible to engage me. He has never made any attempts to contact me privately, either on my userpage or through email, and the incident that got him blocked was because of a combination of his desire to make his conflict with another user as public as possible and his lack of understanding of how inappropriate his communications were. Listen, maybe it isn't stalking, and if it isn't, I don't mind nothing being done because it isn't impacting my life. But if I say 'I accept your apology, 'kissy kissy' (to quote him) 'we're friends again' (to quote him) 'sure, let's date' (to paraphrase him) just to get him to stop making unnecessary and unwanted overtures to me, that's giving in to bullying IMO. His comments to me are <i>not</i> helpful to the threads they are posted to, and they are not helping to build a better encyclopedia. I'm not asking him to be blocked or to be banned from posting to the ref desks, but I think it's not inappropriate for him to refrain from making the same personal asides to me in pretty much every thread we both post to. Also, really, the 'here is my blood' thing was really creepy. I mean, YUCK. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 02:45, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I requested formal mediation from a disinterested politically-neutral Wiki mediator days ago. I contend that the 3 active Protest Warriors, and their conservatively biased supporters have used Wikilawyering (and violations of WP) EXTENSIVELY and inconsistantly to exclude information that they consider unfavorable, and to INCLUDE info they think favorable. They even talked about it on Protest Warrior, where they discussed their sordid, unscrupulous plans to skew this article in their effort to make what many feel is a hate-filled Islamophobic organization look good. I'm new to Wiki, but learning more about WP every day. I also publicly apologized for wrongly accusing other editors of vandalism as I didn't know WP as well as I should. I EAGERLY AWAIT FORMAL MEDIATION OF THE PROTEST WARRIOR ENTRY FROM A DISINTERESTED, POLITICALLY-NEUTRAL WIKI MEDIATOR!</dd>

<p>This user (whose name stands for Neocons Be Gone Protest Warrior Sucks, by the way) came to disrupt the article. One of his first edits was to add a Nazi slogan under the "PW slogans" section. Once he learned this would get him banned, he began trying to subtily undermine the article. He has violated <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> repeatedly. He created a sockpuppet to continue an edit war after being blocked for violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. He continually makes major edits and marks them as minor. He is now reverting typo corrections by users who did not fill in the edit summaries of minor typo correcting edits. I believe he is just trying to slowly frustrate the community away so he can have his way with the article.

<dd>I believe this requires immediate intervention. As the RfC process requests not to file both ANI and RfC at the same time, we are requesting relief here first. "Exhausting the communities patience" is a legitimate reason for a block.

<p>When article <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_War_of_Independence_39e8.html" title="Croatian War of Independence">Croatian War of Independence</a> was created, there was a rather broad discussion about the name of the article (broad meaning I invited native speakers of English and people who have nothing to do with the war to help us decide which name is the best). A peaceful consensus was reached, and the article got it's current name. Several users have contested this name since, and that's just fine, there exists a procedure for such cases. What's not fine is that <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a> started doing a bunch of edits like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pag_%28town%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=71492707" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pag_%28town%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=71492707" rel="nofollow">this one</a> to bypass the discussion on <a href="../../../c/r/o/Talk%7ECroatian_War_of_Independence_f985.html" title="Talk:Croatian War of Independence">Talk:Croatian War of Independence</a> (the article is locked for moving, so he can't just move the article). I reverted his edits and warned him that I find this to be a disruption of Wikipedia. He did it again. Before any constructive discussion even started. To me, it is clear that <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a> deserves to be warned, and then blocked if he does that again after I warned him. The only problem is that I'm not NPOV. He's from <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>, I'm from <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatia.html" title="Croatia">Croatia</a>, so I'm not the best person to judge if he is to be blocked. Therefore, I ask you, fellow administrators, to voice your oppinion if you feel that <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a> should not be blocked and that what he is doing is perfectly legitimate. I will now warn the user, and if:</p>
<ul>
<li>he does the same thing again</li>
<li>no <b>admin</b> disagrees with my intention to block the guy in next 24 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>I will block him for 24 hours for disruption of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 11:23, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dijxtra, this is ridiculous, I hope that you know that blocking me would be abuse of your adminship. My edits are certainly not a "disruption of Wikipedia".

<dd>Well, the argument about "replacing a perfectly good link" might stand, thus it perhaps would be better that I replaced it with this: <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_War_of_Independence_39e8.html" title="Croatian War of Independence">war in Croatia</a> (That would not replace link, only its description). Second thing, the consensus you speak about was about name of the article itself, not about description of the link that we should use is other articles. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 14:37, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To echo what RyanGerbil said, the appropriate policy is: <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. You are attempting to push your own point of view about this matter against <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">consensus</a>. <a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> has done the right thing bringing this matter here rather than blocking you himself, since he's an interested party. However if you continue to insert your POV into articles instead of reaching consensus on the appropriate talk page its likely that a neutral admin will block you. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 13:08, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please tell me how name "war in Croatia" could be POV? It is completelly neutral name that does not imply the character of this war (Not to mention google hits with this name: <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=FP-pull-web-t&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;p=war+in+croatia" class="external free" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=FP-pull-web-t&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;p=war+in+croatia" rel="nofollow">http://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=FP-pull-web-t&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;p=war+in+croatia</a> ) It is highly disputed whether this war was a war for independence or civil war. The current title clearly propagate only one point of view and completelly ignore another. My change was simply in favor of the title that will not propagate any of these two points of view. Now, please tell me what is wrong with that? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 14:37, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>While I agree that PANONIAN is behaving wrongly, I feel that Djixtra shouldn't block him personally, for nothing good can come from such an action. I advice to inform the admins ChrisO or Jkelly or FrancisTyers, all active in the area. Believe me Dijxtra, nothing is worse for an admin than the suspect, even when utterly unjustified, of acting as part of a faction.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 13:38, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe that PANONIAN has raised what he considers perfectly valid points. Nonetheless this needs to be discussed in the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Talk%7ECroatian_War_of_Independence_f985.html" title="Talk:Croatian War of Independence">talk page</a> before going ahead with unilateral changes. I brought this to PANONIAN'S attention and he duely started a straw poll on the subject. Yes, he made a mistake and his actions could have been understood as disruption but he is a veteran user and showed the willingness to debate the issue. I have to say I am personally very discouraged by the uncivil response and namecalling that he has received from some people at the talk page. This is utterly deplorable.

<dd>Well, this is my last comment on this page, but I suggest to you all to imagine that you live in Serbia and than from that perspective to read these two articles: <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_war.html" title="Bosnian war">Bosnian war</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_War_of_Independence_39e8.html" title="Croatian War of Independence">Croatian War of Independence</a>. After reading them (starting from the title of the second one) you could not escape from the impression that these two articles are written with the single purpose to blame Serbia for everything, with no single intention to show any guilt of other side. I am not trying to say that Serb side was not guilty, but that the other sides involved in war were no angels too, despite the fact that they trying to present themselves as such. As <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewanderer_2fd1.html" title="User:Thewanderer">User:Thewanderer</a> nicely said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Croatian_War_of_Independence#Comments" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Croatian_War_of_Independence#Comments" rel="nofollow">here</a> that "the name War in Croatia (1991-1995) is an attempt to downplay the role of certain other nations in the conflict" clearly show that intention of the current name (Croatian War of Independence) is "to magnify the role of certain other nations in the conflict". Finally, I do not want to waste my time and energy on this question any more, and not only that I will not change name of this war in other articles, but I will not any more participate in any discussion anywhere about this issue. If Croatian editors wanted (with threats and sockpuppets) to remove me from this question, they succeded. I have nothing else to say. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 01:53, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Editor in question is <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikkicraft_a7ce.html" title="User:Nikkicraft">Nikkicraft</a> and I ran into her when I made a minor change on <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melissa_Farley_489c.html" title="Melissa Farley">Melissa Farley</a>. She is clearly a rather abrupt person, who holds very strong opinions and is also obviously trying to be a loyal defender of her friend and colleague, <i>(in real life she herself is Notable and has an extensive article on her activities <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikki_Craft_af1b.html" title="Nikki Craft">here</a>)</i>.</p>
<p>What I am unclear on is if she is being deliberately abusive <i>(&amp; homophobic)</i> or if she is just a newbie who is particularly clueless about what Wikipedia is <i>(IMHO it's an Encyclopedia)</i> and the difference between a User Page, a User's "My Talk" page, an Article and the Discussion Page attached to it.</p>
<p>I had tried to get an opinion on what should be done on the 20th whe my attempt to follow <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a> did not get positive results by posting to the Admin page on the 20th: 02:07, 20 August 2006 (hist) (diff) Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents (in re: article on Melissa Farley an editor seems to be a bit confused) -- but never got any reply.</p>
<p>If your opinion is that it's just life on Wikipedia and I should get over it I will bow to your superior knowledge.</p>
<p>It's just that even with other intellectually heated controversies I've been involved in when editing, nothing like THIS has ever happened to me here. This woman worries me <i>(especially give her history of violent confrontations in real life)</i>. I do not think the article is <b>at all</b> accurate, but I am now afraid to edit it since I don't want to get any more of these personal attacks and even it seems, accusations that because I'm an LGBT person that I'm somehow trying to get be inappropriately <i>"cozy"</i> with her.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Since you have just brought her new comments to my attention and reading what she has now written, I'm still not at all comfortable. Especially since she seems to be <i>"forgiving"</i> me for the insult of not agreeing with her, not passively allowing her odd behavior/remarks and also blaming me for her homophobic remarks. So I'm still and seeking guidance as to what to do. She is in real life a colleague and <i>(sometimes violent)</i> partisan of the subject of the article's philosophical movement, so I am worried.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also I really do want to know if it was it correct for her to take my enquiries from the "User Talk" page and post them onto the article discussion page with a provocative title, etc.? Should that/can that be removed?</dd>

<dd>I fail to see how her saying "I'll start out by apologizing" counts as her forgiving you. Try collaborating with the her if there are entries of interest.

<dd>Sorry, but I have to interject here. My main complaint with <a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECyntWorkStuff_cd2b.html" title="User:CyntWorkStuff">CyntWorkStuff</a> was because she has posted on several wiki pages false accusations about me. (I'll document them if anyone wants them [yawn].) And now she is posting some more here. She writes that I'm "sometimes violent" and that I have a "history of violent confrontations in real life"? This is such a lie. Ask her to document <i>one</i> instance of it. She says I've made homophobic comments? Ask her for documentation. The only thing I've <i>ever</i> said to her was I don't <i>care</i> what her sexual preference is in connection with discussions about differences on the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melissa_Farley_489c.html" title="Melissa Farley">Melissa Farley</a> page. In fact I couldn't care less. That's not homophobia and also I think it was highly inappropriate for her to even bring up her sexual preference to me in connection with editing a wiki article. --<a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikkicraft_a7ce.html" title="User:Nikkicraft">Nikkicraft</a> 09:26, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I indef-blocked Phoenix and blocked Prof. for a week for using the account to evade a block (since its first edit was made about 4 hours before Prof.'s block expired). Tyenius notified me on my talk page that I may have been incorrect about the blocks. I'm putting this up here for review by any other admins. --<a href="../../../l/b/m/User%7ELbmixpro_347b.html" title="User:Lbmixpro">LBMixPro</a> <a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>&lt;Sp</sup></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="#0c0"><sup>e</sup></font></a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>ak|</sup></a><a href="../../../c/c/d/WP%7ECCD_fd32.html" title="WP:CCD"><font color="#0cc"><sup>o</sup></font></a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>n|it!&gt;</sup></a> 23:19, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First let me say I have no criticism of Lbmixpro and have told him his actions are fine by me (he'd put this up here before I managed to type my message). If anyone's interested, it is really a technical matter. <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoenix_V_ce32.html" title="User:Phoenix V">User:Phoenix V</a> has publicly stated that he has adopted the new user name.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:LinaMishima&amp;diff=71399154&amp;oldid=71380235" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:LinaMishima&amp;diff=71399154&amp;oldid=71380235" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> He lasted edited as <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProf._MagneStormix_4e4c.html" title="User:Prof. MagneStormix">User:Prof. MagneStormix</a> on August 8. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Prof._MagneStormix" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Prof._MagneStormix" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> He began to edit as <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoenix_V_ce32.html" title="User:Phoenix V">User:Phoenix V</a> on August 9. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Phoenix_V" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Phoenix_V" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> There is no overlap between the accounts. He is entitled to edit under a new name. I suggested it might be better to delete the former account, which is now defunct, and to deal with Phoenix V for whatever sins he has committed, which as far as I can see to date are primarily leaving a nonsense message on <a href="../../../i/27/l/User_talk%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_063e.html" title="User talk:I'll bring the food">User talk:I'll bring the food</a>. When I communicated with Lbmixpro initially I hadn't noticed the evasion of 4 hours of the block (which I suspect Phoenix V may not have done deliberately but inadvertently), so it is technically the creation of a sockpuppet account to evade a block, although the user has been using it properly apart from those first 4 hours. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 23:43, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>The world of bots is a mystery to me, but I'd have <i>presumed</i> that the bot approval process was strict for a reason, contrary to Cyde's contentions in the discussion linked above. Do we generaly restrict bots to what for which they have explicit approval? If not, why not? - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 06:43, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Having just been through the approval process myself, I can report that you're right, it is strict. Furthermore, when deciding whether or not a bot should be blocked we can be much more aggressive than when deciding whether or not to block a human. If folks feel the bot isn't doing the job it's meant to, or isn't doing it well, it's perfectly appropriate to block it until the owner shows up, and I support that. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 07:12, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok. So, on RC patrol, I stumbled upon <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalistan.html" title="Khalistan">Khalistan</a>. Apparently it's an edit war heavy topic. Anyway, a user named <a href="../../../s/y/i/User%7ESyiem_29af.html" title="User:Syiem">Syiem</a> was tipping my radar. I'm a little too lazy to go back and see what it was, but he had made comments like "I will never let &lt;insert name here&gt; make edits" and other ownership style phrases. He was very definitely pushing a POV. I was about to report him for 3RR, when I noticed he had already been reported. I weighed in my two cents there, in favor of the block for 3RR. My next login, I noticed a message on my talk page, very confrontational, lots of attitude etc:</p>
<p>"Please mind your own damn business. You don't own wikipedia and niether does Zafarnamah. I will edit the article as and when I so desire and will never let Zafarnamah ruin the article with his communal, pro Khalistan edits. Regards! Syiem "</p>
<p>I responded on his talk page with this:</p>
<p>"I'm not sure what you're getting at coming to my talk page with that attitude. You are not above the policies of Wikipedia regarding the WP:3RR and WP:CIVIL. Our editing here is a privilege, not a right. You'd do well to remember that.⇒ SWATJester Ready Aim Fire! 05:09, 21 August 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>I assumed the exchange was over and nothing of it. Then, just today I notice this:</p>
<p>"Please mind your own damn business and stop behaving as if you own Wikipedia. Before referring other users of civility I suggest you have a look at it again yourself. <b>All of you a sudden you appear from your shithole and term other users' edits as Vandalism. ArjunSingh</b> 23:11, 24 August 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>It's the users only edit. My suspicion was that it was Syiem. I clicked on Syiem's user page, and noticed he'd been blocked as a sockpuppet. Now I'm not entirely sure what to do next. I suppose I could RFCU to see if ArjunSingh and Syiem are the same person. But that'd be pointless, because Syiem is already blocked. So... I thought I'd drop a note here and let you all know, should that editor make anymore abusive comments. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 05:36, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just noticed an IP edit to Image talk:CheetahGirls12345.jpg. It caught my attention because the edit summary was "Hi, Cheetah Girls", so I checked it out and noticed that two minors (one eight year old girl and one ten year old girl) were the only contributors to the image's talk page and both had revealed their addresses and first names. I blanked the talk page out of concern for their safety and was wondering if an admin could delete the page as it's unnecessary and the only information it contains is the personal information of two young girls.

<p>Hi, I just wanted someone to keep an eye on the AOL IP 205.188.116.131 - this user has made several edits with inflammatory edit summaries without clear vandalism. However, on page <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_and_American_health_care_systems_compared_eb0c.html" title="Canadian and American health care systems compared">Canadian and American health care systems compared</a> the user inserted information which broke a link. Obviously could have been an honest mistake and I left a request to be more careful on the talk page. However, given the edit summaries I have a higher than average concern that the IP is currently a vandal.

<p>The EddieSegoura vandal, editing from AOL, has become a real time-sink of late. Rather than just fighting off references to "exicornt" and bogus baseball edits, it seems like we are now spending all our time fighting over sockpuppet tags. See User:MER-C/Eddie Segoura, a new VIP-style page, which, interestingly, describes his vandalism *only* in terms of sockpuppet and impersonation tags. It also (shudder) recommends AOL rangeblocks as part of the standard strategy for handling his attacks.</p>
<p>My suggestion is going to be obvious, and obviously unpopular: let's stop tagging his indef-blocked puppets as puppets of EddieSegoura. We don't get much benefit from having the enormous, ever-growing list around; at this point, anyone involved knows "it's a very large list" and that's probably enough. I would go so far as to suggest we replace the existing sockpuppet tags with the generic indefblockeduser one. The benefit is, we will hopefully have fewer angry, concentrated attacks like those of late, and we won't have to block AOL IPs as often. The downside is that it is caving in to the desires of a banned vandal. That's a big downside. I know it. But the pages we are wasting our time on aren't part of the encyclopedia; we wouldn't be making a content-oriented compromise of any sort. Thoughts welcome. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 15:19, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I agree with Bunchofgrapes and Morven. Probably the only reason to tag socks is when they are socks of a known user and have a significant contribution history. There's no reason to tag obvious vandals of the exicornt/willy/enthusiastfrance ilk with a specific template except scorekeeping, which has no value in tracking down further vandal accounts and may lead to more vandalism (either "blank me or I'll keep doing it" or "look how many times I can get blocked". <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 18:34, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Exactly my point. A vandal creates multiple disposable accounts - many of which are blocked on creation, and some idiot goes round creating a userpage and markng it with precisely the right deadly threatening official template, then categorises the userpage and adds the account to the vandal's hall of fame. It is all just CVU-style para-law enforcement crap - one big game of soldiers for the role-playing secret agents. It serves no useful purpose, except to encourage vandals and paranoia. Block, yawn, forget (repeat the process, until they get bored). And those who want a police incident room - should go play elsewhere.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 18:35, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Or its useful for some people as not everyone is familiar with 100% of the vandals out there. Maybe not every sockpuppet needs tagged, especially for the big few, but some of the smaller-time or more unique vandals should have evidence pages and some sockpuppet links, especially if it can help establish any kind of pattern for identifying. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 18:39, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All right. I like the general debate, but I did come here with a more specific question in mind.

<dd>The only thing I see is that by him removing the puppet tags himself it identifies him very easily. its unlikely anyone else would do this.

<dd>I don't buy this 'identifying vandals' bit at all. If they vandalise deal with them, whoever they are. If not, who cares. This all smacks of an obsession with 'Wikipedia's most wanted'.

<dl>
<dd>that's your choice, but if user x vandalizes a page , we should assume good faith and give them a break. If we don't identify past vandals we never really deal with them, because first time around we should always been assuming good faith. Once a user continues behaviour, we usually ramp up the recourse for it. If a vandal is an obvious sockpuppet of known vandal Y then they should be blocked outright, we shouldn't waste our time sitting there warning them 3 or 4 times then blocking them. If eddy shows up, removes a sockpuppet label the block should go into effect immediately. If we didn't identify any vandals and someone did something that was associated with a known vandal now, but wasn't because we threw out all the files, we waste time warning people who's sole purpose is to cause trouble because we didn't keep any information on their past behaviour.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 19:29, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But if he edits in a vandal manner, someone might be more likely to assume good faith and maybe not block him outright like he should. If any vandal comes back and edits constructively thats cool with me.

<dd>So then might it not make sense to keep the record and just protect the pages? It seems your intent here is to remove these in anticipation that he's just going to do that anyway and people end up fighting over the page trying to undo his edits, etc. I guess it comes down to is there a purpose of having records or not having records and perhaps address this issue for all sockpuppets. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 19:40, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>OK, now look at my block log <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Doc+glasgow&amp;page=" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Doc+glasgow&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. See the various username blocks on willy-wanabees and other trolling usernames. Most of these were blocked with no edits. Now, someone tell me why anyone went round creating userpages for these nil-edit accounts to mark them as blocked - or to categorise them by the vandal they were/were impersonating.

<dd>I have as well wondered the same about the people that go around following after the block log and applying those tags.

<dd>So then maybe we should set a threshold, only sock puppets with more than 5 edits should have a sockpuppet tag on them?--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 19:43, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Higher than that. Pure vandal accounts should never be specially identified. Tagging should be reserved for cases where the account lasts long enough to insinuate itself into the edit history of multiple articles, or represents a known editor with a known agenda, like Lightbringer. An account with all vandal edits should not be rewarded with a specific tag no matter how many edits it manages to accumulate before it gets blocked. Giving the vandal a name and a special page either rewards or angers the vandal, neither of which has anything to do with writing an encyclopedia. (Naming the vandal also rewards the CVU which ditto.

<p>Just put Indefblocked on them all, except in very special cases. If it is needed, a page identifying behavior is fine but, for example, we don't need help identifying page moves to "...on Wheels" as being bad, it is obvious even for anyone who doesn't know there is a history associated with it, and we don't need to have special logos for each of them. It is just a waste of time. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 19:54, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Often wondered why we spend massive amounts of time with these templates. Sometimes the sockpuppet templates will be changed multiple time on accounts that I block. Seems quite pointless to me. Part of the Template for Every Occasion patrol.</dd>

<dd>The advantage for IDing is making it easier for less experienced users to understand the reason that reverts of banned user are made on articles or why articles that seem fine are deleted. IMO, posting the information on AN or AN/I does not help because it is removed. If the accounts have not edited at all them it is pointless to label them. The rest need to be dealt with on a case by case basis. In this case and many others not labeling makes good sense. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight"><font color="darkblue"><b>FloNight</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFloNight_133a.html" title="User talk:FloNight"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 20:15, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This repetitive vandalism strikes me as a modern form of arcade or video games, where people with nothing better to do spend their time racking up huge scores just for bragging rights. I agree that the solution is to make this boring for them, and one way to do it, if we have sufficient coverage to respond to these incidents promptly, is to go through the boring escalation of templates <i>each and every time</i> an anon or new user vandalizes. We kill two birds with one stone: truly "new" vandals will be given the appropriate cautions, and inveterate perpetrators must spend five times the effort to get the same "score", hopefully boring them five times as fast. I don't know if this is practical, though. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 23:38, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suggest that all the real vandal pages get transwikied to countervandalism.org so that they are of some use to us, yet don't give the vandals their time in the limelight. Then start merging vandal pages which deal with vandals with similar editing patterns (e.g. TCV, Mr. Pelican Shit and WoW). I'll tag my two vandal pages for speedy deletion (u1) once they get transwikied.</p>
<p>As for tagging, tag enough accounts to establish a vandal's MO. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 03:43, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. As you can see <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruto_Uzumaki_c432.html" title="Naruto Uzumaki">Naruto Uzumaki</a> history, Kingdom hearts III continues to break the 3 revision rule and continues to edit war with many other editors. At this point, it is no longer a content dispute and has become a case where we can no longer assume good faith, as he continues to add information without citing sources and continually reverts edits made by many other editors. While I agree that content disputes can and will arise in many different places, this extends far beyond that and beyond one statement on the Talk page refuses to discuss the changes or cite proof. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 17:10, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You do not own your user page, it belongs to the community. I merely added a link to the previous name, because it had administrative action taken against it. The reference I found in the WP:AN/3RR archives of the last time he was banned for 3RR. It seemed an attempt to cover up a mischevious past, and my interactions with you suggest someone who would have a past as a POV warrior, and finding out about the 3RR violation in the past after having reported you made it important. I know that there is no policy banning me from editting your user page, so long as it is for constructive reasons. I did not add anything negative on the page, only a fact that I found in the archives.</dd>

<p>I'm not one of the two, but I will respond anyway. 1) That wasn't userpage vandalism. It was a strange thing to edit war over, however. There's no obligation for Hanuman Das to keep a notice of a previous username on their userpage. 2) That response is clearly not a model of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. Please make an effort to discuss things like reasonable people. 3) I have no opinion on the editing dispute, but it is probably better if the two of you avoid each other. This needs mediation, not administrator action. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 21:53, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I suppose I am one of the two. I do not actually dislike KV, we have just often disagreed. Hanuman Das' comment is uncivil. I understand KV's rationale in wanting to note a previous username. But, I see Hanuman Das says he changed names to avoid harrassment and coordinated with an admin about it. I didn't look any further into it, but taking it at face value I can see why he would be annoyed. If you guys are going to need to work together, mediation would be a good idea. I have no opinion on the editing issues or 3rr violations. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 22:47, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Vegita_0877.html" title="User:King Vegita">User:King Vegita</a>'s actions were wrong. You don't just go around tagging someone else's user page with "this user is also known as so-and-so" unless (1) there is suspected abusive sock-puppetry or proven abusive sock-puppetry OR (2) you have that person's consent. While Hanuman's actions were less than civil, I can tell you I'd be annoyed if someone kept on adding "this user is also known as whoever" repetitively to my user page without any evidence -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)">धर्म</a></small> 00:17, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with the actions of Cactus.man. The edit war have stopped and there is no need to block anyone. Besides the edit war is a rude form of voting if 2 editors are for a version and 3 editors are for another version, the three should win. In this case we have a user (Nixer) against another (Ryulong). One against one. I do not see why Nixer should win <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 12:16, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And why Ryulong should win? What the purpose of the 3RR rule if admins do not stop violators, but instead block others? He has right to revert 4th time, I - havent. Double standard. --<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 12:25, 26 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, he doesn't have the right to revert a 4th time. Yes, he violated 3RR. No, that doesn't mean he has to be blocked. Blocks are to stop people from disrupting the encyclopedia - whether they've broken the rules or not. You've both voluntarily stopped disrupting the encyclopedia, so there's absolutely no reason why anyone needs to be blocked. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornhj_aa00.html" title="User:Bornhj"><font color="#3366CC">--<b>jam</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornhj_E_1d10.html" title="User:Bornhj/E"><font color="green"><b>es</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBornhj_2497.html" title="User talk:Bornhj">(talk)</a></sup> 12:28, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He did not stop disrupting, he insists on his version. He reverted 4th time even after I worried him about 3RR rule. The <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> says "Do not revert after the reporting the 3RR, just wait an admin to revert the violator.

<dl>
<dd>He hasn't touched the page in 3 hours. I don't see him still "insisting" on his version. Whether he reverted a 4th time is irrelevant - we've already established that nothing needs to be done over the 3RR report. <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> <i>actually</i> says that offenders "may" be blocked at any admin's discretion - not that they "must" be blocked.

<dd>It may be an artful badger. Seriously, this is not much of a problem, so long as a few people keep the article on their watchlist and revert the rubbish. I've added it to mine. After a while this fellow will stop making the effort, because he will see his graffiti washed clean in short order. If he turns it into an edit war, then he can be blocked. So long as we have enough eyes on it, the article can be kept clean for 99% of the time, which for an article like this one is OK. After a while he'll stop doing it and we'll have it back completely.

<dd>Then it shouldn't have been applied. By doing this block you dont just block the vandal, but every dial-up AOL user online at the time who rolls onto the proxy. New Account creations are to be left up for AOL range blocks. Thats pretty much it. This was childish vandalism, easy to fix, easy to block the new accounts that are used abusively, and no where near worth denying that many potential new users. Seriously folks, this isn't brain science. Get out of the 'we're under seige by vandals' mentality. There aren't that many of them and their easy to revert, and block as they come up.

<p>I'd like an opinion on a editor I have a problem with. There's this fellow named <a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">User:Kmaguir1</a> whom I encountered because he put in disruptive and disparaging digressions about a few contemporary philosophers whose work (and articles) I follow. After a bunch of back-and-forth, he eventually got blocked a couple times, first for a few hours on 3RR, then eventually for 10 days for sockpuppetry. I was one of the main people filing the various administravia, looking up diffs, and all that (probably the main one; though by now a good chunk of editors have become pretty annoyed at him). Oh, those specific types of insults on those specific types of biographies was the <i>only</i> thing he edited before his blocks.</p>
<p>Mr. Maguire is back from his 10 day rest, with an obvious dislike for me personally. The latest thing he has done is add a weird template to two biographical articles I created: <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Martelli_9729.html" title="Alex Martelli">Alex Martelli</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Yee_bcaa.html" title="Danny Yee">Danny Yee</a>. Neither of these persons has anything to do with contemporary philosophy; so taken together with the fact that I created both articles (and that he has edited little else), it's pretty clear the tag is really about me, not about the subjects. On the other hand, neither person is huge general notability. I believe both are significantly more notable than a lot of biographied subjects, but neither is of worldwide fame (well, actually, both are known in many nations, but to limited audiences). Here's the tag:</p>
<p>{{dated prod|concern={{{concern|Not notable}}}|month=August|day=27|year=2006|time=02:54|timestamp=20060827025429}}</p>
<p>What do you think I should do? I've contemplated changing it to a straightforward AfD myself. I think both biographies would easily get voted "keep", but I'd certainly be happy to yield to consensus if not. On the other hand, the gesture itself is obvious bad faith... if someone I had no contact with had simply doubted the notability when they clicked on "random article", I think an AfD nomination could be in good faith (albeit wrong analysis). This is something different... i.e. it's <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 03:35, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. I also see that Kmaguir1 has added the same tag on Raymundo Baltazar, which had been created by another editor he was in conflict with on the philosopher articles, User:Agnaramasi. I had never heard of Baltazar before just now, but Baltazar is also clearly unrelated to Kmaguir1's prior editing interests. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a></p>

<p>Hello, I just noticed a new user Eddie Jacobson (<a href="../../../e/d/d/User_talk%7EEddie_Jacobson_95bc.html" title="User talk:Eddie Jacobson">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eddie_Jacobson_90db.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eddie Jacobson">contribs</a>) edit the article <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butterfingers.html" title="Butterfingers">Butterfingers</a>, an Australian band.

<dd>He has inserted nicknames for two band members, including himself. If those nicknames are accurate, then there's no issue.

<p>You've misunderstood (I think). If it's your own name, you can use it, even if it's the same name as a famous person. You're just not allowed to use a pseudonym that's the same as a famous person.

Less than a day after Tirid Tirid voted on Talk:Nicolaus Copernicus, just like Space Cadet had done, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATirid_Tirid&amp;diff=41685205&amp;oldid=41626885" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATirid_Tirid&amp;diff=41685205&amp;oldid=41626885" rel="nofollow">report</a> of the users' similarities was finally written. Tirid Tirid also got tagged as sockpuppet, and on suspicion of having evaded 3RR, feigning greater support, evading increasing punishments for revert warring, and committing double-voting in at least four cases with this account, the case was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_checkuser&amp;diff=41783391&amp;oldid=41776436" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_checkuser&amp;diff=41783391&amp;oldid=41776436" rel="nofollow">listed</a> at CheckUser.

After shortly being blocked again, Space Cadet never continued to edit. But Tirid Tirid went on. Now he simply removes the suspicion of sockpuppetry from his user page again and again, and this, I think, should not continue. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESciurin%C3%A6_d3c6.html" title="User:Sciurinæ">Sciurinæ</a> 12:47, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A review of <a href="../../../l/o/l/User%7ELolababy_b035.html" title="User:Lolababy">Lolababy</a>'s edits reveal that they are, almost without exception, to articles that <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Beale_c7bd.html" title="User:Mr Beale">Mr Beale</a> has edited.

It's a fairly classic case of <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">wikistalking</a>, and there are a number of other policy problems (using minor edits to cover up removal of sources, borderline vandalistic behavior).

<dd>You have the correct tag for self-made images already. But these images are not self made, they're cropped images from another source. Cropping a copyrighted image doesn't remove the copyright. If you think these are off copyright by age, one of the PD tags is correct. If you are asserting fair use, a fair use tag is correct. A discussion of tags can be found here: <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Copyright_tags" class="extiw" title="commons:Copyright_tags">Commons:Copyright_tags</a>, and it does cover fair use (although fair use images have to stay on en: they cannot be uploaded to commons). Hope that helps. That said, I looked at the article as it was prior to reversion and I agree with those who said that it was a mass of unformatted (and possibly copyrighted) material.

<p>I had asked for Halibutt to be warned for personally attacking me less than a week ago, my petition on here was removed without any action being taken, and he has now done it again. if you will notice here[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APolish_September_Campaign&amp;diff=72126739&amp;oldid=72120522" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APolish_September_Campaign&amp;diff=72126739&amp;oldid=72120522" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>], he has personally insulted me again. hopefully this time someone will do some justice and atleast warn him.</p>

<dd>The test is not "can you dig up an inoffensive use for the name", but "is this name likely to be offensive". Stormtrooper and Stasi both, I think qualify as likely to offend.

<p>I don't think a warning was in order here as it was clearly a good faith edit. Edit warring to keep a warning on someone's userpage achieves what exactly?

<p>Not a bad suggestion. I guess on my end, I got worked up over having my edits deleted, with the reasons given being that my claims were unsourced, even though I had included sources in the body of the text. I responded to this by posting a warning on Jared23's page, in an effort to head off an edit war. Jared responded by posting comments on my pge which rubbed me the wrong way, and the whole thing escalated from there. I looked at Jared23's talk page and saw a link to an earlier admin incident log showing that he makes quite a habit of deleting things from his User:Talk page when he doesn't like them. Since he wound up deleting every one of the warnings I posted to his page, I felt somewhat incensed. It was like talking to a brick wall, you know? Like trying to reason with somebody who just flat refused to listen or even acknowledge that anything had been said at all, except for the things that he posted on my own page. He can talk, but he can't hear. At the end of the day (literally, since I'm on EDT), I suppose it shouldn't matter so much. After all, who really cares if Jared23 deletes comments from his user:talk page or not? As for my edits to the article Cracker (pejoritive), I guess it was inevitable that somebody would have deleted all or a large portion of them. Better to just accept that some of it survived in some form, and not get irritated over it. I don't need the high blood pressure anyway. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandering_Star_ca1f.html" title="User:Wandering Star">Wandering Star</a> 02:58, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Apologies in advance for the length, but it is a complicated case.</p>
<p>Wikipedia regularly finds itself caught in the crossfire between extremists from both the Republican and Unionist communities in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Both communities use certain terms to define Northern Ireland in an area that suits <i>their</i> political agenda while sending a <i>fuck you</i> (or 'Wikipedia accepts that we are right and you are wrong') message to the other. Unionists call the place "Ulster" to claim it wasn't created by an Act of Parliament only as recently as 1920. Republicans say "Six Counties" or "Six Occupied Counties" to claim that the place's existence is invalid. Various users have spent a lot of time reverting the POV-pushing from both sides. One republican POV-pusher, <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapsed_Pacifist_8b06.html" title="User:Lapsed Pacifist">Lapsed Pacifist</a> ended up being referred (by me) to the arbcom for his republican POV-pushing behaviour. (He did a runner once referred.)</p>
<p>Now a Unionist POV-pusher is not merely engaging in the word games, but abusing WP processes and vandalising articles in the process. A valid term, "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Constituent_country.html" title="Constituent country">constituent country</a>", is used to describe Wales, Scotland and England. It is also used by the British Government and the Unionist Community to refer to Northern Ireland, to suggest that Northern Ireland, far from being a creation of a controversial 1920s law, is an ancient country akin to Scotland and England. Nationalists and Republicans reject the term, arguing that Northern Ireland is neither a nation, a country nor a country country but merely, depending on one's politics, a <i>region</i> of the United Kingdom created in 1920, or <i>part of the country</i> of Ireland.</p>
<p>Because of its highly controversial and disputed nature, and because of sensitivities to the way both communities use language, it was agreed not to <i>use</i> the term in its descriptive sense in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> article. Instead a neutral, non-judgmental variant was piped, with an attached footnote explaining that unlike in Scotland, Wales and England, the term is controversial and disputed by one side, and accepted by the other, when used about Northern Ireland.

Because his POVing was constantly reverted, he has proceded to abuse Wikipedia procedures:</p>
<ol>
<li>by proposing that the article on the the <i>real</i>, perfectly valid term "constituent country" be renamed "constituent part". This is clearly a bad faith nomination. (He then voted <i>oppose</i> to his own nomination!)</li>
<li>by changing the articles on those parts of the United Kingdom where the term's usage is non-controversial so that they also use the piped link to the neutral variant only needed in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. It is simply a stunt in his tactical battle. He wants to have people from England, Scotland and Wales endorse the term (as they correctly will) and then to stop him messing around with their articles rally to support its controversial usage in the Northern Ireland.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am an admin but having dealt with Mal's antics repeatedly I cannot intervene to close off his ridiculous stunt renaming nomination. Nor can I sanction him for his bad faith edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scotland&amp;diff=72288055&amp;oldid=72272519" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scotland&amp;diff=72288055&amp;oldid=72272519" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=England&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72256950" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=England&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72256950" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72256798" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72256798" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72256700" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72256700" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Could someone else please intervene? Setanta's stunt pulling and POV-pushing has gone on long enough. Reducing one page to a mess is bad enough. (Those of us who have spent the time fighting of extremists from both sides are used to it by now. Their antics on WP are so notorious they even have been written about in Irish and British newspapers!) But taking his POV 'war' for tactical reasons to other pages is crossing a line and making a mockery of Wikipepdia. This has to be stopped.</p>

<p>Hi guys, a character called User:Achilles2006 has been popping in and out of the articles on Robert Kennedy and John F Kennedy and adding in spurious remarks and generally being a pain. I just realised someone else gave him/her a warning for being offensive. I've tried a thousand times to remind the 'contributor' (vandal, in my opinion) that this is an encyclopedia and not National Enquirer. Others are having trouble getting the person to stop adding in cutting little remarks and it's gotten to the point that others are now just reverting his/her additions. Could one of you take a moment to tell me what to do at my user page, please. I'm really at the end of my tether and would prefer he/she found another article to vandalise / use to subtly call others names. For some reason unbeknownst to me his/her current piece of enjoyment is to accuse RFK of having had affairs (no such evidence). Having been a solid contributor to both articles I am getting really fed up now. And that shouldn't be the case, I shouldn't have to keep undoing this person's foolishness. Thanks, guys.<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamlondon_47e2.html" title="User:Iamlondon">Iamlondon</a> 00:43, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have discussed this problem with an admin and neither of us were able to find guidance on: <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28places%29_59d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (places)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (places)</a> or <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28subnational_entities%29_4593.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (subnational entities)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (subnational entities)</a> and so I have been advised to seek guidance on this issue here.</p>
<p>The problem arises following attempts by a Wikipedia user to seek out references to "England", "Scotland" and "Wales" and edit them to read "United Kingdom".</p>
<p>One example of this can be seen at <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ocean_570a.html" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> where <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">User:Owain</a> recently made changes including changing text:</p>
<p>from "Aberdeen, Scotland" to "Aberdeen, United Kingdom"; from "Liverpool, England" to "Liverpool, United Kingdom"; and from "Newport, Wales" to "Newport, United Kingdom".</p>
<p>I came across this change while using VP and had made no contribution to this particular article myself but reverted on the grounds that there was no problem with the original text and that the changes reflected a minority POV, and certainly did not conform to "common usage". My revert was immediately reverted by <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">User:Owain</a> so I issued a warning to him using VP, which he chose to delete from his home page. I therefore requested that VP admins protected the disputed page.</p>
<p>I believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the edit was nonsensical, totally unnecessary and politically-motivated</li>
<li>the edit made the article imprecise in not giving sufficient detail to pinpoint a place by omitting the obvious (i.e. the country), and gave less information than the original edit</li>
<li>to deliberately ignore the country is to disrespect the people, culture and traditions of those nations</li>
<li>there have been a large number of edits to this page by many other Wikepedians, all of whom saw no problem with the identification of the country</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">User:Owain</a> recently made changes the article on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisvane.html" title="Lisvane">Lisvane</a> by changing the text:</p>
<p>from "For the village in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conwy.html" title="Conwy">Conwy</a>, see <a href="../../../l/l/y/Llysfaen.html" title="Llysfaen">Llysfaen</a>" to <i>For the village in north Wales, see <a href="../../../l/l/y/Llysfaen.html" title="Llysfaen">Llysfaen</a></i></p>
<p>Again I had made no contributions to this article but believed the edit presented a biased POV, expressed by a small number of users involved with <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Watch_e4a6.html" title="County Watch">County Watch</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_British_Counties_36bd.html" title="Association of British Counties">Association of British Counties</a> who attempt to wipe out, or depreciate, any references to the counties of England, Wales and Scotland which were formed following local government reorganisation in 1974 and again in 1996.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">User:Owain</a> recently made several changes to the article on <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdyfi.html" title="Aberdyfi">Aberdyfi</a> by changing the name of the town to the anglicised version of "Aberdovey" throughout. Again I must point out that I had made no previous contributions to this article. Despite being presented with several 'reference' articles, all using the spelling "Aberdyfi", he continued to revert to the out-of-date spelling, thus flaunting the "common usage" policy. The comment he makes on his talk page "I attach absolutely no authority to the 'National Assembly'" (the elected parliament of Wales) reveals his political motives.</p>
<p>I believe that what we are witnessing is an attempt a small group of people to use Wikepedia to put forward a heavily-biased, right-wing, "British Nationalist" agenda, views which are rejected by the vast majority of the population as being out-of-date. I am informed by other Wikipedians that these antics have been going on since before I began contributing to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>If Wikepedia is to be accepted as a serious source of information then this cannot be allowed to continue and must be stopped at the highest level. Should an investigative journalist attempt to compare Wikipedia to other conventional encyclopaedias I believe that we would be totally discredited on the grounds of neutrality.</p>
<p>I am not a member of any political party and have no political axe to grind, in fact I treat all politicians with equal contempt!</p>
<p>Can we please have a definitive ruling on the convention to be used when referring to place names here? --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelor_975d.html" title="User:Maelor"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; color:white; background-color:red">&#160;Maelor&#160;</span></a> 19:30, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've unblocked Bastique (for he is doing the right thing) and shortened Cool Cat's block to two hours (as my experience with Cool Cat is that he needs the extra tough love). Also, Bastique's use of protection was not protection abuse; it's a case of an uninformed and meddlesome user interfering with new but generally agreed-upon practices regarding how we report abusive users. Cool Cat acted rashly and without knowledge, and in so doing acted to feed the trolls. He should know better; his two hour cooling-off period will help to remind him that it is important (a) not to feed the trolls and (b) talk to others before acting. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 21:54, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not an admin myself, but I hope my opinion is still valid.&#160;:) I wasn't aware that one had to be a certain age to edit Wikipedia, so I think blocking for that is rather odd. A <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_S-man_34e3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/S-man">checkuser</a> filed came back inconclusive, so she's probably not the same person as <a href="../../../s/-/m/User%7ES-man_be8d.html" title="User:S-man">S-man</a>, as was speculated. However, she was in cahoots with S-man and his project to vandalize other Wikimedia projects. So I think that as long as S-man retains his block, Cute 1 4 u should, too, since they were blocked for the same thing. --<a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Lefty_bcf9.html" title="User:Mr. Lefty"><b>Mr. L</b><span style="color:green"><b>e</b></span><b>fty</b></a> <sub><a href="../../../m/r/2E/User_talk%7EMr._Lefty_44c9.html" title="User talk:Mr. Lefty"><i>Talk to me!</i></a></sub> 20:45, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think part of the block was based upon speculation, but in some manners she has exhausted some of our patience with certain actions. I'm not sure if this has to do with age or the possibility of trolling(?). The whole we'll vandalise other projects was the icing on the cake for me, maybe she needs mentorship in order to better understand the project. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 20:48, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>She has impersonated celebrities (see User:Raven Symone), and from what I've seen, she is exhausting the patience of a lot of people.

<dd>I wouldn't be opposed to lessening the block, but we would also have to consider the other younger users which all seem to be connected to each other.

<dd>I would support a shorter (that is, a definite) block. We should also remember that assuming this person really is the age claimed, it seems to take longer for time to pass when you are young. That said, I'd fully support a permanent ban if there's any further problem behaviour from this user and furthermore, I explicitly agree with what Yanksox says immediately above this. We should also remind the user that Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a social networking site.

<dd>((edit conflict)) Here I go again, butting in even though I'm not an admin. I saw all the ruckus on Cute's talk page and have to voice my opinion. From what I can gather, she never vandalized or intended to vandalize an article, project, category, template, etc., on <i>Wikipedia</i>. In light of this, and being <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a>, my suggestion is: block for a short period of time (1 week, perhaps), indefblock her from the other project that she intended to vandalize, and set her up with a mentor (I'll volunteer). <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 21:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's actually not a bad idea. I don't think she has bad intentions, but merely age-related ignorance.

I do not think mentorship has to be anything other than communicating through talk pages, so I do not see why anything special would have to be done for it. Some people want all those under 18 or 21 excluded (from comments on the Village Pump), but I doubt that is going to happen. Blocking those that admit to be under 13 would be the most extreme thing I see the Foundation doing. Although, there is the problem of a person who is too young editing through a shared IP with lots of people on it, a dynamic IP or ultradynamic IP (an IP that changes with every page load). Also, there are school IPs that have people with a wide range of ages editing on them, from elementary students, to high school students and faculty. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 18:38, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regardless of what the foundation says, if there is law in place wikipedia will need to comply with it at a minimum so working from that is a starting spot.

<dd>I'm not the world's leading expert on this but I believe this 13-years-old thing only applies if the site wishes to collect personal information from the user (name, age, location, etc).

We don't collect, let alone distribute, <i>any</i> personal information other than an optional email. The real problem is that children (and quite a few adults, too, but they're on their own) are often unwise enough to post all sorts of personal information about themselves. (I could write a few paragraphs of bio about "Cute 1 4 u" based on the info she's provided on WP, WQ, and linked sites, which would scare the hell out of me if I were her parent.) This is not information we collect, so it doesn't seem to be covered. Nor is it clear how Wikipedia could obtain "verifiable parental consent" when we don't even really know who the editors in question are. (All that bio info could be made up; "Cute" could be a 35-year-old male, for all we <i>know</i>.)

<dd>As to the point I made above and COPPA it doesn't require that you intentionally collect the information, but if you know that it has been provided i.e. someone admits to being under 13 and they've entered their e-mail address in their account, then you've violated COPPA. A site could be COPPA compliant and then 5 minutes later not be because an under age individual has shown up and entered their e-mail without parental consent. In order to remain compliant you have to either remove the individual's account or get parental permission.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 18:20, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay. I'm a Wikiquote admin. I have reason to believe Cute is 11. Does Wikiquote have her email address? I can't query the database to find out. I could try to email her, but I will only know if she has one if she responds. If she doesn't, I still don't know. Assuming that Wikiquote is violating COPPA by allowing her personal information (unrequested, but on her user page) to be displayed, who do I contact to get permission? Do I become a stalker to track down her last name and address, then write a letter to her parents? Or do I remove this information, ask her not to repost it, and block her from editing if she doesn't provide a means to confirm consent? If she does this last, how do I know it's legit? We're probably not talking about kids scrawling poorly forged signatures from their parents about being unable to do their homework. These and many other questions and their consequences must be addressed by the Wikimedia Foundation. Where is this discussion taking place?

<p>Have a policy that "No one identifiable as under-18 may have a user id on Wikipedia". This doesn't mean no under-18s can edit, or even have user pages, just that if it is possible to identify them as youngsters - what a paedophile will be looking for - then the account is immediately blocked. This is one occasion when opening another account would be perfectly OK - as long as again there is no way to determine the age of the user.</p>
<p>The "identifiable as under-18" criterion could be very broad: photos, mention of school, link to MySpace site with info... Anything. And it should be made clear that these measures are not punitive to the user - they are entirely protective.</p>
<p>There is still the issue of potential abusers sending out speculative emails to users hoping are young. But some of these emails will end up going to older folk, which will then be an indicator of who might be dodgy.</p>
<p>Will require policing, but may be lightweight in comparison to other solutions. Dunno how any of this will interact with the legal requirements: as said above, let's wait on what Brad says. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackyR_8980.html" title="User:JackyR">JackyR</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJackyR_e6f9.html" title="User talk:JackyR">Talk</a> 15:20, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I agree. This is up to the Foundation. We must be secure and protective to all young Wikipedians. But maybe we shouldn't be too harsh yet. If we make this new policy, all userpages, including subpages, will be reviewed by an admin. If there is info that could pinpoint the <b>exact location</b> of a user, the content in question will be blanked. If the user puts it back, then we tell the user it is for their own protection. If it happens again, the user will be blocked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see the need of under-18, under 13 is what the law requires. By sticking to that we're not placing any subjective criteria on a user that would require judgement. Anyone under 13 who identifies themselves as such should be blocked until they turn 13 (without asking for birthdays, if they identify as 11, block for 2 years). --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 18:45, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also recommend that we have a special page for dealing with harassment. That way, if a young user is contacted by a pedophile, then we can take immediate action. Also, having a centralized page for complaints and reports could make it easier for local police to view all of the incidents and take action. <i>Note: I am not an admin</i>.--<a href="../../../l/e/r/User%7ELeroyencyclopediabrown_71f9.html" title="User:Leroyencyclopediabrown">Ed</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/r/User_talk%7ELeroyencyclopediabrown_2778.html" title="User talk:Leroyencyclopediabrown">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leroyencyclopediabrown_70b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leroyencyclopediabrown">c</a> <b><font color="green">E</font></b></sup> 15:28, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think we have an opportunity here to deal with two problems at the same time. The second problem I'm seeing is the increasing usage of this site as a social network, especially by under 18s. They have a few minor edits here and there to fairly trivial articles, but mostly a stack of userboxes and a talk page bursting with chat from other under 18s. Why don't we simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete and prohibit all user boxes which state the user's age or year of birth (birthdays are fine, just no year)</li>
<li>Delete all Wikipedians by age categories</li>
<li>Automatically block anyone who states their age if it's under x, and block them until birthday x, per <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a>.</li>
<li>Strongly discourage users from revealing their age if under 18, because it detracts from our encyclopedic purpose (and will lead some people to discriminate against them too, I might add).</li>
</ul>
<p>If these ideas, or a variation thereof, are thought workable perhaps we could put up a policy proposal page somewhere. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 09:01, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

While it's a bit <a href="../../../a/b/f/WP%7EABF_c955.html" title="WP:ABF">bad faith</a> to assume that these users are all sockpuppets, it could be that Kmaguir1 is just now an AFD browser, and not creating sockpuppets to list AFDs. These are just the AFD hits, none of the stubs that he prodded.</p>

<dd>Worse still, IMO, is Kmaguir1's gratuitous insult about Danny Yee's appearance: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Danny_Yee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72320461" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Danny_Yee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72320461" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>. Yee happens to be a Wikipedian himself, but he has not been involved at all in the AfD of the article about him, nor in any of the other issues with Kmaguir1. I think Kmaguir1 feels somehow that insulting Yee's appearance is a way of attacking me for adding the image to the biography. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 02:19, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>None of the comments alleged by Ryulong were even close to off color, none were personal attacks, so no problem. And I say that adding the picture was deranged--not the subject in the picture that was added. If Lulu could read well, she may well have noticed that. Furthermore, I object to lulu and ryulong and anthony krupp consistently running to admins every time they have a problem, and unjustifiably so everytime. They misrepresent and misrepresent and no longer have any objectivity on the issues. I am, as Ryulong states, a bit of an AFD browser. I like it because it's one of the easier ways to get rid of much of pointless drivel that haunts Wikipedia, without actually engaging in edits. And yes, I am a hard deletionist--but not harder than some of the people I've seen on that page. And i don't know how sockpuppetry has been alleged--I'm the one putting up all the deletions, articles which I pick either from the "random article" box or I just look at names I don't know that have been up before, or just look small and insignificant. It's time for Lulu and the rest to just be quiet and go about their business on wikipedia with a dignity that has so far not embodied them.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 08:59, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Kmaguir1's characterization that I run to an admin etc. is false. His allegations of my misrepresenting lack evidence, and I would challenge him to provide them, by pointing to actual diffs, if I were not tired of disruptions. I think his AfD browsing is fine, even if it began in a meanspirited way (trolling Lulu's page creations). I joined him in one of the delete votes, objected on others, was silent on yet others. I say all of this to address his slander, above. I find his advice to be quiet and go about the business of editing to be excellent, and hope he takes it as well. Finally: I think his lack of respect for <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a> is more of a reason for an Admin to look into his edits. See <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_hooks.html" title="Bell hooks">bell hooks</a> and its talk page for a case in point. He has yet to answer specific questions I've posed to him regarding criticisms of hooks, ones I'm willing to have included. I'm willing to play ball; I haven't seen that he is.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Krupp_1e6c.html" title="User:Anthony Krupp">Anthony Krupp</a> 15:40, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>P.S.

<dd>Kmaguir1's argument now seems to be that my allegedly bad behaviour excuses his. Not valid. Regarding my behavior, anyone is free to see on my Talk page that I compared Kmaguir1 to the 'ha-satan' figure ("the adversary") of the book of Job. This is not the Christian Satan, but is rather a prosecuting attorney against mankind in the heavenly court of God. That is, this figure works for God. In Goethe's <i>Faust</i>, the sense is that the 'satan' figure wants to disrupt but ends up doing good (i.e., God's work). In short: I made this religious history/literary reference in the context of saying that some of Kmaguir1's disruptions have actually resulted in others improving several articles in question. If any administrator regards my conversation as incivil, kindly let me know and I will take steps to make amends. But don't let Kmaguir1 throw a smoke screen over his own behaviour, which has exhausted community patience.

<dd>I'm well aware of the differences in the text of the Torah with respect to the way Satan is conceived and the way the devil is thought of in the New Testament. However, I happen to be a Christian, so I see them as consistent and part of God's plan and part of His inerrant Word. And regardless, it's always, without exception, a personal attack to compare someone to Satan, regardless of your historical hoop-di-doo. It was extremely unwise, and it will be yourself who opened yourself to criticism about it, not I.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 18:57, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kmaguir's edits to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_hooks.html" title="Bell hooks">Bell hooks</a> have consistently ignored consensus and have been in explicit violation of WP:BLP policies, which he has been reminded of over and over. Instead of engaging in talk, he simply keeps adding the disputed material to the article once a day, when it is quickly reverted.

<dd>I had a rather long discussion with this user through email in May over this kind of edits, and she promised to try and behave. Apparently she's resumed the same behaviour since. I also warned her about 3RR on her talk page, which may explain the 3RR gaming. As far as I'm concerned, she has no useful contributions at all, and since she's been nothing but disruptive for several months, I'd recommend an indefinite block. - ulayiti <font color="#226B22"><small>(talk)</small></font> 09:04, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It looks to me as if he is genuinely confused about our processes. We have to give him some chance to understand explanations. Sure, if he continues with the practice of blanking articles at the same time as he nominates them for speedy deletion, he can be given a substantial block. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 12:18, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>None of the above diffs show him exceeding 3 reverts in a 24-hour period. I note that Zenguru is also adding print references for his claims, which are removed every time the coronation paragraph is taken out. Confessing my complete lack of knowledge on this subject, I would like to know why you think the references are unreliable (especially the one Zenguru says is "published by the Maharastra State Government"). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 09:48, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, not in 24 hrs but he is reverting back anyway. The links he claims as references are [{Dalitstan]]-affiliated websites and/or Independent Research organizations. However, I must say that the universally accepted version od Shivaji's history is that he was a <a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshatriya.html" title="Kshatriya">Kshatriya</a> and of course, he never made any reference to Sisodiya clan or any other <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajput.html" title="Rajput">Rajput</a> clan. Apart from that, I may also add that <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajput.html" title="Rajput">Rajputs</a> are <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Scythians_1907.html" title="Indo-Scythians">Indo-Scythians</a> while <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a> are <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryan_3705.html" title="Indo-Aryan">Indo-Aryans</a>, which is a major genetic difference between them and one which was known since historical times, due to which Rajputs were also referred to as <i>Saka</i>s or <i>Saurya</i>s while Marathas are referred to as <i>Arya</i>s. That apart, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmins</a> calling <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a> as <i>shudras</i> is an allegation which was never proved and has no historical basis. It is just a speculation. Apart from that the other thing that he states is about the priest which is already mentioned. So, repeatation is not required. And the only reason he is repeating that is to push his POV about Marathas being shudras and alleged linkup to Sisodiyas. This I must say is massive <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> pushing. And most of the things he says are speculations, rumours and falsities. I think <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is not for these things.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you feel that my argument isn't powerful enough, then it's alright. Let Wikipedia be filled with false information. As you would have noticed, I have stopped reverting the accused user's edits to "Shivaji" article now. See the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shivaji.html" title="Shivaji">current revision</a>. If false information can so easily be fed into Wikipedia then what's the use of editing it. Isn't it&#160;?</p>

<dd>I am not trying to let disinformation perpetuate in Wikipedia, I just want to understand the background information underlying this issue so I can come to a better understanding. Does Zenguru misrepresent the reference "Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar writings and Speeches volume 7 chapter 10, page no.156- 185 published by Maharastra State Government"? Or is Ambedkar considered an unreliable source, and if so, why? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 10:57, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As it is, from the reference title itself, we can understand. The problem here is not whether Ambedkar is a reliable source or not. The thing is whether what Ambedkar wrote about Shivaji is reliable or not. When Ambedkar wrote the thing, he wrote it as pure speculation. Also, it was a charged atmosphere. And Ambedkar being a recent convert to <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> had a reason to write it. The <i>so-called</i> lower castes shudras were ill-treated by <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmins</a> and he had a reason to attack Brahmins in his writings. But then, everything he wrote doesn't become the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> because of that. Then why doesn't everyone feed the articles about <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, that Ambedkar wrote, into Wikipedia. That's because it cant be put, first because it is derogatory and secondly, it is false and was written in a fit of anger. That's because Babasaheb wrote it in anger and a feeling of revenge. Lest you may think otherwise, I must tell you, that I have utmost respect for Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. But just because he was Great, doesn't mean every word from his pen is the truth.</p>

<dd>Then couldn't the article include the information Zenguru is adding, but point out that it is based entirely on potentially damaging charges made by Dalitstan supporters and strong activists for certain castes? That is, rewording Zenguru's contributions to say something like "Some people affiliated with such-and-such movements, as well as Dr. <a href="../../../b/2E/_/B._R._Ambedkar_967a.html" title="B. R. Ambedkar">B. R. Ambedkar</a> shortly after his conversion to Buddhism, have speculated that not everyone at the time accepted Shivaji's coronation... (and so on) ... However, these highly charged claims have been challenged by historians like so-and-so, who say that..." This is how we normally present controversial and potentially injurious allegations made by notable groups and individuals in Wikipedia. Rather than call it the truth, we point out who's making the accusations. I trust that users like you with much better knowledge in the subject than mine are up to the task of fitting such a wording into the article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 11:51, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Please take a peek at <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWerdna_2947.html" title="User:Werdna">User:Werdna</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Publicgirluk_photo_debate&amp;diff=72569061&amp;oldid=72568382" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Publicgirluk_photo_debate&amp;diff=72569061&amp;oldid=72568382" rel="nofollow">deletion of my comments</a> from the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Wikipedia%7EPublicgirluk_photo_debate_e976.html" title="Wikipedia:Publicgirluk photo debate">Wikipedia:Publicgirluk photo debate</a> page. I'm heading out of town on a train and won't be back online for a few hours, so I wanted to post this here to avoid a 'revert war' with Werdna re-deleting my comments. If the comments in question were a vio of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, I apologize in advance and welcome some advice on how to improve my debating form. However, from examining the diff link I think it's clear these comments are not personal attacks, and in no way justify deletion - and in this case the deletion of comments on a contentious page established expressly for debate is only likely to escalate tensions. Please advise, and thanks for your time. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 12:41, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks to me like a good faith attempt at refactoring the page - whether or not it was the wisest possible move - and the user concerned seems to be in good repute. You may be in the right here, but does it matter <i>awfully</i>? I suggest you simply be big enough to let it go (and the same applies to everyone else who has been wounded by what happened). If you do that, why should the dispute escalate? None of the material that has been deleted is a great loss in my opinion. Really, everyone who got involved in this debate over the past few day needs to take a step back and a few deep breaths. A policy is needed for next time, and we all need to think calmly about what it should be, but endless arguments about who was "right" and who was "wrong" are not useful. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 13:00, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed - I believe however that the comments should stand and users not refactor selective sections of the debate (and obfuscate their meaning) - especially those of an opposing POV. . I won't escalate in either case, but let's leave the discussion intact. I'm not upset, just want the dialogue preserved and the meaning intact.

<dd>I'd favour leaving the comments as is. Archive it if necessary (although it eems already like an archive) or provide a summary but it may be best to leave comments alone.

<dd>Ooh, my first ANI post, how exciting <tt>:-)</tt>. In all seriousness, I did my utmost to make sure that the comments I deleted had no relevance to the situation. It is somewhat common practice to refactor discussions such as that, if they have descended into bickering, which they seemed to have. As the other user in the debate's block log, and back and forth accusations of bullying had little to nothing to do with the discussion, I removed them in order to keep the debate on-topic, or to move it back. I won't re-remove them, as it seems to have been contentious in some manner. — <b><a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWerdna_2947.html" title="User:Werdna">Werdna</a></b> <i><a href="../../../w/e/r/User_talk%7EWerdna_0e10.html" title="User talk:Werdna">talk</a></i> <i><a href="../../../w/e/r/User_talk%7EWerdna_Review_4524.html" title="User talk:Werdna/Review">criticism</a></i> 22:36, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

These are <i>major</i> changes that Lkinkade did not discuss beforehand, instead declaring "I am currently working on separating out all of the A. A. Milne characters from their more recent animated versions. The information about the original character was difficult too distinguish from the Disney character and attempts to use the article to find out about the original character were being foiled." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Winnie-the-Pooh&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72588305" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Winnie-the-Pooh&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72588305" rel="nofollow">[88]</a> Worse, the changes are being made poorly -- the new articles have titles like Disney representation of the Milne character "Eeyore", and the old articles have no links to the new ones, resulting in the appearance of censoring Disney-related content from these articles, rather than a good-faith article split (although I am assuming good faith that the user is just unaware of good-practice rather than actively trying to hide the Disney-related content).

<dl>
<dd>Not to steal Lee's thunder on this one, but these changes were the result of a complaint regarding the content of <a href="../../../p/i/g/Piglet_%28Winnie_the_Pooh%29_c849.html" title="Piglet (Winnie the Pooh)">Piglet</a>. A broader investigation disclosed that most of the articles on the A. A. Milne characters suffered the same defects: a total lack of references, and a concentration on Disney's representation over the A. A. Milne originals. Disney's representations of classic literature, in many cases, are so divergent from the originals that they really deserve separate coverage, and furthermore the gross popularity and greater recent exposure of the Disney content tends to result in the originals being overwhelmed. An example of how far this goes was on <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quasimodo.html" title="Quasimodo">Quasimodo</a>, where a "fair use" screenshot of Disney's version was used to illustrate the article even though there are public domain illustrations in the original 1831 novel, and there may also be public domain material from the first Lon Cheney film as well. However, the editors of this article elected to use Disney's version -- which is not free by any means, and is also very unrepresentative of depictions of Quasimodo, being far less grotesque than virtually any other depiction in history -- instead of available free content. I suspect that these articles are being dominated by Disneyphiles, and as a result they are skewing these articles away from NPOV. This action benefits Wikipedia both by sequestering articles which are likely to attract the use of unlicensed media and by presenting a fuller, more complete examination of characters which have effectively led a "double life" (one as they were originally conceptualized by their original creators, and another as they have been reimagined by Disney). I think it a good thing that our readers are made aware that the Disney versions are not all that exists of these classics.</dd>

<dd>Finally, this is not really an appropriate issue for the Administrator's Noticeboard. That you ran here first over what is merely a content dispute suggests that you are attempting to strongarm Lee into backing down on this issue. Powers, I think you need to back off here and contemplate whether you are attempting to support a Disney-friendly POV on these articles. By my eyes, before Lee worked on them, they were very strongly Disney-friendly and certainly not neutral. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 14:54, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, it's not really something for AN/I, although Powers did seem to want editorial attention more than administrative attention, and said "I also have no idea how to go about fixing this" so I'll assume he didn't intend to "strongarm". Take this away to the talk page, although you can ask for administrative assistance later if there are things like ugly redirects to clean up, or if <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> breaks down.</dd>
<dd>To offer an editorial opinion, the treatment of the characters as they appear in Milne can certainly be improved, though it's quite clear that a separate article is not necessary; rather have two top level headings, one "In Milne" and the other "In Disney" (or words to similar effect) to distinguish the content. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 15:11, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree AN is not the best place for it, but there is no single talk page on which to discuss this. I suppose I am trying to "strongarm" a bit, but only insofar as I'm trying to get him to discuss these changes before making them wholesale across the board. There's also the issue of the completely non-encyclopedic new article titles, and the complete lack of any cross-referencing between them. This looked for all the world like a situation that would only get worse if allowed to continue, and I wanted to enlist some help in reining it in until a consensus can be reached. I'd appreciate a little more assumption of good faith, Kelly. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 16:05, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, how can I argue against that? I have maybe 20 Disney-related articles on my watchlist; if that's evidence for bias, then I guess I'm guilty. If you'd look at the actual edits, instead of just the titles, maybe you'd notice that I am not exactly a rampant pro-Disney POV pusher. I really don't appreciate this when all I'm trying to do is raise an alert to what looked to me like potentially destructive behavior. Yes, we want users to be bold, but this looked like something that would take a lot of effort to untangle, should consensus be against the split, and should be discussed first. If this split can be done correctly, I may not even have a problem with it, but the way it's being done seems reckless. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 16:33, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have a strange sense of "reckless", then. Oh, and the reason I said you came here first? You posted a rather irate comment on Lee's talk page, then posted here SIX MINUTES later (during which time Lee made no other edits) without first discussing the issue on any article talk page or in fact anywhere else at all. AN/I is not the place for just-started content disputes, no matter how "reckless" you think they are. (And reverting changes like the ones Lee made is actually very easy, your histrionic defense of your preferred version of these articles notwithstanding.) The tone of your second message on Lee's talk page was "I'm going to sic the administrators on you because you're being bad"; it came across to me as an attempt at intimidation. If that was not your intent, perhaps you need to be more careful in how you phrase your messages. Your conduct definitely "fanned the flames" rather than calming them. If I had to guess, from examining your conduct, I'd say that you were very emotionally upset because someone altered your preferred version of one of your favorite articles. That stinks of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">article ownership</a> and is not acceptable on Wikipedia. You don't get to own articles here, and you don't get to be the defender of the "consensus version", and even more so when it's a consensus of like-minded people (which I suspect is the case here). Reading through the article's talk page, I don't see much evidence of a significant debate toward consensus, except for one episode where you argued vehemently toward favoring Disney's representation over all others. More evidence toward the conclusion that you're biasing the article in Disney's favor. I really do think you're letting your personal affinity for the Disney franchise cloud your judgment here, and that you really should back away from this issue. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 16:58, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Kelly is correct - reverting many of those changes was reasonably trivial and required no adminstrative intervention, and Kelly was also correct that you are being overly protective of your preferred version. I know nothing, nor care at all, about the reputed contravercy over ownership, but I will help all parties in interest craft well worded articles at the names of the characters, without the creation of POV forks, that describe all of the relevent positions on who exactly Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore and Tigger are. I would support blanking this section of AN/I, and was considering doing it myself. <a href="../../../j/b/k/User%7EJBKramer_42bf.html" title="User:JBKramer">JBKramer</a> 17:31, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I apologize for the impression that I'm being overly protective of "my preferred version". <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnie-the-Pooh_bd94.html" title="Winnie-the-Pooh">Winnie-the-Pooh</a> is in no sense "one of my favorite articles;" I think it's bloated, overly long, and attempts to discuss both the franchise and the character without fully succeeding at both. I fully support any effort to improve the quality of the article, but the way this split was done appeared hasty and ill-advised. I also apologize for posting this discussion here; as I've already said, it was not the most appropriate place, but likewise I didn't know where else to discuss it (since more than just one article was affected). Despite appearances, I can only offer my sincere assurances that this was not an attempt to protect a favored version, nor to unreasonably promote a pro-Disney POV. I can't prove it, since it's impossible to prove a negative, so I can only offer the record of my contributions and disucssions as evidence of my sincerity. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 17:39, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I see the logic in this; SoftPaleColors thinks this is injust, that he should have been warned first, etc. I have no opinion on the block, but since its not related to the rest of MONGO's arbitration case, a community review is probably a better idea than cramming unrelated matters into the arbitration. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 21:10, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi, if there is a Sri Lankan admin or editor, or an admin or editor who speaks Sri Lankan I could use their help in communicating with <a href="../../../l/a/h/User%7ELahiru_k_90e0.html" title="User:Lahiru k">User:Lahiru k</a> about his edits.

<p>This IP address has made between 100-250 edits since January of this year. A sampling of these edits show that about half of the edits are page blanking vandalism, while another set seem to be legitimate. Turns out this IP address belongs to Aurora Public Schools (below is the ARIN print out). Probably this is some kid using his/her school IP to vandalize wikipedia pages. Since I have no idea how to deal with this kind of vandalism/IP situation I am reporting it here. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetatree_2501.html" title="User:Metatree">Metatree</a> 20:02, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
