<p>Someone needs to do something as I am being accused of sockpuppetry, again. I am not a sockpuppeteer of Bowsy and I don't think some users (ie. RobJ1981 and Geoff B.) realise this.

<dd>It's meat puppetry in my opinion. Bowsy and Henchman have voted in the same AFDs, same RFC on a talk page, and so on. At <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Mario_Party_8_minigames_06e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Mario Party 8 minigames">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Mario Party 8 minigames</a>: Bowsy stated: <i>I would like to point out that wikipedia operates on a "one person, one vote" and not a "one computer, one vote" basis.</i> I think that's incorrect when it comes to meat puppetry. If that was the case: someone could make lots of names, and just make slightly different comments at an AFD and get away with it. Something needs to be done about this. They were clearly warned not to do this type of thing at the sock puppet case. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 00:05, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not recruiting Bowsy to support my veiws, I let him do what he wants, and if he wants to support my veiws, let him. This has nothing to do with pupperty. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenchman_2000_6976.html" title="User:Henchman 2000">Henchman 2000</a> 09:07, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just because this is the internet doesn't mean that you can't believe what someone says. If you read the conclusion on my sock case, you will know we are two people. We know the sockpuppet policy and we do not engage in it because we know we will be indef. bolcked if we do. And anyway, how can I know for sure that you really feel that mini games are listcruft, you could be being paid to say these things. This is basically what you're saying, "You cannot believe a word someone else says on the internet." It is very easy to believe someone else, so why do you always have to question things like this. I am telling you again that I am not manipulating Bowsy, please believe me this time as I don't manipulate him. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenchman_2000_6976.html" title="User:Henchman 2000">Henchman 2000</a> 11:13, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From <a href="../../../m/e/a/WP%7EMEAT_8cd6.html#Meatpuppets" title="WP:MEAT">WP:MEAT#Meatpuppets</a>: <b>A related issue occurs when multiple individuals create brand new accounts specifically to participate in, or influence, a particular vote or area of discussion.</b> You and Bowsy are two accounts, doing this exact same thing. Granted: it's not all the time, it's still a fair amount (edit histories are proof of that). Why should people ignore this fact? It's proven you two share a computer, so meatpuppetry is a likely possibility (even if you dispute it). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 12:10, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just because we share a computer, we are not meatpuppets and our accounts were not made to support an area of discussion or vote, in fact, when we created our accounts, this nonsense with the minigames had not yet started. The reason we created our accounts were so that we could edit wikipedia, as our school computers are blocked for 6 months, even though they are shared by (literally) thousands of people, and we did not want to both use our IP as we are two separate people, as you know (or at least, you should). If you check our contributions, you will find that the majority of our contributions are in no way related. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenchman_2000_6976.html" title="User:Henchman 2000">Henchman 2000</a> 18:57, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see no reason why we should take Yossben's mere allegations seriously. If there's evidence, I'll reconsider. But so far it seems like baseless allegations with an intent to smear JoanneB. For the time being, I have blocked him with the explanation "apparant single-purpose account to smear JoanneB... blocking until we straighten this out".

<dd>Not as dynamic as the 207 range; it might be more on par with the 172 range, where you <i>can</i> change IPs but don't necessarily have to. Seems to change a few times a day, so probably intentional, no? Also, this was briefly discussed above, at <a href="#IP-hopping_vandalism" title="">#IP-hopping vandalism</a>. I've been sprotecting related pages, but that has its unfortunate side effects. The range does appear to be shared, which makes me hesitate to lay down a heavy block, but it should be clear by now that blocking an individual IP won't have much effect.

The problem appears because, like in other countries, the data of the censuses are contested regarding the figures for Roma, because many Roma for fear of discrimination hide the real identity or do not have ID cards to be counted in censuses. I presented the case at talk page, the reasons for hiding the identity, the oscilation of the censuses' data and other sources. They other side says that citation of the president of Roma's Party, Nicolae Păun is not trustworthy. I cosider that it is their problem to find out if it is true or not. In Wikipedia there are accepted sources not available on-line, not rapidly verifiable, like books, newspapers, but which can be verified.

I hesitate whether or not to unarchive it here, but I hate to add a whole big thing to this already groaning page. I urge you to please take a look at the archived thread before commenting here, though. It's quite recent! Several admins stated in that discussion that they were on the verge of blocking BabyD simply for disrupting the discussion itself. S/He has been blocked three times in the past couple of weeks (discounting one 3RR block made in error), but it's really more pertinent to note that s/he seems to spend <i>all</i> the rest of their time skilfully balancing on the very verge of being blocked for edit warring, for personal attacks, for disruption. The archived ANI discussion didn't slow the user down any, nor do the wimpy reproaches I resort to on his/her page and mine (because I don't want to be the one to always block the same user). These recent edits which Smee just brought to my attention show BabyD's characteristic talkpage manner <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barbara_Schwarz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109663779" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barbara_Schwarz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109663779" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and disruptive <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> article editing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dwight_D._Eisenhower&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109605594" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dwight_D._Eisenhower&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109605594" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dwight_D._Eisenhower&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109614686" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dwight_D._Eisenhower&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109614686" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=L._Ron_Hubbard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109606316" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=L._Ron_Hubbard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109606316" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> (truly ridiculous, those last). If s/he does any useful editing, it eludes me; perhaps s/he does. But I'm very sure that the sum total of his/her impact on wikipedia is negative: that the poisoning of the atmosphere of talkpages, and the disturbance, annoyance, and sheer waste of time of other editors amply outweigh any good edits that may be hiding in some corner where I haven't looked. I don't think this is yet a community ban matter—though it's not hard to see one approaching—but I do think a long block is due and overdue. Hopefully it'll get the user to rethink their approach.

<li>So Bishonen, you want to block him for one month because he displays an attitude when he is attacked and hounded? And because he put sourced trivia in two relevant articles to make a point? Sourced trivia. Relevant articles. He is already on a block and for those self-same trivia edits, why not see if he gets the message this time. Another editor making the same edits was blocked for one hour but somehow BD was supposed to know that and that his repeating the edits would land him 24-hours. Sheesh. Or a month. A month???!!! --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 04:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> - Just a few minutes ago, I blocked BabyDweezil for 24 hours for violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and causing disruption on <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Ron_Hubbard_3ec8.html" title="L. Ron Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> and <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_D._Eisenhower_449c.html" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>. After that, Smee called my attention to this thread. BabyDweezil has had several 24 hour blocks before, but at least one of these was cancelled early. I do support a longer block. I would support anything up to and including one month. I think a ban is too harsh at this time. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 07:54, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Over-reaction by an admin/editor involved with BabyDweezil in a content dispute at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a>. Johntex, I think that you should have posted this to an admin board and let someone else handle it as this looks a lot like "conflict of interest". I make no claim to be a mind reader and make no claim as to what motivated you in this block, I am telling you what it has the appearance of, to me. It would have been better to avoid that appearance. And if you are going to say that BD can appeal the block, I think that you know as well as I do that there is a big difference between another admin undoing your block vs. another admin not making the block for you in the first place. The former, undoing, is a much higher hurdle. The funny thing is that wikipedia is full of silly trivia and the Schwarz claims are interesting trivia for both Hubbard and Eisenhower and, certainly Eisenhower as he has a trivia section. It is trivia that he plays a part in the suits brought by the "queen of FOIA". So was it <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>? Perhaps, but it was also a valid edit in Ike and needed only minor editing, to identify it as trivia, to be a valid edit in LRH. Personally, I see this block as piling-on on BabyDweezil. I think that a simple warning for the <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> would have served, especially as the edits made were not egregious in the least. I do not think that BD wants more blocks and I think that he would have responded to a warning. Please remove the block and post it to an admin board and let a non-involved admin make the call.

<li>Calling it a "conflict of interest" for an admin who witnesses a user committing violations of several policies (yes, <i>even</i> if the user is alleging that he was 'forced' into those violations by The Cabal's failure to bow to the absurd demands he is making in a supposed "content dispute") to block that user for those violations is absurd. It would be as if a cop caught a drug dealer selling marijuana to twelve-year-olds, and the drug dealer claimed that he was just proselytizing for <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rastafarianism.html" title="Rastafarianism">Rastafarianism</a>, and when the cop arrested the drug dealer, some bystander forced his way to the front of the crowd and accused the cop of having a "conflict of interest" because he had previously had a "dispute" with the dealer over the issue of cannabis. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 04:40, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I ask again, as I did on the previous thread: Has this editor contributed <b>anything</b> of substance to this encyclopedia? No one has provided a single diff which made a positive change when I asked before. If BabyDweezil exists solely to disrupt and be a general PITA, why are we even discussing this?

<li><small>Copy of reply to Justanother</small>Hi Justanother, thanks for your message. Yes, I considered that there my action may appear to be a conflict of interest and I still decided that to take action was the best course. There were several factors to my decision. One of them is that BD's behavior is consistently bad. This was not an isolated incident. Another is that I had previously blocked a different editor for the exact same thing. BD came along and made the same edits. It was a clear violation. Another factor is that BD has received many warnigs and even previous 24 hour blocks. Yet another is that the project favors action, and that any decision can be undone.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, I was confident enough in my actions that I didn't feel it was beneficial to the project to delay while waiting for another admin or set of admins to review the case. I stand by my action. I also note that no admin has yet found issue with the block. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 15:02, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Responding only your second justification: "Another is that I had previously blocked a different editor for the exact same thing. BD came along and made the same edits. It was a clear violation." For the exact same edits in Ike and LRH, I guess? Well, I did not know that you had blocked someone; how was BD to know?

<li>I'm not really happy about the 24-hour block—the timing isn't ideal. When I posted this proposal for a long block, I invited BabyD to come to ANI and comment—I didn't foresee that he was about to get a 24-hour block. I hope you don't mind, Johntex, but I've offered to unblock him for the purpose of taking part here, on condition that he edits nowhere else. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 16:41, 21 February 2007 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Oppose one-month block</b> - As someone that has stood where BD now stands, I have a bit to say and maybe some of what I say will be news to some. I really do not know BD's edit history or how much he has contributed. I "ran into him" on <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_apologist.html" title="Cult apologist">cult apologist</a>, I think. But the fact is that there is a group, and a somewhat cohesive group at that, of "anti-cultists" editing here that, IMO, disrupts wikipedia and poisons the atmosphere here far more than BD could. If you want proof of that take a look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipediatrix_ce2c.html#Mirror.2C_Mirror" title="User talk:Wikipediatrix">this</a> by an editor, <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">User:Wikipediatrix</a>, that pretended to be one of them for a whole year:
<blockquote>
<p>To pro-Scientology editors: I don't know what to tell you, because, frankly, it's a lost cause. If you make meek moves, you get nowhere. If you make bold moves, you get instantly reverted. If you try to discuss it on the talk page, you get ignored. . .</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To anti-Scientology editors: . . . You are hurting your own case by making all the articles look like total lurid attack pieces, and hurting Wikipedia's credibility as well. <b>One editor actually said to me words to the effect of "we don't have to treat Scientology as fairly as we treat other religions".</b> That was a real wake-up call to me. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
Some of these people (actually, often the more moderate ones though still over-agressive "defenders") maintain highly biased websites off wikipedia dedicated to fighting what they, in my best AGF, consider destructive cults. Some of these "cults" are recognized <a href="../../../n/r/m/NRM_d989.html" title="NRM">NRMs</a> that most of the members enjoy being part of and reap benefits from. Some of these "anti-cultists" are admins here and it is to their credit that they usually do not abuse that privilege. There was a recent such abuse involving none other than BabyDweezil, since reversed and apologized (I think). However, the "problem" is not the "anti-cult" admins; it is the "like-minded" editors that have created and maintain such highly POV articles as <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_apologist.html" title="Cult apologist">cult apologist</a>. These editors have made the atmosphere in these articles very hazardous indeed for anyone that opposes their views. When I arrived here I was greeted by insults (still am, today I am a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Orsini&amp;curid=6450515&amp;diff=109736554&amp;oldid=88816236" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Orsini&amp;curid=6450515&amp;diff=109736554&amp;oldid=88816236" rel="nofollow">troll</a>), 3RR-baiting, NPA-baiting, and just about every other dirty trick to put me in the same position that BD now finds himself. And this is not about Scientology either. I certainly do not think that BD is a Scientologist; he has never said one thing that would lead me to believe that he is. Personally, I think Smee has an abusive editing style when it comes to editors that he does not agree with. He may not see it that way but that is what he is doing. In conclusion, I really think that many admins here do not know what editors that oppose this group of "anti-cultists" are up against and, I think, that some extra leeway is in order for BabyDweezil. I think that editors and admins here should make a better effort to see that all are treated fairly here. And, to be honest, I think that some blame should go to the "anti-cult" admins because they NEVER step in to help or support anyone but "their side" and they are the ones that probably see the disparity as clearly as I do. That said, BD still needs to follow the rules and should also contribute, contribute, contribute. Something I have already discussed with him and that I think has improved. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 17:38, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> a one-month block, though I'd also support a community ban.

KillerChihuahua asks whether BD has made any worthwhile contributions. If you look at BD's edit history it's pretty obvious that he's focused entirely on deleting content that he doesn't like from articles on Scientology and cult-related topics, and arguing about that in talk pages. The frustrating thing is that he's right about there being a lot of problems with cult-related articles on Wikipedia - unfortunately he seems to be blind to, or simply doesn't care about, the abrasive way that he deals with other users. He's had multiple blocks, hasn't learned from them and seems to be incapable of working with others effectively. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 23:10, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Chris, don't you think that you should recluse yourself from this one as you are one of the "anti-Scientology" admins here? Wouldn't avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest be more important than getting a vote in? Not to mention that you have been an active "opponent" to BabyD in the Schwarz article that led to all this. I mean, I don't know how this works here, but I imagine that involved editors like me or Smee would be kinda suspect and that the opinions of non-involved or neutral admins would count for more. But you are not exactly any of that, are you? --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 04:29, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'd not even heard of BD before last week, and I've only encountered him on the Barbara Schwarz article. But it's clear from his contributions that he's been active on a range of articles, that he's made many contentious edits and that he's wound up a lot of people with his lack of civility. If he can get it into his head that Wikipedia is a <i>community</i> where you need to get along with other people, he could be quite an effective contributor. Right now, though, he doesn't seem to understand that. It has nothing to do with being pro- or anti-Scientology, it's a basic issue of being able to work effectively with others. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 07:52, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>CC, I appreciate your vote of moderation. However, I think that the specific issues raised by Bishonen as justification for this action are insufficient. Please see my comment directly related to them near the top. The issues cited are displaying some attitude under stress and making edits of sourced trivia to relevant articles to make a point, one of the edits in the actual "Trivia" section. I see Bishonen's putting this up as a "rush to judgement", and a rush to sanction; behavior sometimes termed "railroading". --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 13:00, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Some of that might be going on, but BabyDweezil does show a bit of a tendency towards disruption when under stress, and could use a short cool down. It really looks like the Eisenhower edit was put in repeatedly to make a point. Yes, it's sourced. It is, however, a crazy <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">fringe</a> conspiracy theory. Schwarz is only "noted" because of her bizzare FOIA requests, something which BabyDweezil has criticized about her article (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_ee6c.html#What.27s_the_point_of_this_ridiculous.2C_gratuitous_article.3F" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz">Talk:Barbara_Schwarz#What.27s_the_point_of_this_ridiculous.2C_gratuitous_article.3F</a>).

<li>Understood. Thanks. I will have to bone up a bit on what exactly "probation" means in this context. I certainly think that asking him to demonstrate clearly that he "got it" regarding CIVIL, 3RR, and POINT is appropriate.

<p>&lt;left&gt; Sounds like you are trying to get that muzzle back on me, Bishonen. Why is that? As a Scientologist, this whole "affinity for scientology" as being some sort of a crime is extremely offensive to me. As far as being off-topic, Orsini's "colluding with another editor" bit is off-topic to the degree that it is an accusation against me (I am the "another editor" as he makes clear in the links to my talk page) and he clearly goes out of his way to make an off-topic accusation that I have some sort of conflict-of-interest editing in Scientology as if a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> should not edit in the Christian articles or a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black.html" title="Black">black</a> in the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_History_336c.html" title="Black History">Black History</a> articles. Ludicrous and to call it what it is; it is <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigotry.html" title="Bigotry">bigotry</a> - plain and simple and obvious and offensive. The collusion bit is a silly and obvious lie and and another editor that inadvertantly piled-on has already apologized to me. As far as being inappropriate, well barring every thing else I already mentioned that makes it inappropriate, this action is over, BD is blocked and I thought there was something about not kicking them when they are down. Bishonen, I am really disappointed that you have climbed on board with this "Justanother is a troll" idea that Orsini is pushing for his own motives and I put that down to the fact that you don't know me and I don't know you. But I made the necessary stretch to assume good faith on your part and I continue to do so. I would appreciate it if you would return the courtesy. And if you can't make that stretch, at least take a breath. This action as regards BD is over. What it now seems to be about on the part of a couple of editors is trying for a twofer; get Justanother at the same time.

<p>Oh dear! The unfortunate Justanother has been muzzled! Bishonen is choking the life out of him, do something! Meanwhile, I see a lot of community support for a one-month block above, but also a couple of respectable users suggesting one week. Accordingly, I've blocked BabyDweezil for one week. I would tend to assume that if his edit warring, content removal, and PAs continue unabated when he returns, the next thing will be that somebody (not me) places a one-month or indefinite block. But let's by all means hope for an <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiphany_%28feeling%29.html" title="Epiphany (feeling)">epiphany</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:21, 23 February 2007 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Mmmmpphhh pffft. Glad that is out. Ok, now. Last I checked I was at 39.6% so I figure I got a bit of room here to stretch. Not much to say, though. Bishonen, you do not have a LOT of community support, IMO, if you discount all the POV-pushers that chimed in. But you do have some small amount of non-POV support and, more importantly, no-one chose to oppose you except obviously interested parties like myself. I hope that BabyDweezil has a nice break and I hope that he steers clear of the site during the break. BD, nothing much will likely change while you are gone but we can hope that the unfriendly atmosphere in articles like the Scientology Series is abating somewhat and the NPOV editors are beginning to feel more comfortable editing there. I really do think that is the case. I ask Bishonen and all the other admins here to do their parts to clear out the poison in those articles and, Bishonen, if you sincerely think that blocking BD is a move in that direction then I will not argue that with you though I may feel otherwise. So be it. Later, my friends. God bless you all. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 19:34, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Justanother, you regularly remove entire sections from article talk pages with the summary "rm offensive soapboxing". I might ask -- just what exactly <i>is</i> it that you think you're doing here? Calling those people who agree with you "the NPOV editors" and labelling everyone who disagrees with you "all the POV-pushers" -- are you providing anyone with any <i>reason</i> to think you are in the right, or are you just employing WP:AN/I as a 'bully pulpit' from which to harangue everyone with your opinion about how in the right you are? It's hard to believe that the editor who left <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=104614897&amp;oldid=104066563" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=104614897&amp;oldid=104066563" rel="nofollow">this</a> message on my talk page acknowledging that he had violated his own standards and engaged in less-than-civil discourse <i>could be</i> here before us now, utterly discounting the idea that anyone except "POV-pushers" could be recommending a block for someone who egregiously violated Wikipedia policy <i>because he egregiously violated Wikipedia policy</i>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:20, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

Both the technical evidence and other evidence is extremely compelling. On at least one occasion recently he forgot which account he was logged in as, and corrected a post made by another of his sockpuppets: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109082043" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109082043" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> He had also started using his sockpuppets to stack votes. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Good_article_review&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109412214" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Good_article_review&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109412214" rel="nofollow">[15]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Good_article_review&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109601331" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Good_article_review&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109601331" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></p>
<p>Even worse, he's been creating new sockpuppets since October 13, 2006, at the same time he was arguing that all evidence of his previous sockpuppeting should be removed, in return for him quietly leaving Wikipedia. In the end, huge amounts of material was deleted on his behalf, based on that promise. The timing of the creation of these new sockpuppet accounts shows that he was never serious about keeping his word. In fact, the very day the last piece of identifying evidence was removed, he created his second new sockpuppet.</p>
<p>This is exactly what he did in August 2006; his sockpuppet category was deleted then, on the promise of good behavior going forward, and he immediately went and created another bunch of sockpuppets. That time he (and his facilitators) claimed they weren't really "sockpuppets", but rather "alternative accounts" or "role accounts" or some such nonsense. The key for him is getting the evidence pages deleted; once the list of IPs is gone, it's much harder to tie the new sockpuppets to him.</p>
<p>Since his agreement to "go quietly in return for deletion" was with Jimbo, I've been in touch with Jimbo asking if I can now undelete the deleted materials, and tag and block his latest socks. Jimbo has given his full approval, and I have done so. I've also reverted and removed some of the material he created, though there's far too much of it to do in any thorough way. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:53, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have off-project reasons to beleive that these, and a couple more IDs, are indeed the same user. Basically all indications are that this is the same user that has recently been quite disruptive on the VirtualGlobetrotting website, at which I also moderate. To the point where he has become the only person to date to receive a total ban from the site, including being systematically IP blocked, which can only be done by the site's owner, not the moderators. I'm really not certain if it's appropriate to give out any more details than that, but, suffice it to say that I've not been too pleased the last few days to find myself having to interact with him here as well. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 15:09, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fayssal, if you can't see similarities in the edit patterns, then I think you might have clicked on the wrong contribs page.

<dd>Most of the edits to <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvader_Soap_969b.html" title="User:Invader Soap">Invader Soap</a>'s user page are from <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvader_Poonchy_01ff.html" title="User:Invader Poonchy">Invader Poonchy</a>, giving the firm link there.</dd>
<dd>My first interaction with Soap here on the project was him asking me to investigate why he could not access VGT. A quick investigation showed the above links, and thus gave me the answer that Soap was almost certainly Sklocke, and thus his problems were his having been IP banned from VGT. I let him know this fact, and declined to assist him in regaining access to VGT. The very fact that Soap was reporting to me symptoms of his having been IP blocked on VGT was additional evidence that he was the same person.</dd>
<dd>I'm going to point <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThisisbossi_e64b.html" title="User:Thisisbossi">User:Thisisbossi</a> to this discussion, as he's also been interacting with Zim/Soap/Sklocke, and has left several querries on some of their user pages asking if they were the same person. It would be interesting to hear from him why he came to that observation. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 16:16, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think that establishing that all of these accounts are the same user is of secondary importance right now; we need someone to reach out to the user and see if we can redirect his/her edits in a constructive direction. I'll leave a note on the talkpage of Invader Soap, but I don't have the time to mentor myself. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite">Ryanpostlethwaite</a> was willing to take a problem user under his wing before, I'll see if he'd be willing to do it now. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Train_c9b0.html" title="User:A Train">A Train</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/_/t/User_talk%7EA_Train_dd5d.html" title="User talk:A Train"><font color="DarkBlue">take the</font></a></small></sup> 16:21, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I am more than happy to take the user under my wing, but which one should I go for? It does seam clear that they are socks, but scanning through their contribs I believe that they are trying to make an active effort on wikipedia (even if they are possibly confusing it with MySpace). The sock issue is only going to be a problem if we can't clear this up with a bit of mentorship first. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 17:01, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suppose I may be a bit late at joining in on this discussion, but I first became curious about the possible suckpuppetry after seeing the aforementioned "oddball" page moves to articles such as <a href="../../../r/o/u/Roundabout.html" title="Roundabout">Roundabout</a>. After examining the contributions of the users performing the moves, I made comments on the user talk pages I had initially observed as bearing a correlation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Invader_Soap&amp;diff=108707256&amp;oldid=108224144" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Invader_Soap&amp;diff=108707256&amp;oldid=108224144" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sklocke&amp;diff=108706794&amp;oldid=102904223" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sklocke&amp;diff=108706794&amp;oldid=102904223" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADab235&amp;diff=108707048&amp;oldid=105008736" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADab235&amp;diff=108707048&amp;oldid=105008736" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>.

<dd>Expanding somewhat, deletion review is meant to be the final stop for reviewing deletions. We should be more reluctant to snowball close discussions there than we are elsewhere, because there isn't really anyplace else to turn short of ArbComm. We've already had one speedy deletion review close this week that generated more drama and wasted time than letting the discussion run would have, we don't need two. I'm very tempted to undo that deletion review close myself, as a regular closer of deletion reviews, but I have hopes that the admin that closed it will wise up and reverse themselves. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:52, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well that's where I'm confused, and the out of process deletion makes it far more confusing. What are we commenting on - the process (which is the standard topic for a DRV) or the article itself? If the former, then it's a clear overturn - it was inarguably not a valid CSD. If the latter, then some people are commenting on a different issue, and the discussion becomes that much harder to judge. So in this case, <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignoring rules</a> has left a confused mess with discussions being begun, moved and closed in an unreasonably short time frame.

<dd>I see no confusion. You write what you want to have happen with the article where the discussion is taking place. If you believe the encyclopedia is better without the article, you endorse the deletion. If you believe the encyclopedia is better with the article, you oppose the deletion. I know it's hard to distance onself from proccess wankery, but just do so.

<dd>To expand on the first quote "This page is about process, not about content, although in some cases it may involve reviewing content." We review content as needed to see if the process was correct. I think, when all is boiled down, this speedy deletion was done under the belief that doing so improved the encyclopedia. [WP:IAR]] is the policy authorizing such actions. So, if we should have an article then speedy deleting it didn't improve the encyclopedia, and if we shouldn't have an article then speedy deleting it did improve the encyclopedia... and both arguments are about whether the <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> policy was correctly used. There is a legitimate issue about whether <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> deletion was more efficient than another AFD would have been, but there are arguments that could be made (and I haven't seen yet) given the prior AFD history. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:20, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Yes well I put it in my sandbox initially but have removed that too though I have a copy in my office now. What I wanted was a place where those who want to edit the article while it is under review can do so. if I could do this at Talk:Daniel Brandt/temp I would do so but need advice first given the reactions to my creating on at Daniel Brandt// <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 20:38, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe the intent was to impress upon you the seriousness of trying to fork or recreate the article against the decision at DRV, which is basically what you were trying to do by editing it when the <s>current consensus is to endorse deletion</s> article is still under review. <font color="#1874CD"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 20:13, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's the problem - you cannot create copy-paste recreations of <b>deleted</b> content, because the history of the content <b>must</b> be visible to all users. You can create copy-past recreations of <b>existing</b> content because the history of that content continues to exist. My request that you stop being a <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a> was because your actions were transparently gaming the system. You've been an editor here for more than 4 years. You should know by now that recreating deleted content that is under active dispute is an agressive action - and that doing so while pretending to listen to an article template as a reason to go around a protected page, violate the GFDL and recreate content that has scores of users up in arms? Perhaps I went to far in assuming the effects of what you were doing. For that, I apologize. In the future, if you wish to restore content that is on a locked, blanked page, given your lack of experience with the GFDL and page protection policies, I suggest you come to me and I will tell you why you can or cannot take any given action - this will prevent eggregious violations of the GFDL, and actions that will anger wide swaths of the community. With that, I believe this problem has been solved.<a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 20:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So what about deleted content being moved to other sites that don't support a history mechanism? Is a link to DRV and an instruction to request a content review for history purposes sufficient? What about pages that link to wikipedia for it when the content <i>isn't</i> deleted, and then it later gets deleted?

<p>On February 19, User:Jance got into an edit war with me on my talk page when she deleted a list I was keeping of uncivil comments she had made to me.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATedFrank&amp;diff=109496555&amp;oldid=109496156" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATedFrank&amp;diff=109496555&amp;oldid=109496156" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> As a result, we were both blocked for 31 hours.</p>
<p>During the block, my work e-mail started receiving a variety of messages indicating that I had been signed up for a number of mailing lists: pornography, commercial marketing, etc. Someone had also used my personal information to sign me up for a mortgage loan application. Three of the e-mails--one from HornyMatches.com, one from Amigos.com, and one from BigChurch.com--indicated that someone had impersonated me and created an account in my real name and work e-mail address falsely claiming that I was a bisexual male who wanted to receive emails from couples for discreet sexual encounters. Those e-mails revealed the IP address of the person who had committed the impersonation: it was &lt;IP number redacted&gt;. &lt;diff redacted&gt; That IP address belongs to Jance. I will be happy to forward these emails to anyone who wishes to see them. At a minimum, these accounts were created to embarass and harass me; at worst, they were created in a fruitless attempt to offend my employer and get me fired. (Fortunately, my employer is used to its employees facing harassment, and I don't have it anywhere near as bad as my co-worker, feminist <a href="../../../a/y/a/Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali_4cc6.html" title="Ayaan Hirsi Ali">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a>.)</p>
<p>I have several different issues:</p>
<p>1) Do I have any recourse for this here? Is this sort of real-life harassment in retaliation for a Wikipedia edit war acceptable behavior on Wikipedia?</p>
<p>2) For full disclosure, Jance's dispute with me stems from the fact that I object to what I perceive to be the POV-slant of a variety of articles in my field of work, civil justice reform, where Jance and her predecessor editor identity, Jgwlaw, have made thousands of edits, often simply excising cited, verifiable, and notable information that supports reformers (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tort_reform_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=60242167" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tort_reform_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=60242167" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Contingent_fee&amp;diff=97305650&amp;oldid=91375273" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Contingent_fee&amp;diff=97305650&amp;oldid=91375273" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asbestos&amp;diff=59384787&amp;oldid=59067886" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asbestos&amp;diff=59384787&amp;oldid=59067886" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_malpractice&amp;diff=90175237&amp;oldid=90137999" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_malpractice&amp;diff=90175237&amp;oldid=90137999" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tort_reform_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64301519" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tort_reform_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64301519" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tort_reform_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64151638" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tort_reform_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64151638" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tort_reform_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64072107" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tort_reform_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64072107" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Edwards&amp;diff=61224765&amp;oldid=61029474" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Edwards&amp;diff=61224765&amp;oldid=61029474" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frederick_Baron&amp;curid=2617130&amp;diff=109253358&amp;oldid=109253239" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frederick_Baron&amp;curid=2617130&amp;diff=109253358&amp;oldid=109253239" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>). I wish for these articles to accurately reflect both the point of view of civil justice reformers and opponents. I have frankly acknowledged my <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>, have added POV tags to articles I have edited, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Baron_%26_Budd_Script_Memo_controversy_712c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Baron &amp; Budd Script Memo controversy">AfD tags to an article I created</a>, have attempted to restrict my edits to NPOV issues and comments on article talk pages about ways to restore NPOV.</p>
<p>This is complicated by the fact that Jance does not wish for me to perform any edits on any articles, and reverts my edits indiscriminately, and engages in personal attacks on the talk pages of articles where I participate, burying substantive discussion. She accuses me of a "stealth campaign" on behalf of my employer. (I do this as a hobby, and I'm not very stealthy when I use my real name and note on talk pages that I've written on the subject.) This accusation is ironic, because in real life, Jance is affiliated with a left-wing think-tank funded by indicted plaintiffs' law firm Milberg Weiss where she has the title of "Wikipedia Editor" on their weblog, where she is identified under her real name as a blogger. Unfortunately, I am prevented from raising the issue of Jance's <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>, because Jance takes the position that she is actually anonymous, that I cannot raise her COI without violating Wikipedia rules, and that she will sue me if I reveal link to her webpage:</p>

<p>Her husband also emailed me threatening me with prosecution for "stalking" (again, ironic, given the actual identity theft committed by Jance).</p>
<p>An editor warned Jance about such litigation threats, and she has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jance&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109841675" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jance&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109841675" rel="nofollow">deleted the warning on her talk page</a>.</p>
<p>I don't even think a warning was necessary: Jance has previously been warned about this.

<p>3. Less seriously, but still annoyingly, there have been problems with <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> that are not being addressed, and, in fact, resulted in me being blocked because I tried to keep a list of them on my talk page:</p>

<p>I have other complaints about Jance's behavior, but I'd like to focus on stopping the personal real-life harassment.</p>
<p>I am happy to comply with Wikipedia rules, and I certainly don't want to be sued. I have learned that I need to focus on the substance of articles and edits, and avoid getting pulled into a mud-wrestling match. I just want to ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do I have any recourse on Wikipedia for this harassment and these threats of litigation from a recidivist?</li>
<li>Is there a way for me to raise what are NPOV and COI problems in dozens of articles without these incessant attacks or threats of being banned?</li>

<dd>Hm... for my part, I'm going to address the on-wiki aspect of this. Off-wiki activities do concern me, definitely, but that's going into an uncomfortable territory where (a) I don't know anything, for sure, and (b) I can't <i>do</i> anything, for sure -- it's too far out of what I guess I could call my "jurisdiction." But as for her on-wiki behavior, she's definitely upset, and should probably take a breather at the least. I do support a block under <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a>, although I'm concerned about what drove this editor (who's been with us at least since Nov 2006) so far over the edge. I've left a note on User talk:Sarah Ewart asking if she'd care to comment. There may be more to this story than is being presented here -- if so, that worries me. – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 23:23, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Needless to say, this is an extremely serious situation. Someone in a position to investigate this entire matter thoroughly needs to do so quickly and gather all information available from both parties. (I know people at a law firm that has been tangentially mentioned in this matter and therefore am not in a position to do this myself.) Allegations of real-life harassment, litigation threats, or other alleged off-wiki misconduct of the nature discribed should not be detailed further on Wikipedia. I see that a block has been imposed for legal threats, but even were that not the case, both parties should probably refrain from editing and certainly from any controversial editing until this situation has been addressed. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:32, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Note that Jance's userpage and talk page have been protected, stating she's a "banned user" - a block makes sense until this can be straightened out, but the b[an] word seems a bit premature, no? There's been a recent spate of on-wiki disputes escalating into off-wiki personal harassment - and way too much talk of lawyers, libel, and identity theft. For the love of God... it's just Wikipedia. Take the time you'd spend creating an attack page and go out to dinner with the spouse, play with the dog, walk around the lake, read a book, or do <i>something</i> to regain perspective.

<li>I don't use my work email for Wikipedia; any Wikipedia editing I do is in my spare time from my personal account. You would have to ask Jance how she obtained my work email address, though I can guess; it's not that hard to find out, since it's public so the press can contact me at my job. I don't blame Wikipedia for Jance obtaining my email address, never claimed that it was, and have no reason to believe that the Wikipedia entity has any legal culpability. I merely asked whether behavior from a user like this was considered acceptable conduct to intimidate other editors from participating.</li>
<li>I am quite confident that Jance is directly or indirectly responsible. As I documented above, several of the emails identified the IP address of the person who signed up my work e-mail address for the personal ad; as I documented above, the IP address corresponds to Jance's Wikipedia editing. I'll be happy to forward you these emails and the diff where Jance acknowledges that the IP address is hers, which Newyorkbrad redacted from my post. And if that's not enough, Theresa Knott's 06:28, 22 February 2007 comment says that Jance acknowledges her husband sent the emails. (Jance has yet to acknowledge this to me personally, and I have not received any sign of remorse or apology or responsibility from either of them. Rather, Jance's husband implausibly claimed that his IP had been hacked, and that there had been a remarkable coincidence that the hacker who just happened to hack their IP had happened to target the person whose Wikipedia talk page Jance had been blocked for edit-warring on, and then threatened me not to pursue the matter further.)</li>
<li>Even if Jance is correct that it is her husband who performed the actual harassment, rather than her personally, I believe the two should be held jointly responsible. On the weblog of the left-wing think-tank, Jance and her husband identify themselves jointly as affiliated with their anti-reform project by real name as "Civil Justice Wikipedia Editors". And the two of them previously tag-teamed editing articles together.</li>
<li>NB also Droliver's comment above, which suggests that this is not the first time Jance and/or her husband took this tack to harass editors who disagreed with their POV-pushing. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 13:50, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This whole mess looks like it's just about ready for arbcomm. As far as I can tell from the history (see particularly AN/I <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive202_d663.html#Please_stop_abuse_and_use_of_my_and_my_spouse.27s_real_name" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive202">here</a> and Sarah Ewart's talk archive <a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarah_Ewart_Archive12_d92c.html#Jance" title="User talk:Sarah Ewart/Archive12">here</a>, Jance objects to links to a page identifying her real name, or the use of phrases sufficient to identify that page. TedFrank originally offered those pages to rebut conflict of interest charges (through some kind of <a href="../../../k/e/t/WP%7EKETTLE_583e.html" title="WP:KETTLE">pot-kettle</a> argument or to show that Jance's identity is not private. Ted apologized for using Jance's name but continues to refer to her webpage. Jance has threatened a bunch of lawsuits and, if Ted is right, Jance and/or her husband has started a campaign of off-wiki harassment. Unless the parties are willing to mediate, I would recommend some quick admin action, followed by arbitration. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 14:41, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, please read the discussion on Dab's talkpage, where I've provided some of the relevant diffs. Haphar's exchanges with Blnguyen date back to the ArbCom election but most recently from February 12-13: his comments on his talkpage consist of aggressive incivility, accusations, taunting and insulting him. This recent flare-up this clearly constituted harassment of Blnguyen. As for prior warning, Haphar has been warned in the past about civility/personal attacks and has been blocked for excessive incivility in the past as well. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="green"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 16:08, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've talked to RA about it now, and I can see his point. He is under a lot of pressure, and rash actions are bound to occur in such a situation. My remaining gripe is just that there should have been a warning. Even just a curt "this is your one and only warning". We let Haphar bicker and pester for days on end, and one morning he finds himself blocked as it were out of the blue. I am not into giving out five stages of warnings in clear cases of bad faith, but this was a somewhat obnoxious debate, not vandalism. That's really it. I can see how the block is justified. There should have been a warning. RA could do with constructive help in his admin workload (the "Indo-Pak mess") in general. thanks, <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 16:12, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Dab and completely respect that admins must warn in good faith, no matter what the situation may be, but I would just like to mention the following for the record of the discussion here. Actually this is an interesting edit summary used by Haphar just 1 day ago, where he is advising Blnguyen to "maintain civility:" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blnguyen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110023019" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blnguyen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110023019" rel="nofollow">Please do maintain civility + who's doing a windup now</a>. It is clear that Haphar was aware of policies (and using them to taunt Blnguyen) and thus merited no particular warning. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="green"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 16:40, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I am referring this case directly to the ArbCom to look at possible remedies for all parties involved up to and including desysopping, blocking, etc. I have absolutely no opinion on the actual content question (Should we have an article about him? I don't care) but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Daniel+Brandt" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Daniel+Brandt" rel="nofollow">this log</a> is a disgrace.</p>
<p>Different people played different roles. I do not have time to sort it all out <b>today</b>, so I am referring most of it to the ArbCom. I have instantly desysopped Yanksox, though, because he's basically begging for it. I have temporarily desysopped Geni and Freakofnurture pending the ArbCom thinking it through.</p>
<p>Here's the action count:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yanksox - out of process deletion coupled with an insult, 2 deletions</dd>
<dd>Geni - 3 restores</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Freakofnurture - 2 restores</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Bumm13 - 1 restore</dd>
<dd>Deskana - 1 delete</dd>
<dd>Doc Glasgow - 1 restore</dd>
<dd>Mailer Diablo - 1 restore</dd>
<dd>CesarB - 1 delete</dd>
</dl>
<p>I know how these things go. Some of the people involved were trying to calm things down. Others were merely trying to cause more disruption and fighting by engaging in inflammatory actions designed to outrage the other side. It is hard to sort it all out.

<p>FWIW, Jimbo is right that the wheel warring is a disgrace. I didn't realise there was quite so much back and forward when I re-deleted it. I simply wanted to keep the DRV debate on course.

<p>Any chance we can start a civil discussion on how to move forward with the article? My neck almost snapped in the wheel war over whether it should be discussed at AfD or DRV. The currently open DRV contains much discussion about process and attempts to assign motives to those on the other side of the dispute, but little discussion about the actual article (though Doc and Eloquence have made good points, on different sides of this question). <a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObiterDicta_b9a4.html" title="User:ObiterDicta"><b>ObiterDicta</b></a> <small>( <a href="../../../o/b/i/User_talk%7EObiterDicta_88da.html" title="User talk:ObiterDicta">pleadings</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ObiterDicta_3d4c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ObiterDicta">errata</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_ObiterDicta_8ff5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/ObiterDicta">appeals</a> )</small> 23:12, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was the correct action to take, not that <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> needs my endorsement for his actions.

<p>(edit conflict x2) Can we try to limit the firestorm? One DRV (for discussing the deletion/restoration of the article) and one ArbComm case (for the wheel warring) seem adequate for central discussion places.

<dd>I like you more and more every day, (jarbarf). There is deletion outside of speedy deletion by IAR (I do it semi-regularly if the situation warrants).

<dd>There may be more to it than "making a mistake". I note that Yanksox blanked his user and talk pages *before* deleting the Brandt article (with the summary "My, My. Hey, Hey / Won't you let me burnout or fadeaway?") - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Yanksox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Yanksox" rel="nofollow">logs</a>. I really hope this isn't a case of a burned-out administrator going kamikaze and doing something that he knew would get him desysopped. I've seen that happen before, unfortunately... -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 00:53, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Too bad that the proposal for timed desysoping never went anywhere. A month or two without the tools would seem appropriate. Desysopped, what's the chance they will ever get through RfA? And without any desysopping, what's the message that JW, ArbCom, and the rest of the admins send to regular editors? Regular editors would have been blocked for reverting edits the way these guys reverted deletes. I've learned to talk first, before running to revert. I expect that an admin, looking at the log, would contact the deleting or reverting admin <b>before</b> acting. They certainly should not be able to the same thing, but with greater consequences for the project, without consequences to themselves.</dd>

<dd>That's another good point i've seen, how administrators apparently have a different set of rules applied to them compared to us "ordinary" users. There should be one set of standard, uniform rules for everyone, from Jimbo on down. And if Jimbo breaks them, he should be blocked. That is the only way Wikipedia can avoid issues like these in the future, which will probably destroy it sooner or later. This stuff seems to happen all the time, and eventually it'll happen on a page or an area where the "real world" law will get involved like the <a href="../../../f/u/z/Fuzzy_Zoeller_645c.html" title="Fuzzy Zoeller">Fuzzy Zoeller</a> article.

<dd>It was more than just one mistake. And the penalties for misusing administrator tools are necessarily very high. I don't think anything unfair here happened. Get into a wheel war and you can lose your adminship privileges. That's been the rule for over a year.

<dd>After 10 edit conflicts, I also disagree with a permanent desysopping, though something had to be done in order to prevent escalation. Let the ArbCom decide what to do with it, and in the mean time, warn all involved parties that they will be desysopped if the wheel warring continues, and delete the article until a real DRV completes. <a href="../../../s/t/4/User%7EST47_d0a2.html" title="User:ST47">ST47</a><small><a href="../../../s/t/4/User_talk%7EST47_ecf4.html" title="User talk:ST47">Talk</a></small> 23:22, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not regret the deletion I did; I had partial information when I deleted (I did not know the problematic revisions had been oversighted). I also agree with <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" title="User:Freakofnurture">Freakofnurture</a>'s last restore, which was just after mine; Freakofnurture might either have seen when on IRC the administrator who originally selectively deleted the problematic revisions said they were oversighted, or have seen the comment a few sections above (answering my comment on why I did the delete) which also said these revisions were oversighted (in fact, Freakofnurture just said on IRC, while I was writing this, that the information came from the IRC discussion). That particular restore is not a symptom of a wheel war; it's merely undoing a mistake on my part (and I fully approve of that restore). I also deleted several redirects to the deleted article (while it was still deleted), and their corresponding talk pages; I fully intend to restore them if/when the article is restored, after the dust settles (restoring before it's all settled would just lead to more delete/undelete cycles). --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 23:27, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The first restoration by me came after I had read the top deleted revision in its entirety and saw no sign of unsourced negative material. I was unaware that it had been restored and re-deleted during the time that I was reading the article. The second restoration by me came after I spoke to CesarB about the possible presence of revisions that needed to be removed from the database. He assured me that any necessary <a href="../../../o/v/e/WP%7EOVERSIGHT_fcd3.html" title="WP:OVERSIGHT">WP:OVERSIGHT</a> had been performed. I restored the article and protected it in the blank "see deletion review" state, so that interested parties at the deletion review discussion could easily see the content which allegedly violated <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, and which I had, in good faith, fully examined and concluded that was compliant with that policy. I have nothing else to say in my own defense. In defense of Geni, I will say that he is a fine administrator and the authority whom I most frequently consult on issues relating to image copyright law, and that to deny him the ability to serve the project in that capacity whould be a huge disservice to the Wikipedia community. In defense of Yanksox, I will say that the location of his personal attacks is not relevant. Anybody can make a personal attack with or without admin access, and despite being the butt of his rhetoric, I do not believe that should be a factor in considering his status as an administrator. —<tt class="plainlinks"><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Freakofnurture_77c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Freakofnurture">freak</a>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>)</b></tt> 23:39, Feb. 23, 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since nobody's asked yet, or at least not asked here, I will: Are we permitted to put the 3 people you desysopped back through a normal RfA after the DRV and related disputes have calmed down, or is this being dealt with through arbcom, or is Jimbo declaring them unfit for adminship permanently? --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 23:33, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Jimbo "temporarily desysopped Geni and Freakofnurture", which implys his desysoping of Yanksox was permanent. Which raises the question of exactly what is permanent. I would assume it means Arbcom can't resysop him, but can do so to the others. However, Arbcom could probably allow Yanksox to be resysoped though RfA. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 23:41, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd recommend trying semi-protection, before you break out the heavy tools. Rangeblocks are <i>effective</i>, yes, but they can also cause nasty collateral damage, upset otherwise happy people, and turn away potential contributors. They should be kept as short and rare as circumstances allow. If anybody wants to block a range, on this, WHOIS suggests 12.216.96.0/20 <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_12.216.96.0_20_ea3f.html" title="Special:Blockip/12.216.96.0/20">(block)</a>. Let's see how semi-prot works out; that may be sufficient in this case. – <span style="font-family: Garamond"><a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin"><font color="#1E90FF"><b>Luna Santin</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELuna_Santin_c747.html" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)</span> 08:07, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
