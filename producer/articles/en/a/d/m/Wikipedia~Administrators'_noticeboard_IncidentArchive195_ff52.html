<p>Hi can you help me with this fellow who is threatening to block me, merely because I pointed ourt to him that the Jat page was biased and not a neutral point of view. He also removed my disputed fact tags without a discussion. Please help. --<a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikh-history_70b0.html" title="User:Sikh-history">Sikh-history</a> 22:54, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Take the warning I gave and do not try to hide it by removing it from your talk page. You deleted a whole section out from the article without consultation or agreement. You cannot and people like have come wikipedia before who try to push their views you will be stopped - you WILL NOT be allowed to delete entire sections from articles without consultation agreement with the rest of us Wikipedians--<a href="../../../j/a/t/User%7EJat78_4ff5.html" title="User:Jat78">Jat78</a> 23:40, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You dileberately removed dispute tags from the Jat page. You are acting beyond your authority as vandal patrol. I will see to it you are reported and removed as you are pushing a biased point of view with non-verifiables sources. Your attempts to add Patiala, Nabha and Jind as Jat Kingdoms, rather than Sikh Kingdoms (as they are in reality will faiil). Also the sources used to back the article Dudhee etc are not scholarly works.

<dd>Please can someone neutral have a look at this.<a href="../../../j/a/t/User%7EJat78_4ff5.html" title="User:Jat78">Jat78</a> is clearly biased, and has added a warning to block me for no good reason. He did not even discuss my edits and why I moved the Patiala, Nabha and Jind article. I need mediation on this. The Jat article in itself is a POV, but I am not concerened with that. I am only concerened with Patiala, Nabha and Jind being included as "Jat Kingdoms", when they clearly are Sikh Kingdoms. I have provided verifiable sources to back this up.

<dd>Yes you can please. I contend that the Patiala, Nabha and Jind articles, should not be listed under Jat. I can provide verifiable sources. These Kingdoms should be posted under the Sikh stub. Also, the warning added by <a href="../../../j/a/t/User%7EJat78_4ff5.html" title="User:Jat78">Jat78</a> to my page is unfair. He deliberately removed my dispute tags from the Jat page, and when I removed Patiala, Nabha and Jind to the Sikh page he added a warning to my page. Unfair and underhand. We need constructive discussion and not autocratic acts. Ironically I am a Jat too, but I am also Sikh. I therefore tend to have an insight into both worlds.--<a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikh-history_70b0.html" title="User:Sikh-history">Sikh-history</a> 13:08, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

No edits by Sikh 1 occurred between my warning and Mango's block.

<dd>Thanks for the advice, but... there isn't really a dispute, as currently neither he nor his opponents are actually trying to change the article or bringing forward any tangible thesis or proposal. It all doesn't rise above a constant bickering and nagging about being unhappy at not seeing the terms "Albanian" and "Greek" less often or more often in the text, and accusing everbody else of being prejudiced, nationalists, bigots, etc. But it makes the talkpage an absolute mess for later reference, and it carries a constant risk of having the whole situation explode into a big editwarring shoot-out. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 15:24, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>It seemed to me that that was not only out of process, but also not excusable on grounds of avoiding unnecessary bureacracy, etc. I therefore deleted the article (as illicitly recreated after an AfD), and prevailed upon Royalguard11 to go to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>.

<dd>That would be great advice if I'd asked what I should do next — but I didn't. I asked whether it was acceptable for an admin to go against what he'd said was consensus at an AfD because he had personally changed his mind in the light of new evidence, and whether it was OK for another admin to close a DRV request early when this had happened. If the answers to these questions are yes, I'd like to know the reasoning (though whatever the reasoning, it seems to me to tarnish the process). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 16:09, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AFD is not a vote. As a general comment, circumstances sometimes change, and AfD consensus should never override common sense. In this specific case, the correct thing to have done in the would have been to reopen the AFD, which is what I will do now. (The current page looks like a delete to me. I've defluffed and despammed it and I still don't think it's a keep.) I'm not sure DRV is appropriate, given that we aren't trying to overturn an AFD, but to get it enforced. In either case, why isn't there a note on the RSD talk page mentioning the AFD and the DRV?

Fair enough, but that removed a number of contributors' comments, and he didn't bother to tell anyone he'd done it. Many editors involved were obviously watching the page, so went back to add themselves again, but two apart from me seem not to have seen what happened. I've now informed them, but this is becoming a farce. If I thought that Royalguard11 was actually trying to skew the result, I'd be furious, and taking this elsewhere — but so far as I can see, it's just carelessness and poor judgement (and discourtesy). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 22:11, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, first, opening a new AfD was unnecessary. Secondly, not telling at least three people who had contributed to the discussion (one of whom, me, was hardly low profile in the whole affair — and in fact I don't know that it was only three; I only know that three people hadn't noticed what was going on by the time I found out) was at best careless. Thirdly, he didn't change the notice at the article to point to the new AfD, and has never explained at the article's Talk page what's happened (either his original AfD close as delete, nor his unilateral change of mind in defiance of the consensus at AfD, nor his switching to a new AfD in the middle of the discussion. Someone else has done these things for him (in the case of the Talk page with the misleading claim that the original AfD closed as "keep", which I'll change). It's been a shambles, I'm afraid. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 21:15, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>It appears that the source may not be <i>fake</i> as much as misunderstood.

If you plug in the birthdate, it's listed in the comments. Thus, it's not reliable and shouldn't be sourced to that place, BUT very well could have been a good faith error. I looked at a couple of the other birthdate additions he did and they checked out, so I think this is a massive misunderstanding, IMO. More to the point, I'd hate to see us block a guy on a mistake any of us could realistically make. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:36, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>My question is, why is this person so interested in making sure that Wikipedia contains the exact birthdates of juvenile rape victims? What on Earth does it encyclopedically add? <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 21:42, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is off the wall. I'm tempted to almost ask for deletion of all difs that mention them if not outright oversigt. This is unacceptable. At this point we often make a point of not adding birthdates of people in general to prevent assistance with identity theft and/or harassement of the more borderline notable people. To do so with juvenile rape victims is disgusting. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:48, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>(editconflict - answer to above - nothing - ban user) So basically, what you're saying is that his sole goal appears to be inserting personally identifiable information about rape victims into their articles on Wikipedia, that he frequently uses poor sourcing and is intransient when confronted. This is a reason NOT to block him why, exactly? I consider his edits that reveal poorly sourced birthdates of rape victims a clear violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, and intend to revert them on sight.

<li>Because I saw it pop up on the watchlist, and noticed that the link that this guy gave pointed to a cache that had the birthdate listed in it. Given that we seemed ready to block an editor with a long history over what may have been a misunderstanding, why not? He accuses me of stalking any time I pipe up somewhere near him anyway, so I may as well just ignore it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:47, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<pre>
UPS Store locations are supplied with materials and goods at dimunitive prices. Thus the
expense is minimal and the potential for high retail markup is limitless. Studies show that 9
out of every 10 UPS Store owners belong to high profile Asian families. The ability of these
owners to generate a constant flow of revenue is due to the consistent supply of cheap
products and even cheaper labor. UPS Store employees are often High School Dropouts with
little or no social or cognitive ability. Management positions are occupied by younger
relatives, usually nephews of the owner, who perform minimally in their job requirements and
possess a less than adequate command of the english language.

<dd>Not to completely come to his aid, because I dont know the user and there could be some LaRouche history im unaware of, but opposition to free trade is a mainstream, although not majority, ideal.

<dd>Free trade may be an issue that generates varied opinions, but LaRouche is just about the only person who traces his opposition to free trade to Carey, List, and the American System. As a test try Googling [Friedrich List Henry Carey "American System" -wikipedia] and see whose websites pop up most frequently. When I try at least half of them are LaRouche sites, or posting elsewhere by movment writes (for example, <a href="http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/cgi-bin/blogs/voices.php/2005/09/20/cheney_s_permanent_war_permanent_revolut" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/cgi-bin/blogs/voices.php/2005/09/20/cheney_s_permanent_war_permanent_revolut" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>). The 19th century American System is a major tenet of the LaRouche movement, rarely mentioned by anyone else. In our own experience on Wikipedia, LaRouche-related editors have sought to promote its importance, and the importance of specific people, in countless articles in ways which further their worldview. It's important to remember that we don't ban LaRouche concepts from Wikipedia outright, but they should stay in one of the numerous articles we have about him, his viewpoints, his associates, his political parties, etc. His views could easily fill a wiki of their own, but Wikipedia is not that wiki. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 06:57, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Everything that I said in my edits (except for the quote from <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_McKinley_c296.html" title="William McKinley">William McKinley</a>) is in those articles. None of it was sourced to Lyndon LaRouche. Those individuals I cited held those views long before Lyndon LaRouche ever existed. It seems that you are being very selective here, because there are many other views held by LaRouche, such as the view that the Bush administration misrepresented or invented intelligence to get the US to go to war against Iraq. Does WB intend to go around threatening editors who make reference to this POV, accusing them of promoting "LaRouche-derived theories"? Ah, you might ask, but LaRouche is not the only one who has that POV. Well, surprise! That is also true of historical opposition to free trade in the U.S. If WB wants to be consistent, he should argue for the deletion of the articles <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Carey_317f.html" title="Henry Carey">Henry Carey</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_List_d948.html" title="Friedrich List">Friedrich List</a>, instead of bullying me for trying to cite them. --<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHonourableSchoolboy_09e2.html" title="User:HonourableSchoolboy">HonourableSchoolboy</a> 07:27, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your snide tone is not helpful. I've read the ArbCom ruling. It applies to OR from LaRouche. My edits had <i>nothing to do with LaRouche.</i> That's the whole point. And as far as the sourcing, the sourcing was primarily from <i>other Wikipedia articles</i> that were linked. Clearly, you don't like the quote from William McKinley, but there is only one on-line source. I have offered to get a different cite for it from a book, which I will do shortly. WB's bullying is uncalled for. --<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHonourableSchoolboy_09e2.html" title="User:HonourableSchoolboy">HonourableSchoolboy</a> 01:40, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The above is baseless accusation. The author of the above was asked to quote Mallory on Scythians and he did not. He glossed over the important parts of Mallory about Scythians and he did not know I had the book in my personal library. Instead he is extrapolating some ideas which are not related to Scythians from pages not relavent to Scythians. The discussion is perfectly scientific and there is no personal attack. I am just quoting many sources including Britannica 2007 and Encarta and etc. The above author does not like the sources, so he deletes them, or weakens them and brings his own theories (some from 1911 whereas if I am correct, it is year 2007 now). The above user even thought that Hermatta madeup the term Khotanese Saka..The above user is not a scholar of Scythians and yet he insits on pushing his viewpoints from extrapolating materials from authors who have not claimed what he is claiming. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 00:51, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Above I supplied userlinks to facilitate independent investigation. The disruptive reverts are systematic and organized over a long period of time and directed against the contributions of many people. Conflicts are staged and arguments, whenever used, cliché (f.i. "removal of sourced information"). Truth is presented by begging the question, without the required reference to current discussion or supplying required information. Hypercritical disposal of arguments is mounting to an inacceptable degree of non-scientific negationism, as can be demonstrated by the above accusation where A.D. calls my extensive supply of quotes and contextual information (<a href="../../../s/c/y/Talk%7EScythians_dee3.html#Origins_.28Third_party_review.29" title="Talk:Scythians">Talk:Scythians#Origins (Third party review)</a>) "glossing", or by insinuations on details not even mine (like the above reference to Harmatta).

<dd>Actually Wikipedia is not a place for independent investigation. It quotes scholarly sources.

I looked at the Protest Warrior, Free Republic, and Democratic Underground articles since I suspected that they would be flashpoints for conflict and this was immediately confirmed. I quickly learned about diffs, talk pages, archives and about contribution histories. What they're doing is not right.

He keeps "representing" Bryan here on Wikipedia - at least twice that I know of he has posted the permablocked Bryan's words as a proxy.

<dd>Seconded. Ben and FAAFA, while I have no objection to your other activities, the two of you are way too tangled up in this to have any sort of an unbiased opinion.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the specifics, as I said in email, I would neither be suprised if it turned out that this was a sock, nor if it turned out that an uninvolved person had reacted that badly on initially seeing the earlier Free Republic fracas. The edits are suspiciously mature for such a new, uninvolved user - I remain very suspicious - but I would personally be willing to assume good faith and watch them. If they voluntarily agreed not to edit the Free Republic article directly, working through the talk page as Dean is, and to avoid engaging FAAFA and Ben, it might work out ok. That said, I wouldn't unilaterally unblock on good faith myself if I could (and I can't, not being an admin yadda yadda).

<li>Me, I am an evil suspicious bastard. A couple of token edits, then posting to an RfC using a term which only this account and Hinnen have ever used ("street gang", rather than the more WP-usual "cabal"), registering a "meatpuppet" RFCU with the 8th edit at BenBurch, displaying knowledge of policy and claiming this is because he's learned about diffs, histories, talk pages and archives <i>before</i> pitching in? How many new users manage to learnt eh Byzantine complexities of Wikipolitics before hitting a dozen edits? Just how likely <i>is</i> that? Plus, the tone looks far too much like DeanHinnen. Clinching factor: do we need yet another partisan combatant bringing the Free Republic battle to Wikipedia, even in the unlikely event that this was <i>not</i> yet another sock of a known sockpuppeteer?

<p>I have noticed a similarity in style between the edits of User:Wbrz and numerous anons in the editing of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudette_Colbert_9bf2.html" title="Claudette Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a> (now semi-protected) and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Talk%7EClaudette_Colbert_5afa.html" title="Talk:Claudette Colbert">Talk:Claudette Colbert</a> (unfortunately not semi-protected). All are pushing a very similar POV, and they all use a similar indiosyncratic grammar (English seems not to be the first language of either the registered user or of the anons). Some vandalism has been appearing from the same various anons on my talk page (now semi-protected), and since semi-protection, on my user page. All harmless but annoying. My name is also appearing in senseless comments being left on the talk pages of other editors. For example, another editor has left 3 vandalism warnings at <a href="../../../2/1/8/User_talk%7E218.217.208.119.html" title="User talk:218.217.208.119">User talk:218.217.208.119</a>. One of them is for an edit to my user page, but the other edits are both directed at me. It's so stupid, the edits basically say "User Rossrs, an admirer of Vivien Leigh" which makes no sense whatsoever, and is harmless but I'm getting tired of seeing my name in these bizarre edits. Similarly, a string of reversions to <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudette_Colbert_9bf2.html" title="Claudette Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a> on Feb 3 are directed at me personally, with my user name in each edit summary. (although the summaries make no sense at all). Actually this started about a week ago when I reverted some edits by User:Wbrz on the <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivien_Leigh_c566.html" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a> article - I left a message at <a href="../../../w/b/r/User_talk%7EWbrz_e008.html" title="User talk:Wbrz">User talk:Wbrz</a> which received no acknowledgement, however the anons have had quite a lot to say about me ever since.</p>
<p>I think it's likely User:Wbrz and the anons are the same person, and I've noticed a couple of edits that duplicate language used elsewhere. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Rossrs&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106253450" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Rossrs&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106253450" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> to <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossrs_5806.html" title="User talk:Rossrs">User talk:Rossrs</a> is identical to edits made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:D_C_McJonathan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106254601" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:D_C_McJonathan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106254601" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and both were made by <a href="../../../2/1/8/User%7E218.217.208.119.html" title="User:218.217.208.119">User:218.217.208.119</a>.

<dd>The editors in question returned to a more NPOV, and better, state of each page. To declare Hinduism a 'mythological' set of ideologies would be as insulting as to call all of YOUR beliefs 'mythological' and be similarly dismissive. It's a religion, and thus a set of beliefs. 'Mythological' often implies that they are 'false' or 'dead' ideas, which Wikipedia can't decide upon. Jesus, Mohammed, and Buddha might be 'mythical' too, in the eyes of some, but we can't make that judgement. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 22:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

Instead, it seems more like it's <a href="../../../w/a/v/Waving_the_bloody_shirt.html" title="Waving the bloody shirt">waving the bloody shirt</a> than actually explaining the subject of the article. <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_fundamentalism.html" title="Religious fundamentalism">Religious fundamentalism</a> has a specific meaning, as described in the article, in addition to its use as a term of derision. <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> is a poor match with <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_fundamentalism.html" title="Hindu fundamentalism">Hindu fundamentalism</a>, so the redirect you want does not make much sense.

<p>Resetting the indents(The following was first posted on Neptunion's UserTalk page)::::I think you're still unclear as to the differences between good faith edits and vandalism. For one, good faith edits are those which can be rationally explained by the editor making the change; his reasons may be falsely held beliefs, or even patently demonstrable as outright falsehoods, but teh edit was made in the spirit of improving Wikipedia. A vandalous edit would be soemthing in which vulgarity is added, information is randomly removed (this is often referred to as 'blanking', when applied to a large quantity of text), or in which malicious changes are made. Seen in this light, redirecting Hindu fundamentalism to the larger article on Religious Fundamentalism, instead of one of the Right-Wing groups in India would be a Good Faith edit, especially since directly tying only ONE group in India to Hindu Fundamentalism makes numerous fallacious constructs, including:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Ignoring any and all other right-wing indian groups IN India</li>
<li>Ignoring any and all other Hindu Fundamentalist groups outside India</li>
<li>Suggesting that the agenda of the group it linked to was ONLY Hinduism in it's reactionary ways, and not nationalistic or possessed of any other agendas.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>As such, the edit in question is CLEARLY a <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Good Faith</a> edit. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 03:20, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well that was my comment on his talk page that seems to have started all of this. He made some edits to <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivien_Leigh_c566.html" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a> about a week ago. I reverted them. I then started reverting some edits on the Claudette Colbert article, and he started putting "Rossrs, an admirer of Vivien Leigh" in edit summaries, on talk pages, on my user page, my talk page and the talk pages of other users. In the last day or so he's been directing the same comment at other users. I don't quite get the connection, but perhaps anyone who makes an edit to Claudette Colbert that he disagrees with, is motivated by the fact that they are a fan of Vivien Leigh. Not that it makes sense, but I can't see anything else. Who knows what he thinks.

<p>I hope someone can help with this difficult problem. I would describe this as sneaky vandalism, which includes "adding plausible misinformation" and "reverting legitimate edits with the intent of hindering the improvement of pages." This behavior has persisted off and on for many months or possibly years.</p>
<p>I and some other editors have been working to improve the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interlingua.html" title="Interlingua">Interlingua</a> article, and maybe get it to Good Article or Featured Article status. A few supporters of other <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliary_language.html" title="Auxiliary language">auxiliary languages</a> keep introducing and re-introducing incorrect information, jargon, personal observations, links to competing languages, and sometimes just bad writing. They say they are improving the article or removing subjectivity, but they are deleting sound, mostly sourced information and replacing it with unencyclopedic material. One of these people has somehow become an administrator of the Interlingua Wikipedia.</p>
<p>They tend to dominate the discussion page, so the good faith editors mainly comment in the edit summaries. And the whole situation has had a chilling effect, so that many of the good faith folks have stopped editing.</p>
<p>Now, someone (Dissident) has put up a series of tags reading "dubious," "neutrality disputed," and the like. The article is littered with tags and signs. Most of the challenged information is either sourced or is just basic grammatical material. In one case it's a quote from a book. The poster has demanded in the talk section, "<b>Don't</b> remove [the signs] without discussing it here…." But the talk section is kind of off-limits.</p>
<p>With all the interference, I don't see how we can ever get to Featured Article or Good Article status.</p>

<dd>I would start by removing any claims that it is easy to learn, easily understood if you don't know it, and makes learning other languages easier. Or give them hard factual citations, backed up by scientific study. And then give references for every fact in the vocab and grammar section, which at present have not a single reference. That seems to be the major contention in the talk page. Just reference everything, preferably across multiple sources. --<a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlf67_d959.html" title="User:Slf67">Steve <sub>(Slf67)</sub></a> <a href="../../../s/l/f/User_talk%7ESlf67_bed3.html" title="User talk:Slf67"><sup>talk</sup></a> 08:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Steve, thanks for your helpful suggestions. I will reference the Interlingua article more thoroughly. Scientific studies of auxiliary languages are unfortunately rare, but there are some that haven't been cited in the article yet.</dd>

<dd>In the meantime, can something be done about the tags and interference? It's difficult to edit with people stopping by and suddenly deleting parts of the article, making little plugs for a competing language, and the like. One editor even replaced a good URL with one that read "demon" and apparently carried a virus. You have to keep a close watch over the article or its quality can deteriorate in a surprisingly short time. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECal_Evans_6315.html" title="User:Cal Evans">Cal</a> 04:23, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Just smalltalk I suppose?<br />
<br />
Discussing it is, according to the admin, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Weregerbil&amp;diff=106375494&amp;oldid=106281424" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Weregerbil&amp;diff=106375494&amp;oldid=106281424" rel="nofollow">childish</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Weregerbil&amp;diff=106375494&amp;oldid=106281424" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Weregerbil&amp;diff=106375494&amp;oldid=106281424" rel="nofollow">sheesh</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Glen_S&amp;diff=106530734&amp;oldid=106530566" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Glen_S&amp;diff=106530734&amp;oldid=106530566" rel="nofollow">trolling</a>.

He decided all my points were trolling or incorrect, told me basically that everything was my mistake because I obviously didn't understand what I was doing, that I was trying to start a flame war, and that if I did not stop I wopuld be blocked. He then commented on my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MSJapan#Failure_To_Read_Complete_Articles_.26_Discussions" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MSJapan#Failure_To_Read_Complete_Articles_.26_Discussions" rel="nofollow">here</a> which is pretty much where I'm going to leave it, because there's no point in continuing the discussion.

<p>A user editing <i>Mega Man Battle Network</i>-related pages as well as voice actor pages for the series' anime continuously and deliberately mispells the Japanese name of the series (mispelling "Rockman" as "RockMan" despite having been directed to sources in the past proving the proper spelling, even though it should seem unnecessary), among other disruptive behaviors (vandalizing rōmaji to fit his/her edits for example).</p>

<p>I reported this on the vandalism page, and they sent me here, saying they deal only with "simple vandalism."</p>
<p>Since first taking an interest in <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Winer_e258.html" title="Dave Winer">Dave Winer</a> in late January, this user has blanked out the article, blanked entire paragraphs of the article, replaced the article with his own comments, etc. Now he has gotten more clever and is trying to diguise his POV attacks as a "content dispute."</p>
<p>There is consensus among all the other editors of this piece that Nirelan is working to remove information from the article that is accurate and verifiable, with good references from encyclopedia-quality sources, at the same time that he works to insert statements that have a much less firm foundation--for example, that Ramanatha V Guhan invented RSS (based on one interview with Guhan himself).</p>
<p>His heavily POV edit attempts are not improving the information content of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 17:09, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could we not spar about the meaning of inconclusive? :) I agree that precision is required. But to me, the editing patterns are more important, if several experienced editors say "same pattern" CU results do not matter. CU is imperfect, it can be fooled, and sometimes it can be inconclusive. Patterns are much harder to mimick if the contribution history is large enough. So I support a block for block evading sockpuppetry based on editors saying they see the pattern.

<p>For what it's worth, Light current all but announced his intention to evade the block a few days ago with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALight_current&amp;diff=105205214&amp;oldid=105204335" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALight_current&amp;diff=105205214&amp;oldid=105204335" rel="nofollow">this edit right here</a>. Combine this with his previous block evasions, and there should be no surprise here.

I suspect that if he actually respected the block he received and came back to make productive contributions, he wouldn't be hassled—in fact, I would actively intervene if he were. <i>However</i>, for whatever reason – be it a lack of self-control, a mental disorder, a need for attention, or just plain immaturity – Light current's current behaviour makes him unwelcome here. He can find another outlet and another audience elsewhere, if he wants.

<p>Well really, I think that all LC needs is some respect from Admins as to the work he has done, and for good faith to be assumed so that he can carry on his (generaly) good work. For instance Lc has been accused a number of times here of block evasion, but how do we know its him? Is it not just possible that LC is in fact just sulking somewhere in a corner at his treatment. I would suggest that the accusation of block breaking is not proven. If that is the case, I suggest also that we are doing LC a disservice by accusing him of that. Also I thikn we need to inform him as to the actual length of his block, so that we give him some light at the end of the tunnel. Whether lc will in fact come back if he is not banned is a further question, but one about which we can do very little. I think its beter to have lc on board rather than outside causing possible mayhem to those whim he thinks hav aggreived him.

<p>As someone who's tried speaking up for LC, can I just say how sad I am to see it come to this, but that I agree wholeheartedly that there was no other course of action open to you admins.

<p>To me, more important than the community ban question is the issue of how we deal with him from here on out. Since his primary purpose appears to be attention seeking, I second the suggestion above to ignore this as much as possible. Revert any bad edits, of course- probably block the accounts, but other than this, don't worry about it. The longer he sees his "name in lights" here on AN/I, the more he'll continue his attention seeking. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:22, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am asking for someone to take a look at the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephanie_Adams_6ac4.html" title="Stephanie Adams">Stephanie Adams</a> page to block or ban User Sean D Martin from editing the article. If you follow his talks and contributions, you will see that he has repeatedly made personal attacks to other users and even made several personal attacks to the woman the article is about (Adams).</p>
<p>This user seems to enjoy distorting facts provided on your site and even removes what little is written there to begin with. This is classified as what Wikipedia refers to as "sneaky vandalism" and has a direct "conflict of interest" with the person in the article because she (Adams) is suing someone he knows. (Please refer to the comments.)</p>
<p>I am not the only one who feels this way, as several others have left requests to ban or block the user from editing (as seen in the history of the article).</p>

<p>Lies and attackes are not being posted about you. You are trying to take away fom the quality of the article because you have some sort of personal conflict of interest with the person it is about (whom you do not even know). And Stephanie Adams IS suing someone you know (who has posted numerous defematory comments about her on some amateur site called Metadish) and you have put your name down as a witness to the defendant. 66.108.144.31 16:51, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>sigh</i> Yes, <b>lies</b>. And continuing to repeat them will not make them any more true. (And BTW, just HOW am I supposed to have a "<b>personal</b> conflict" with someone I "do not even know"?? Please make sense.) As for the lies: Again, Stephanie Adams is <b>not</b> suing anyone known to me personally. (She has threatened to sue a friend of mine, twice, and the fact that she hasn't carried thru and actually done so suggests how weak her position would be. But she is not currently suing anyone I know personally.) And just what am I supposedly a witness to? If you have facts, use them.

<dd>This is a ridiculous complaint and a waste of space. I dealt, somewhat severely I must confess, with Vintagekits <i>yesterday</i> re. 3RR, which he did not actually violate, although there was a minor spat of edit warring taking place. I have also warned Vintagekits about the "taunt", which again was fairly minor, but unhelpful in an overall antagonistic situation.

<p>I just wanted to know if anyone can copy/paste any of the warning templates anywhere? I would think that only people with admin rights could/should be doing that.

<dd>Any editor can issue a warning but that one was a bit much and I have told them that. At the same time saying the user in question has a fake name is in a bit odd in that I assume Fuzzone, as is CambridgeBayWeather, a fake name as well. Nor can I see why the IP should be Peter_johnson4. I would suspect that Peter_johnson4 was reacting to the IP's tags, which I have removed. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 19:30, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, today's main page FA, has been semi-protected. Is this really necessary? The vandalism by IPs was reasonably high but was being reverted quickly and I've seen past FA vandalism that was far worse and no protection resulted. It just looks bad if one of the first articles people see of <i>free encyclopedia anyone can edit</i> cannot in fact be edited by them. I thought there was a general consesus against protection of the main page FA? <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 18:51, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm inclined to agree -- protecting TFA is usually a net loss for our ideals, for a number of reasons (see <a href="../../../m/a/i/Wikipedia%7EMain_Page_featured_article_protection_4333.html" title="Wikipedia:Main Page featured article protection">Wikipedia:Main Page featured article protection</a>, which I now see is disputed, but it covers the general pros and cons pretty briefly). Vandalism is bad, but being "the free encyclopedia anyone can edit" is worth some sacrifices, I think. On the other hand, I prefer not to unprotect a page unless I'll be around to deal with potential problems, and I'll be heading off in about ten minutes... <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 19:54, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've removed the protection; as Luna pointed out, protecting it is contrary to one of our main tenants. I can understand protecting it for a short period if there is heavy vandalism, but it had been protected for a couple of hours when I turned it off; that's a bit too long, in my book. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 20:03, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have added factual information to the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> article and yet it is constantly being reverted without any reason being given and they are not discussing it in the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Talk%7EJapan_1094.html" title="Talk:Japan">Talk:Japan</a> page either. I have asked in the talk page why the information is being reverted and yet no reply is given. Considering that the information which is constantly being reverted is just well known facts I can't see any reason why it would be reverted other than for anti-Japanese sentiments, which I have concluded for myself is probably the reason after looking at the users talk pages and past contributions. Can someone please stop this 'vandalism' of the Japan article as it's being done to hinder the article in as much of a way as they think they can get away with, not to mention that this anti-Japanese sentiment has no place on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomethingoranother_1921.html" title="User:Somethingoranother">Somethingoranother</a> 21:21, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Common sense tells one that if even Czechs were direct speakers of modern Polish language, then they still would be belonging to the Southern Slavic peoples by their ethnicity. Ethnic Czechs during entire written history never were ethnic Lechs. This ethnic partition is older then any possible differentiation of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Slavic_language_d6f4.html" title="Proto-Slavic language">Proto-Slavic language</a>. However when they put all over the Wikipedia that Czechs and Slovak are together with Polish the Western Slavic peoples, then it is just not the truth... Even if Czechs, Slovak and Polish would be speaking the same language they still would belonged to different Slavic ethnicities. Lechs are not Czechs and every child in Poland knows that.</p>
<p>I found these false entires in <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_peoples.html" title="Slavic peoples">Slavic peoples</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Slavs_f56c.html" title="West Slavs">West Slavs</a> and <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechs.html" title="Czechs">Czechs</a> pages. I consider them to be ethnically incorrect and to be an ethnic vandalism on Wikipedia. I suspect some scientific paper about similiarities amongst Slavic languages is used by some crazy fringe nationalistic political elements to cause all those ethnical errors and lies about true Slavic Lechitic ethnic identity. I made couple edits to correct these errors on these pages, but I found myself overwhelmed, when they proved to be very extensive. I did also notify about my findings of this vandalism in the talk pages of these pages.
