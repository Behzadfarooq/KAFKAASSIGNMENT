As for the <i>Playboy</i> article, its co-author is reputed Elvis biographer <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alanna_Nash_eb91.html" title="Alanna Nash">Alanna Nash</a>. Therefore, I do not think that information from this article is poorly sourced. However, this is not the only source I have used.

<dd>Perhaps it's just that the Count is one of the few people who has the stamina to keep up with these readditions of tittle-tattle to articles on the obsessions of decades-old tabloids. (I used to try to keep up myself, but got bored, as the sex life, if any, and drug life, if I may call it that, of Presley was of even less interest to me than his music was.) Anyway, what's at issue is neither the Count's motivation or material attributed to most of the authors listed above; it's instead titillating tidbits attributed to a single unnamed article in an unspecified issue of <i>Playboy</i>: (i) why should we believe this; (ii) what relevance does it have to the subject of the article even if true; and (iii) even if it's credible and relevant, what significance does it have? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:13, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article has been written by Byron Raphael with reputed Elvis biographer <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alanna_Nash_eb91.html" title="Alanna Nash">Alanna Nash</a>. It is entitled "In Bed with Elvis" and appeared in November 2005 in Vol. 52, Iss. 11, of <i>Playboy</i>, p.64-68, 76, 140. It clearly shows that Elvis actually was not the womanizer and sex symbol many people belonging to the world-wide Elvis industry still wish to suggest. The problem is that there are a few Elvis fans who endeavor to suppress critical voices from the Wikipedia article, although the material has been published in books and articles. One of these people was <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETed_Wilkes_458b.html" title="User:Ted Wilkes">User:Ted Wilkes</a> who is now blocked for one year. Count Chocula and another anonymous user (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49691151" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49691151" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=49754348&amp;oldid=49752313" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=49754348&amp;oldid=49752313" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49691368" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49691368" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>) seem to follow his footsteps, as they are deleting well-sources references which are not in line with their personal opinion. It should be noted that there are statements in books by <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priscilla_Presley_9aa3.html" title="Priscilla Presley">Priscilla Presley</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzanne_Finstad_95b8.html" title="Suzanne Finstad">Suzanne Finstad</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/g/Peggy_Lipton_1244.html" title="Peggy Lipton">Peggy Lipton</a> and others in support of what has been written in the <i>Playboy</i> article. A Wikipedia article is not a fan site. It should give a balanced view of the star, his life, his personal relationships and his music. Significantly, Hoary is calling me "dread 141" on the <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">User talk:DropDeadGorgias</a> page claiming, without evidence, that he has "a hunch that a lot of the quoting by 141 is highly selective (or worse)" (although I have given the exact page numbers for my quotes) and that he "can't assume good faith" (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DropDeadGorgias&amp;diff=49756352&amp;oldid=49552653" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DropDeadGorgias&amp;diff=49756352&amp;oldid=49552653" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>), simply because my contributions are not in line with his positive view of Elvis. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 16:58, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There's a lot more heated discussion between them, but the part that caught my eye was that Conradi regularly creates diminuative names for those he deals with. For some, this may not be a big deal. For Simpson, it is a very big deal. Conradi calls Simpson "Willy". Simpson has expressed that he finds this extreamly offensive. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_April_15&amp;diff=48931271&amp;oldid=48930704" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_April_15&amp;diff=48931271&amp;oldid=48930704" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_April_11&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48720617" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_April_11&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48720617" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> show spots where Simpson has protested the name.</p>
<p>I gave Conradi a warning on his <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html#William_Allen_Simpson_vs_.22Willy.22" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">talk</a> page not to refer to Simpson like this any more, given how offensive Simpson was finding it. Conradi and I went back and forth a bit about <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, and Conradi's use of diminuatives. In the process he came up with a diminuative for me as well (Texy) ^_^;; Finally, within the last hour, Conradi posted a lengthy commentary on his user page about me and Simpson. In it he repeatedly used the "Willy" name for Simpson. Viewing this as flagrantly violating <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> despite being warned against exactly this type of action, I have given Conradi a 24 hour block for the continuing WP:CIVIL violations.</p>
<p>And none of this includes the fact that Conradi repeatedly calls Simpson a "liar" in almost any way he can without ever actually using the word "liar".</p>
<p>Anyway, Despite the fact that I am fairly well targetted in Conradi's user page commentary, I still consider myself an uninvolved admin, given that my only involvement has been totally on the technical side of the CFDs these two have been warring over. I really do not care about the outcome of any of their CFDs. I'm involved to the extent of warning Conradi, and following through on the warning when it was all but ignored. Yeah, Conradi skewered me pretty well in his commentary on hir user page, but if criticising an admin for giving out warnings was all it took to get the admin considered "involved", then the edit warriors would quickly rule the project.</p>
<p>I welcome review of my actions here, given that this is my first forray into this type of block. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 19:25, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Conflict in the fantasy world of Wikipedia was threatening to have a real world affect upon him, but rather than act to defend himself (which he could have done quite simply by requesting that I identify myself to Merkey) he came here to help defend Wiki. He did nothing but "Merkey nonsense", which is to say he tracked the sockpuppets of a banned user. If that is an undesirable activity then most of the Wiki admins have been guilty of it at one time or another. What made it grounds for an indefinite block in this particular case? No one ever suggested his activities were inappropriate (other than Merkey) until you lowered the boom. Why was there no warning, no discussion? This is not just idle curiosity. Editors really need to know if we should stop trying to identify sockpuppets of all banned users or if only Merkey enjoys such a protected status. — <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMediaMangler_0339.html" title="User:MediaMangler">MediaMangler</a> 00:58, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there. I'm getting a little too involved over at <a href="../../../r/a/27/Ra%27anana.html" title="Ra'anana">Ra'anana</a> and I'd appreciate another administrator coming in and laying down the law. The situation is this: a certain paragraph of the article is being aggressively defended by <a href="../../../i/s/r/User%7EIsraelbeach_1341.html" title="User:Israelbeach">User:Israelbeach</a>. The user has enlisted a sockpuppet, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidstone_7ba7.html" title="User:Davidstone">User:Davidstone</a>, and a probable sockpuppet, <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonnieisrael_553e.html" title="User:Bonnieisrael">User:Bonnieisrael</a>, to show "support" and to circumvent 3RR. This person has also erased a third user's comments from the talk page of the article.

I've already listed the article itself on RfC, but I think it is also time to set limitations on <a href="../../../i/s/r/User%7EIsraelbeach_1341.html" title="User:Israelbeach">User:Israelbeach</a>.

<dd>I'm dissapointed that nobody has stepped in to help. This user has apparantly been using wikipedia to publicise himself, his business and his <a href="../../../r/a/27/Ra%27anana.html" title="Ra'anana">custody battles</a> with his wife: his tactics (sockpuppets, erasing other users' comments, threatening legal action) are the tactics of a bully. I feel uncomfortable dealing with him on my own because I've already been accused of all sorts of personal interests. But if no other administrator feels that this justifies action - well, just one more thing to contribute to my rising sense that I don't belong here. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">Woggly</a> 06:19, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

I've attempted to engage Israelbeach in dialogue, and he seems totally focused on his own agenda. I've politely suggested to him that Wikipedia is not a soapbox; we'll see if he understands. He's pretty disingenuous; he points to an article he wrote himself as evidence that what he's saying is noteworthy. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 14:50, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

Notice the articles that Israelbeach et al have started, all seem to be about his personal friends and/or employees of his agency, the Israel News Agency: Joel Leyden, Charley Levine, Sara Silber, Chaim Emmett and <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Granot_5a4d.html" title="Archie Granot">Archie Granot</a>. For the record, I live and work in Israel, and have worked as a journalist for <a href="../../../h/a/27/Ha%27aretz.html" title="Ha'aretz">Ha'aretz</a> and for IDF radio (<a href="../../../g/a/l/Galatz.html" title="Galatz">Galatz</a>) - I've never heard of the Israel News Agency or any of these people before. In my opinion, none of them are notable enough to merit Wikipedia articles (several of these articles have in fact been nominated for deletion, but given benefit of doubt). I find Israelbeach's conduct on Wikipedia distasteful to say the least, and I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks he should be discouraged. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">Woggly</a> 17:14, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Deathrocker after being banned for a month for vandalising the Nu Metal article, went straight back after his block and vandalised it again changing it back to the version he last did before his block was imposed</p>
<p>Then he starts accusing Leyasu who i am not, of doing things he hasnt done, which is stupid, because i edit Wikipedia on a lot of different adresses and do lots of good work, and ive seen the vandalising of Deathrocker</p>
<p>I also know that Leyasu has a page of his user page detailing all of Deathrockers vandalism and that Deathrocker has vandalised Leyasus user page more than once</p>
<p>Also i changed the Nightwish article, not Leyasu, because someone vandalised it after it being a featured article</p>
<p>Deathrocker is a vandal, and should simply be ignored as he vandalised the article Nu Metal 4 times today</p>

<dd>I've went ahead and protected the page, since all anyone was doing here was reverting. Hopefully, now, you two can work this out on the talk page.

<dd>My immediate read on the situation is that you are correct: moving from one name to another but maintaining the original is a misuse of userspace: either he's using the name or he's not, and if he's not, then using the userspace to post, well, anything, goes against the tenet that Wikipedia <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">is not MySpace</a>. I'm not clear what this user means when he says "the only thing I did was to remove linking (the old userpage) to my new userpage," when he pretty clearly reposted what was up before. But whatever: I don't think this is worth getting too worked up about especially as it looks like it might just go away on its own. I think you're right in not reacting to the suggestions that you're anyone's sockpuppet (though admin actions are preventative, not punitive, right?) My conclusion would be to keep the redirect, though if he requests that the <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestyle.king_4eb8.html" title="User:Freestyle.king">User:Freestyle.king</a> page not redirect but instead be deleted altogether, eh, I don't see any huge problem with that. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 17:14, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to point out that User:McCready has been a prolific POV warrior during his/her short tenure here on wikipedia and has shown him\herself to be very difficult to work with.

<p>I fail to see how my comment constitued a "slur". Whether or not Slimvirgin was justified is central to your accusation. And your attitude as an editor needs to be shown in order for this to be established.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 08:58, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your allegation is that I am a POV editor and that is sufficient justification for SV revert. Not very logical, even if you allegation has merit. What you need to argue is why her reverts of criticisms of Slater were OK, why her removal of subheaders were OK, why her failure to discuss adquately is OK.

<dd>I doubt the proposal is going anywhere. This is nowhere near becoming accepted policy and most likely won't. I wouldn't say this debate rises anywhere near being disruptive for now. With seven to one against implementation (and by the way, there would be a whole lot more than eight votes before this became policy), it doesn't look like this has legs, so don't get too stressed about it. Have a cup of tea, let Francis present his best case, and have faith that the Wiki community will think the matter over and come to a conclusion that's best for the community and the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 16:13, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To get an updated edit count, you'll need to use an external tool, such as Flcelloguy's, or Interiot's javascript.". Therefore, we're referring editors for official decisions (whether you've got enough edits for adminship, etc.) to a tool that, according to its creator, will give them outdated and now static information. [Example: it has me 595 total edits, 307 mainspace edits. The JavaScript has me at 709 total edits, 323 mainspace edits. (I've been doing a lot of userspace work lately, as well as interactions in some mediation/etc. procedure.)] Can anything be done to systemetically catch all links to this tool wherever they've been mentioned in official language?

Still, <s>before I start doing that,</s> if edit counters need to be used in formal workings of Wikipedia, wouldn't it make sense to store the entire system not externally but in some sort of Wikipedia namespace?

<p><b>Issue taken care of</b></p>
<p>We really need <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_School_at_River_Ridge_804d.html" title="Trinity School at River Ridge">Trinity School at River Ridge</a> to be protected. It has been vandalized in a huge rush of attacks just today, and is still under attacks from various IPs. I only think a semi-protection is needed, but if you think that a full protection would be necessary, then so be it. If so, I request that you please allow myself privledge to edit it. I have already reverted vandalism two times today, so I don't know if it would be appropriate for me to revert it once more (3RR), so please let me know if I will continue to be able to do so, because it's really not a conflict of interest, it's patent nonsense.

<p>Yeah, we say "simple vandalism" to discourage people from labeling edits they don't like as "vandalism" and claiming exemption from the Three Revert Rule. In practise if there is a problem of this kind it doesn't harm to revert a few times but it is definitely better to file a report about the problem. <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> is a good place to go; there the page can be protected if necessary. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 05:51, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I blocked this account indefinitely as vandalism only. They hit a few admin's userpages, and created a speedyable page The Darth Cult Movement. I remember reading somewhere about personal threats and users talking about "DCM" (and giggling conspiratorially to themselves), so thought I would bring it up here. Keep an eye out for new accounts vandalizing related pages (DragonflySixtyseven's and Vegaswikian's in particular). --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 15:53, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to think that most college students don't make up the majority of vandals. I think the increase in vandalism is purely coincidental as different school districts have different spring breaks. Around here was three weeks ago and I know of another county had theirs two weeks ago.

<li>I guess when I said, "a valid observation," I meant the observation there is a lot of disregarded and too often approved bias floating around here. Deeceevoice may seek it out, but she finds it, too easily, based on my admittedly limited observations. The idea that confronting our biases directly is better than letting them fester is also valid, IMO.

<li>Wikipedia does discriminate to some extent, which may or may not be a good thing. If I recall correctly, an editor was banned for stating that he was a pedophile on his userpage, despite an absence of disruptive behavior (there was a pedophile userbox controversy, but I think this guy just said he was a pedophile). Also, again if I recall correctly, an editor was banned for admitting his racist beliefs on his userpage, even though he did not make racists statements in articles. If such a person wants to make useful contributions, he or she would have to hide their beliefs. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 08:41, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>On a side note, I'm very tempted to delete Deeceevoice's userpage as a rant under the terms of his probation. Any thoughts? --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 21:48, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>What about it offends you? Her probation says "Deeceevoice is prohibited from using her user page to publish offensive rants." (I tried to get the phrasing made more objective, since "offensive" is pretty vague, but was rebuffed.) Tell ya what, though; if you do delete it, I'll just put it on my own user page, since I agree with it, pretty much to the letter. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></li>

<li>This is exaclty the reason that wikipedia needs an entirely new generation of administrators, not bogged down by all this politically "correct" nonesense, who will be willing to deal with messes like this with the sterness requird, ie. delete the userpage + indef block for disruption, anyone who tries to repost the content should be stripped of their administrative powers, and placed on probabtion, which is why in an ideal world, people like myself would be in a place to make these decisions, unfortunatly, it is not so, and so a very different systematic bias sweeps wikipedia--<a href="../../../i/-/2/User%7EI-2-d2_f543.html" title="User:I-2-d2">I-2-d2</a> 04:24, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What? So, now you're the thought police? Sounds like fascism to me. There's nothing <i>remotely</i> offensive about the page. The ruling was issued because the previous version of my page contained images from the database that people found disturbing (most of them appended in the past to my user or talk pages by racist, neo-Nazi, mental cretins). If you can't stand to read reasoned, objective criticism of the project, then perhaps you should consider the fact that your temperament may ill-suit you to be an effective, impartial admin. I can easily name a dozen user pages that are at <i>least</i> as equally critical of the project as mine. IMO, admins would do better to address people's very real concerns than waste your energies blanking people's user pages.

<p>Whats that? You support paedophiles and would like to trash any editors fighting systematic first world bias and rascism? (see I-2-d2's user page). You are right we need to overhaul the admins system but not to impose the biases of a few extremists such as I-2-d2 but to ensure people like that dont gain any authority on this project.

<dd>That "God's Firstborn" thing is a load of hokum, anyway... the fact that the first humans to appear on Earth were apparently in the continent of Africa (as is held by scientists now) certainly does <i>not</i> imply anything about present-day African peoples being in any way "closer" to the "firstborns" from which all of humanity sprung; people of all races and continents are descended from those ancestors by approximately the same number of generations (give or take a little depending on how childbearing ages may have varied in different times and places) and have had a similar amount of evolutionary divergence; no race has a basis for any sort of valid claim of being closer to "God" (or to chimpanzees, for that matter) due to happening to have remained on the same continent as their ancestors instead of migrating elsewhere. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 18:04, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Shrug. Read all the discussions on that page for a good overview; she was making an impassioned (and supportive) response to another editor, and engaged in a bit of hyperbole -- amidst the more serious business of discussing her lack of a dolichocephalic skull and presence of both a maxillary and alveolar prognathism.

<dd>Lord. Give it a rest, JFAS. Dtobias: "No race has a basis for any sort of valid claim of being closer to 'God'." That's neither the meaning nor the intent of what I wrote. And that's all I'll say about it. But I'm struck by the claim of a particular group to be God's "chosen people." Since you apparently feel the need to comment on my out-of-context comments, any comments on <i>that</i>?

<dd>Actually no, Dan. Africans maintain more diversity in terms of mtDNA and Y chromosomal haplotypes. Since all non-African people are derived from small groups which migrated out of African relatively recently, they lack much of the lineage diversity which is present in Africans. Since more of the ancestral genetic diversity is present in Africans, it's a valid statement to say that they are "closer" to ancestral humans (and to chimpanzees) than are non-African populations, which lack much of this ancestral genetic diversity. So yeah, if you believe that God created humans, it's a valid statement. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 18:25, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ha. I have a(n admittedly) bad habit of reading the first few lines of a post and responding before I've read the entire thing. There is no <i>question</i> that blacks are closer to the original people than anyone else. Absent environmental and certain other stressors that caused dark-skinned peoples to mutate to fair-skinned peoples, indigenous African peoples are the least changed from the original humans on the planet. The Khoisan peoples and the Ethiopid peoples of Africa are thought to both share a common, ancient African, human ancestor. Judging from faciocranial characteristics, it is likely the "Ethiopid" peoples formed a later "proto-Caucasoid group" from which Europeans later mutated/emerged. It is very clear that the first human beings were black people, the rest of humanity having descended from us. And Guettarda is right. Indigenous Africans possess a greater degree of biodiversity than any other peoples on earth. He is also correct that, since we were the first humans, on a timeline of development, we are then, of course, also closer to humankind's simian ancestors. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 18:41, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Deeceevoice and Guettarda, you are misinformed on this subject. It is disinformation like this that results in people saying "group X is more <i>primitive</i>/<i>less evolved</i> than group Y". In actuality, all have been evolving and adapting for the same amount of time.

<p>Which doesn't of course make black people better than white people and therefore it should not be interpreted as saying so either. Rascism is a fact on modern life as is first world bias and in that wikipedia is just a reflection of real life and to point this out isnt rascist either.

<dd>Hello Lapinmies. If you wish to rewrite an article that is compliant with <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and related rules, you are very welcome to do so in a user subpage and notify an administrator when you're done. If the new effort sufficiently addresses the concerns over which the original was deleted, such that it cannot be speedily deleted under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD G4</a>, the <a href="../../../h/a/i/HAI2U_5bbe.html" title="HAI2U">HAI2U</a> page may be unlocked and the new version moved there. Note that, depending on the adequacy of the rewrite, it may or may not be renominated for discussion at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>. As to the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_HAI2U_e0d8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/HAI2U">original article's deletion</a>, I judged the closing administrator's decision to be perfectly appropriate: <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> is a foundational principle of the encyclopedia, and not something that can be set aside by users in the belief that it "doesn't apply" to a page. Note that the value of true consensus decision-making lies in its propensity to arrive at an acceptable decision that most participants can live with and see the merits of, even when they do not all agree completely. The questions to which consensus decision-making are best applied are those where there is no immediately clear 'right answer'; it cannot be applied to overule foundational policies. For example, if 10 users ask to "keep" an article in AFD but one comes along and points out that the article is a copyright infringement, I would not simply decide to ignore the foundational policy <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a> and say "there is a 'consensus' to keep"—neither would any other administrator who has remotely any idea of what he's doing. I view the close of the HAI2U AFD similarly. If you disagree, however, note that it is currently <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html#HAI2U" title="WP:DRV">in Review</a>—you are welcome to join the discussion.

<dd>This is a regrettable bit of nonsense, of course. I have never even been asked to provide a copy, at any time. The suggestion, therefore, that I refused a request is untrue, and the personal attack sadly ironic. As to recreation, it is best to abide the outcome of the deletion review discussion.

<p>In response to this complaint, at 6:52 pm (CST) April 22, 2006, InShaneee blocked "Ardenn (contribs)" with an expiry time of 48 hours (incivility). <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" title="Special:Log/block">Special:Log/block</a>.</p>
<p>At 8:20 pm (CST), Earl Andrew unblocked Ardenn.

<p>It is my opinion that Mr. Andrew is demonstrating a considerable and consistent bias in favor of Ardenn's actions. I ask the administrators to respond at this level, but am willing to take this to higher strata if necessary, as Ardenn should not have license to continue <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> simply because he has the friendship of an admin.

<dd>I imagine I'm not coming across as very factual at the moment, but evidently Osgoodelawyer is not an admin. I apologize. Is there a clear way to discern from an everyday look at a user's name or other method whether they're an admin? And Osgoodelawyer has nothing to do with this. I was pointing out that Osgoodelawyer made the statement and not Andrew because I wanted that fact — the fact of the "that was a legitimate rebuttal" remark — removed from consideration when considering a reversal of Earl Andrew's unblocking. — <a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">WCityMike</a> (<a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html" title="User talk:WCityMike">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">contribs</a>) 03:01, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hey all, Osgoodelawyer (the non-admin) chiming in here. I wasn't aware of all that had gone down before InShaneee blocked Ardenn, but from the reason given by InShaneee on Ardenn's talk page, it didn't seem like there was real justification to block him—certainly not for a full two days—and that's why I made the comment I did on InShaneee's page. However, I was unaware of some of the earlier things said, including the "STFU" comment noted above (which I actually can't find, but which I assume is somewhere), and I agree that's certainly deserving of a block. I've had my share of problems with Ardenn myself, but I've been trying to help out a bit, knowing that he's also done a lot of good. Perhaps, though, a good 48 hours away from Wikipedia will help cool his head. -- <a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><span style="color:#CC0000; background-color:white"><b>Osgoode</b></span></a><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><span style="color:#444444; background-color:white"><i><b>Lawyer</b></i></span></a> 13:52, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yep, that's crazy bad. It might be too much to expect on short notice, but I wonder if changes to the software are going to be the most practical way to deal with WP:OFFICE actions.

<dd>Unfortunately, Kelly, that advice is not very useful. In at least one case in question, Danny deliberately took steps to make his actions seem NOT to be WP:OFFICE.

<dd>He didn't use the OFFICE tag and he didn't use the Userid he claims he'll use when doing things in his official capacity.

<p><a href="http://www.citypopulation.de/India-Kerala.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.citypopulation.de/India-Kerala.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, Thiruvananthapuram is the biggest City Corporation by population. The reporting of this fact is continously being edited and changed to 'second largest city after Cochin' by the people who have started this off. If you look at previous edits, any efforts to change a statement that Trivandrum has narrow and winding roads, to wide and clean roads (Trivandrum has the longest kilometerage of 6 lane and 4 lane dual carriageways, with high mast lamps and automated road sweeping machines) was promptly deleted by User:Deepujoseph. Even in the 1930's the main arterial road was almost 6 lanes in width (it was the road between the two palaces of the Travancore Royal Family). Please have a look at the history of the page and judge. Rajeshdxb 14:00, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks like just a definition question; in terms of the incorporated city, T. is the largest city; in terms of urban agglomeration it is Kochi. I have clarified this in the introduction of both articles, and I hope both parties find that acceptable. As it is about content, I don't think it needs to be on this noticeboard, and therefore I have removed a message below on the same subject. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugene van der Pijll</a> 16:00, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, this is all that we have been writing for. Still, a request for a small change: I do not think that the part of the statement which reads 'although the population of the urban agglomeration is smaller than that of Kochi', is required. My view is that the statement can read as follows- 'With almost 745,000 inhabitants at the 2001 census, the city of Trivandrum is the most populated incorporated city in Kerala, and the population of the urban agglomeration is 889,000'.

<dd>Mmmm, yeah, that would still make it clear that the "largest city" refers to the incorporated city; not to the UA.

<p>I was in the middle of typing a message to Rob's talk page, as he was hysterically saying that I had told him his account would be or had been deleted and protected, and was going to various pages demanding that it be deleted now, after I had failed to do so. However, when I went to submit my post, I found he had made so many attacks that they had been deleted and his page protected. I'm therefore posting here instead.</p>
<p>Robsteadman e-mailed me on 3 April, asking me to delete his account. Of course, that's not possible, so I e-mailed him that I could delete his user page and his talk page, but not his contributions. I never told him that I would delete his account. A copy of the reply I sent him on 3 April (still in my computer) is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>If you inform me that you are leaving Wikipedia, I can delete your user page and archive, blank, and protect your talk page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>If you really intend that, let me know by e-mail, or better still post it on my talk page so that I'll have evidence if anyone queries it.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>It's not possible to remove your contributions from the history of articles, though.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ann</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It is simply impossible for somebody to recreate a deleted account, since there is no such thing as a deleted account. Rob's <i>userpage</i> was deleted, as was his talk page. But the account couldn't be deleted, so if he edited something from his usual computer, it would appear in the diff as coming from Robsteadman, as is the case for a particularly nasty and spiteful comment concerning two editors who were driven off Wikipedia because of real-life stalking<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jesus&amp;diff=49719313&amp;oldid=49714139" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jesus&amp;diff=49719313&amp;oldid=49714139" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> and the case of an edit to the article about the composer <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Steadman_9c22.html" title="Robert Steadman">Robert Steadman</a>.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Steadman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49340588" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Steadman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49340588" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> There are only three possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rob made those edits, thinking that his account had been deleted<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Musical_Linguist&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46812518" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Musical_Linguist&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46812518" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> and that the edits would therefore be anonymous.</li>
<li>When he stopped editing Wikipedia, he did not think of logging out, and somebody else with enough knowledge about his conflict with those two editors and with an interest in the Robert Steadman article made those edits.</li>
<li>Someone else knows his password, and knows enough about Robert Steadman the composer and about his conflict with some of the Christian editors to make those edits.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, there is <i><b>absolutely no possibility</b></i> that someone created a Robsteadman account after Rob had gone. I once wanted the username Cordelia, but that name was "taken", because someone had registered it, even though that person had never made any edits. You can edit a talk page and sign it as if from another user, though in that case it shows up in the diff that it's not from that user. But you can't mess with another user's Special:Contributions.</p>
<p>With regard to Rob's denial of sockpuppetry, six admininstrators with checkuser access have reviewed the evidence — see here. But he is still shrieking things about libel, and is still accusing Deskana of vandalism.</p>
<p>It has been pointed out the new user <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYummy_mummy_6126.html" title="User:Yummy mummy">Yummy mummy</a>, who edits from a British school IP (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yummy_mummy&amp;diff=49430612&amp;oldid=49423359" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yummy_mummy&amp;diff=49430612&amp;oldid=49423359" rel="nofollow">here</a>) and is showing interest in <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Steadman_9c22.html" title="Robert Steadman">Robert Steadman</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, and other music-related articles, is making arguments similar to Robsteadman, and could have a connection. Yummy mummy and Robsteadman have both voted to oppose Deskana's RfA.</p>
<p>I have always tried to be as fair as possible to Rob, despite his numerous personal attacks, and his hysterical outbursts. I voted to keep the Robert Steadman article. I showed him how to archive his talk page. I reverted vandalism to his user page. I reverted harassing-type edits to his talk page. On many occasions I asked people to leave him alone. I deleted his user page at his request. But I believe that the nature of his personal attacks tonight will make it difficult for anyone to believe that the spiteful remark on the Jesus talk page did not come from him. And his hysterical behaviour on Deskana's RfA page has done more harm to him than to Deskana. A checkuser could certainly esablish if the spiteful comment on the Jesus talk page came from Rob's IP, but I know admins don't normally carry out userchecks to satisfy idle curiosity. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 21:14, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Update. I have just had an e-mail from Rob, denying that he used sockpuppets, and denying that he made the edits on 20 and 23 April. He seems to blame me for the fact that his account was not deleted. I never told him that I could delete the account, and I never intended that he would think I could. I did delete his user page. He says now that he wants his account to be permanently blocked. I see that <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">User:InShaneee</a> has extended the block on Robsteadman to indefinite, for trolling and personal attacks. Some examples were on Rob's own talk page (now deleted); some were on <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_c3aa.html" title="User talk:William M. Connolley">User talk:William M.

<dd>There was no response from you to my question. Miami of Ohio redirects to Miami University, in Ohio.

<dd>Of course I blanked my talk page. I'd seen the contents and there is no logical reason to carry on the conversation on three pages. Two has been confusing enough. The fact of the matter is, you made a bunch of bad edits without bothering to do any research and then deliberately misrepresented my edit history. The fact is, you have engaged the standard round of bullying so common among admins here. Finally, I didn't demand an apology. I said I await one. You don't have to deliver, but it will show whether your intent is bullying for the sake of bullying, or actually participating in the larger community. -<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardjp_053d.html" title="User:Howardjp">James Howard</a> (<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowardjp_214f.html" title="User talk:Howardjp">talk</a>/<a href="http://jameshoward.us/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="jameshoward:Main_Page">web</a>) 21:22, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True, if you block someone who is currently blocked, the block due to end first is the one that acutally "takes". So as far as I know, if you block someone for a week and then feel you've been too harsh, you can simply reblock for 48 hours. But if you block for 48 hours and then decide it should have been a week, you have to <i>unblock</i> before you reblock. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 21:01, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Surely the correct way to have gone about this was for either an unconnected admin to block him for 3RR or a personal attack incident be reported so that again, an unconnected admin deals with it. Whilst not excusing Alienus kicking off on his talk page I can see why he feels victimised as proper procedure seems to have been thrown out of the window in the hurry to ban him.

<dd>The posting on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> should come before the block. Month old warnings do not apply to this case. Alienus is not an unknown vandal who must be stopped asap so setting aside procedure in this case seems incorrect. InShaneee came along after Alienus was venting his anger at what he saw as an unjust block so his view of the situation is skewed.

<dd>I agree that it could be considered entrapment. In my opinion Alienus was provoked by Nandesuka to respond in an intemperate manner. It is unfortunate that Alienus took the bait, instead of ignoring it. It is also unfortunate in my opinion that you are the only person to question the appropriateness of Nandesuka's ban given his history of disagreement with Alienus on circumcision related articles. -- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanBlackham_ea8d.html" title="User:DanBlackham">DanBlackham</a> 07:49, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please don't misunderstand - I don't support any personal attacks and I agree they are never justified but the only way to show that the system is fair and open is to use it that way. All that happens when you ignore procedure is that it makes the user concerned feel cornered and no one shows their best side under such circumstances.

<dd>For whatever it's worth, I haven't known him for long, but the attitude he displayed towards me on Talk:Christianity was pretty much the same as what I've seen on his user page. I'm the one who reported him for 3RR, not AnnH, or this sinister circumcision cabal he keeps ranting about, and I likely wouldn't have done so had he not been so relentlessly and implacably hostile, accusatory and uncivil.

<dd>I simply don't agree with you, SOPHIA, that this block was out of process, although I am of course willing to listen to your arguments. The idea that one should need regular reminders not to tell other contributors that they suck is, at least on Wikipedia, a novel interpretation. Alienus knows that personal attacks are unacceptable. He has made a conscious decision to ignore that policy, and deliberately and repeatedly made vicious personal attacks, daring the community to discipline him for them. His third strike, in my personal opinion, was about 10 strikes ago. He has been blocked in accordance with the blocking policy, and every admin who has reviewed the case so far has either reconfirmed or extended the block. One can choose to interpret that as evidence of a sinister cabal of oppressors, or one can choose to interpret that as people that care about Wikipedia, which is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a bureaucracy</a>, making the best calls that they can to protect the encyclopedia.

<p>If the point is to protect the encyclopedia then a knowledgeable editor who adds good content has just been banned. My argument was not that he should be warned just that an incident should have been logged so that an independent admin could deal with it right from the beginning - not after tempers had flared.

<dd>I respectfully have to disagree with InShanee here. The 'point' is indeed to protect the encyclopedia; enforcing policy purely for the sake of enforcing policy would be busywork at best and WP:POINT at worst.</dd>
<dd>While Alienus has made – and will hopefully in future continue to make – positive contributions to Wikipedia, he also has an unfortunate habit of making personal attacks on our other editors. (He has been frequently warned about this.) By making Wikipedia an unpleasant place for our other editors to work, he damages the encyclopedia. Our contributors are volunteers. Most of them do not and should not expect personal attacks in return for their work. Needlessly inflammatory and abusive treatment will drive off <i>other</i> good editors—editors who <i>have</i> managed to contribute to articles <i>and</i> abide by our policies on civility and personal attacks. Those editors are more likely to leave if they receive the impression that admins don't care about abusive behaviour.</dd>
<dd>In an ideal world, Alienus would take the hint from this block and reform his interaction style. I sincerely hope that this happens. However, if it does not, I would rather lose an editor who engages in personal attacks than many who do not. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 03:53, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since Nandesuka acknowledged prior disagreements with Alienus, and reported the block on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>, welcoming a review, I think it's quite appropriate for SOPHIA to comment on it. I know when I queried a block a few months ago, it wasn't easy to make my arguments, as I got little support, and there were some insinuations that I supported the behaviour of the user who had been blocked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Having said that, I think the block was correct, though I'd have felt more comfortable if another admin had carried it out. I would feel a lot <i>less</i> comfortable if it had been done as part of an editing dispute, or if it had not been reported for review immediately after. Other admins have also reported blocks they had carried out when there was a slight question mark hanging over these blocks. There is no need to report for personal attacks or for 3RR prior to making a block. Any admin who spots something that justifies blocking can carry out a block; s/he doesn't have to have it <i>reported</i> by someone else first. So the only question mark in my view is that it was Nandesuka who carried out the block. However, the block was self-reported, and reviewed, and no admin saw fit to reduce it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>SOPHIA, I know that you're not trying to excuse Alienus's behaviour — what you've seen of it — but I think you may not have seen as much of it as some others. He has been hostile, aggressive, and potty mouthed. He threatens to get people banned. He violates 3RR and is full of moral indignation when his opponents do it. He kicks people who are down. He spits at people. He sneers constantly. He calls other editors "assholes", and then sends {{civil1}} warnings to editors who calmly refer to "a not untypical sneer from Alienus". He insinuates that a well-respected member of the arbitration committee has been dishonest in a usercheck (one which has been ratified by five other checkuser admins). He constantly calls admins biased and incompetent. He sympathizes with blocked users who engage in stalking. He refers to edits that he opposes as "vandalism". He constantly uses popups to revert non-vandalism edits, although he has been asked not to. He has insisted over and over again in addressing the editor <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">User:Goodandevil</a> (whose signature has been modified to say "Good") as "Evil", although he has been asked not to do so. He removes administrators' warnings from his talk page, but reverts users who remove his trolling comments from their talk pages. He makes false accusations over and over again. There are plenty of good editors who don't do those things. All in all, he is contributing towards a poisonous atmosphere here; and that is bad for Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I appreciate and respect your concern for fairness, and agree that it would have been better for the block to have been done by someone else. But it was self-reported immediately for review, and I'm quite sure that Nandesuka would have accepted it courteously if another admin had undone the block. The only one who changed it increased it. So I think we can take it that the block has now been, in a sense, ratified by uninvolved admins. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 11:22, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As the admin who brought this back up, I just wanted to point out that Alienus had put an {{unblock}} up contesting the block -- I reviewed his history and seeing much of what AnnH described above, I felt the block was justified and left a note to that effect. To say that he was angry and that's why the personal attacks continued is, to my mind, a poor excuse. I understand blocks can be frustrating if you don't think they're valid, but somehow, continuing the behavior that led to the block after more than one admin discusses it with you just doesn't seem like the proper course of action. When Alienus suggested he would evade the current block and continue to harass after it was over, I brought it back here again for others to look at since I had already declined to unblock him once. While it may always be preferable to get someone else to do the block for you, I see no problem with Nandesuka stopping the problem and then asking for review. .:.<a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJareth_d262.html" title="User:Jareth">Jareth</a>.:. <sup><a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJareth_7e10.html" title="User talk:Jareth">babelfish</a></sup> 12:37, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks to Ann for your calm explanation. It seems there is a system but I haven't quite got the hang of it yet. I still feel that an uninvolved admin should have placed the initial block as there was no threat to the articles so immediate action was not required. This is a point that I hope will be accepted and will actively work against accusations of cabals and bias. I would also request that admins do not take questioning of their decisions personally as this is unhelpful to an open environment. The next step is how to plan for Alienus' return. Could I suggest his talk page is unblocked 48 hours before the week ban is due to be lifted to get a feel for how he is going to take this?

<dd>I haven't had much experience with Alienus. My one encounter with him was watching him advocate for Pro-Lick to be unblocked, which I think for these purposes makes me pretty uninvolved... although what I saw there was enough for me to cock an eyebrow. He was essentially berating administrators (as a general populace) for not "doing their job" in unblocking Pro-Lick (who at the time had been blocked as a possible Amorrow sock, which he's not -- I eventually unblocked Pro-Lick after a checkuser showed the blocking rationale was wrong). I've looked over some of Alienus' edits, particularly ones recently to his talk page (in the interests of doing my "job"), and particularly after reading Ann's comments must say I support the week-long block. It's a shame because he's obviously a smart guy, but acting this way will get him shown the door pretty quickly, and not just for a week. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">poll</a></small> 21:54, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Having read all the above I still think this will come across as a punishment of sorts, fully defensible from a process point of view but in this case, I think, simply guaranteed to make matters worse. Katefan0 may well be right about Alienus' being on collision course, but I feel this block is too long to be convincing to Alienus. There's a history here, and it's the history of an editor getting increasingly frustrated with process thwarting progress. I feel there should be a better way to convince Alienus that he can find a role where he can give what he has to offer to the encyclopedia and the world without all the conflicts. I guess this supports <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA">Sophia</a>'s salvage attempts.

<p>This block of addresses (apparently belonging to a school board) has been the source of a large number of obviously vandalous edits since at least the beginning of the year. I tracked this back from an edit of image:cartooon.gif a cartoon on the <a href="../../../i/g/o/Igor_Sikorsky_8505.html" title="Igor Sikorsky">Igor Sikorsky</a> page. Almost of the edits that I sampled from this block seem to have been obvious vandalism -- one seems to have undid previous vandalism. It's probably worthwhile to block the address block and/or contact the administrative team for the school board. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkonc_fb11.html" title="User:Darkonc">Darkonc</a> 21:12, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, you can start by tagging the talk pages with <b>Template:SharedIPEDU</b>. I for one would like to see a policy that any IP address identified as a school that is a source of presistent vandalism can be blocked for one hour (the length of a class period, generally) on one vandalism edit, without requiring 3 recent warnings per usual practice at AIV. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 21:33, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>two points:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(1) This seems to be a relatively low-level (couple of pages a week) long term (3-4 months) vandalism spree, so blocking for an hour after a vandalism wouldn't do much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(2) just how do I do the Template:sharedIPEDU&#160;? Do I have to manually put the tag in each IP's talk page, or is there a nice way to add them bulk to the category page?</li>

<dd>I have encountered a couple of more persistent vandals who will hit 5-10 pages over the course of a few minutes, and come back every other school day at about the same time, as if its a recurring study hall period held in the school library. What I unfortunately don't know is if any legit editors log in from that computer. I have seen admins here block school IPs for a month (until the end of term) and other admins on AIV refuse to block because it hasn't been warned 4 times on the same day. Regarding the template, I think you have to do it manually, but it shouldn't be that much work. Type it out once then copy and paste it (and remember to subst.) <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:44, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, The Kerala page has some factual errors. There is only one capital and its [Thiruvananthapuram]. There's nothing called a commercial capital or a judicial capital. There are some vested interests in proclaiming Kochi as commercial and judicial capital. Its factually incorrect and quite misleading to the millions of users visiting the Wikipedia. I request the administrator to look into these matters earnestly and do the needful. Thanks Rajkrish</p>

<p>Parateq has been listed for speedy deletion, but a number of users (mainly IP addresses) remove the speedy template as soon as it is added/reinstated.

<p>New article and a copyvio; the content is copied from the "about" page of the web site the article is promoting. I added a "copyvio" tag, which was removed by the article creator. <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajeevranjanlall_5fad.html" title="User:Rajeevranjanlall">Rajeevranjanlall</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/j/User_talk%7ERajeevranjanlall_af20.html" title="User talk:Rajeevranjanlall">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rajeevranjanlall_652e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rajeevranjanlall">contribs</a>) I restored the "copyvio" tag and put notes on the talk page and the user's talk page. No reply, and article creator removed "copyvio" tag again, restoring article to the original text. I can do nothing more without violating 3RR. Request appropriate action.

<dd>Actually, removing a legitimate copyvio tag can be reverted as simple vandalism, especially after attempts to contact the editor in question. No danger of falling afoul of the 3RR.

<dd>I always assumed that the point of legitimate sockpuppets was to edit articles you didn't want other people to know you were editing, like <a href="../../../p/a/e/Paedophilia.html" title="Paedophilia">paedophilia</a> or <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.html" title="Goatse">Goatse</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Blunt_6f74.html" title="James Blunt">James Blunt</a>. If you're willing to reveal that a sock account belongs to you, why not just use your own account to make those edits?</dd>
<dd>In fact, I can easily see WoW or WiC or whoever starting to slap this on their own accounts. They're <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jolli3_4993.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jolli3">clearly aware</a> of current events on Wikipedia, so it wouldn't surprise me in the least if they were gleefully reading this right now. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:18, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I use them to subdevide my edits. For example <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenidealingwithfairuse_8a6d.html" title="User:Genidealingwithfairuse">User:Genidealingwithfairuse</a> exists souly to sort out fair use issues involveing images and remove copyvios from articles.

<dd>Ahh. That makes sense. Though if someone hasn't suggested giving editors the possibility of setting up multiple watchlists, they should. I'd certainly like a separate watchlist for articles I'm actively involved in maintaining, as opposed to those I just reverted vandalism on once, if such a thing were possible. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:35, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

Trolls go away quicker when they're bored, and it looks like you've already established the connections between the other vandals/sockpuppets: adding one more blocked user to the list may not be worth the trouble. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 03:53, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can't double-check it for another 25 minutes or so because NIWP is blocking further attempts. Can someone check to see if that server has been infested?

Since there's not much discussion, and I appear to be one of the few disinterested people still having this page cluttering their watchlist, I thought this is something the wider community ought to look at. We could also resolve the issue of admins "editorialising" in their closing of deletion debates at the same time. I know I editorialise when I close contentious AfDs, so ought I to gag myself? Hm... <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 05:30, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course, admins should editorialize when they feel necessary. Transparency is a good thing and deletions are discussions not votes, so we know the admin had do to some thinking. And even if one thought that admins should not editorialize, I can't see why one would remove the admin's explanation for their reasoning. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:34, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've suggested Ambi just add a reply to the closing comment instead of removing it, and she has. Hopefully that can be the end of it. I agree with JoshuaZ that transparency is a good thing. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 07:47, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I editorialise all the bloody time when closing AfDs.
