I found Paul Venter at the time very aggressive, abusive, and generally very resistant to accepting others' views. He also engaged frequently in personal attacks towards individual editors. Further when efforts were made to build a consensus, he declined to abide by the consensus and merely increased his aggression and abuse. <a href="../../../r/u/e/User%7ERueben_lys_c4ed.html" title="User:Rueben lys">Rueben lys</a> 09:24, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An argument over whether the image should be placed in the infobox? It seems that Paul venter seems to have acted very stubbornly in that issue... Well,Paul deserves a warning for 3RR, which he seems to have broken, looking at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_venter_7d4f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul venter">his contribs</a>.

<p>(undent)Be careful when bandying about charges of vandalism. Vandalism is narrowly defined as actions designed to damage or harm Wikipedia articles. There appears to be none of that going on by you, or by EITHER of the two people you have accused of vandalism. While I make no statements on the position of either side <i>vis-a-vis</i> the quality of their edits in this dispute, such edits are clearly <b>not vandalism</b>. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 06:56, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a complaint raised against Gun Powder Ma. He doesn't seem to resort to middle ground and prefers to edit things according to his own sources/POV and throw away contradicting opinions with their own sources as well. He continually edits away any source I pointed out in Wikipedia when it comes to "Four Great Inventions". He does not answer the discussion section, and although he argued with me on the neutrality of his source in Siege of XiangYang he now only reverts the edits back to those of his own instead of discussing the neutrality of it with me. I pointed out that having minority sources is against Wikipedia's NPOV rule, but now he just stopped replying and only resorted to reverting. So I'm out of luck for better communication.</p>

<p>Okay, so I realize that sometimes people take CFD's (and AFD's) a bit too seriously. Sometimes things get heated. Assuming good faith can be hard at times.<br />
However, if you're going to accuse somebody of something, then you need to either be prepared to back it up, or be ready to take it back.<br />
<br />
In a CFD for "Anti-Semitic people", Beit Or said, "In addition, you may consider not starting your posts with a brief piece of trolling." (you can find that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_March_27&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118367980" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_March_27&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118367980" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Since he originally misplaced his comment (he later moved it right after one of mine), I didn't know if he was talking to me or BrownHairedGirl, and what 'trolling' he thought he saw, so I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABeit_Or&amp;diff=118368962&amp;oldid=118333289" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABeit_Or&amp;diff=118368962&amp;oldid=118333289" rel="nofollow">asked him</a> (the intermediate revision not shown is because I forgot to use quotes to quote what he said).<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABeit_Or&amp;diff=118369245&amp;oldid=118368962" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABeit_Or&amp;diff=118369245&amp;oldid=118368962" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is his reply. Note that it isn't very helpful.<br />
(By now, I see that he's moved his comment to make it clear that he was addressing me)<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beit_Or&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118369245" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beit_Or&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118369245" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is my reply to that. I think I was fair. It <i>was</i> a personal attack, since it was an unfounded accusation.<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beit_Or&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118369584" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beit_Or&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118369584" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is his reply to me. Notice two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>He <i>still</i> doesn't specify what part of my behaviour was supposedly wrong. If someone's going to accuse me of something, then they have an obligation to <b>back it up</b>. I can't start calling Bishonen a vandal without providing a single diff or explanation.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>He actually <i><b>warned</b></i> me there. He's the only one who's verifiably guilty of grossly uncivil conduct, and yet, rather than admit that he's made a mistake, he instead has the nerve to warn me!</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beit_Or&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118371606" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beit_Or&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118371606" rel="nofollow">My reply</a> didn't pull any punches. Nor should it have. The only way I can possibly defend myself from an accusation is if I at least know precisely what I'm being accused of!<br />
Somewhere in the midst of this, I also told him not to make personal attacks in the CFD itself. You can see his diff <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_March_27&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118372331" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_March_27&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118372331" rel="nofollow">here</a>, as well as my statement that he was replying to right above it. Note that he's reaffirming his accusation of my 'trolling', and yet still he never once points to a single quote or diff that he actually believes to be trolling.<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_March_27&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118372331" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_March_27&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118372331" rel="nofollow">My reply</a> to that nonsense may not have been with a cool head, and yet, all I did was demand that he either <i>back up</i> his accusation or retract it. And that really is a very reasonable position to take. By all logic, if you're going to keep accusing someone of something, then you <i>should</i> be specific and provide at least a sliver of evidence!<br />
Anyways, he didn't even bother replying to me on his talk page.<br />
At first, I didn't know if it was simply because he'd went offline or something. I didn't want to assume that he was ignoring me (that'd be acting in bad faith), so I waited. And waited. And waited. Until I noticed that he had made comments elsewhere. Still, just in case he was only one for a moment, I waited a bit longer, until I saw that he'd be in wikipedia <i>again</i>. By then, I knew that he was certainly ignoring me.<br />
Then I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beit_Or&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118755719" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beit_Or&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118755719" rel="nofollow">posted</a> on his talk page again. I didn't insult him. I didn't call him a meaniehead or anything like that. I just said that I knew he'd been on so he saw my messages to him, and that I wanted him to either back up his accusations, or retract them, as well as his "warning".<br />
This was fair and reasonable. If you absolutely refuse to back an accusation up, then you should (obviously) retract it. And any <i>warnings</i> he gave me were certainly uncalled for. (You can't warn a person for conduct that you can't even prove they ever did)<br />
His <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABeit_Or&amp;diff=119047406&amp;oldid=118945605" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABeit_Or&amp;diff=119047406&amp;oldid=118945605" rel="nofollow">response</a> was to remove my comment from his talk page! And the edit summary is the real kicker. "rm fresh attack" and "rm latest attack" (it took a couple edits for him to get rid of it all).<br />
So, let me get this straight... Saying, "prove your accusations against me or retract them" is an attack?!? Screw that. He's made personal attacks. False accusations. Given invalid warnings. Put me down on both his talk page and a public CFD.<br />
I want it all deleted, and him told that it won't be tolerated in the future. I don't care about things like 'blocks', because I'm not going to assume that he's disrupting wikipedia in any other way, but this sort of crap has to stop, definitively. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 17:44, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Considering he made a direct personal attack/false accusation, I don't think I was unnecessarily rude. Most times, if a person is acting in good faith, and they're called a troll, they won't reply with an ice cream cone.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>That said, there's still an accusation against me visible in the CFD. His comments are still visible there, and on his talk page. I hate being accused of things I never did.</dd>
<dd>It isn't simply a matter of me not liking them. They're outright false. They're <i>directed at me</i>. They're entirely unsubstantiated. He's accused me of trolling, and of attacks. He's <i>warned</i> me. I don't want any of that crap visible to <i>anyone</i>. And I don't see why I should have to put up with it. It's very much clear what I want to be done. I explicitly stated it. I won't personally remove comments from a CFD, even if they aren't votes. I won't personally remove someone else's comments from their own talk page (false or not, I have a personal interest in the matter). I haven't unnecessarily escalated things. I never said, "you aren't allowed to call me a troll!" I asked him <i>which</i> part he thought was trolling. I've done every single thing that could reasonably be expected of me. And telling me to take a deep breath is silly. I've patiently waited for two days, just to make sure that he had absolutely every single opportunity possible to correct his mistake. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 18:40, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I must say, I'm rather disappointed. Referring to a warning for trolling from someone who won't even say <i>where the trolling occurred</i> as nonsense is "entirely unacceptable", but actually making an accusation, and repeatedly reaffirming that accusation, while repeatedly refusing to provide a single diff or even rationale, is something I should simply accept?

<dd>I guess this is the 'consensus', but it certainly is a shame, isn't it? Being hit with the same accusation repeatedly... it's irritating to say the least. But the idea that personal attacks are simply accepted as part of the CFD process, well, that's even worse. I guess I'll just stay out of CFD and AFD from now on.

<dd>... <b>That</b> was what you meant by 'trolling'?!? I say 'Oi' all the time! (In real life) people make fun of me for it because I'm not jewish, but it's just a habit I've developed. (I also call people 'schmuck' and 'putz', if it matters. I also say, "holy snappin' crap" too often, but I'm pretty sure that <i>doesn't</i> matter.)</dd>
<dd>Heh... I <i>guess</i> since the topic was 'Anti-Semitic people', I can see you wondering... (the fact that you edit jewish articles is irrelevant, since I didn't research your background before commenting) but wouldn't it have saved a <i>lot</i> of trouble if you'd just said that from the beginning?</dd>
<dd>We actually went through all of this just because I sometimes say 'oi'?</dd>
<dd>Um, in the future, you might want to Assume Good Faith. Simply saying 'oi' isn't an attack against you or anyone else. It's relatively normal speech. And try to look at this now from my perspective. Everything I was doing was in good faith. Then I was accused. And you <i>actually expected me to guess that a single two-letter word</i> was the cause of your offense? That's a stretch.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, you've just made another false accusation, when you (once again) said, "This editor's behavior only confirms my observation that the purpose of their comment was to distract the discussion from its subject and make it a personal issue"... but, um, I don't think I'm going to get too offended this time... Now that I know the <i>reason</i>, well, it's hard not to laugh. Seriously though, AGF; it's a pretty important concept here, and would've prevented you from snapping at people acting in good faith. And discussion. Yup. Discussion would've been good.

<dd>Beit Or is a serious editor from whom I have never seen anything remotely characterizable as "trolling;" if anything he is distinguished by his reluctance to engage in time-wasting discussions like this one. I have to assume that Beit Or's intepretation of Bladestorm's intentions was influenced - and understandably so - by Bladestorm's questioning whether Nazis and holocaust deniers are respectively characterizable as antisemitic (the initial argument about <a href="../../../n/a/z/Category%7ENazis_186e.html" title="Category:Nazis">Category:Nazis</a> makes sense, but read further)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_March_27&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118366017" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_March_27&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118366017" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.I find it disturbing that several commenters here seem oblivious to the obvious.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 21:19, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(outdent)I can't believe people are still talking about this. However, if you insist on doing so, I think I can make it quick: I thought that calling <b>people who tried to kill Hitler</b> automatically antisemitic was a bad assumption to make. And I said that there were different possible reasons to deny the holocaust, including "poor education" and "ignorance". What's more, whether or not people assume good faith in me shouldn't depend on whether I tend to associate holocaust denial with antisemitism or simply ignorance. If it were true that he really was reluctant "to engage in time-wasting discussions like this one", then he would've simply explained his accusation or retracted it. Obviously, <i>anybody</i> who makes an accusation (or any claim, for that matter) in wikipedia is expected to be able to back it up.<br />
As it is, since the original offending comment was removed from the CFD, and since I finally know the cause of the accusation (as peculiar as it was), I'm fine with letting it end here. If you still wish to discuss it, then you're welcome to take it up on my talk page, so the AN/I board can be freed up for more pressing matters. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 04:28, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow. It's interesting to see how people can take such different views on the same acts. You make me wait two days before I find out <b>what</b> you're accusing me of across pages, and you think that shows I'm harassing you for days. I repeatedly ask you to back up your allegations, and when I get upset after multiple refusals, you point out that I got upset. You accuse me of trolling just because I said 'oi' perfectly innocently, and yet you accuse me of incivility.</dd>
<dd>You know, I have to wonder how things would turn out if the roles were reversed. If I were to have seen someone start a reply with "Eh...", assumed bad faith, jumped to the conclusion that they were taking a jab at my being canadian, and then insulted and 'warned' them for their 'trolling'... would people take me seriously? And if he then pointed out just how wrong such actions were, could I then get away with demanding that he be blocked? For failing to accept that I can accuse people of whatever I like, without ever having to support those claims? Hmm... I suspect people wouldn't take that too seriously. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 21:29, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Second the motion that <a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">WP:LAME</a> applies here. I am accused, essentially, of disagreeing with the above user; I opened up discussion on his moves, and reverted them after a time, in agreement with other users, when he failed to provide substantial reasons for them. The renames were his only contributions to the articles in question. Note that while he bizarrely accuses me of a "personal attack" above, he has no problem calling me a "liar" in the paragraph above. He is still insisting I used "the tools" somehow against him, despite other users demonstrating that I did not. This, sadly, has been the tenor of previous discussions with him. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions"><span style="color:#800">Pro<span style="color:#a00">hib<span style="color:#b00">it<b><span style="color:#c00">O</span>ni</b></span><b>o</b></span><b>ns</b></span></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProhibitOnions_b4f5.html" title="User talk:ProhibitOnions"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 07:52, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It was talked about and, IMO, examples such as this (and possibly other) BLP violations are examples suggesting that deletion is warranted. There appeared, however, to be consensus that culling the totally un-funny and policy-violating content and history merging it all into five-or-so archives would be appropriate. It probably should be done sometime. We need to be able to actually manage the content and monitor it for violations. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 03:24, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>(edit conflict) IMO, yes without æquivocation. They should also be vetted of fair use images and images with patently false licensing. I currently have watchlisted every fair use image I found in all 61 main archives but, as my watchlist is rather large, they have been swallowed up. BJAODN has several complications that really need to be addressed and were brought up in the recent mfd. I originally meant to bring them to the forefront on the talk page and link there from the VPs, but have not mustered up the energy yet. Any help with removing the stuff that blatantly needs removal would be sorely appreciated. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 03:22, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is a LOT of stuff that needs to be removed, and most of it isn't even funny. A lot of "OMG HE IS GAY!!!" childish vandalism (aimed at living people) seems to have made it in for some reason, and it will have to be taken out.

<li>While I wont argue that most of BJAODN isn't funny, the fact that its clearly labelled as humor, not serious articles, and in most cases can be classified as satire/parody/opinion (pick one, depending on case) would easily remove any libel/slander claim.

<p>Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, if it is please point me in the correct direction.</p>
<p>On my talk page user Widefox has posted a slanderious lie stating that I have been banned from Wikipedia and other unnamed forums for a dispute with someone else. There is no factual basis for this. The reason I believe that he has posted this lie is an ongoing dispute on the Swiftfox article. He is doing this out of spite, in an effort I believe to use one lie in one place as a basis to start problems in another place. He did that in the past, by saying an unsigned edit was a sockpuppet, even though I have a static ip. He then took that lie and used it in other areas. Is it poossible to have user Widefox blocked from my talk page as he insists on posting lies, slander, and starting arguments with me there?

That so long as its what you remember happening months and months ago you can dreg up anything and post it.

This is what he was seeking by posting the attack on my talk page in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. He thinks personal attacks are a way for him to win disagreements over editing an article in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. His solution is rewarding him for bad behavior. I have not attacked him in any way. But simply ask to be protected from more of the same. He sees nothing wrong with what he has done. He will do so again. His request shows he does not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. His actions on my page show he does not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>.His actions on the Swiftfox page show he does not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. Maybe he should be blocked from my page and from Swiftfox since he attacked me in both places. At the very least, I believe he (Widefox)should be told that his actions were wrong. To stop attacking me and focus in on the issues and not me. That he should not repeat them, that he should assume good faith, and that a repeat of his actions will have consequences. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilz_c9ee.html" title="User:Kilz">Kilz</a> 12:09, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But you did vandalize the page, you removed tags without fixing the problem the tag was placed there for. While there was a discussion on the section. You also removed requests for citations on areas that were inmho original research by you. Reverting vandalism is an approved practice. I did it once a day. You also tried to put words in another editors mouth, and told me to be quiet on the subject as you sought to influence the discussion. Then when you saw that you were not winning, you posted a smear on my talk page and the Swiftfox page , in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. You did not seek help from an admin, you took it opon yourself to make a personal attack. Dreging up the most dirt you could think of, to smear me. You have used lie upon lie and imho you will do it again without at the very least, a warning not to do it. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilz_c9ee.html" title="User:Kilz">Kilz</a> 17:25, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My take on this is that Wildefox should not be posting on Kilz's talk page unless it is absolutely necessary because it clearly irritates Kilz. And there is nothing to stop Kilz removing stuff he does not like from his talk page. - <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> <small><a href="../../../k/i/t/User_talk%7EKittybrewster_3d4b.html" title="User talk:Kittybrewster">(talk)</a></small> 20:16, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your answer Kittybrewster. I have been told that I am not allowed to delete things from my talk page. That I must archive everything. Are you suggesting that the attack be deleted. Secondly, if I do that doesnt it remove the record of what Widefox has done, and if he does it again I wont have proof to point to? <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilz_c9ee.html" title="User:Kilz">Kilz</a> 21:16, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is a new tatic of Widefox. It appears that 2 other editors have in some way agreed with me. So widefox has labeled them as puppets of some kind so he can write them off. He is now ignoring consensus. Secondly, what may have happened in the past on the Swiftfox forum in no way changes my ability to edit the swiftfox article on Wikipedia and make sure that it is as honest and up to date as possible. As you see Widefox is using one tatic after another to win a content argument. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilz_c9ee.html" title="User:Kilz">Kilz</a> 11:34, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

That others are editing and changing things should be no suprize on Wikipedia. That they may disagree with Widefox has nothing to do with me. Even with the knowledge that one is from the University of Maine he still claims one to be a sockpuppet. Has Widefox filed any reports of suspected sockpupptry? Not that I can find, Why?

<dd>I've tried to work with these users, but their actual responses to my questions are usually rather incoherent or begging the question. On the other hand, they are repetitively battling across a variety of articles and there has been no success in stopping this dispute. I give Venki some credit for trying mediation, even though he listed an absurd number of people as parties, making his attempt futile. Anyway, overall, I don't think giving both of them what they want would be a bad idea. Of course a number of socks would follow, but from what I can tell, they should be fairly easy to catch; these two users have very specific things in mind for these articles.

<dd>Perhaps it is that I am a mere neophyte in comparison to individuals such as yourselves. My humble apologies for not reading all of the <i><b>Talk</b></i> pages as I am still learning this marvelous entity called Wikipedia. My adding information and editing information to the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turtle_Creek_Chorale_7f8e.html" title="Turtle Creek Chorale">Turtle Creek Chorale</a> article was to improve the overall completeness of the Wikipedia. I have requested that the TCC add a notice granting permission to release their rights to Wikipedia for educational and informational purposes. This is of course to add more accurate and completeness, which is what I hope every contributor wishes. As they are a US 501(c)(3) Not-for-profit organization which seeks to educate, unite and uplift their audiences and members, it would be harsh to state that they are advertising on Wikipedia. In fact, you could view almost any article about a person, organization or corporation as a living advertisement. KZ, I love the superscripts on your Talk &amp; Contrib, perhaps you can teach me how to use them sometime. Happy writing...see you in a couple days after we work this out with TCC website.

<dd><b>Whoa</b> Fairuse violation, yes, but as this is now code on the page, not a template, it does NOT violate T1. Nail it on fair use, and dig thour the Userpage rules, but these ceased being templates after they were sub'd. You can embed a template, and you can substitute the code of the template onto the page, two different things. Watch out for the over reaching instructions, it sets bad precedent as subing T1 UBX's before deletion has been somewhat commonplace, and it can allready be easily handled under other rules violations allready -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 19:37, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anyway, I brought it here specifically to get that question answered since I haven't dealt with it before. I see at as roughly equivalent to having a userbox saying, "This user is opposed to international terrorism" and including a picture of George W. Bush on it. It is definitely divisive and inflammatory, like the deletion log said. I believe they should go and I am not sure why Khoikhoi subst'ed them right before deleting them.

It may be that they are distinct individuals whom Bless sins had recruited onto Wikipedia, or at least to the depictions discussion.

<dd>It turns out that many of the edits from this anon are happening at the same time Bless sins is editing but on different articles. See for example the edits by this anon IP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.126.81.88" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.126.81.88" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, at the exact same time Bless sins is editing another article while logged in, if you check Bless sin's contribution log. This suggests that they are different people, but in all seriousness if you make both ranges wide enough you can probably get a match anyhow. --64.230.123.126 03:07, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I object to characterizing Dmcdevit as a "clueless college kid". For my part, my previous unblock of Gwen Gale was conditional on refraining from future edit wars, and she then edit warred not too long after on an article regarding the same subject. I'm failing to see what you consider so unreasonable here. I would indeed be sorry to see her leave, but even good editors are not allowed to edit war or break 3RR. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a></sup></small> 07:29, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You suffer from the misimpression that edit warring is acceptable as long as it doesn't exceed 3 reverts in a page.

Unfortunately, edit warring is prohibited, certainly not "nothing wrong at all", and a blockworthy offense, especially in light of a block a little more than a week ago for 3RR, which was reversed upon her promise not to edit war. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:33, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To both sides, tempers seem to be getting out of control, all those who contribute to Wikipedia should be respected and thanked for doing so, but from a quick look at the contribs, both sides did break 3RR.

<dd>I can see that you are directing that message to me, clearly. The fact of the matter is that she was abusing the editting on her own talk page.

Also, my talk page is only <b>semiprotected</b> because there's an IP user who's being a dick (and move-protected because no one should be moving those pages).

<p>Some admin please take a look at LionheartX's repeated, very disruptive moves to article <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chonji.html" title="Chonji">Chonji</a>. At the talk page, there was a discussion and a vote to keep it at Chonji, against moving to Tianchi. LionheartX keeps moving without any discussion or consensus.</p>
<p>Then he give me a 3RR warning for undoing his moves, and then vandalizes by user page with a "suspected sock" tag. This is very disruptive trolling.</p>
<p>I bring this here because I see he has a history of disruptive behavior. <a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBAmonster_509b.html" title="User:BAmonster">BAmonster</a> 07:34, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I created <a href="../../../i/s/r/Image%7EIsrael_and_occupied_territories_map.png_f94f.html" title="Image:Israel and occupied territories map.png">Image:Israel and occupied territories map.png</a> a few days ago from an existing UN map (under a PD license) to provide a high-resolution overview of Israel, the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights and chunks of the neighboring countries. It replaced an earlier version of the same map, Image:Israel.png, which I also created from the same UN source. That map was the subject of a dispute between <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> and a number of other users concerning the classification (was it a map of Israel alone or a map of Israel plus the territories occupied by it?). I sought to resolve that dispute by retitling the map and renaming it (plus making some unrelated formatting changes) to make it clear that the map was indeed supposed to be of the entire region, not just Israel. I explained the changes and the rationale at <a href="../../../i/s/r/Image_talk%7EIsrael_and_occupied_territories_map.png_84c7.html" title="Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png">Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png</a>, and asked for an independent review at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Maps_fb9d.html#Request_for_review_of_map_classification" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Maps">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Maps#Request for review of map classification</a>. Nobody there saw any problems with it.</p>
<p>Three (presumably Israeli) users raised questions about the nomenclature at <a href="../../../i/s/r/Image_talk%7EIsrael_and_occupied_territories_map.png_84c7.html" title="Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png">Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png</a>. (The term "occupied territories" is taken from standard UN usage and is also replicated in the CIA World Factbook map of the region, which uses the term "Israeli-occupied" - see <a href="../../../c/i/a/Image%7ECia-is-map2.gif_d059.html" title="Image:Cia-is-map2.gif">Image:Cia-is-map2.gif</a>. Wikipedia uses "<a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-occupied_territories.html" title="Israeli-occupied territories">Israeli-occupied territories</a>".) In response to their concerns, I suggested renaming the map again to eliminate the term "occupied territories" (see <a href="../../../i/s/r/Image_talk%7EIsrael_and_occupied_territories_map.png_84c7.html#Alternative_proposal" title="Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png">Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png#Alternative proposal</a>). The discussion was ongoing and there was every chance of finding a solution that was acceptable to everybody.</p>
<p>Regrettably, <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> has decided to abuse his administrative powers by speedily deleting the image's placeholder from the English Wikipedia with the edit summary "enough is enough; restore the original image without your added commentary" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Undelete/Image:Israel_and_occupied_territories_map.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Undelete/Image:Israel_and_occupied_territories_map.png" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. He also posted to the talk page (addressed to me): "Your actions regarding these images are becoming increasingly abusive, and enough is enough." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Israel_and_occupied_territories_map.png&amp;diff=119412706&amp;oldid=119042551" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Israel_and_occupied_territories_map.png&amp;diff=119412706&amp;oldid=119042551" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> Jayjg had previously played no part in the discussion on <a href="../../../i/s/r/Image_talk%7EIsrael_and_occupied_territories_map.png_84c7.html" title="Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png">Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png</a> - this was his first edit to the talk page. (<i>Added</i>: the thing that has been deleted is a placeholder page categorising the image in two categories, not the image itself. The image is on the Commons. See my comments further down this thread for a detailed explanation.)</p>
<p>This is a blatant misuse of deletion authority for presumably POV reasons and is a completely unjustifiable personal attack as well. The map was not created for POV reasons. I've taken the time to explain every aspect of its creation and rationale on the talk page. As the talk page also shows, I've been working with the objecting editors to find a common solution, and I've directly asked them for their views (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Shuki&amp;diff=118468732&amp;oldid=118089798" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Shuki&amp;diff=118468732&amp;oldid=118089798" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>) - how on earth is this "abusive"?. Instead, Jayjg has decided to short-circuit all of that by speedily deleting the image page, posting a personal attack and attempting to shut down the efforts to find a compromise. The <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">deletion policy</a> was ignored, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith</a> was assumed and an unpleasant <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a> was posted out of the blue. As a former arbitrator (!) he of all people should know that isn't acceptable. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 08:34, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The term "occupied territories" is the official term for these regions, and it is a term used by the UN to describe them - therefore it is by definition a NPOV term. As you describe the facts Jayjg speedy-deleted the image, failing to satisfactory explain why he did that. But I would also like to listen to what he has to say.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 08:55, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The UN does indeed appear to refer to the territories as "occupied", discussion did appear to be happening in the talk page, and the speedy did appear to be out of process and non-<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a>.

<dd>Can we sum this up as "If it may be questionable for you to use admin tools in a given situation, request that someone uninvolved do so, just like a normal editor would do, and go from there?"

<dd>Chris, Jay wasn't involved in the dispute and took admin action to sort it out. You <i>were</i> involved, yet you also speedied two of the images the dispute was about.

<dd>I'm not saying you were wrong to do this, because I don't know the details, but I'm wondering why it would be wrong for Jay to take admin action when he's <i>not</i> involved, but all right for you to do it when you <i>are</i> involved. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:26, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not so. I originally speedied <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Israel.png">Image:Israel.png</a> because I uploaded it to the wrong place - en: rather than Commons. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Image%3AIsrael.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=Image%3AIsrael.png" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> Following the dispute over the categorisation, I modified the image to make the subject matter explicit (as explained at <a href="../../../i/s/r/Image_talk%7EIsrael_and_occupied_territories_map.png_84c7.html" title="Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png">Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png</a>) and de-linked the original image on en:. I requested <i>on the Commons</i> that the image be deleted as it had been obsoleted; this was actioned yesterday. There was no need to retain a "placeholder" for a deleted Commons image here on en:. I also created <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Israel annotated topographic.jpg">Image:Israel annotated topographic.jpg</a> and uploaded that <i>only</i> to the Commons. Following comments on en:, I realised that the image name was both ambiguous and inaccurate - it isn't purely of Israel, and it isn't a topographic map (it's of the entire SE Mediterranean region and it's a satellite image). To resolve this I re-uploaded it to the Commons as <a href="../../../s/o/u/Image%7ESoutheast_mediterranean_annotated_geography.jpg_41ef.html" title="Image:Southeast mediterranean annotated geography.jpg">Image:Southeast mediterranean annotated geography.jpg</a> - the same image with a different filename and some more annotations - along with an explanation of its purpose (<a href="../../../s/o/u/Image_talk%7ESoutheast_mediterranean_annotated_geography.jpg_1da2.html" title="Image talk:Southeast mediterranean annotated geography.jpg">Image talk:Southeast mediterranean annotated geography.jpg</a>).

My preference would have been to move the images to new names and overwrite them with the updated versions, but the images had to be deleted rather than moved because the Commons software doesn't support moves (see <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:FAQ#Technical_questions" class="extiw" title="commons:Commons:FAQ">Commons:FAQ#Technical questions</a>).

<dd>The CSD reasons were (1) author request (i.e. mine); (2) transwikiing in the case of the first image; (3) deletion of the referenced images on Commons in both cases.

Just to clarify, neither image is a "duplicate" - I don't think I've ever claimed this. I've been very explicit about why they were created and why I asked the Commons to delete the first versions.

<li>this apprears to be a similar case in regards to Israel related editing, where user appears to be adamant on anti-israeli presentations. As such, i think it is very much appropriate to firstly remove the bais presentation, and return the information only when an approved version is accepted upon - rather than doing it the other way around - misrepresenting events until a resolution is achieved.

<dd>Since you've added your personal perspective, let me add mine. I've been creating maps for Wikipedia since 2004 for places as diverse as Greece, Ukraine, Niger, East Timor and Azerbaijan. Dozens of my maps are in use across numerous Wikipedias. I've <i>never</i> in nearly four years of editing had to face such a barrage of hostility over a map as I have over this one: "blatant idiocy" (sic) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notice_board_for_Israel-related_topics&amp;diff=118364565&amp;oldid=117187027" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notice_board_for_Israel-related_topics&amp;diff=118364565&amp;oldid=117187027" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>); <b>"POV" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Israel_and_occupied_territories_map.png&amp;diff=118374588&amp;oldid=118366985" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Israel_and_occupied_territories_map.png&amp;diff=118374588&amp;oldid=118366985" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>); "attempt to place a POV" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Israel_and_occupied_territories_map.png&amp;diff=118566423&amp;oldid=118487292" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Israel_and_occupied_territories_map.png&amp;diff=118566423&amp;oldid=118487292" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>)</b> and "increasingly abusive" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Israel_and_occupied_territories_map.png&amp;diff=119412706&amp;oldid=119042551" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:Israel_and_occupied_territories_map.png&amp;diff=119412706&amp;oldid=119042551" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>). <b>There seems to be a tendency among some users - you, Jaakobou are one, Jayjg is plainly another - to constantly assume bad faith</b> on anything to do with edits on Middle Eastern matters that don't meet their personal POV.

I requested the deletion of the original image <i>on the Commons</i>; this has now actioned and the original image no longer exists, which is why it shows as a redlink.

<p>ChrisO was involved in a dispute about an image, and, from what I could tell, proceeded to delete the image and upload a different version, to further his own POV about what the image was about. I was not involved in a dispute regarding that image, but viewed ChrisO's actions as an abuse of admin powers, similar to his abuse of admin powers last week, when he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=protect&amp;user=ChrisO&amp;page=Image%3AIsrael.png" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=protect&amp;user=ChrisO&amp;page=Image%3AIsrael.png" rel="nofollow">protected the image</a> while involved in an edit war over it, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=ChrisO&amp;page=Image%3AIsrael.png" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=ChrisO&amp;page=Image%3AIsrael.png" rel="nofollow">subsequently deleted it</a>. ChrisO seems to be playing fast and loose with his admin powers here, protecting, deleting and re-uploading modified versions of images when he gets into conflicts over them. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 18:58, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let's get this clear. First, I deleted the <i>image</i> from the English Wikipedia on 20 March, before all of this blew up, because I'd uploaded it to the wrong place - en: rather than Commons. The subsequent deletion of the same immage from the Commons was done by a Commons admin following an unopposed request at <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Deletion_requests/Image:Israel.png" class="extiw" title="commons:Commons:Deletion_requests/Image:Israel.png">Commons:Deletion requests/Image:Israel.png</a>. As the author of the image, I have an explicit right to ask for its deletion. Second, the accusation of "furthering my own POV about what the image was about" is utterly wrong - I said <i>right from the start</i> that the image was a map of Israel and the occupied territories. I then had the bizarre experience of users ignoring my stated reasons and in effect claiming I didn't know my own intentions. That's why I added an explicit rationale and statement of intent at <a href="../../../i/s/r/Image_talk%7EIsrael_and_occupied_territories_map.png_84c7.html" title="Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png">Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png</a> - to make it crystal clear why the image was created and what it was about. The change to the image caption and filename were similarly intended to make this clear. Third, you're mistaken (I'm assuming good faith here...) about your own previous involvement. I pulled this revert out of the edit history for Image:Israel.png: <i>03:17, 25 March 2007 . . Jayjg (Talk | contribs | block) (don't need a cat for one map).</i>. Finally, the deletion of the <i>placeholder page</i> (not the image) at Image:Israel.png was undertaken because of the deletion of the image on the Commons. We simply don't need to have placeholders for deleted images.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But let's also get past your smokescreen and get to the heart of what this is about. You speedily deleted a page without giving <i>any</i> rationale beyond what I can only describe as an order directed at me. You were involved in a dispute over the previous version of the image. You issued a personal attack: "Your actions regarding these images are becoming increasingly abusive." You assumed bad faith. You plainly had a POV objection, but didn't try discussing it with me or any of the other users on the talk page, who were trying in good faith to reach a common solution. I'm still not clear what your objection was, because you've never bothered to explain it to anyone (and still haven't). That sort of conduct would be unacceptable coming from any admin, but coming from a recent former arbitrator it's mindboggling. A few months ago you were voting to ban people who did exactly the same sort of things. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 19:19, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a fellow mapmaker, I think I agree with ChrisO on this; he replaced an image <i>he created</i> and <i>he uploaded</i> with what he perceived to be a less POV version, and I personally agree with that assessment. My prescription for this is that we all sit down, calm down, and realize that after all of this discussion, deletion, reversion, etc., we seem to be exactly back where we were after ChrisO uploaded the new map and before Jayjg deleted things. In other words, I say we start over and discuss the merits of the new map, without getting into immediate accusations of POV and deletions.

<dd>Chris, much of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Image_talk%7EIsrael_and_occupied_territories_map.png_84c7.html" title="Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png">the discussion on the map</a> was editors telling you why it is not proper to unilaterally create a new map with an altered name to fit your new filename (the <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/israel.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/israel.pdf" rel="nofollow">original UN map</a> was titled 'Israel', which you reproduced in the first image, and altered to '...and the occupied territories' on <a href="../../../i/s/r/Image%7EIsrael_and_occupied_territories_map.png_f94f.html" title="Image:Israel and occupied territories map.png">the second</a>), and then replace the original map across WP.

<dd>I'm not going to repeat myself indefinitely here, so let me do it once more for the record: I created both images as an overview of Israel and the territories. I stated this explicitly at the time. Because the filename and caption were ambiguous, it promptly got jumped on by several users. I changed the filename and the caption to make the subject of the map explicitly clear <i>in the image itself</i>. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:07, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is the crux of the issue - you decided to modify/label/name the new images as "...and occupied territories", which is a content decision, despite the original UN image only being titled "Israel". That would be fine if discussion then formed a consensus declaring that a better description than the original UN image's, but instead you unilaterally enforced the change (with admin tools - deletion, hence AN/I) while the discussion was ongoing (Talk reflects that <i>your changes</i> are what "promptly got jumped on by several users"). That this comes on the tail of a previous misuse of admin tools on your part a week ago (on this very image) is why there is so much concern. Please show us that you realise what the problem is and that you'll be more careful about it. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 22:01, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I might take your comments more seriously if they didn't come from three members of a POV-pushing clique, the activities of which are well known to and deplored by a number of admins, not just myself (see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118256099" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118256099" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>).

<dd>Thanks Chris0 for your side of the story, and the very enlightening links. As a participant in most of this, I must be seeing something completely different from what Tewfik is seeing. Tewfik's characterizations of what happened seem very inaccurate. To sum it up, you, Chris0 have been trying to create content, and to modify it at the request of discussion on talk pages. Tewfik and Jayjg have not been creating content. Tewfik has been trying very hard to eliminate this map category, <a href="../../../m/a/p/Category%7EMaps_of_the_Palestinian_territories_cf72.html" title="Category:Maps of the Palestinian territories">Category:Maps of the Palestinian territories</a>. That has already been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive219#Use_of_admin_tools_in_content_dispute" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive219#Use_of_admin_tools_in_content_dispute" rel="nofollow">discussed on the incident board</a> on March 26, 2007. Until recently that desire on his part to eliminate the map category is all he clearly discussed on the talk page for the map in question (<a href="../../../i/s/r/Image%7EIsrael_and_occupied_territories_map.png_f94f.html" title="Image:Israel and occupied territories map.png">Image:Israel and occupied territories map.png</a>). On April 1, Jayjg deleted that modified UN map with the cryptic edit summary of "enough is enough." His comment on the talk page was, "I've deleted the image; restore the original, without your added commentary. Your actions regarding these images are becoming increasingly abusive, and enough is enough." That was his first participation on the talk page for that map. This was several days after Chris0 had asked, "Would it be more acceptable if the map was recaptioned 'Israel with the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights' - eliminating the collective term 'territories' altogether?" So I see great effort by Chris0 to discuss changes and to accommodate people, and little or no effort to engage in current discussion from Tewfik and Jayjg. It is all on the talk page: <a href="../../../i/s/r/Image_talk%7EIsrael_and_occupied_territories_map.png_84c7.html" title="Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png">Image talk:Israel and occupied territories map.png</a>. Tewfik and Jayjg seem to be mad about some perceived problems from days before. I thought that was taken care of in a previous discussion on the incident board here:</dd>

<dd>Jay, I call it as I see it. As I see it, many of the Middle East articles - not my normal subject area by any means - are being used as soapboxes by a group of editors (including a few admins) who are seeking to impose a specifically right-wing American/Israeli POV. In the process, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> are frequently being ignored or bent; bad faith is assumed of anyone who doesn't share their POV; attempts to fix problems with articles are being reverted without discussion; fringe sources are preferred over the mainstream; editors who aren't part of the clique are denounced as biased, disruptive or abusive. I should add that there <i>are</i> of course editors who are biased, disruptive and abusive in editing Middle East articles, but accusations of such conduct seem to be made at the drop of a hat.</dd>

<dd>As an example of a grossly bad article produced by this clique, I'll point to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_al-Durrah_f90d.html" title="Muhammad al-Durrah">Muhammad al-Durrah</a> - I've never edited it but it's plain from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_al-Durrah&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_al-Durrah&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">article's history</a> that the clique has been fighting off any attempts to make the article conform with NPOV and ATT. The entire article is written from a conspiracy theorist's POV, using fringe sources, with POV-pushers removing references to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> and <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_News_5160.html" title="BBC News">BBC News</a> on the grounds that neither organization is a reliable source (!). That's comparable to writing <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Olson_271a.html" title="Barbara Olson">Barbara Olson</a> exclusively from the POV of a <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theorist</a> and junking anything CNN says on the subject because it doesn't suit the conspiracy theorist's POV. This sort of behaviour is totally at odds with our aim of producing neutral, reliably sourced articles, and it's going to end up in an arbitration sooner or later. If you'd like to improve Wikipedia in a small way, might I suggest that you try fixing that article so that it conforms with our basic policies? -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 22:14, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Chris, in fairness, you edit from a strong POV yourself. You're currently trying to suggest at <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombietime.html" title="Zombietime">Zombietime</a> that only the United States regards Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zombietime&amp;diff=119819305&amp;oldid=119817859" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zombietime&amp;diff=119819305&amp;oldid=119817859" rel="nofollow">[57]</a> and that the views of people who support those groups are only regarded as extreme in the context of U.S. politics, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AZombietime&amp;diff=119828486&amp;oldid=119816174" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AZombietime&amp;diff=119828486&amp;oldid=119816174" rel="nofollow">[58]</a> which is demonstrably false. Hamas is listed as a terrorist group by Canada, the European Union, Israel, Japan, and the U.S. Several countries other than the U.S. regard Hezbollah or its external security arm as a designated terrorist organization. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:45, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SlimVirgin, I have seen what you are doing now many times from many editors and several admins. I ask that you apologize to Chris0 for the smear and slander implied by your above comment. If you don't see the smear and slander then I ask you to reread what you wrote, follow the links, and put everything in context. If you still can't see the smear and slander, I ask you to consider resigning as an admin. Please see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias</a> to see why this is not a personal attack on my part. It is a formal request I am making on an administrators' noticeboard concerning the content of your remarks, and not about your character. Like Tewfik, you are inaccurately characterizing things, assuming bad faith, and generally assuming the worst about someone. I have lived outside the USA for several years. So I know somewhat of what Chris0 is saying. Chris0 is eminently NOT editing from a strong POV, as you say. Quite the opposite. He is being very NPOV. The fact that you don't see it is disturbing, but understandable. It is the reason for the existence of the project I linked to. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 23:45, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not trying to suggest anything of the sort, as you very well know, and Timeshifter is right to characterise your comments as slanderous. Let me point out that <i>I myself</i> said that Hezbollah is a designated terrorist organisation in several countries other than the US, including my own (see <a href="../../../z/o/m/Talk%7EZombietime_b7f0.html#Terrorist_organisations" title="Talk:Zombietime">Talk:Zombietime#Terrorist organisations</a>, well before you tried to pin this "terrorist-supporter" tag on me. The point I've been making all along is that there is no universal agreement on what is or is not a terrorist organisation. You and I happen to think that Hamas, Hezbollah etc are terrorist organisations. Others do not. This is a statement of plain fact, not POV. Frankly, you seem to make a habit of this sort of deliberate twisting of someone else's comments and <i>ad hominem</i> accusations of POV.

<dd>I also don't want to keep on posting about this, but I have to point out that shortly after my post above from today, you voted oppose to ATT, in part on the grounds that you are "concerned that some of the proponents may have ulterior motives in pushing this so hard. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution/Poll&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119851703" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution/Poll&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119851703" rel="nofollow">[59]</a> That is so thoroughly out of order and below the belt it leaves me almost speechless. If you're talking about me, I've worked very hard to develop and maintain V and NOR for <i>two years</i> because I don't want to see Wikipedia publish unsourced nonsense. I worked hard for months to develop ATT because I feel it's a clearer rendition of the V and NOR concepts. You're welcome to disagree with me, but you can't imply there was an "ulterior motive" without saying what and who and giving diffs; and it's not clear what such a motive could possibly be, given that the two pages say the same thing. I'll leave it to others here to judge whether your responses in this thread have been reasonable or not. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:40, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We all know that the debate is being watched by people hostile to Wikipedia. There have been claims about Jayjg and SlimVirgin's involvement which I won't repeat here and haven't repeated in the poll, and which for the record I don't believe for a moment, especially not in SlimVirgin's case given all the work she's put into this. Unfortunately both Jayjg and SlimVirgin's prominence in editing controversial articles has made them a target for many unjustified claims of improper behaviour. If a perception develops among the Wikipedia community that such a fundamental change is being forced through for improper reasons, that's going to be absolutely disastrous for our reputation - far worse than the Essjay affair and potentially causing permanent damage to the community. We absolutely have to avoid this. I support the objective of streamlining existing policies, but we need to take more time, use more patience and get the politics right. My approach to this issue is a strictly <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabius_Maximus_e757.html" title="Fabius Maximus">Fabian</a> one. Regarding the comment clarification, it looks like I posted it a matter of seconds after you posted your message above. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 01:24, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Chris, this isn't fair. You're repeating nonsense from Wikipedia Review. For a start, Jay had nothing to do with developing ATT. Secondly, there <i>is</i> no fundamental change. Third, hundreds of editors have looked at it, commented on it, and helped to develop it, including editors who worked on V and NOR. <i>I</i> helped to develop V and NOR in their current form, so if ATT is tainted, then so are the others. You really are out of order. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:44, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I'm <b>not</b> repeating WR (didn't I just say I wasn't citing or repeating any claims?). I'm saying that <i>claims have been made</i> by hostile parties, and we have to do everything we can to ensure that other potentially hostile parties - the media, members of the community who don't like ATT, the external trolls - don't buy into those claims. That doesn't mean I'm calling for you to step aside - absolutely not. It <i>does</i> mean that we have to avoid <i>giving any impression</i> that the process is stacked. Time, patience and better politics. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 01:54, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unbelievable! After I post about smears, slanders, and not assuming good faith on the part of Tewfik and SlimVirgin, we are now into using mind-reading and comment timing as tools for assuming the worst about people. Please resign, SlimVirgin. You did not even bother with the courtesy of a reply to the substance of my comment. Instead, you escalated your personal attack on Chris0. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 01:15, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

SlimVirgin wrote: "Other people spoke up, either in defense of him [Jayjg] or pointing out similar behavior from you [Chris0]." What actually happened was that there was a near consensus of admins who disagreed with Jayjg's deletion of the map. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 04:13, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You miss the rather important points that (a) from the start I explicitly created the map as an overview of Israel <i>and the occupied territories</i>, not just Israel, so the caption needed to make that clear&#160;; and (b) more fundamentally perhaps, <b>we're not allowed to use unmodified UN maps</b>. They <i>have</i> to be modified else they don't comply with the UN license, which I negotiated with the UN in the first place - see <a href="../../../u/n/_/Template%7EUN_map_e757.html" title="Template:UN map">Template:UN map</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/_/Template_talk%7EUN_map_f14d.html" title="Template talk:UN map">Template talk:UN map</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 12:14, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

His ongoing badgering about a lot of nothing is certainly not becoming in an administrator...his "guarantee to take it further" is also highly inappropriate and I see it as a threat to make a poor administrative decision on his part, especially since this is an article that he has had disagreements with me in the past, and his behavior in regards to this same article was a major issue by those who opposed his <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Guinnog_70ac.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Guinnog">request for adminship</a>.

<dd>Great, not only did a conspiracy theorist finally get admin status, but it was by the thinnest of margins. This is making me rethink my current abstention from RFA. I don't quite know what to say, except that if Guinnog does this again (among other things, justifying libel - I notice that Guinnog, while adding a welcome template to his new buddy, chose not to actually warn the chap for violating BLP, which was the main reason that warning was there in the first place), you should take this straight to RfC and/or Arbcom. I like how Guinnog is inviting this person to 'add their thoughts' to improving the article, as if anything they put remotely belongs. Sad. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 09:55, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Guinnog did nothing wrong here</b> and acted in good faith. I would suggest that you do not just try to get rid of every administrator who doesn't follow your instructions, it could lose us valuable wikipedians - Guinnog has tirelessly reverted vandalism since he got here - just see his contribs. I don't think there is any question of his commitment to the project.

<li>Guinnog absolutely did do wrong, in that these edits were in blatant violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Any administrator intervention should have been in support of warning the editor never to repeat this grossly inappropriate behaviour. Whether a polite note to MONGO would also have been appropriate is immaterial. I have blocked that account because (a) every edit appears to violate one or other of the two policies noted above and (b) if it's not a sockpuppet then I'm a monkey's uncle. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 11:27, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I must agree with MONGO, and I'll state that I have handed out similar warnings in similar cases myself (on articles in the domains I edit). Even though these cases may not technically match our standard definitions of vandalism perfectly, there is a point where reckless POV-pushing becomes so blatant and so disruptive that an anti-vandal response is legitimate. Nobody in their right mind can possibly believe that the statement <i>"7 World Trade Center collapsed in an obvious, controlled demolition, ordered by owner Larry Silverstein"</i> fairly and accurately reflects the current state of commonly accepted human knowledge. Even if you happen to believe that the statement is true, you simply <i>must</i> know it's not commonly accepted and not "obvious". A user who makes edits like this is either not acting in good faith, or so clueless about the purpose of Wikipedia they really shouldn't be here. Come to that, there's the very real BLP issue. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 11:02, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Guinnog told me it would have been better had I done a BLP warning instead of a vandalism warning, but seeing that the editor has such a very limited contribution history, his edit appeared to be clear vandalism. <a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">User:Tbeatty</a> later placed a BLP warning template on his talkpage. My biggest concern about this entire affair is to wonder why I would be badgered for the entire editing session about a whole lot of nothing when I had hoped to be working on other things of interest to me. It appears Guinnog was trying to goad me into saying something nasty.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 11:13, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Guinogg exercised poor judgment in reverting MONGO and leaving a message on MONGO's page. Guinogg was involved in the article. It is inappropriate to act as both a contributor and an administrator as it has a chilling effect on contributions. At most he should have simply expressed his viw as an editor on MONGO's talk page without reversion and without an administrator warning. That would have given MONGO the choice of amending the warning to be more specific or taken no action. Guinogg's next choice should have been to bring it here for comment. But ating unilaterally was inappropriate considering his involvement. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 15:45, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, AumakuaSatori made edits which were POV and BLP violations. No, MONGO did not correctly deal with those as POV and BLP problems, but rather incorrectly as 'vandalism'. No, Guinnog did not defend AumakuaSatori and was not wrong to tell MONGO to stop misusing the vandalism template.</dd>
<dd>Guinnog was acting, correctly, under the guidance of things like <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>... new users doing things they shouldn't may simply not know / understand. The proper response is to calmly inform them of things like NPOV and verifiability. It is certainly possible that this was a sockpuppet, troll, or new but equally intractable user who would never comply with policy... but usually we <i>tell</i> them about those policies and block them <b>after</b> they continue to violate them, not before. If we've reached the point where it is <i>wrong</i> to give new users the benefit of the doubt / tell them what is actually wrong with their edits we should ditch <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> and rewrite <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> to make clear that in only applies to 'established contributors'. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:42, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It was a standard vandalism warning....indeed, the editing hisory of this probable sock account has at least one other BLP violation and vandalism as well. Replacing my warning with a welcome is ridiculous. AGF didn't seem to apply to me...so obviously "admins" such as yourself and Guinnog would rather AGF of vandals than established editors...how interesting.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 16:30, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've just belatedly come across this thread (I'm travelling with limited internet access this week). The violation of WP:LIVING, WP:VERIFIABILITY/ATTRIBUTION, and common decency involved in posting that Larry Silverstein obviously blew up his own building on 9/11 is extremely serious. I don't care precisely what warning template is used, but assertions of that nature must never be allowed to remain posted on Wikipedia, much less being restored by an experienced editor or administrator. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:52, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That assertion <b>wasn't' <i>"allowed to remain",</i></b> <i>wasn't</i> "restored by an experienced editor or administrator", wasn't 'endorsed' by anyone, et cetera.

<dd>Seeing <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a>'s note on <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a>'s talk page and then the words 'demolition' and 'collapse' I knew immediately what article was being talked about. I'd thought to try to educate him how readily recognizable AumakuaSatori's 'edit' was, but in finishing up my comment I found Guinnog had been at the page for quite a long time, and <i>must</i> know it was a bad edit. I backed off, not knowing what to think. And then re-reading his comment to MONGO, there was <i>"I'd like to see you use discussion and references to reliable sources rather than labelling them a vandal. I don't see any vandalism in the user's edits but an attempt to improve the article."</i> That shook me, because if Guinnog had been anywhere near the article for any length of time, and knew MONGO had been too, his comment was pure nitroglycerin. Given my perceptions <i>at the time</i>, and after checking around, I guess I have to take exception to any summarizing that Guinnog was acting correctly with respect with another editor, MONGO. Read the talk page, check the page histories, re-read his initial comment, Guinnog was being provocative. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 23:54, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I consider the situation to be water under ther bridge now, so long as people will not spend hours badgering me about warning another editor about vandalism.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 05:05, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I've been away. To paraphrase <i><a href="../../../a/i/r/Airplane%21.html" title="Airplane!">Airplane!</a></i>, "Looks like I picked the wrong weekend to move house...". I considered the situation to be already water under the bridge when I last spoke to MONGO about it on Saturday evening when I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119319375" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119319375" rel="nofollow">apologised</a> to him. I admit (as I already admitted to MONGO) that I was wrong to replace his bad warning template with a welcome one; I should have also added a more accurate warning in the 15 minutes before Tbeatty did, instead of getting into an unproductive discussion with MONGO about it, and I thank Tbeatty for that. I never used or threatened to use admin powers over the matter.</dd>
<dd>The edit which I promised to take further if MONGO failed to correct it was his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=7_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119274883" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=7_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119274883" rel="nofollow">mistaken reversion with unhelpful edit summary</a> of my (fairly non-controversial) attempt to edit the article, something I have incidentally very seldom done. MONGO <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119277634" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119277634" rel="nofollow">explained</a> that he "thought [he] was reverting the vandalism by the anon (sic)". A look at <a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html" title="Help:Reverting">Help:Reverting</a> might be in order; "Do not revert changes simply because someone makes an edit you consider problematic, biased, or inaccurate. Improve the edit, rather than reverting it." and "<b>Reverting is not a decision which should be taken lightly</b>". One ought to at least read the edit one is reverting, I think.</dd>
<dd>I take heed of the opinions of others here, and I note with sadness that some have commented on the matter who clearly have not researched what actually happened. I have always understood that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> applies to users here as much as to anyone else, and vandalism warnings should not be misapplied by anyone. <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> dictates that we assume good faith in newbie users; I found it instructive how little good faith was assumed on my part. As CBD says, if this is now to be the way that AGF is implemented, perhaps we need to edit the policy to make it clear that it only applies to established users.</dd>
<dd>Nonetheless I accept that I did not handle the situation in the best way. As JzG says, I should have sent MONGO a note querying his use of the template first of all, rather than changing the template. I thank I'm so special, Chacor and Newyorkbrad for alerting me to this centralised discussion, something MONGO failed to do.</dd>
<dd>Next time I see MONGO misapply vandalism warnings I think I will bring it straight here and let others who MONGO may feel are more neutral deal with it. As I already said, I sincerely hope there will not be a next time. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 07:05, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Next time you harass me about nothing, and make the mistakes you have made over this affair, I won't waste time with an Rfc, I'll take it straight to arbcom. His edits were vandalism, read all about it. Nevertheless, JzG took care of that, he's blocked now, something you should have done yourself if you were an impartial administrator.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 07:30, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I... I don't know if I can say anything bad about someone who paraphrases Airplane!. You've caused quite an internal conundrum.</dd>
<dd>As for your apology, I will sheepishly admit that I missed it; I had looked through your contribs but somehow glanced right over that one.</dd>
<dd>But seriously, we don't need to issue total good faith to these folks. I very much doubt that, when pointed out that his theory was not welcome, he would have said, "Oh, pardon me sirs, I won't do it again, I'll go over here and edit an article on grasses". However, I cannot read his mind.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps a vandal template was the wrong thing to do. But a nice note saying that their theories aren't welcome here? That might be nice.</dd>
<dd>Either way, I apologize for the brash tone of my comments above. Thank you for responding. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 07:11, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, that was going to be the substance of my comment at the time to <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">User:MONGO</a> (which I also deleted out of trepidation at the situation). Not finding an applicable template, and knowing that editor's time is precious, I was going to suggest that for situations like this which could be foreseen, perhaps a cut-n-paste text from a sub-page would be helpful. Something that says this same subject edit has been made N to the N times before, and could the contributor please read the talk page archives first, then bring up any <i>new</i> discussion areas on the current talk page, as mere repetition is not a good thing (which is why the revert was done). Of course, maybe the user warning templates people just haven't edited pages where the same edits have been seen literally 20, 30, 50 times before? Could we suggest creating a new template, or else they <i>have</i> to watchlist these pages?&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 07:48, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The blocking was forewarned by <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaillimh_1708.html" title="User:Gaillimh">User:Gaillimh</a> but not 'discussed' in any meaningful sense. It was strictly a 'do it or you are blocked' ultimatum. <b>Play Brian Moore</b> is what the user signs signs all his edits; which was (I think) the compromise reached in 2005. In order to see the "Fenian Swine" you must go to his Userpage. Furthermore, as an avowed Fenian himself (a claim supported by his contributions) he states his use of "swine" is ironic. In this case, given all the facts and previous compromise two years ago, it seems to me that this blocking is totally OTT and not in the <i>spirit</i> of Wikipedia.

<dd>As the blocking admin, I'll note that the name "Fenian Swine" is indeed blatantly offensive (and he was, in fact, originally blocked for just that reason). With regards to the username policy, and the aforementioned section in particular, <i>Usernames that are recognised as slurs or insults</i> are disallowed. Such usernames fall under the scope of what is labelled <i>Inflammatory usernames</i> on the policy page. This applies to this user, as a "Fenian" is sometimes used as an insult directed at Catholics and nationalists. However, if someone is a member of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinn_F%C3%A9in_5dd5.html" title="Sinn Féin">Sinn Féin</a>, he might identify himself and his mates as Fenians, where no insult is intended. It's a bit confusing if you're not from Ireland, and the only similar comparison I can make is that it's a bit similar to when African-Americans use the word "nigga" as a substitute for "mate" or "friend." Conversely, when those outside of the African-American community use the word, it's usually in a disparaging tone. One can see that this user is attempting to use the word "Fenian" as an insult as his full username is "Fenian Swine." As you may already know, swine is a term for pig, which is almost never used in a flattering term. Ironic or not, the username is ridiculous and disparaging towards Catholic nationalists. In addition, if one looks at my discourses with the user, one will see that I had asked him to change his username beginning eight days prior to the block being issused. During this time, I attempted to work with this user and was rebuffed several times. I also ignored his incivility in the hopes that he would change his username. That is, the block was used as a last resort <a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>gaillimh</b></span></font></a><a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup></a> 19:12, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>For a 2 year old user account, blocking is not the correct answer, and its certainly not the last resort. WP:RFCN is the right place to go. Disagreeing with you on changing his username is not appropriate grounds for blocking unless there is community consensus per WP:RFCN. For an account just created, I can understand blocking and posting to RFCN upon the user's request <i>if this were a new account</i>, but this particular block was very much the wrong action to take. --<a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutocracy_4fe0.html" title="User:Autocracy"><span style="background:darkblue; color:white"><b>Auto</b></span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../a/u/t/User_talk%7EAutocracy_ca14.html" title="User talk:Autocracy"><span style="background:#B0C4DE; color:black"><i>talk</i></span></a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Autocracy_0ad6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Autocracy"><span style="background:#B0C4DE; color:black"><i>contribs</i></span></a>)</sup> 04:21, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia:Editor review/Anynobody. Really sorry to be here again but his relentless creepy preoccupation with me just seems to have no end! Looks like clear misuse of the Editor Review process. <b>Suggest a block</b> so he really gets it that he should go edit articles or something and leave me alone. <i>(He does edit mostly naval articles, I mean also better invest the time he wastes being preoccupied with me and misusing the processes here to pursue said preoccupation)</i> Other than <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a> a while back, he and I do not edit together!!

<li>Well, I won't <i>block</i> Anynobody for trolling, and I doubt anybody else will either. But otherwise I agree with Justanother: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editor_review/Anynobody" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editor_review/Anynobody" rel="nofollow">this Editor review</a> is a mere troll. I was just thinking of taking it to ANI myself. It's an attack page, lightly disguised as a request for review of Anynobody's dispute resolution skills—and guess what, the example dispute turns out to be that between Anynobody and Justanother— very inventive! And as JA points out, it comes on top of some very strange use by AN of other processes, notably a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_Anynobody_0aa8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Anynobody">rather frivolous RFA</a> devoted to attacks rather than any realistic attempt to attain adminship. I should declare an interest here: I'm one of the people attacked, see especially the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_Anynobody_0aa8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Anynobody">RFA talkpage</a>. Anyway, I recommend people to take a look at this request for editor review, it's quite a document. In my opinion it should be deleted as misuse of process. Being one of Anynobody's targets, I won't delete it myself, but somebody might like to. Anynobody, please stop all this, leave Justanother and the other people you resent alone. Abandon the idea that you must triumph over your "enemies" at all costs, walk away. I honestly think you'll feel better. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 15:42, 1 April 2007 (UTC).</li>

<dl>
<dd>I concur with the above opinion. It was my feeling that, even if the user is gaming the system, the system needs to be honored somewhat. If there were 48 hours without actual progress from someone other than Anynobody at the editorial review, I was going to delete it. If there were 24 hours without any comment from another party, then I would delete it. The point is that this is trolling, but trolls are best starved, not whacked. At the peril of <i>again</i> being misread, I suggest that these are virtual tarbabies: the more you strike them, the more you stuck you are, and so few people are listening or interested in what Anynobody is saying that I suspect it can fail with a whimper. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:56, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Tom. Thanks for your help with the phony Editor Review. Yes, you are right, that is the beginnings of an RfC or ArbCom on <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmee_be9e.html" title="User:Smee">User:Smee</a> (formerly Smeelgova). Certainly my user space is the appropriate place for me to work on it. It goes without saying that those are charges against Smee that I intend to pursue. Another editor has already added his experience. After Smee's promise to reform and as a sign of good faith (please see my User Talk) I have put it on hold. If I see a turnaround then I will save it off-wiki and delete the page. I must say, however that, so far, reviews are mixed on Smee. A couple positives but a few negatives too including misrepresentation on my talk page and her unwillingness to accept that I will not delete the page until I see some change. She very much wants the cart before the horse. But I remain hopeful. Thanks for your time. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 01:17, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Honestly, this is one of those occasions where we really need to feed no food. People can prepare RFC's in their private spaces. People abusing the rules in order to simply say the same things over and over is no good. In fact, abusing AN/I for "tell me again and again and again" is abuse. Tom, don't answer. Smee and Anynobody, let go of your grievance. Justanother, archive your evidence, if those guys do as they have been urged/admonished to do.

I then realized that he was clearly causing trouble; so I started monitoring his recent edits regularly, and have to revert or de-tag about dozen of prod/speedy tagged articles(none of which I created) a number of which again were expanded to decent articles. To top things off, earlier today he/she vandalized <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_advocate.html" title="Devil's advocate">devil's advocate</a> by inserting c's into the middle of several interwiki links. Because a registered user made a good faith edit and failed to notice it, I had to remove the c's myself.

<dd>Paul McCann, Chief, Public Information Office, UNRWA Headquarters Gaza, writes, in part that: <code>The Weekly Standard's characterization of Peter Hansen, UNRWA's Commissioner General as an anti-Semitic "peasant-in-chief" is <b>pure slander</b> and an insult to the intelligence of the magazine's readership.</code> David Tell responds in part that: <code>One of the books in question, for instance, turned out to include such evocative lessons as this: "Treachery and disloyalty are character traits of the Jews and one should beware of them"; UNRWA's researchers advised the State Department <sup><b>{{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}</b></sup> that the phrase could not fairly be considered offensive because it described actual "historical events."</code> <sup>(from <a href="http://www.tomgrossmedia.com/mideastdispatches/archives/000578.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tomgrossmedia.com/mideastdispatches/archives/000578.html" rel="nofollow">[70]</a>, bold is my emphasis)</sup> Perhaps this unsourced statement in good enough for the standards of the <i><a href="../../../w/e/e/Weekly_Standard_59f2.html" title="Weekly Standard">Weekly Standard</a></i>, but I hardly see why they should be good enough for Wikipedia.

<dd>The TWS piece quoted is a response to that rebuttal, and no one ever requested it be included.

<p>I'm not sure what policy this would fall under, but it seems like a really questionable thing to do. One editor here has been unable to insert his point of view into a particular article (COI as well) and has written an article on his website detailing what he thinks is wrong with wikipedia in general, and this specific article, as well as instructing readers to come to wikipedia and "fix" these things. That's his business, he has every right to do that.</p>
<p>But recently an editor sent a newcomer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Crystal_Healer&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119143323" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Crystal_Healer&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119143323" rel="nofollow">a welcome message that included a link to this advocacy page</a> ("For a perspective from another author on paranormal coverage in Wikipedia, go here."). This seems like a big conflict of interest and encouragement to do POV pushing (both the new editor and the one have already engaged in some blatant POV edits, and this seems like an attempt to recruit potential bodies to help in revert wars and such). I'd appreciate if an admin would take a look at this and either make a recommendation or take whatever action is appropriate. At the very least, is it appropriate to remove the link to the advocacy site? --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinderbinder_2383.html" title="User:Minderbinder">Minderbinder</a> 14:45, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

And while attempting to "explain" to me why my additions were wrong, he referred to me as an "Armenian joke" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MarshallBagramyan#Rmvl_of_AG_reference" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MarshallBagramyan#Rmvl_of_AG_reference" rel="nofollow">[88]</a>. He furthermore continues with accusations that I am a part of fringe Armenian political party (the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation_c3c3.html" title="Armenian Revolutionary Federation">Armenian Revolutionary Federation</a>, (ARF) ) whose sole purpose is to essentially terrorize Turkish related articles, that the party supposedly terrorized Turks 100 years ago, and continues to do so now on Wikipedia: "<b>ARF members are attacking everything they found honorable around</b>, this time Ataturk, They are constantly deleting significant information that proves they made mistakes." One successive attack after another, all because he believed my additions were too insulting to the person in question the article is about.</p>
<p>Later, my propositions on the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Resistance_871b.html" title="Van Resistance">Van Resistance</a> talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Van_Resistance#Opposition_of_deletion_of_content." class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Van_Resistance#Opposition_of_deletion_of_content." rel="nofollow">[89]</a> turned hostile when the same user became indignant about them, and again attacked my people as a whole: "<b>When history is written by Armenians with Armenian lexicography it is nice</b>, but rest is bad and ugly. Truth has no value in these arguments" , "MarshallBagramyan says: ""LETS get rid of it" <b>Of course. There is a group of Armenian soldiers which votes to get rid of even the name of these activities</b>" , "It is so dogmatic <b>that the people like MarshallBagramyan 's view of history</b> [my note: that is, in reference to us Armenians]; if the answers of these questions are not in his/her history book (lets say the bible of the truth) the questions are not (or should not be) valuable questions."</p>
<p>All these comments and yet he still feels that it is necessary to add the comment "thanks" at the end of his messages.

<p>Yesterday evening Daniel Brandt e-mailed me with a proposal to allow him to begin editing again. Brandt has been banned for a while now due to spats with some of our administrators; he has been editing Wikipedia since then using a number of sockpuppet accounts.</p>
<p>The premise of Brandt's proposal was that he has a lot to contribute to Wikipedia. He runs NameBase, a comprehensive database of biographical articles citing thousands of reliable sources. Brandt is an "old-school" researcher who would be invaluable to our biographies of living people. Although some people may have old fights to pick with him, he suggested a mentorship to prevent personal disputes from disrupting his editing.</p>
<p>I have decided to take a <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> action in the interest of improving the encyclopedia and allow Brandt to start editing again.

<p>Before I could get on to reporting these two users, you probably should know who Danny Daniel is. Danny Daniel is a user who vandalized pages related My Gym Partner's a Monkey and Zatch Bell!. His confirmed sockpuppets like to create hoaxes and vandalise articles related to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fairly_OddParents_90b9.html" title="The Fairly OddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Gym_Partner%27s_a_Monkey_1e4d.html" title="My Gym Partner's a Monkey">My Gym Partner's a Monkey</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/s/Foster%27s_Home_for_Imaginary_Friends_4c3c.html" title="Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends">Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/-/Re-Animated_5392.html" title="Re-Animated">Re-Animated</a> and anything related to anime. He created a hoax article called Monk (Cartoon Network). All of this would eventually get him blocked indefinitely for vandalism on December 21, 2006. See this <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Danny_Daniel_17aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Danny Daniel">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Danny Daniel</a> for more information about this vandal.</p>
<p>I already notified <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal">User talk:Persian Poet Gal</a> about this, but she says that she can't log on right now, so I decided to report this here. Anyways, I found two possible sockpuppets of Danny Daniel. They are <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoolabuuulba_96f1.html" title="User:Choolabuuulba">Choolabuuulba</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChoolabuuulba_94a1.html" title="User talk:Choolabuuulba">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Choolabuuulba_7cd8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Choolabuuulba">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooooomerang_0580.html" title="User:Booooomerang">Booooomerang</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBooooomerang_bd6b.html" title="User talk:Booooomerang">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Booooomerang_3dc2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Booooomerang">contribs</a>). Both of these accounts have similar editing patterns to that indefinitely blocked user. In fact, Choolabuulba even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astro_Jam&amp;diff=119131468&amp;oldid=118384000" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astro_Jam&amp;diff=119131468&amp;oldid=118384000" rel="nofollow">edited</a> a page created by Booooomerang adding on to the hoax with more misinformation and lies.

Both seem to be vandal-only accounts. To top it all off, Boooomerang has created a hoax page called Jeanie Meanie Minnie Mo. Note how it seems to relate to the television shows <i>The Fairly OddParents</i>, <i>Ed, Edd n Eddy</i> (see the parts about Jib), and <i>Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</i>. Danny Daniel's sockpuppets seem to "like" creating hoaxes like that.</p>

<li>Really? Name three examples of user space essays being linked in the body of Wikipedia space content. Some broadly used resources are kept in User space, and linked from other places, but I can't think of any that are essays. If any time content is "userfied" the creator can just replace all the links to the original with links to the User subpage, then much of the point of the process is lost. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 00:43, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Several of my essays are linked to from project space, and linking from AFD discussions (that are in the project namespace) to user-space essays has been a common practice for several years. See <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_User%7ERaul654_Raul%27s_laws_c6ab.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/User:Raul654/Raul's laws">Special:Whatlinkshere/User:Raul654/Raul's laws</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_User%7ESilensor_Schools_bbdc.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/User:Silensor/Schools">Special:Whatlinkshere/User:Silensor/Schools</a>, for examples. "Cross-namespace linking is bad." is superficial and wrong, which is probably why you are having a difficult time explaining it. A better statement would be a specific one: We don't link from the article namespace to other namespaces (except the category namespace), because it causes problems for mirrors, and causes articles to make no sense anywhere other than on Wikipedia itself. (See also <a href="../../../s/e/l/Template%7ESelfref_ae94.html" title="Template:Selfref">Template:Selfref</a>.) But links between the project namespace and user namespace are <i>not</i> prohibited for those reasons.
<p>Now whether a link to <i>this particular essay</i> is appropriate is a different matter. My essays and <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_Schools_46ba.html" title="User:Silensor/Schools">User:Silensor/Schools</a> are not humour, and linking to them is not a matter of "I wrote a humourous essay, too!". So the consideration is not the namespaces but is, in part, whether the link is an aid in the effort of working on the project, and how far it is across the threshold beyond which user space starts to turn into Uncyclopedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:53, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>For the past several months <a href="../../../p/e/j/User%7EPejman47_4bc1.html" title="User:Pejman47">User:Pejman47</a> has been trying to remove any mention from the article lead that <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> is infamous for his alleged antisemitism and Holocaust denial. The lead itself uses multiple impeccable sources to merely state that he has been accused of it, and also includes his own defense that he is not; it was difficult consensus hammered out amongst multiple editors. After finally giving up on deleting the material, more recently Pejman47 has decided to insert an argument that Ahmadinejad cannot be antisemitic because Persian Jews aren't officially persecuted, and because his office once donated some money to a Jewish hospital. It has been pointed out on the Talk: page that this argument is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and that he has misrepresented his sources. However, rather than dealing with the issue, he insists that he can insert whatever argument he wants to invent for the sake of "NPOV", and that he will revert 3 times a day for that purpose. His most recent Talk: comment states <b>"I have done my 3rr today, take care till tomorrow!"</b>. I am requesting a block under the following <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> clause:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The rule does not convey an entitlement to revert three times each day, nor does it endorse reverting as an editing technique; rather, the rule is an "<a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_fence.html" title="Electric fence">electric fence</a>".<sup id="_ref-electric_fence_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-electric_fence" title="">[1]</a></sup> Editors may still be <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocked</a> <i>even if they have not made more than three edits in any given 24 hour period</i>, if their behavior is clearly disruptive. This particularly applies to editors who persistently make three reverts each day, or three reverts on each of a group of pages, in an apparent effort to game the system."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am hoping that such a block will convince Pejman47 to respect policy, and use the Talk: page, rather than assume that 3RR is a game where you revert 3 times, then wait for the next day. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:14, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A list of facts is (by US law, maybe different elsewhere) ineligible for copyright, only a list based on opinion is protected. If these cars where in fact shown on the segment (verifiability may be your real problem) Then the list is fine. Otherwise, if theres no verifiable list, then its an opinion-generated list, and not allowed. The reason music charts are copyrighted is because its not a simple list of how often a record was played and bought, its a complicated procedure involving equations that arent public, estimation and research. -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 23:26, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What the image needs is the good fairuse rationale since this historic and non-reproduceable photo certainly qualifies for the specific article. It is hard to expect a newbie user to be able to come up with such rationale and Abu badali, an experienced image handler, if acting in good faith for the good of Wikipedia, should have helped a newbie user to write a good fairuse rationale rather than act in a way that would likely discourage the newcomer and turn him away from Wikipedia. IMO, Abu badali actions qualify as newbie biting and it is Abu badali who is to be taken to a woodshed about this, not a user who tries to contribute and does not know the wikilawyering rules yet. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 22:22, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Your statement that "That what the experienced user should have done" is directly commenting on Abu badali, the person making the argument that this particular image should be deleted; in other words, you have directly replied to Abu badali's deletion argument an ANI post not on the substance of Abu badali's argument, but on Abu badali him(/her)self. Thus <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a></i>. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User_talk%7EIamunknown_bbeb.html" title="User talk:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 05:27, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, the wikipedia article <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> is neither a reliable source nor a Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> <i>is</i> a policy and my entry did not violate WP:NPA in any way. I describe the matter as I saw it. My description was harsh but <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. Abu badali posted a complaint asking for a helping hand in the conflict. However, the conflict would not have escalated had Abu badali himself acted properly and courteously towards the users.</p>
<p>The experienced user greats the inexperienced one with a series of arrogant templates at her talk and posting the newcomer's contributions for deletion. This is not exactly the best way to engage the user, not familiar with a labyrinth of our image policy pages, into productive work. The contributor tries her best and she needs to be gently encouraged. The images, that she failed to properly tag, need to be examined, retagged when possible, deleted when necessary, with a friendly and helpful explanation on why we have to do the former or the latter. Instead, the user is communicated through templates that she, not used to the level of courtesy of some here, perceives as threats and intimidation. The user feels unwelcome as instead of a helping hand she gets the messages from what seems like someone who instead of developing articles like she does, goes around from user to user telling them what to do and claiming policies as an excuse to do that with impunity.</p>
<p>The inexperienced user starts looking for an explanation of such an unfriendly attitude and, since the particular topic is greatly politicized, mistakenly attributes the tagger's motives to the political agenda since she can't believe that someone would deal with her this way for any other reason (she was wrong at that and I don't think Abu badali's motives here are politically motivated.)</p>
<p>The bottom line is that should Abu badali have acted courteously and reasonably we would not have had the cause to discuss this incidents at WP:ANI. Stating this is not an ad hominem but simply an opinion on the matter. I am merely pinpointing the root cause of many similar conflicts in the past and want to prevent similar conflicts in the future. This is the reason of my post rather than, as you imply, some outstanding issues with Abu badali of which I have none. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 07:40, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I though the user would know what the templates messages mean, as he/she already has a couple of them in <a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBassPlyr23_9eef.html" title="User talk:BassPlyr23">his talk page</a>.

<dd>I think Irpen was hasty in accusing Abu B of "threats of all sorts". That said, it's clear that the newbie uploader did feel threatened by the templates and the deletion nominations, and that communicating exclusively in templates and by rolling back their edits (with the automated edit summary "using popups", yet..!) is deplorable. Especially doing it to a new user, who is clearly doing their best to contribute... and then, when the user can't understand what the template is telling her/him to do (can't say I blame them), to repost the <i>same</i> template, for the next image they upload... what were you thinking? Try to put yourself in the other person's shoes. Now, I could be wrong about your communicating exclusively in templates, you have a lot of contribs and I may have missed something. But the only non-template post to this person that I can see is on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion/2007_March_31&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119697516" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion/2007_March_31&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119697516" rel="nofollow">Images and media for deletion</a>, obviously too little and way too late.</dd>
<dd>Iamunknown, I have to say you're not helping. Please provide examples and diffs for your repeated claims that Irpen is posting ad hominem attacks "all over the place", or else stop saying it. There's no ad hominem from him here, that's ridiculous. ("Your statement that "That what the experienced user should have done" is directly commenting on Abu badali, the person making the argument"—er, no.) A common saying on this page is "Diffs or it didn't happen".

<p>I am posting here regarding a dispute with administrator <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">User:Rlevse</a>.</p>
<p>Background: <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrain40_ceda.html" title="User:Brain40">User:Brain40</a> vandalized my talk page, reverting it 6 times. He was warned and continued reverting. He finally stopped when <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html#User:Brain40_reported_by_User:Tjsynkral_.28Result:no_violation.29" title="WP:AN/3RR">this 3RR dispute</a> was opened.</p>
<p>However, despite the wording of <a href="../../../u/p/_/WP%7EUP_7462.html" title="WP:UP">WP:UP</a> saying otherwise, <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">User:Rlevse</a> has proceeded to take no action, close the 3RR complaint, taken WP guideline pages out of content (using a section that applies only to <b>other users' talk pages</b> to apply to edits performed against <b>a user's own talk page</b>), and even stated on <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBrain40_4fca.html" title="User talk:Brain40">User_talk:Brain40</a> that he is going to willfully ignore the matter.</p>
<p>I would like another administrator's opinion on this matter. This is what <a href="../../../u/p/_/WP%7EUP_7462.html" title="WP:UP">WP:UP</a> currently says about editing one's own talk page:</p>
<p>"On a user's own talk page, policy does not prohibit the removal of comments at that user's discretion, although archival is preferred to removal. Please note, though, that removing warnings from one's own talk page is often frowned upon."</p>
<p>I read that to mean that removing warnings (which is also sketchy, since "warnings" are not defined) is frowned upon but there is absolutely no rule against it. It's not considered vandalism, so one cannot revert removal of warnings by oneself under the vandalism umbrella for <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>.</p>
<p>I don't believe that a block of <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrain40_ceda.html" title="User:Brain40">User:Brain40</a> will be necessary unless he continues to vandalize my user page, but this matter ought to be straightened out and the administrator should be informed of correct WP policy. If the policy in practice disallows removal of warnings from one's own user talk page, the guideline page needs to be changed to make that clear.</p>
<p>I became aware of the policy as written when a warning I left on another user's user talk page was deleted by that user. I checked the rules to see if he could do that - and it's allowed. If the rule allows a user to revert, <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_infinitum.html" title="Ad infinitum">ad infinitum</a>, another user's talk page to re-insert a warning, then an administrator ruling to this effect entitles me to do as much to this other user's talk page. I highly doubt that is the case. --Tjsynkral 23:51, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I thought that the new consensus was that it was okay for editors to remove warnings from their user talk pages and that said removal was considered ackowledgement by the editor that they had received a warning. If so, it could be that not everyone has gotten the "word" on this. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 23:59, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>I resent these remarks made by tjsynkral, as soon as I made a comment on his talk page he blanked it before he probably even read it...though it is true I was in violation of the 3RR rule it was only to revert vandalism and repost my warning (ironically about 3rr) on this man's user page. Once the edit war got out of control me and another editor reported tj to an administrator.

<dd>The policy certainly needs clarified and announced, it's too open to interpretation. Let's say User:ABC123 gets a valid vandalism notice, removes it from their talk page, gets reported to AIV and the admin checks to see if they have been warned and then has to dig through history pages to find it? Hardly conducive to admins fighting vandals.

<dd>That's sad... as an admin it is your responsibility to check the history for removed warnings, and you've revealed that apparently you are loath to check up on these things. Even if it were against policy to remove warnings, it would still happen and you would be expected to look for that. Also, we are still left with a problem in defining a warning. If I went on your user page and warned you for vandalism, without any basis - would you be forced to keep it forever? --Tjsynkral 03:11, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Rlevse is trying to apply the guideline's consistently and it isn't his fault if they're vague.

<dd>It's ok to remove warnings, although it's better to leave them then to edit war about their inclusion. You should never revert a page more than 3 times in 24 hours. You should never characterise an edit as vandalism that is intended in good faith. It was a mistake for other editors to assert that the 3rr did not apply, but it was <i>equally</i> wrong for you to revert the page more than 3 times. If anyone should incur the penalty here, it would be you, since you reverted the page more than any other individual. So be glad for the inaction on AN3. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 06:11, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>Earlier today, I received a private complaint about libelous information being added to this page by <a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EImstillhere_db58.html" title="User:Imstillhere">User:Imstillhere</a>. I reviewed the matter, and found the edits in question to be inflamatory, potentially damaging, and cited to a non-specific source: a clear violation of BLP. A few minutes ago, I took the emergency step of deleting the page, restoring it without its edit history, and imposing page protection.</p>
<p>I am not an entirely uninvolved party in this matter. I have been active on the Warman page for some time, and have reverted edits by Imstillhere on more than one occasion. Under normal circumstances, I would not have carried out these administrative actions myself; given the existence of BLP concerns, however, I decided that I would be justified in taking extraordinary steps.</p>
<p>Could I please request that:</p>
<ul>
<li>an uninvolved administrator review my actions, and determine if they were appropriate?</li>
<li>an uninvolved administrator review Imstillhere's recent posts in the deleted page history, and determine if (i) they constitute BLP violations, and (ii) deserve some form of censure?</li>
</ul>

<dd>Well, there's a ref, but as far as I can tell it's a bullshit source. Has anyone attempted to find the supposed transcripts anywhere? Maybe even online? If the source can't be located by anyone, than I think you did the right thing CJC.

I mean, can't you go to some Justice site and download them? I agree that the comments can be considered libelous.

<p>WP:HAR, WP:STALK issues. This is not a content dispute. <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemarlin_8532.html" title="User:Orangemarlin">User:Orangemarlin</a> continues to label me as a "creationist" on talk pages related to <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> and the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">Creation-evolution controversy</a> in an effort to discredit me among other editors who frequent those pages, many of whom naturally have strong feelings against creationists. I've explained (very reluctantly) that the label is inaccurate and that I find his comments and attacks (e.g., "whiny little creationist") offensive. I've attempted for some time now to resolve this issue amicably, or at least courteously. My attempts to simply remove his personal attacks and labeling from article talk pages, even being careful to leave appropriate content, have been reverted by him. I object very strongly to allowing him to leave those attacks and labels on the talk pages for any period of time, therefore I request a block. I'll provide background and evidence upon request, but I would be very grateful for speedy action.

He seems to have created some sort of fantasy persona for himself under the article Bo Taylor, wherein he claims to be a famous Academy Award-winning actor. I put a subst-prod on it, and he removed it twice (although hiding behind an anonymous IP address.) He also created articles about the two characters he allegedly plays on As the World Turns, and vandalized another page (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Divins_482b.html" title="Charles Divins">Charles Divins</a>) by editing it to state that this person (who actually does appear on As the World Turns) is his son. He also vandalized several other pages (see my user contributions from 3/31 and 4/1 where I attempted to clean up some of them.) Additionally, he recreated an article called WHAA-TV after it was speedily deleted. This article was a copy of all of the text in the <a href="../../../w/a/b/WABC-TV_f943.html" title="WABC-TV">WABC-TV</a> article where he just changed the call letters to some fictitious station. He's done extensive editing on various television news personalities; these may be legitimate, but I don't have the time to check them out. I put two vandalism warnings on his user page, but he blanked the entire page. And someone else also put a warning about removing speedy deletion tags on one of the anonymous IP address user pages that he's clearly using. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProofreader_J-Man_4a2e.html" title="User:Proofreader J-Man">Proofreader J-Man</a> 00:59, 2 April 2007 (UTC) (note: moved from AIV ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 01:22, 2 April 2007 (UTC))</li>

<dd>When did I call Peters Stalinist? C33, who has found Peters' sockpuppets before, caught this one and requested a block. I reviewed his contribs and it was <a href="../../../s/e/n/WP%7ESENSE_4fdd.html" title="WP:SENSE">clear to me</a> that this was Peters. I blocked a sock of his before and this time was no different, save the fact that all of a sudden my abilities at recognizing a duck as what it is are being questioned. If you honestly do not believe that is Jacob Peters, and that C33, Irishguy, Moreschi, and I are wrong, I can request <i>more</i> users who are familiar with him to come verify it.

<p>It has to be said that, after applying for a change of name and having "TortureIsWrong" accepted, and then joining in discussions at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a> for some time, his name was suddenly (and without going through proper procedure) proposed for blocking by another regular at RFCN, immediately supporeted by a third. It seemed to me and to others there that this was not entirely a good-faith proposal. It included the claim (though rapidly struck out) that "TortureIsWrong" might be offensive to bondage-lovers, and other absurdities. TortureIsWrong's misbehaviour is not excused by this, but his frustration is understandable. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 09:40, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Torture is most definitely trolling on the RFCN. He votes 'allow' on almost, if not all, cases, even if they are clearly against policy. The most recent was <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_J_FOX_fbe6.html" title="User:Mike J FOX">Mike J FOX</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_J_FOX_6cc7.html" title="User talk:Mike J FOX">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mike_J_FOX_6fc9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mike J FOX">contribs</a>). Rather than arguing from policy he challenges its legitimacy. In addition to this he has been generally uncivil and caused disruption in the discussions. I don't know what is motivating him; perhaps he has been bitter about the board since they forced him to change his more blatant violating name. But regardless something needs to be done to prevent his continual disruption there.

<p>I suggest that admins look at the discussion for themselves. TortureIsWrong is flailing about, and apparently doing his best to disguise the fact that there's an unpleasant witchhunt against him, mounted by a group of editors whose approach to Usernames is via a narrow and doctrinaire reading of policy, and who reject any disagreement with their interpretation as being based in a misunderstanding or rejection of policy. Early mediæval Christianity offers some insrtuctive comparisons here, as does 20th-century communism. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 20:24, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They're not NPOV, but they (mostly) seem to be good faith. Obviously, this is an author who regards this scientist as a villain and charalatain, but he added significant <i>laudatory</i> information as well as significant damning information. There was an escalation, of course, with charges that the guy lives on the Internet and posts nonsense, but I suspect that was a complaint about the article. Nevertheless, the matter should be discussed on the talk page. The factual bits, if they can be referenced, would be useful for the article. If <i>Nature</i> did dismiss him, that should be verifiable. If the board did oust him, that would be verifiable. The BLP issues come from the lack of references. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:17, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it's nothing to do with me! I would say as a caution however that frustration often brews when good-faith editors see such abysmal behaviour passing by with little of no action- and problems may subsequently arise that could easily have been prevented. I don't see an editor abusing another editor like this ("Fuck You" and so on) as acceptable. It's a curious system- sometimes blocked are handed out for nothing, or next to nothing, whilst in a case like this- that seems to be fairly clear-cut- nothing is done. Anyway, I shall shut about it since it's beyond me to interfere, even if I wanted to. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 10:57, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PatPeter_50ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/PatPeter">Special:Contributions/PatPeter</a> for numerous examples of such edits.</p>
<p>I first noticed this behavior when I reverted an edit made by PatPeter (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_fr-0&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:User_fr-0&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[133]</a>), and then his/her response was this very incivil post on the talk page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk%3AUser_fr-0&amp;diff=119569559&amp;oldid=26000793" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk%3AUser_fr-0&amp;diff=119569559&amp;oldid=26000793" rel="nofollow">[134]</a>). All of this certainly appears to be inappropriate and disruptive behavior, and I don't know what to do about it, other than posting here hoping that an admin can help.

<p>I noticed Dariusholiday's userpage a month or so ago. This user has made a total of 4 edits. 1 to upload a picture of himself, and 3 to update his "bio and resume". I left a message on his talk page a week ago asking that he either remove his resume or start contributing in other ways here.

<p><small><i>Moved back from archive</i></small></p>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>User:195.169.212.143 is continuously adding the full and not confirmed name of a recently arrested murdersuspect to the article <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_S%C3%A9v%C3%A8ke_a9ea.html" title="Louis Sévèke">Louis Sévèke</a>. The case is that the name he adds has been mentioned by anonymous users in a forum (www.geenstijl.nl) and therefore he (or she) concideres this as a valid source. The fact of the matter is that the name of the suspect only is referred to by the initial of his last name in the Dutch newsmedia. I've asked the anonymous to give a reliable source (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Louis_S%C3%A9v%C3%A8ke&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Louis_S%C3%A9v%C3%A8ke&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edithistory of the article</a>, the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Talk%7ELouis_S%C3%A9v%C3%A8ke_cff3.html" title="Talk:Louis Sévèke">talkpage of the article</a> and the <a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.169.212.143.html" title="User talk:195.169.212.143">talkpage of the user</a>), but he or she refuses to do so and keeps on adding the name. Can an administrator have a look at this and take appropriate actions?</p>
<p>Another fact is that I am administrator on the Dutch Wikipedia, and I also have a problem overthere with someone who keeps on adding the full name of the murdersuspect, claiming that it is on the English language wikipedia. I have no proof, but I suspect the anonymous overhere is the same user as the one that keeps adding the name on the Dutch article <a href="../../../../nl/l/o/u/Louis_S%C3%A9v%C3%A8ke_a9ea.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Louis_Sévèke">nl:Louis Sévèke</a>.</p>

<dd>The short name should be OK. Dutch law mandates that the Dutch press may never publish a suspects' full last name; only the first letter may be used. While en.wiki is not strictly bound by that law, it is arguable that it violates <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Some weblogs (such as geenslijl.nl) feel they should expose the suspect, but I can say that geenstijl.nl cannot be used as a reliable newssource; their goal is to publish controversial 'news' and hold no journalistic ethics. Having said that, I feel that any mention of the suspects' full name, including edit summaries, should be deleted. --<a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdokter_4a5a.html" title="User:Edokter">Edokter</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/d/o/User_talk%7EEdokter_9869.html" title="User talk:Edokter">Talk</a>)</small> 17:25, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. Just a probably superfluous note note that, as with all negative information about a living person WP:BLP kicks in when we don't have a reliable source and forbids any mention of it anywhere in the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvb_5b28.html" title="User talk:Avb"><small>talk</small></a> 17:38, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is usually caused by editors placing the top part of the template <i>above</i> the header, which is incorrect. This happens a lot because the templates lack any documentation.

<p>Reverting vandalism I came across User:SPONGE's page. When I reverted I was surprised to see a vile and racist Klan page - can someone please blank it / delete it and block this user (who only ever did this page from contributions)? I will go blank the page next, as I don't want this up, but was not sure if that would be better for an Admin to do.

<dd>Quite correct, Veronica Mars fanatic didn't vote on any of the AfDs in question but is part of the series of socks, as the timeline shows. VMF does use the same non-standard link format though as demonstrated by the example (more can be found if needed), so given the timeline and that is there enough evidence to support a block?

<dd>Perhaps, the main article <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trelleborg.html" title="Trelleborg">Trelleborg</a> should be on the town (the municipality), as it originally was, since it is the most notable use of the name.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_trollfighter_d420.html" title="User:The trollfighter">The trollfighter</a> 16:59, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That is for you'all that are familiar with the subject to decide. I fixed the weird redirect in the disamb page. You can put it all back from <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trelleborg_Municipality_3908.html" title="Trelleborg Municipality">Trelleborg Municipality</a> to just <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trelleborg.html" title="Trelleborg">Trelleborg</a>.

<dd>Well, I have been observing Arigato1's edits for a while, and there seems to be some antagonism towards things Swedish in his edit history. I guess his main reason was that the main article was about a Swedish town, but that is only my theory.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_trollfighter_d420.html" title="User:The trollfighter">The trollfighter</a> 17:25, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We already have opinions from a number of different editors, and what seems to be consensus. The problem is that a couple editors refuse to accept that there is consensus and keep reverting to their preferred version in spite of all the editors who disagree with them (and I suspect they'll keep reverting regardless of how many additional editors came in from 3O or RFC and disagreed with them). Is there any solution to this? Without some sort of admin intervention, I fear the page will just turn into a revert war. I'd still like to get admin input on the situation, could someone please take a look? If an editor is editing in opposition to consensus, isn't that a policy issue? --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinderbinder_2383.html" title="User:Minderbinder">Minderbinder</a> 22:53, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

1) It is the responsibility of the administrators and other responsible parties to close extended policy discussions they are involved in, such as this dispute. Closing consists of announcing the decision at the locations of the discussion and briefly explaining the basis for closing it in the way it is being closed; further, to change any policy pages, guidelines or naming conventions to conform with the decision; and finally, to enforce the decision with respect to recalcitrant users who violate the decision, after reminding them and warning them.

<p>User:Calutuigor has vandalized the article <a href="../../../d/a/t/Database.html" title="Database">Database</a> by moving it - and its talk page - to Belucci, and turning <a href="../../../d/a/t/Database.html" title="Database">Database</a> into a redirect.

<dd>This was talked about much earlier, his English skills are not very good and I don't think that he is harmful. In fact, "Revolution;coordinator is died, long live new coordinator." was kinda funny - even though it is a bit POINT. As for canvassing thing, it still shows that he is naive, because had he really wanted to he could have e-mailed many more people and is useless in any case since that AfD was already listed under Turkey-deletion sorting.. He generally does good work around Wikipedia (especially with templates and certain articles) so if you ever see him do such edits, just leave a note to his talk page.. That would be my two cents... <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 20:27, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

He created 50+ user names, and is so persistent that the page had to be fully protected on March 27 - even the semi-protection doesn't work. It is extremely disruptive since he seems to be passing all the time he is awake in front of his article waiting for an opportunity to vandalize the article. It is an FA, and is really disrupting the work of many editors. No block seems to work, and I feel that something needs to be done since the block auto-expired just this morning and he already came back.

<dd>They were page moves, and I've moved it all back whence it came. The motivation is still not apparent, but it is believable that it could be the user trying to give the account a new name. I've seen other editors, notably vandals, do this multiple-move thing recently, but this does not fit the pattern. -- <a href="../../../z/z/u/User%7EZzuuzz_ab5e.html" title="User:Zzuuzz">zzuuzz</a><sup><a href="../../../z/z/u/User_talk%7EZzuuzz_d9bf.html" title="User talk:Zzuuzz">(talk)</a></sup> 21:12, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Recently we've had some problems with hoax articles on alleged future automobiles. There was one round of about 5-6 articles that went to AfD. Last week, we had <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Opel_Rekord_%282008_version%29_0e6e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Opel Rekord (2008 version)">another AfD</a> about the same subject.

Another article, Saturn Avaze, was created recently by User:Dathe remoncado, possibly in response to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Automobiles&amp;diff=117966884&amp;oldid=117910254" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Automobiles&amp;diff=117966884&amp;oldid=117910254" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<p>Howdy! Operating as an editor, I'm having a bit of a problem that I'd like to ask for external input on. I'm posting here because I'd like to make sure that I've got good admin scrutiny of my actions, things are a bit catywonkous. Traditionally, this would just be a run of the mill content dispute, but I'm an admin, the standard dispute resolution techniques seem to be failing, and I'm wondering if anyone has some suggestions on how to fix this.</p>
<p>The article <a href="../../../a/c/e/Aces_High_%28computer_game%29_3301.html" title="Aces High (computer game)">Aces High (computer game)</a> has been recently edited by a gent named <a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScribner_94ed.html" title="User:Scribner">Scribner</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/r/User_talk%7EScribner_9808.html" title="User talk:Scribner">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scribner_6a23.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scribner">contribs</a>) who has added some distinctly POV stuff (in my opinion), specifically <a href="../../../a/c/e/Aces_High_%28computer_game%29_3301.html#Derogatory_Online_Experiences" title="Aces High (computer game)">Aces_High_(computer_game)#Derogatory_Online_Experiences</a>. Originally, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aces_High_%28computer_game%29&amp;diff=119490829&amp;oldid=119432416" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aces_High_%28computer_game%29&amp;diff=119490829&amp;oldid=119432416" rel="nofollow">zapped it</a> because I felt it didn't belong (inherently unfixable NPOV issues), then when he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aces_High_%28computer_game%29&amp;diff=119662638&amp;oldid=119490829" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aces_High_%28computer_game%29&amp;diff=119662638&amp;oldid=119490829" rel="nofollow">restored it</a>, I tried to engage him in conversation to see if we could find some sort of middle ground, because there were no references, and it doesn't seem terribly accurate. Over the course of the past day, he's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aces_High_%28computer_game%29&amp;diff=119745401&amp;oldid=119743863" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aces_High_%28computer_game%29&amp;diff=119745401&amp;oldid=119743863" rel="nofollow">reverted</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aces_High_%28computer_game%29&amp;diff=119743564&amp;oldid=119741721" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aces_High_%28computer_game%29&amp;diff=119743564&amp;oldid=119741721" rel="nofollow">my</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aces_High_%28computer_game%29&amp;diff=119741429&amp;oldid=119738166" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aces_High_%28computer_game%29&amp;diff=119741429&amp;oldid=119738166" rel="nofollow">unreferenced</a> tags for the section, and has tagged the entire article as unreferenced, even after it was <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFOOT_ead9.html" title="WP:FOOT">footed</a> appropriately. I don't want to edit war, of course, and I've asked him to come to the table, but he's instead left 3RR notices on my page, deleted the conversation threads on his talk page, and more. I'm feeling a bit frustrated here, and if I were an admin coming into this conversation from the outside, I'd be warning the user to knock off the disruption, but as I'm an involved party, I've brought it here instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Article: <a href="../../../a/c/e/Aces_High_%28computer_game%29_3301.html" title="Aces High (computer game)">Aces High (computer game)</a></li>
<li>Talk section where I asked for references: <a href="../../../a/c/e/Talk%7EAces_High_%28computer_game%29_9a09.html#Derogatory_Online_Experience_Section" title="Talk:Aces High (computer game)">Talk:Aces_High_(computer_game)#Derogatory Online Experience Section</a></li>
<li>Note on my page where he accused me of leaving "inappropriate messages" on his talk page: <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html#Aces_High" title="User talk:Chairboy">User_talk:Chairboy#Aces_High</a></li>
<li>Note on my talk page where he accused me of 3rr after I counseled him on the risks of rv-warring:<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html#Warning_3rr_Violation" title="User talk:Chairboy">User_talk:Chairboy#Warning_3rr_Violation</a></li>
<li>Section of his user talk that he's repeatedly deleted where I've tried to engage him in discussion: <s><a href="../../../s/c/r/User_talk%7EScribner_9808.html#Aces_High" title="User talk:Scribner">User_talk:Scribner#Aces_High</a></s> (EDIT: Whoops, he's deleted it again. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Scribner&amp;curid=4532724&amp;diff=119810858&amp;oldid=119794671" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Scribner&amp;curid=4532724&amp;diff=119810858&amp;oldid=119794671" rel="nofollow">Here's the diff</a>. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 21:13, 2 April 2007 (UTC))</li>

</ul>
<p>I don't think he's a vandal, I suspect instead (just my opinion, mind you) that he may have a grudge against the game or the company. He seems to be using the unreferenced tag as a bludgeon and using the article as an attack page against the online game referenced. I'd like an external set of eyes to help out. If I'm crazy and he's the soul of civility, then I'll take my lumps and learn. If he's being disruptive and incivil, he might benefit from an uninvolved person discussing the issue with him. It's obvious that he's passionate about the subject, I'd hope that he'd turn that energy into either beefing up the disputed section with good references or improving this/other article(s) instead of just leaving threatening messages. Finally, if there are any ways I can improve in how I balance the admin/editor role in situations like this, I'd appreciate the feedback.

<dd>The main article is referenced quite well, and therefore I have removed the tag from the top of the article. The subsection has no references at all so I added some tags there. If references aren't provided within a couple of days, that section should be removed entirely. Unreferenced POV doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. Verifiability is required. I put this on the talk page as well so hopefully Scribner will discuss his changes. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 21:01, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>Apparently they've done this before in December and less ambitiously in March, hitting several articles with an external link to what resembles a myspace/blog-type site, not an information source. They've been warned before.</p>
<p>What drew my attention was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roman_Catholic_Church&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119804216" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roman_Catholic_Church&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119804216" rel="nofollow">placement</a> at <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, which is overreaching at best. Does it seem reasonable to revert the rest of the placements?

<p>I recently had a bad-tempered run-in with <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERama%27s_Arrow_c0a8.html" title="User talk:Rama's Arrow">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rama%27s_Arrow_8cc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rama's Arrow">contribs</a>). Shortly afterwards I received <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMel_Etitis&amp;diff=119660579&amp;oldid=119575112" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMel_Etitis&amp;diff=119660579&amp;oldid=119575112" rel="nofollow">this message</a> from <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESystemic_rant_8d41.html" title="User:Systemic rant">Systemic_rant</a> (<a href="../../../s/y/s/User_talk%7ESystemic_rant_46ef.html" title="User talk:Systemic rant">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Systemic_rant_5c52.html" title="Special:Contributions/Systemic rant">contribs</a>), and a while later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMel_Etitis&amp;diff=119793042&amp;oldid=119790040" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMel_Etitis&amp;diff=119793042&amp;oldid=119790040" rel="nofollow">this message</a> about a problematic AfD. I responded both times, but when I found that Systemic rant hadn't contributed to the AfD I was puzzled and checked his contributions; the account seemed to have been created largely in order to contact me about and to support Rama's Arrow. I left <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASystemic_rant&amp;diff=119816054&amp;oldid=119796056" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASystemic_rant&amp;diff=119816054&amp;oldid=119796056" rel="nofollow">this message</a> at Systemic_rant's Talk page asking him what was going on, and in under fifteen minutes received <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMel_Etitis&amp;diff=119818842&amp;oldid=119804426" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMel_Etitis&amp;diff=119818842&amp;oldid=119804426" rel="nofollow">this furious message</a> from Rama's Arrow.</p>
<p>Now, Rama's Arrow has had no (public) dealings with Systemic_rant, and I can think of no reason for the latter to be on the former's Watch list — so how did he come to see my message, and so quickly? I'm now more than ever suspicious that sock-puppetry's involved. So far as I can tell, no abuse has been perpetrated using the account; indeed, Systemic_rant aroused my initial suspicion partly because he avoided contributing to the AfD to which he'd alerted me. Still, if it <i>is</i> sockpuppetry it's at least bad form to use the sock-puppet to try to influence me in what can only be described as an underhand way.</p>

<dd>Mel Etitis, it was obvious how Rama's Arrow was drawn to Systemic's talk page. His attention was drawn to it by another user under the heading "Interesting" on Rama's talk page. Presumably that contributor and/or Rama had been watching your talk page. He obviously read your recent contribution just before he replied to you direct.

<dd>Let me be perfectly honest - I am a volunteer, all respectable editors are volunteers. We do all this because something in our retarded brains makes us think this mad dream of Jimbo Wales will do something important. But I didn't go through 11 FACs and 2 RfAs to be accused of disrupting the very project I've worked hard for. When trolls accuse me of racism, bigotry, abuse, etc., I can take it because they are trolls. But when a guy like Mel, whom up till now I didn't think was a troll, takes it upon himself to personal attack me with incredulous accusation like this, it makes very, very mad.

<p>[After edit conflict]<br />
Before Rama's Arrow (and one or two others) explode with indignation, note a few points:</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn't accuse Rama's Arrow of being a sock-puppet, or of anything else — I accused Systematic Rant of being one. The only (intemperate, not to say uncivil) accusations have come from Rama's Arrow.</li>
<li>I didn't claim that he was Rama's Arrow's sock-puppet; I <i>asked</i>: "are you Rama's Arrow, or just a friend of his using this sock-puppet account to help him out?" A reasonable question, given Systematic Rant's limited set of actions.</li>
<li>I'm not sure what "administer people" means, but I can't see that what I did was any different from what most of us who have been here for a while have done many times: when we suspect that someone is a sock-puppet (and it's pretty obvious that Systemic Rant is one — moreover I see that his User page has just been tagged as such) we ask them politely if that's what's going on. I'm not clear what alternative is being suggested for me here: ignore the sock-puppetry, or simply block the sock-puppet without any preliminary discussion, or what? What "investigation" is suggested, apart from approaching the suspected sock-puppet and mentioning it here?</li>
<li>As for other people "picking up the pieces" — I haven't seen anyone doing that. I've seen a bit of finger-wagging based on false premises (perhaps by people who haven't actually loked at the details of the suituation properly), but I'm not sure that that counts. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 23:02, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am NOT "overreacting" and I don't care about what this Systemic rant fellow says or does. I just want to make sure that Mel Etitis and others like him think 2,000 times before frivolously attacking someone's integrity like this. And forgive me for being a little emotional, for I am not comforted by the prospect of being wantonly insulted on a project I've worked so bloody hard to help build. There wasn't any reason on the face of the earth for Mel to think that this Systemic rant chap was me, except that we had a terse exchange yesterday. This is an incredulous waste of time and energy caused by Mel Etitis's most insane accusation. As I've said, one expects such behavior from trolls alone. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="green"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 23:16, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rama is NOT overreacting in any way. Asking a user "are you Rama's Arrow or just a friend of his using this sockpuppet account?" is extremely provocative. I can only read it as a barely disguised accusation of sockpuppetry — or a rhetorical question that seems meant to cause people to start doubting Rama's Arrow. Either way, it's a terrible slight against one of the best editors and admins we have, by another respected <i>admin</i> for God's sake, which gives the question/accusation a veneer of authority. If any number of other editors made such a comment, it could be ignored, but a fellow admin making a comment like that fully justifies Rama's response. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPriyanath_0bf1.html" title="User:Priyanath">ॐ Priyanath</a> <small><i><a href="../../../p/r/i/User_talk%7EPriyanath_7e03.html" title="User talk:Priyanath">talk</a></i></small> 23:45, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There’s an ‘every article must have at least one image’ (yes, unqualified just like that) faction out there, so somebody would probably argue that this is a good idea. However, with party logos being usually copyrighted (and non-free), there is absolutely no way that they could be used in articles on individual politicians (we don’t have an Apple logo in <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>, either). The reason is that per policy, we are to display fair use material only where it is not just not replaceable, but also necessary and used in a critical context and for identification. Party logos in biographical articles obviously fail this benchmark. Even where a logo is usable in terms of copyright, putting it into the infobox instead of a photograph would probably give the implied affiliation undue weight (assuming that the person is notable). —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 23:32, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Which is not a place I would have chosen, but Jimbo did give me advice on how to handle a similar issue.

<dd>Then I don't see the need for it now, as they have stopped using the Lengis account and are using Malamockq as their primary. If he/she begins using both accounts disruptively, then one of the socks should be blocked, and the user warned/temp blocked again. That's about it. One indiscretion (assuming it hasn't happened in the 8 months since) should not amount to a permanent scarlet letter, in my view. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#555;font-weight:bold;">bbatsell</span></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#C46100;font-size:0.75em;">¿?</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><span style="color:#2C9191;">✍</span></a> 02:04, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This user has been disrupting numerous articles for quite a long time now. I believe that <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiorgioOrsini_2f95.html" title="User:GiorgioOrsini">GiorgioOrsini</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni_Giove_12a0.html" title="User:Giovanni Giove">Giovanni Giove</a> and recently NovaNova are all the same person. They use the same style of writing (grammar mistakes, spacing, etc.) and they all have the same subject of interest which are Dalmatia-related articles and removing or vandalising every mention of Croatia in them. I have looked around their history pages and I have found striking similarities in their reverts. I found out that these two members have been involved in numerous edit-wars where they have "collaborated" to such a degree that it took my attention right away. Looking closer I found out that they in fact made exactly the same methods and when there wasn't one there was the other doing the same revert and replying in the same manner. Some of the articles included are: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Croatians_ba68.html" title="List of Croatians">List of Croatians</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_Luppis_b85d.html" title="Giovanni Luppis">Giovanni Luppis</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesco_Patrizi_7ce0.html" title="Francesco Patrizi">Francesco Patrizi</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedetto_Cotrugli_7c39.html" title="Benedetto Cotrugli">Benedetto Cotrugli</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Meldolla_8e4c.html" title="Andrea Meldolla">Andrea Meldolla</a> and so on. If these are all accounts of the same person (which I am convinced they are) he is also guilty for vote stacking on as can be seen on <a href="../../../f/r/a/Talk%7EFrancesco_Patrizi_ba52.html" title="Talk:Francesco Patrizi">Talk:Francesco_Patrizi</a>, this page can also be observed for striking similarity in argumentation of these supposedly two people (it is in fact identical). Recently it seems he introduced another sockpuppet at <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giulio_Clovio_a798.html" title="Giulio Clovio">Giulio Clovio</a> named NovaNova, this article is also where GiorgioOrsini is involved in a edit-war for very long time and now he obviously introduced another sock to help himself. In short due to long-term disruption, vandalism, incivility and extremly striking similarity in edit style, argumentation and exactly the same interests I am forced to request an indefinite block or ban of this user and all of his accounts.</p>
<p>It is certain to assume that <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni_Giove_12a0.html" title="User:Giovanni Giove">Giovanni Giove</a> is the master account, as it is the oldest account out of the three. This person then created his other two accounts in a short amount of time - during November 2006. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiorgioOrsini_2f95.html" title="User:GiorgioOrsini">GiorgioOrsini</a> and NovaNova are his two accounts which are used for rampant edit warring, and personal attacks, and they are also used to create the illusion that their is more than one person who holds these opinions. To get a taste of this report, please see that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GiorgioOrsini&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88822454" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GiorgioOrsini&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88822454" rel="nofollow">after a user gave him a legitimate warning</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PaxEquilibrium&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88822152" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PaxEquilibrium&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88822152" rel="nofollow">Orsini removed it and was uncivil.</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nishkid64&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=92110211" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nishkid64&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=92110211" rel="nofollow">Also take a look at this threat/attack.</a></p>
<p>Looking at each user's contributions, it is highly likely that GiorgioOrisni was created by Giovanni Giove to create the illusion of support for his views on the article "<a href="../../../j/u/r/Juraj_Dalmatinac_aaed.html" title="Juraj Dalmatinac">Juraj Dalmatinac</a>". Another point to notice is that GiorgioOrisni's <b>first ever edit</b> was to the talk page of <a href="../../../j/u/r/Juraj_Dalmatinac_aaed.html" title="Juraj Dalmatinac">Juraj Dalmatinac</a>, where he immediately started <b>repeating the same words spoken by Giovanni Giove</b>, and immediately engaged in edit warring over that article - quite an unusual thing for a genuine new user to do.

Both account seem to have the single purpose of removing all references to Croatia or Croats on articles of famous historical figures, and claiming them as exclusively "Italian", while calling all other views "pseudo-historical". Both account use the same style of language in talk pages and edit summaries. The account GiorgioOrsini is also guilty of vandalism, by removing people from article lists and then adding words such as "falsifier" to describe someone<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Croatians&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97854344" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Croatians&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97854344" rel="nofollow">[166]</a>.
