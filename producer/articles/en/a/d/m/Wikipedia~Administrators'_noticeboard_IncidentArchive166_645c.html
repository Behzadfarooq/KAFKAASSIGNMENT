<dd>Maybe I don't want to get involved, but does Hipocrite ever do anything but hunt other users down and attack them? He's got like 2 article edits in as many weeks. Seems like all his comments are directed at pissing people off as much as possible. All I did was "vote" the opposite way on a CfD and he stalked me to some user subpage and out of NOWHERE accuses me of being a sockpuppet. This manner of dealing with disagreement really shouldn't be allowed to bloom IMO. It seems like Hipocrite just antagonizes others for fun and tries to belittle them as much as possible. "This user is banned from my talk page" - what part can that have in collaborative encyclopedia writing? And edit warring over a petition not involving him on another editor's talk page? What is Hipocrite's purpose exactly? And before I get a "NO U" response from anyone, I'm open to answering the same question. But please ask on my talk page if you're interested so as not to derail this thread.<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Milto LOL pia</a> 05:44, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I strenuously object to how this was done. <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Romanian_discrimination_b530.html" title="Anti-Romanian discrimination">Anti-Romanian discrimination</a>, which had hundreds of edits by over a dozen contributors, including quite a few administrators (none of them me) does not look to me like the sort of article that should have been summarily deleted. It contained significant material (including quite a few citations) that, even if this article is deemed inappropriate, belongs somewhere else in Wikipedia; such salvaging of parts of articles often happens in the course of an AFD, but there is virtually no chance for it when an administrator acts unilaterally. I'll also add that the article did not particularly read like a polemic, and even explicitly acknowledged regions outside of Romania where Romanians are treated well (e.g. "The <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanians_of_Serbia_9ffc.html" title="Romanians of Serbia">Romanians</a> living in the Autonomous Province of <a href="../../../v/o/j/Vojvodina.html" title="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a> are very well represented at the provincial level despite their small presence…"). At most, I think it should have been retitled more neutrally to encourage discussion of positive as well as negative treatment, but it seemed to me on the whole to be a decent article. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:13, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By the way, the Romanian term for anti-Romanianism is antiromanism: of course, occasionally that same term (usually in English) means opposition to Roman Catholicism, but a Google search turns up literally hundreds of on-topic hits from what are usually considered reliable sources. Some of them are debating whether there is such a thing, others are assuming that there is, but it seems to me that there is plenty here for a topic. Again, there may have been problems with this article, but I would certainly have opposed simple deletion if there had been an opportunity for discussion, and I do not like the fact that discussion is taking place only in the face of a <i>fait accompli</i>. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 21:07, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it were up to me, we'd get rid of all of the troll magnet unencyclopedic articles we have here.Just because some self-important college professor or politician invents a word doesn't mean we need an article for it.Plenty of Wikipedians have stupid uncles, but we don't need an article on stupid uncles.But seriously ... ignoring process like this is just going to cause more problems than leaving the thing in place.Unfortunately, it's a fact of life that too many people think Wikipedia is a battleground, rather than an encyclopedia.There will never be consensus to delete most of these things because too many people get too much emotion invested in them.Heck, look at <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a>.It was started as a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> article by a now banned user and will never be a good article, but people fall over themselves to defend it.Meanwhile, articles about actual encyclopedic topics are neglected. So these things need to be removed ... but the out of process deletions cause just as many problems as leaving them there.See also, userbox wars. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 00:38, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Two things should be separated in this discussion: the contents of said articles, and the wikipedia process and policies. I think most of the neutral readers would agree that the articles are, um, <i>inappropriate</i> and violate many Wikipedia policies. While the said anti-foo sentiments do exist, are there reliable sources dealing with them as such (I say: barely), and have our editors proven able to maintain them up to academic standard (I say: definitely no)? But, as you said, "there will never be consensus to delete, because too many people get too much emotion invested in them". WP policies do not refer to emotions as criteria for inclusion, AFAICT.<br />
That being said, I felt that it was a really goodopportunity to invoke <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> (which <b>is</b> a policy after all) and get rid of those POV-magnets. That action was controversial, and it turned out to produce a lot of drama. It ended up being a test of the overall applicability of IAR as a policy (although it was <b>not</b> my original intention to exercise a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>). And, 2 weeks later, it seems to have failed. And that turns us to a bigger picture: how come that Wikipedia process (cynics would say, bureaucracy) continues to yield such ugly results, and that consensus (or lack thereof) trumps quality, OR, NPOV etc.? And should we slap {{<a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistorical_f63d.html" title="Template:Historical">historical</a>}} to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, as no one seems to agree what that policy actually means and implies?

<dd>I certainly don't agree with it. If Duja's edits political articles on former Yugoslavia he better keep his admin fingers away from the delete button in that area.

<p>Should I come with an unpopular opinion here? I <b>support</b> Mikka's undeletion because the articles were deleted by means of IAR and not through any process where people are given oppurtunities to voice the good faith objections. When somebody "invokes" IAR to make an administrative action, they should be prepared to relent if anyone has a good faith objection to it. Clearly, Mikka is objecting to the deletion not because he wants to process wonk or be a rules lawyer, but because he thinks the subject matter is valid for an encyclopedia. If there truly is no merit whatsoever for those articles, then waiting a few months for a renomination will usually allow them to be deleted in process, silently and without any fuss or controversy. That is what eventually happened with <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Jews_5375.html" title="Religious persecution by Jews">Religious persecution by Jews</a> and other such articles. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:22, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The logic that 'these articles are contentious (or "troll magnets" in uncivil vernacular) and thus should be deleted' doesn't really hold up to scrutiny IMO... the most contentious article on Wikipedia (judging by edit count) is <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> - yet somehow it hasn't been deleted. There have been other deletions along similar lines and the scale seems to be 'notability' vs 'disruptiveness'. The more notable a topic is the more disruption we put up with... but this results in the deletion of some articles (as above) which are certainly well beyond the normal thresh-hold of notability. As we don't delete all articles of this sort it also creates the disparity of Wikipedia seeming to suggest that discrimination against Polish, Iranian, and Jewish people (for instance) is more important/notable than discrimination against Croats or Serbs. Should Wikipedia really be in the business of <b>not</b> covering contentious topics? Sure, it would be 'easier' (other than having to constantly stomp them out), but makes us a poorer encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:12, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We definitely should have contentious articles—that is not the point. As written somewhere on deletion-related pages, (citing from memory, link appreciated), "deletion of an article is not a definite statement of an encyclopedic value of the subject; a substantionally rewritten article which satisfies the policies is possible in the future." We don't delete the articles <i>just</i> because the topics are contentious, but, among other things, because they fail our policies, and they get deleted after n-th nomination because, after lots of drama, they get empirically proven unable to get into conformance with policies.<br />
As someone suggested back then, (and I'm starting to think it's a good idea), it might be better though to refactor the similar topics into "Serbo-Croatian relations", "Russo-Polish relations" etc, which would be even more contentious, but would have far better prospects due to a) being far more covered by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> than the current conspiracy theories b) be more narrow in scope c) achieve a certain quality management by the very fact that they'd be under scrutiny of both Fooians and Barians d) in general, Fooians are usually not hated just because they're Fooians (Jews being one notable exception), but they're hated by Barians because they have an unsettled issues from the past with each other. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 13:19, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry I had not followed this discussion from the beginning. Otherwise, I would have expressed my reservations to Duya for the application of WP:IAR in this case. I don't think these articles should be grouped and deleted in the way they were. Each article should be treated seperately. Despite their huge POV problems, at least two of them (<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html" title="Serbophobia">Serbophobia</a>) and (<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Bosniak_sentiment_89e4.html" title="Anti-Bosniak sentiment">Anti-Bosniak sentiment</a>) look to me notable and may deserve a place in Wikipedia. Thus, I think we should check them one by one according to the existing Wikipedia policies and not WP:IAR (which I regard as a "measure of last resort"). Another thing we could discuss is the merger of the 3 anti-(Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian) articles in one comprehensive one. Maybe, such a solution would also be capable of limiting the edit and POV wars. This is just a suggestion.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 13:17, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am baffled as to how to deal with this problem. User:66.66.165.85 has been adding information regaring anchors and major tenants at probably hundreds of malls. The information is useful, encyclopedic, and no doubt accurate, but has no source provided. I have searched endlessly to find a source for his work, but I have been unable to find any online source for the data added. If I could find the source I would add the reference and try to suggest how this user could did it on his own, but not knowing the derivation of the information makes this impossible. I have pleaded with this individual to provide a source, provided suggestions to add the information to the articles, my talk page or his talk page, but received no response whatsoever from the individual. I have indicated that the information could be removed as original research, but nothing has helped. I really don't want to start reverting useful work, but nothing seems to get through.

<p>The way for you to proceed as far as the actual content is concerned, as opposed to the user's total unresponsiveness, is to start tagging or simply removing the information that you have been unable to find a source for, explaining on the talk pages of each article where you've looked for sources and pointing to the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policy.If you've made a reasonable attempt to find sources for unsourced content and have come up empty-handed, then either tagging or outright removal of the content is the next step.See <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_sources_and_content_98bf.html#How_to_deal_with_unsourced_content" title="User:Uncle G/On sources and content">User:Uncle G/On sources and content#How to deal with unsourced content</a> for some advice.</p>

<dd>One could actually go to those malls which are local, and check; unless Alansohn and 66.66.165.85 are in the same geographical area, a high accuracy rate is indicative that the information is probably accurate. But doing so would constitute <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.I'd be surprised if most of those malls have websites which would give the information which 66.66 is providing; if he has lots of time on his hands, it might not be that onerous for him to look up the mall website, and add the info; possibly even assuming that if there's a link at the bottom of the mall's WP article, that that constitutes sufficient citation.

While the easy answer is to tag the additions with {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags, and delete them if no source is provided, that could be wasteful if the information does have a reliable source, but the editor in question is too lazy to provide it. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 00:05, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I certainly didn't post my original comment in order to get into a dispute about the interpretation of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, but did you also read the part which says <i>A primary source is a document or person providing direct evidence of a certain state of affairs; in other words, a source very close to the situation you are writing about. The term mainly refers to a document produced by a participant in an event or an observer of that event. Primary sources include official reports, letters, eyewitness accounts, autobiographies, statistics compiled by authoritative agencies, and court records. Experts usually have advanced training, and use as many different primary sources as are available so they can be checked against each other. Thus, primary materials typically require interpretation, interpolation, extrapolation, or corroboration, each of which usually constitutes original research. Wikipedia articles may use primary sources, so long as they have been published by a reliable source, but only to make descriptive points about the topic. Any interpretive claims require secondary sources.</i> ?<a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 18:43, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are a handful of user names that are doing this.I don't know if they are all the same person.I assume it is someone with a financial interest in some ways in shopping malls.One was blocked for spam<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Dvac" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Dvac" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, and had the same pattern of posting mall articles, non-notable malls, with lists of stores, and looks exactly like User:66.66.165.85, with repeated ignored discussions on talk pages of various malls, and the user's own talk page, and the same style of articles, the same content.This information is readily available to all sorts of small business owners in trade journals, through local library resources, and in on-line merchandiser databases that are not free to search.Not everything is on the Internet in the Public Domain.In a discussion about the issue, though, as to whether or not the malls were notable (some are strip malls of 6 stores in a city with 30 other strip malls of the same size, hardly notable), someone else mentioned the utility of being able to find out what stores are in the local mall.While this isn't precisely Wikipedia's purpose, I hesitate to speak out against something that potentially provides a lot of utility for users. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:14, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Backing up a bit as a response to Argyriou: Going to a mall, seeing Macy's as an major store, and adding that to Wikipedia is not Original Research.It's not novel or interpretive, doesn't define something for the first time; it's not <i>original</i>. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 00:32, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>If the person has edited information about Woodfield Mall, Schaumburg, IL, you can check it here;<a href="http://www.shopwoodfield.com/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.shopwoodfield.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> This might provide some indication of the value of the rest of the edits. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 06:10, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I must agree with Schmucky here. This is, for the most part, basic information pertaining to public buildings which are still standing. Whether it's accurate or not is much easier to verify than the average history-related article (which is under-referenced, yet rarely challenged by anyone). Also I suspect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:66.66.165.85&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=95821172" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:66.66.165.85&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=95821172" rel="nofollow">"vandalism"</a> to be poor word choice. Which of the (dozens of) descriptions at <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> do you feel that this matches? — <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharlotteWebb_8dbe.html" title="User talk:CharlotteWebb">CharlotteWebb</a> 12:14, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Disagree with Schmucky because there's no verifiable chain.Original research is where the person who adds the information is also the source.It's not verifiable if I have to phone Schmucky to confirm the verifiability of the information.We don't particularly care about accuracy as much as verifiability.Ascribing a paper source will also allow information to be better presented.If I visit Schmucky's mall and find no Macy's, what ensues?An edit war, with no ability to determine the truth?However, had Schmucky provided any source, such as a local newspaper report, we could date the assertion and allow contextualisation by dating the assertion.It may be that Macy's had closed between Schmucky's visit and mine, but we can't substantiate this.That's why attribution is important. It creates a trail and a context, which allows information to be presented at all times in the best manner.If Macy's website does not list Schmucky's mall amongst its locations, but Schmucky provided that local paper reference, we have a trail and a presentation of information to the reader. Paper said store exists at this date, whilst official website, accessed on this date, makes no mention of a store existing at this location.Thus the reader can determine their own truth from these assertions. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 12:35, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You don't have to call me and ask.You can go there and look.It's verifiable, period.Verifiability doesn't have to be easy.If it is no longer true then the information can be removed by the next editor when it becomes no longer true.At that point if it is still important to reference it historically we probably need something more verifiable - though for something non-contested I'd still accept the original editors assertion. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 17:03, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Steve going to look would also be OR.We need secondary sources, such as a newspaper article which says "A new Macy's opened over at Ourtown Mall.", or even "Police arrested a shoplifter at the Macy's in Ourtown Mall." <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 21:16, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>What's <i>original</i> about viewing a shopping mall?There is nothing novel or interpretive, interpolated, extrapolated; ie original, about taking the public bus to the mall and viewing a Macy's.If an editor was making a claim like "there is a lot of crime at the public mall near the Macy's" then there is an act of interpretation that needs more sourcing.A simple statement that there is a Macy's at the public mall isn't OR. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 21:39, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're hung up on one word, of the title, even.Please read the actual body of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy and think about the rationale that underpins it.Firsthand testimony of a Wikipedia editor as to the existence of a shop in a mall is <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a> material.<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_publisher_of_original_thought" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a primary source</a>.It is an encyclopaedia, a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>.It is not the intention of Wikipedia that readers be required to take Wikipedia editors, with pseudonyms such as "Uncle G" and "SchmuckyTheCat" and about whom readers know nothing, at their words.<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_sources_and_content_98bf.html" title="User:Uncle G/On sources and content">Readers must be able to check all content against sources outside of Wikipedia.And everything in Wikipedia must have been through a processs of fact checking, peer review, publication, and acceptance into the general corpus of human knowledge.</a>
<p>If you, as a Wikipedia editor adding content about a mall, cannot <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">point to a source</a> that has already done the research of what shops exist in the mall, and that has a reputation to protect and thus will have checked its facts; and cannot even show that these data are part of the corpus of human knowledge in the first place; but can <i>only</i> say "In order to check this article you must repeat my primary research of physically travelling to the mall and investigating.Failing that, you only have the word of a pseudonymous Wikipedia editor for any of this.", then you are violating our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy.We don't accept Wikipedia editors' sole words here.<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_sources_and_content_98bf.html" title="User:Uncle G/On sources and content">Some other encyclopaedias require that readers take the sole words of their authors for article content.Wikipedia does not.</a></p>
<p>66.66.165.85's edits require sources just as much as edits that give the detailed geography of Sweden require sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:22, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I've read the policy many times.If you are viewing a mall and see a store the location itself is the primary source.Reporting that as a basic matter of non-interpretive fact isn't a matter of OR nor is it creating a primary source.It's verifiable and that is our requirement.Nothing says verifiability has to be easy.Even published sources may only be available in private archives.Does viewing a mall introduce a theory? No.Introduce original ideas? No. Define a new term? No. Provide a new definition of existing terms? No. Introduce a new argument? No. I've got no opinion on this specific user that started this conversation and have never looked at the edits.If an edit is <i>contested</i>, it's an excellent idea to get better sources.But contesting basic facts without a good reason is bad faith. Now, if there isn't a good published source about something it may not be important but that is something else entirely. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 23:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then please read it yet again, because you appear to have overlooked the third and fourth words of its second sentence.Reporting previously unreported data, obtained from firsthand observation, is primary research, which <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">we don't do here</a>.This really is very simple.
<p>As for "contesting basic facts without a good reason": Basic facts are not exceptions to the rule that everything must be sourced.Indeed, not only are they what require the <i>best</i> sources, so that Wikipedia does not get them wrong, but they are usually pretty easy to source — if they <i>truly are</i> basic facts about a subject.<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:19, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
</li>
<li>To state the obvious: stores are also listed in multiple hardcopy yellow pages, one of mine lists the local mall with its stores, also, on-line in the yellow pages, and white pages, and larger malls may have web sites, and I can find the book store in my local mall by going to its on-line site and entering my zip code in the store finder, probably Macy's also.In addition there are the aforementioned trade journals for mall operators, mall directories, and other resources.Just because the reference is not on-line, doesn't mean the person who listed it used original research.I supsect the poster, as I said before, is using trade listings, as they are listing malls from all over.When I go to market, I get trade publications, lists, e-mails from buyers, publications that lists all of certain types of buyers, all sorts of information about who will be buying at market, on-line, in other ways.Of course going to the mall and looking at the store is original research, and it seems it requires more than just going to the mall, like solid usable original research does, you must verify through the management at the store and probably headquarters that the store is not in the midst of closing, has not been sold in the past week, and plans to stay open.That's part of the reason for not relying on original research, whoever did it, Wikipedia editor or otherwise, the amount of work necessary to certify it.That's where secondary sources come in--they certify the usability of the OR.But really, is the expectation that Wikipedia use only resources that one can find on-line? <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 01:12, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure anyone is pushing for online sources, but simply a source above and beyond because I saw it with my own eyes.Otherwise I'll add the info on that UFO that buzzed my house last night which Schmucky will surely accept, since all he has to do is hop round and witness it, adding that it was no longer there when he came if it wasn't. We have these standards of demanding sources because all the easy stuff is easily sourced, and all the hard stuff like Yeti's and UFO's aren't, and so we find it easier to say provide a source than okay, we'll allow your eyes to bear witness for Macy's, but hold the phone pal, you can't expect us to have the same values for Elvis in that chip shop? All information is treated the same, otherwise you are placing a bias on some pieces of information over others, and we don't do that.Period. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:17, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ok, I'm going to have to respectfully, but <i>firmly</i>, disagree with your interpretation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>.First of all, just because a particular turn of phrase is not listed under "Examples of personal attacks" does not mean it is not one (as it states at the beginning of that section).Secondly, the examples state that, "Laura is a bad editor," can be considered a personal attack.How then, exactly, is repeatedly calling editors with whom one disagrees an "idiot", a "vandal", telling them to "shut up", and repeatedly calling their good faith contributions vandalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brett_Favre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97082637" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brett_Favre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97082637" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> in line with <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>?The policy, in a nutshell, is, (and I quote), "Comment on content, not on the contributor."The editor in question has repeatedly failed at this, has been blocked for it, and continues to act in the same manner, despite a multitude of warnings.I jumped the gun on endorsing a month-long block because I was appalled at the level of incivility, but a week-long, or even a 2-week-long block is most certainly not out of line with this user's behavior.Warmest regards, —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 05:31, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, now he's engaging in sockpuppetry. He is logging out and using an anonymous IP address to blank his talk page. I strongly suspect it is him as he is using IP addresses that were used by anon user(s) on the Brett Favre page where this whole nonsense started. If this user isn't someone who deserves a 1 month block or a permanent block, then I don't know who does. However, I'm sure that he'll just stick with editing anonymously anyway if/when he is blocked. –<i><b><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Bee_6533.html" title="User:King Bee">King Bee</a></b></i>&#160;<sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKing_Bee_0f2c.html" title="User talk:King Bee">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_King_Bee_9e35.html" title="Special:Contributions/King Bee">contribs</a>)</sup> 06:21, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find it odd that a number of Greek voters popped up on the past 'Kurdish Genocide' afd voting keep. The article was not related to Greece or Greeks. The Kurdish Human rights article is being written by a Greek person (according to his userpage). The articles current situation speaks for itself.</dd>
<dd>Historically Greeks and Turks don't tend to get along well. I am concerned by the objectivity of this group of Greek editors involved with the article and/or the afd.</dd>

<li>Statistics: From the 10 "keep" votes of the 2nd AfD only 3 come from Greeks. Aren't you concerned for the objectivity of the other 7? Even if the 3 Greek votes are taken away, we still have a 7-4 for "keep"! You see: Mathematics do not help you.</li>

<dd>In the first AFD the argument of vote stacking was the participation of Greek voters. In this case, what is the argument? Hmmmm ... Let me think. We must find something common among those voting "keep". Wait! I found it! They are <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unidentified_flying_object.html" title="Unidentified flying object">alliens</a>! Yes, that's is, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martian.html" title="Martian">unidentified invadors</a> from the universe united their forces, and decided to prevent the deletion of this article. And you know what is the worst part of this <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Mutant_Zombie_Flesh_Eating_Chickens_From_Mars_b90a.html" title="Attack of the Mutant Zombie Flesh Eating Chickens From Mars">universal conspiracy</a>: some users went through a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Teratogenesis.html" title="Teratogenesis">mutation</a>. Aldux, for instance, was a "delete" voter in the first poll (and a non-conspirator<a href="../../../s/n/i/Image%7ESNive.gif_3e17.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/8/8f/SNive.gif/15px-SNive.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" longdesc="../../../s/n/i/Image%7ESNive.gif_3e17.html" /></a>) and an allien "keep" voter (and a conspirator!<a href="../../../s/s/h/Image%7ESShocked.gif_c59c.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/8/85/SShocked.gif/15px-SShocked.gif" alt="" width="15" height="16" longdesc="../../../s/s/h/Image%7ESShocked.gif_c59c.html" /></a>) in this vote.</dd>
<dd>What is most peculiar in this AfD is Cool Cat's attitude who opened a new AfD for the same article within 10 days (or they are too many!). As <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> said (you know: he is one of the alliens!): "you cannot continue nominating the same article over and over until you get a "good" decision".</dd>
<dd>Since Cool Cat opened this AnI, I kindly ask him, for one more time (he has until now refused to do it and responds with ironies <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FHuman_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey_%28Second_nomination%29&amp;diff=97123323&amp;oldid=96999994" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FHuman_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey_%28Second_nomination%29&amp;diff=97123323&amp;oldid=96999994" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>), to substatiate his accusations against me personally and all the other "keep" voters.

<p>Cool Cat, you lost my respect with "Yes 3 greek votes when there really should be none." Why should Greeks not be allowed to vote (or&#160;!vote if you prefer) on an AfD just because it isn't about Greece? As far as I can tell, you are trying to come up with justifications for going against concensus, and I'm having trouble assuming good faith... --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 16:25, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I dislike it when my statements are misrepresented. I am <b>not</b> saying Greeks are to be prohibited from voting or participating in the discussion. All I am saying is that it is highly unusual for three people of same nationality/ethnicity participating in an afd on a topic not concerning them. They do not appear to be regular participants to afds either. I would be suspicious if it was three Chinese or three Mexican users (I picked the nationalities at random), this has little to do with them being Greek.</dd>
<dd>Ideally AfD's should be reviewed by impartial people. Surely no one is suggesting that it is preferable to have potentially biased people participating on an afd as a group. People of Turkish origin should not be involved with Afds exclusively Greek related articles in groups either. You are welcome to challenge this logic.</dd>

<dd>I am not misrepresenting you, although perhaps you didn't write what you intended. You said "there really should be none", did you mean "I would expect there to be none"?

<dd>You two are having a content dispute.I'm not sure if his/her accusing you of having an "anti-German" bias is a personal attack or not, but he/she is using the edit summaries and discussion pages now to discuss the matter.If you two can't find a compromise on your own, perhaps other avenues of conflict resolution might be appropriate. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 23:37, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I've just had made an entry to my talk page that may be helpful in getting an overview. Rex caught my attention when trying to delete several well-establish German words from English Wikipedia (see e.g. <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaiser.html" title="Kaiser">Kaiser</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprachraum.html" title="Sprachraum">Sprachraum</a>), while at the same time adding rather surplus Dutch ones elsewhere (<a href="../../../m/o/s/Moselle_River_f120.html" title="Moselle River">Moselle River</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/l/Geldern.html" title="Geldern">Geldern</a>). My recent behaviour might not have been a good example of solving conflicts (especially during Christmas holidays), but it came in response to Rex' actions and attitude. --&#160;<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthead_5c8c.html" title="User:Matthead">Matthead</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthead_e270.html" title="User talk:Matthead"><sup>discuß!</sup></a>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../e/u/_/EU_f2e6.html" title="EU"><font style="color:#ffff00;background:#0000cc;">&#160;&#160;&#160;O&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></a>&#160; &#160; 23:48, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Rex has just called me "this ***" a few lines above, right here on Administrators' noticeboard. I'm surprised that this is accepted here - or is it?

<li>You are not the victim here, I am.</li>
<li>My arbcom case is not your, or any one elses (who wasnt directly involved) bussiness.

<p><b>Comment from an uninvolved party:</b> I just stumbled across this report and have had no prior interaction with either of the editors involved.Upon reading through the diffs in question, it seems clear to me that <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_Germanus_1602.html" title="User:Rex Germanus">Rex</a> is making disruptive and POV edits by removing or attempting to remove legitimate information on German topics.His edits and justifications therefor have a clear anti-German bias (e.g., attempting to remove "<a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaiser.html" title="Kaiser">Kaiser</a>", but not "<a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsar.html" title="Tsar">Tsar</a>", on the basis that it is synonymous with "<a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor.html" title="Emperor">emperor</a>".)<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthead_5c8c.html" title="User:Matthead">Matthead</a>, on the other hand, has remained civil and has even provided reasoned explanations on talk pages on why <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_Germanus_1602.html" title="User:Rex Germanus">Rex</a>'s edits were inappropriate.Contrary to what <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_Germanus_1602.html" title="User:Rex Germanus">Rex</a> claims, I see no evidence of any libel against him.I believe that <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_Germanus_1602.html" title="User:Rex Germanus">Rex</a>'s actions, and this report, is a violation of the terms of his probation regarding disruptive edits and incivility. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 12:54, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Matthead, if you think Rex Germanus is breaching his parole, the place to note that is here, not in edit summaries.Writing provocative edit summaries helps no-one and merely inflames the situation, causing it to become harder to decide who is at fault.</li>
<li>Rex Germanus, you are on probation.You shouldn't need one, but take this as a warning that that parole will be enforced.I will block you from any page on which you make an incivil comment or leave an incivil edit summary, per that probation.Incivil edit summaries are disruptivewhether you make them or somebody else does. And don't throw the term libel around so liberally, ultimately it is a legal threat and people who make such are blocked from Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>

<p>Zoe blocked 12ptHelvetica indefinitely, I blocked DP1976 indefinitely, and I also blocked BryanFromPalatine for one week.I invite community discussion on whether the block on BryanFromPalatine should be shortened, or lengthened; it seems that he's sockpuppeted at least twice, so I think a week is good for now, in the absence of any further evidence.<a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 11:45, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After being reverted by a number of editors, he claimed to be leaving, returned to the Ukranian Wikipedia, wrote an "<a href="http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F_%D0%86%D0%B7%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BB%D1%8E_%D0%B2_%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%97%D0%B4%D1%96" class="external text" title="http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F_%D0%86%D0%B7%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BB%D1%8E_%D0%B2_%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%97%D0%B4%D1%96" rel="nofollow">Israel practises apartheid</a>" article as "revenge", and started recruiting Ukranian editors for the purpose of edit-warring. He managed to recruit <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryndza_fa93.html" title="User:Bryndza">User:Bryndza</a>, who normally just inserts Ukraninan interwikis, to revert for him, and <a href="../../../a/4/_/User%7EA4_9cfd.html" title="User:A4">User:A4</a>, who also normally just inserts interwikis, along with vandalizing <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodomor.html" title="Holodomor">Holodomor</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:A4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96775897" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:A4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96775897" rel="nofollow">removing warnings from his Talk: page</a>.

Rather ironically, both Hillock65 and A4 have most recently reverted using the edit summary "rv mass delition without discussion", though Hillock65 has not responded to several questions on the Talk: page, and A4 had never edited it at all (A4 obviously just copied Hillock65's misspelled edit summary). Now, based on this recruiting, <a href="../../../y/a/k/User%7EYakudza_a19d.html" title="User:Yakudza">User:Yakudza</a> has shown up to revert, and "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jayjg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96781356" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jayjg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=96781356" rel="nofollow">warned</a>" me as well, while still not contributing to the Talk: page discussion.</p>
<p>My patience with this kind of nonsense is low; I'm recommending a preliminary block of 1 week each for Hillock65 and A4, and of 2 days each for Bryndza and Yakudza, but I'm open to discussing other penalties.

<p>Allow me to clarify a few things. Apart from grossly misrepresenting the events the accuser makes several slanderous and unfounded accusations. First of all, there was no mentioning of "Jewish terrorism" it is a lie. You can check the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine&amp;oldid=96771193" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine&amp;oldid=96771193" rel="nofollow">name</a> of the article here. One can hardly equate Jewish terrorism with Red Terror and indeed no one even attempts to. As well, the mentioning of atrocities has been dropped out from the title, but the accuser neglected or purposefully mislead the others again. An example of twisted truth is also in allegation that it is based on original research. There was no research on my part, an article of Sir <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchil_3ceb.html" title="Winston Churchil">Winston Churchil</a> and quotation by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Conquest_360c.html" title="Robert Conquest">Robert Conquest</a> are there to prove the point that Jews from Ukraine did indeed participate in the Red Terror of the Russian Revolution. This is a well known and proven fact, the article by Winston Churchill is only there to illustrate the point. Another monstrous lie is that I allegedly wrote an article "Israel practises apartheid", you don't even need to know Ukrainian to see where it <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">links to</a> and what are the titles of corresponding articles in English and Russian. However, I do encourage other people to familiarize themselves with it before the accuser can use his ignorance to mount personal attacks. I also consider slanderous, unproven and unfounded accusations that I recruited someone, as another example of personal attacks done in extremely bad faith. I attempted <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine" rel="nofollow">several</a></b> times to discuss the matter civilly and to come to an acceptable mentioning of Red Terror and Lazar Kaganovich, instead, some people assumed ownership of that article and presume to decide what should and should not be included at all. I dare to disagree. I have a different point of view from theirs and I am intent on making it - personal attacks and slanderous accusations will not prevent me from recounting the well known facts and supporting them with credible sources. I would cordially advise whoever is going to look into this matter to look beyond prejudice and intolerance and see who is really trying to manipulate the truth for their own ends and check all the facts that I have mentioned.

<dd>If I may, Hillock65, the material that you're including is clearly not appropriate, as was explained to you on the talk page.The block that you're going to receive, however, is not only about the content, but your unwielding stubbornness in insisting on its inclusion in its present form through edit and revert warring.<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 21:17, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You can see that I tried to convince them to include it. I was open to variants but numerous people reverted it without trying to reason. I also added completely neutral material from Encyclopedia of Ukraine and it was deleted again. Without any discussion. Where is my stubborness in trying to at least include that material in the article?

<p>Regarding <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryndza_fa93.html" title="User:Bryndza">User:Bryndza</a>, if you look at the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II_91f8.html" title="Ukrainian-German collaboration during World War II">Ukrainian-German collaboration during World War II</a> article, he showed up there to revert war for Hillock65 and Yakudza; this was another article where, for some bizarre reason, Hillock65 felt it was necessary to remove fact about Jews being killed in WWI, and instead insert and revert yet another conspiracy theory about "Zionist-Nazi collaboration" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96413265&amp;oldid=96412222" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96413265&amp;oldid=96412222" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96444964&amp;oldid=96437712" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96444964&amp;oldid=96437712" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96458619&amp;oldid=96455783" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96458619&amp;oldid=96455783" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96462626&amp;oldid=96459839" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96462626&amp;oldid=96459839" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96503141&amp;oldid=96496713" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96503141&amp;oldid=96496713" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>.

<dd>I notice that an IP editor had been doing multiple reverts on the page; it looked like someone was logging out in order to violate 3RR and not get caught.

<li>No 3RR-violation here that I can see (my review is at <a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBucketsofg_temp_6123.html" title="User talk:Bucketsofg/temp">User_talk:Bucketsofg/temp</a>); I'm inclined to accept his explanation for the one IP-revert as having forgotten to sign in, since it is several hours since his previous edit.The deletions as IPs were excessive and deserve a strong caution, as do several of his edit summaries and comments here.I think it is important that we not make him responsible for anyone's edits but his own and several of them seem to me to be well worth considering. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 17:38, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>To Bucketsofg</b>. If these guys are so insistant, then several remarks and questions:
<ol>
<li>Why reverts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96805867&amp;oldid=96798070" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96805867&amp;oldid=96798070" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96750185&amp;oldid=96749991" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96750185&amp;oldid=96749991" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> by <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">User:Beit Or</a> withought any discussion (please find me at least one his post at <a href="../../../u/k/r/Talk%7EUkrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II_dccf.html" title="Talk:Ukrainian-German collaboration during World War II">Talk:Ukrainian-German collaboration during World War II</a>) can not be called vandalism but my edits and contibutions where I acctualy write text into article and provide support to calims can?</li>
<li>Why Mr Beit Or can easily revert my edits (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine&amp;diff=96749406&amp;oldid=96748002" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine&amp;diff=96749406&amp;oldid=96748002" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine&amp;diff=96701526&amp;oldid=96695522" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine&amp;diff=96701526&amp;oldid=96695522" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>) where I add a sentence: <i>The first written document, <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kievian_Letter_cb8e.html" title="Kievian Letter">Kievian Letter</a>, that acknowleges existance of jewish community in Kievan Rus' is dated byearly <a href="../../../1/0/t/10th_century.html" title="10th century">10th century</a> (or possibly 11th century).</i> (BTW, what wrong do you find in it?) without any discussion. Do you find something wrong in this sentense? Or this is just because he is not violating 3RR rule when doing this only twice in a row and then turn goes to Tewfik <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine&amp;diff=96770439&amp;oldid=96768198" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine&amp;diff=96770439&amp;oldid=96768198" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine&amp;diff=96774799&amp;oldid=96771193" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine&amp;diff=96774799&amp;oldid=96771193" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> and then Jayig comes into play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine&amp;diff=96780232&amp;oldid=96776674" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine&amp;diff=96780232&amp;oldid=96776674" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> and so on.</li>
<li>Now I'm listing my blunt reverts here: two of the Beit Or's vandalism (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96755061&amp;oldid=96750185" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96755061&amp;oldid=96750185" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96815659&amp;oldid=96805867" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96815659&amp;oldid=96805867" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>). Do you see more? Others are corrections, requests for facts, adding constructive information. Even when correcting vandalism by 7x sockpuppet <a href="../../../y/a/r/User_talk%7EYarillastremenog_a191.html" title="User talk:Yarillastremenog">User_talk:Yarillastremenog</a>. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">User:Humus sapiens</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">User:Carabinieri</a>, you are the only two who actually contributed to the article (not just reverted it). Do you find my edits violating some rules at WP?</li>
<li>Now can you explain me please how <a href="../../../y/a/r/User_talk%7EYarillastremenog_a191.html" title="User talk:Yarillastremenog">User_talk:Yarillastremenog</a> can get out from this war without even being banned, but <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">User:Hillock65</a>, <a href="../../../y/a/k/User%7EYakudza_a19d.html" title="User:Yakudza">User:Yakudza</a>, <a href="../../../a/4/_/User%7EA4_9cfd.html" title="User:A4">User:A4</a> get overly lengthy bans for nothing but ... for what actually? I did not really get it.</li>
<li>Now I'm relisting logs that Jayig claimed above to be my revert. I comment them shortly. Please confirm yourself:

<dd><b>Reply from Bucketsofg</b>.
<dl>
<dd>(1)Vandalism on wikipedia has a very specific meaning: see <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a>.The important point of which is that vandalism is a <i>deliberate</i> attempt to harm vandalism.It goes to motive. It seems obvious to me that Or's edits were motivated by a desire to improve the article by removing questionable material.You disagree with his opinion here, as is your right, but to call it vandalism is simply wrong and does not help your case.
<dl>
<dd>LOL! I just improved the article "by removing questionable material" inserted by new sockpuppet.Is that OK? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96938236&amp;oldid=96895700" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian-German_collaboration_during_World_War_II&amp;diff=96938236&amp;oldid=96895700" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> using same approach.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>(2)In revert wars it is often the case that good material gets tossed out with bad.This is part of the reason that revert wars are so harmful.In this case, you might have tried re-inserting the Kievian letter and {{fact}}-tags by themselves and tried to build a consensus around them before moving onto the more difficult material.</dd>

<p>Judging from the discussion it seems a pretty preconseived matter.

And only because he filed the complaint his side it taken for granted. As of yet I haven't seen an <b>objective</b> and level handed judgement of this matter.

<dd>As stated above, I consider a week long block for Hillsock65 an 'overkill'. I find blocks based on 'disruption' and content issues (and this is one of those) greyish; in this case looking at the article's talk page we can see discussion ongoing, and co majority support for any side. The procedure in this case should be to protect the article, not to block one side. I certainly don't want to wheel war, but I'd urge you to either 1) unblock the users and protect the article until they agree on a version on talk or 2) at the very least, reduce Hillock's block to 2 days (doubling of his last one day block).--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 12:49, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to me that an underlying problem here is that the German-Ukr-collab article is a pov-fork which is, if you'll excuse the expression, a shit-storm waiting to happen.By its nature it creates a defensiveness amongst Ukranians.Yes, many Ukranians collaborated, but many resisted, and naming an article collaboration by its nature practically defines those who want to include resistance as pov-pushers. One solution that we have to consider is finding a name for this article that at least has a prayer of producing a balanced presentation of a very difficult period of the human experience.<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 17:26, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Then, a week ago, a sock-puppet wrote <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_Nazi_Collaboration_during_WW2_2011.html" title="Ukrainian Nazi Collaboration during WW2">Ukrainian Nazi Collaboration during WW2</a>, a one-sided provocative article, in which the author was focusing entirely on presenting evidence of participation of Ukrainians in extermination of Jews in WW2. <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocost.html" title="Holocost">Holocost</a> is one of the biggest tragedies in the history of the world; it was a deliberate genocide of one nation. Yet, what <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">User:Hillock65</a> was pointing out is that while there are evidences of cooperation of Ukrainians with Nazi, there are also evidences of Ukrainians hiding and sheltering Jews from Nazi. In fact, if we were to present the true picture, should not both sides of the relationship between Jews and Ukrainians be presented? At the end, if we are down to the single most important fact then the fact is that the absolute majority of Ukrainians were in <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Army_7542.html" title="Soviet Army">Soviet Army</a> fighting Nazi.</p>
<p>But, the attention was moved to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine_8fa8.html" title="History of the Jews in Ukraine">History of the Jews in Ukraine</a>. <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">User:Hillock65</a> presented evidence of Jews being overrepresented in Soviet government, and connected the dots with Bolshevik's terror, and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodomor.html" title="Holodomor">Holodomor</a>, one of the biggest tragedies of Ukraine.

Was it the right way to resolve the dispute? Or, was it "no man, no problem" principle? If they are blocked for "edit warring", did they really fight with each other, or with the other side, which turned out to be more powerful?</p>

HE wrote a published book, a movie was based on his research, which spans before and after the book, he has been asked to testify to congress, done over 100 interviews, including fox news and air america, was cited by esquire , used by richard clarke to teach a course ... there is no real pleasing Hipo I believe as this shows. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 17:27, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am concerned that this user appears to be deleting messages on his talk page, even after I've warned him not to do so.Also, he is a bit keen to {{prod}} pages and also doesn't seem to understand WP etiquette.It's not a major problem, but he's had words before and I think he needs a chat from an Admin. He's not malicious, but a bit too keen to "wade in with his size nines" without fully appreciating what he's doing — <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperbfc_cd97.html" title="User:Superbfc"><span style="color:#FF4500;font-weight:bold;">superbfc</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperbfc_ff90.html" title="User talk:Superbfc"><span style="color:#00008B">talk</span></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Superbfc_6ef4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Superbfc"><span style="color:#C71585">cont</span></a> ]</small> — <em style="font-size:10px;">19:56, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</em></p>

<dd>Diffs would be helpful here so an admin doesn't have to comb through his whole edit summary. Deleting messages on his own talk page may be bad ettiquette, but it isn't against any core policy to the best of my knowledge (someone correct me if I'm wrong).Can you provide examples of of incivility or misues of PRODs?--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:01, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I took some time and looked into a couple of recent edits and I don't think there is any reason for anyone to warn <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETellyaddict_29e0.html" title="User:Tellyaddict">User:Tellyaddict</a>.He removed a rather incivil rant from another editor and was the soul of civility in his response to said editor.I asked him to please use edit summaries when he CSD or PROD's an article.Other than that I don't see anything actionable here that an admin would need to address.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:37, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
