<dd>I'm not saying he shouldn't remove it, I'm saying that when a user removes a warning by saying "revert new user test", it is quite reasonable to add it back saying "it was not a test". He can remove whatever he like, but in saying revert test and "fmt", he is showing a deliberate deceit which does his cause no favours. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a></dd>

<dd>Hang on, who's "stalking" whom? This started out not involving JzG, then he leaps in to revive a dispute long considered settled, and misused his admin rollback button in a content dispute. And the corollary to "don't template the regulars" is that you use a specific individual message: when I do this, he removed it. The reason I have learned to be combative with JzG is that he is a personal, vindictive and combative person who pays no regard to logical, well constructed arguments.

<dd>Actually that was a mistake; I immediately made a null edit to add a summary (which was: taking it to Talk, which I did), but it did not show up for some reason.

<p>This is a content dispute (and one, I might add, that JzG has involved himself). If the worst thing here is Fys calling someone an "idiot" (probably over this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anne_Milton&amp;diff=107203283&amp;oldid=107170309" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anne_Milton&amp;diff=107203283&amp;oldid=107170309" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>), then I daresay contributors in this thread have said a good deal worse.

<li>No, Mackensen, with respect, it's not a content dispute. Fys has changed the subject, and that happened because I mentioned that one of the articles involved is <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Milton_11ea.html" title="Anne Milton">Anne Milton</a>, the article where I blocked Fys for edit-warring before, but the problem is not the edit warring (although that is part of the problem), it's Fys' repeatable use of insulting comments in text and in edit summaries. As Viridae says, it's a long-term issue with this editor.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not going to press this further because I am "involved" (in the sense that one who does something to prevent Fys from doing what he wants is immediately "involved", since he seems entirely incapable of taking no for an answer) but you will see that the edit summaries and comments linked above use terms like "liar" and "idiot". He removed abusive comments instead of striking them and apologising (did he apologise for his rudeness? I didn't see it) and he posted blatant personal attacks, including evidently trawling through my Talk to find a disgruntled editor and stirring up dissent there.</dd>
<dd>In short: Fys is a troublemaker. His reaction to being called a troublemaker is precisely as one would expect from a politician and Usenet veteran: deflection and denial. Seems that's what's being tried again here. "Look at this horrible admin abuse, see this terrible edit warring". How about "Sorry, I should not have called this editor an idiot?" Or "sorry, I got carried away?"</dd>
<dd>Sooner or later we (for values of we which do not include me) are going to have to deal with this. Fys was desysopped for unapologetically edit warring on a political biography, and overall the one word that I think characterises Fys' behaviour generally is unapologetic. Like most politicians, he is entirely convinced of his own rectitude and he seems, from my limited interactions with him, to be absolutely unwilling to accept even the suggestion that he may be in the wrong. He is also not prepared to drop it, as we see form the fact that he is still evidently beating the dead horse of his 3RR block months ago. Of course the project can live with bullheaded and opinionated people, if it could not then I'd be out of here, but when they refuse to countenance the possibility they may be wrong, then we have a problem. <a href="../../../t/i/g/WP%7ETIGERS_f7f0.html" title="WP:TIGERS">WP:TIGERS</a>. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 12:58, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With respect, I think it's rather silly to claim everything you've written is NPOV. Everyone has their own political opinions and leanings, and while you certainly don't write articles to say "David Cameron is a Tory idiot", edits such as this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Gilligan&amp;diff=107409510&amp;oldid=107391057" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Gilligan&amp;diff=107409510&amp;oldid=107391057" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> unquestionably demonstrate that you have a POV, as the edit is slanted against Gilligan and in favour of the government, certainly reading the evidence from the testimony you linked, it's not consistent with the slant of the article. Neturality is a lot more subtle than bald political statements, and the presentation of evidence and summaries which appear to be balanced prima facie, but actually slant the reader towards a certain conclusion is actually rather more insidious and effective han overt bias. Of course everyone will do this, nobody is without opinions and bias, and to claim that you are an impartial observer, infallible and completely without bias is just silly. This is consistent with other recent edits of yours to the effect that you are always right, and doesnt' do you any favours. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 13:52, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I think it should run for a while. Fys is very skilled at diverting discussion of his problematic behaviour down blind alleys, but he does keep on with the problematic behaviour and, as noted above, he has an unshakeable belief in his own neutrality, which is a pressing problem given that he is a party political activist; it is unwise in the extreme not to acknowledge even the <i>possibility</i> that you might have bias. Add to that the extremely unhelpful nature of some of his comments, and we have a problem editor. With a history of blocks, an ArbCom sanction and a desysopping behind him. Every time he diverts the discussion by poking sharp sticks at everybody who disagrees with him, we all say "oh, content dispute" and wander off. How many content disputes do you have to have, with how many editors, before it;s considered a problem? Fys <b>will not accept criticism</b>, even when it is seen by outsiders as well founded.

<dd>Tom and ALoan... I would say 'any page' could indeed include this one, but perhaps that might not be the most productive thing to do. What I am seeing is a pattern of contentious behaviour from an editor that has been warned before and perhaps some community sanctioning is in order here... what would be the list of pages that we'd want to restrict this behaviour on? Do we really need ArbCom to sanction?

<dd>I suppose we could make a list of pages and ban him from them under the existing remedy for disruptive incivility. But I'm not sure a focus on particular pages is what we need. The problem seems to be a pattern of behavior with other editors: unwillingness to be civil with people who disagree with him, to the point of interfering with his and others' work.

<p>Thats enough, Fys has had huge amounts of leeway in this matter despite repeated and continuing personal incidents. This last personal attack (reported above) tips the balance that should have been tipped some time ago, and Fys has earnt himself a 31 hour block.

<p>This person made some normal edits initially, but ever since has been inserting not-notable spam about himself and his friends into articles, and creating articles about not-notable films that he was in with his pals.

If you click on the link to Tom Cummings, it's a redirect back to his own userpage (it's already been speedied).

Several days ago, a difference of opinion arose over the placement of a fair use image in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kandice_Pelletier&amp;oldid=106178455" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kandice_Pelletier&amp;oldid=106178455" rel="nofollow">Kandice Pelletier</a> article. The editor in question, <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater">PageantUpdater</a> and I went back and forth about the placement of the image and the boxes. In retaliation, <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater">PageantUpdater</a> went and singled out the image in question for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:TAR10Kandice.jpg&amp;diff=106179128&amp;oldid=88230399" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:TAR10Kandice.jpg&amp;diff=106179128&amp;oldid=88230399" rel="nofollow">possible deletion</a>.

<p><b>My side of the story</b>: Back on the 6th of Feb I noticed a fair use image in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kandice_Pelletier_2138.html" title="Kandice Pelletier">Kandice Pelletier</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kandice_Pelletier&amp;diff=106165735&amp;oldid=103249678" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kandice_Pelletier&amp;diff=106165735&amp;oldid=103249678" rel="nofollow">removed it</a>, while adding a pertinent infobox. The image was re-added by Evrik at which point I removed it citing the fair use rules. For the past week there's been to-ing and fro-ing about the use of the image and the positioning of the two infoboxes in the article (see the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Talk%7EKandice_Pelletier_4418.html" title="Talk:Kandice Pelletier">Talk:Kandice Pelletier</a>) and I clearly admit that I have "used up" my three reverts today. Regarding the image, initially I mistakenly thought that it was only used in the biographical article and tagged it as "rfu". Later, after lengthy debate and argument, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:TAR10Kandice.jpg&amp;diff=107642673&amp;oldid=107638192" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_talk:TAR10Kandice.jpg&amp;diff=107642673&amp;oldid=107638192" rel="nofollow">realised my oversight</a> and removed the rfu tags from the image, and again removed the image from <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kandice_Pelletier_2138.html" title="Kandice Pelletier">Kandice Pelletier</a>. Evrik seems to have a real issue with what I have been doing but in my opinion at least I have been working to improve the article, for example by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kandice_Pelletier&amp;diff=107660962&amp;oldid=107648699" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kandice_Pelletier&amp;diff=107660962&amp;oldid=107648699" rel="nofollow">adding detailed references and expanding the article</a>.</p>
<p>The latest is that I noticed that Evrik had wikilinked some names in the Amazing Race episode articles which I reverted because I couldn't see the point of having redlinks. In my final revert <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Amazing_Race_11&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107689015" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Amazing_Race_11&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107689015" rel="nofollow">I noted that that these articles, if created, would fail on notability</a>. My edits were reverted, the articles were created, and I nominated them for deletion. Evrik then removed the afd tag on one of the articles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mary_Conley&amp;diff=107718896&amp;oldid=107717821" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mary_Conley&amp;diff=107718896&amp;oldid=107717821" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> which I replaced. Creating the afds and my reverts to the episode articles has led to me being accused of wikistalking - which is ludicrous. The articles were all on my watchlist prior and had any other editor tried the same thing I would have reverted and dealt with it in the same fashion.</p>
<p>I probably have more to add but am due to leave work for the day soon so want to get this posted in the interim. I will just add that I prior to this ending up on here I suggested that Evrik launch an RFC if he continues to harrass me in this manner, because I am sick of it. Clearly, for reasons I cannot fathom, he chose to address it here. I have already attempted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kandice_Pelletier&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107668617" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kandice_Pelletier&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107668617" rel="nofollow">extend an olive branch</a> and call in other editors but this hasn't met too favourably with Evrik.</p>
<p>PS Evrik has basically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Evrik#Kandice_Pelletier" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Evrik#Kandice_Pelletier" rel="nofollow">challenged me to deal with the other images</a> yet chooses to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amber_Mariano&amp;curid=646156&amp;diff=107730117&amp;oldid=107724891" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amber_Mariano&amp;curid=646156&amp;diff=107730117&amp;oldid=107724891" rel="nofollow">revert</a> my action when I do so -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 03:00, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<b>My side of the story (part 2):</b> Ok back home now. Not going to add a whole lot right now but to say that I am frustrated by the accusation that by not immediately dealing with other Amazing Race related images at the time I removed one from <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kandice_Pelletier_2138.html" title="Kandice Pelletier">Kandice Pelletier</a> I have somehow acted in bad faith. To be honest at the time I didn't care a hoot about any other articles or images, but only the one in the article I was dealing with at the time (Pelletier's). When I was challenged on this I decided to go and have a look at the others, which I edited in a way I felt was appropriate, tagging some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Chip_Arndt_Access.jpg&amp;diff=106665767&amp;oldid=91242032" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Chip_Arndt_Access.jpg&amp;diff=106665767&amp;oldid=91242032" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, moving those I thought were okay under the fair use guidles to appropriate places in articles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=B._J._Averell&amp;diff=106665275&amp;oldid=104393245" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=B._J._Averell&amp;diff=106665275&amp;oldid=104393245" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tyler_MacNiven&amp;diff=106665008&amp;oldid=106572987" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tyler_MacNiven&amp;diff=106665008&amp;oldid=106572987" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> and nominating whole articles for deletion because I did not think they complied with the notability policy<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/James_Branaman&amp;diff=107728331&amp;oldid=106671709" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/James_Branaman&amp;diff=107728331&amp;oldid=106671709" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. Yet Evrik still accuses me of singling the one article out. As outlined above when I finished up dealing with the images some of my edits were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amber_Mariano&amp;curid=646156&amp;diff=107730117&amp;oldid=107724891" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amber_Mariano&amp;curid=646156&amp;diff=107730117&amp;oldid=107724891" rel="nofollow">reverted</a>.</p>
<p>I admit that I have been mildly rude to Evrik on one occasion this afternoon when I just couldn't stomach this any longer (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PageantUpdater&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107649166" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PageantUpdater&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107649166" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PageantUpdater&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107658438" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PageantUpdater&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=107658438" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>) but I feel that it is <i>I</i> who is being persecuted here, not Evrik. I have been transparent and open throughout the whole ordeal and quite frankly I am sick of it, as I indicated to him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Evrik#I_suggest_you_launch_a_RFC_if_you_refuse_to_stop_harassing_me." class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Evrik#I_suggest_you_launch_a_RFC_if_you_refuse_to_stop_harassing_me." rel="nofollow">here</a> -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 03:45, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>One of the basic tenets of Wikipedia is that anyone can make edits on an article. You shouldn't be taking it personally if someone changes or removes your edits.

<li>In Evrik's defense (and I may not be objective), PageantUpdater had never edited the four articles she initially reverted (until Evrik did) she then revertd him in the name of Wiki Quality.

This is clearly a violation of <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a>.

<p>I'll point out the user does in fact believe the webcomic is non-notable: "Starslip Crisis honestly isn’t notable." He was trying to point out that he could get it deleted for spurious reasons, but he did believe there were valid reasons to delete it.</p>

<p><a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefferson_Anderson_066f.html" title="User:Jefferson Anderson">Jefferson Anderson</a> has apparently left Wikipedia, but the content of what he has left on his talk page and done on his user page violates quite a number of WP policies. His userpage now hosts a series of "what's wrong with WP and particular editors", which if not a borderline violation of SOAP, is pretty close to violating NPA, or may qualify as polemical content. Jefferson has also removed all negative comment made <i>about</i> his edits, and has left only those that, when taken as a whole, make him look like a martyr of sorts, unjustly hounded by Wikipedia users, when looking at other evidence clearly shows otherwise. The problem is, one has to <i>look</i> for that. I'd like to see the talk material restored, the new user page content cleared, and both pages protected. I'd also like to see the account locked to prevent further usage, frankly, because a currently banned user is a known "friend" of his. However, as a named party, I don't want to lend credence to the claims by rm'ing the material myself, putting it up for MfD, or doing anything else to it or with it. Could an uninvolved admin look at the user and talk pages and come to a decision? <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 20:33, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't seem that bad to me. He's whinging, and it's basically pointless, but there's no policies being broken, there's no personal attacks, there's no polemics.

<dd>As another named party (and one who has not had a dispute with him), I do have an issue with his subpage... <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefferson_Anderson_Evidence_36d7.html" title="User:Jefferson Anderson/Evidence">User:Jefferson Anderson/Evidence</a>. Shouldn't an unfounded sockpuppet accusation be considered a personal attack? If he thinks I am a sock of someone else, he should have requested a checkuser to verify it. To place unverified "evidence" on his user page seems like an "attack" to me. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 13:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Hm...so stating and naming users as controlling articles <i>without proof</i> isn't a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>? Particularly where the policy states <i>"Using someone's affiliations as a means of dismissing or discrediting their views</i>"? Jefferson claims that because we're Masons, we all know each other well (which is funny, considering Arbcom statemnts about <i>him</i>and his friends), and that we are controlling articles. He cites Jahbulon, which <i>after</i> we stopped his nonsense, was rewritten <i>totally</i> and is as decent as it is going to get.</dd>

<dd>As for "debating content and not contributors", we have unfounded accusations of sockpuppetry - he claims he was accused unjustly <i>by particular users</i>, yet leaves out that he has done the same thing (as noted by Blueboar). The same with the <i>"meatpuppetry"</i> accusations - <i>he</i> was accused unjustly, but we are actually doing it. Where is this "debating content and not contributors"? I'm not going to respond to it, but I shouldn't have to stand for it, either, especially from a disingenuous user who is distorting facts to make the perpetrator into the victim. Also, given that he was only here for just over 2 months (supposedly; I have doubts given his early contribs), how does he have any basis on which to comment on anything? This is more or less allowing WP and its users to be lambasted by anyone who decides they want to, baselessly. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 22:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This AN/I entry concerns directives I have received from admin <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> on February 14, 2007 in which I was told to not provide notice to users whose work was threatened with deletion under the AfD process. The exchange was played out on our respective talk pages which are found <a href="../../../e/d/i/User_talk%7EEdivorce_c5c4.html#AfD_notification" title="User talk:Edivorce">here</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html#notices_for_afds" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">here</a> . The AfDs involved in this matter are found <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2007_February_14_e0fb.html#Progressive_Bloggers" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2007 February 14">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Blogging_Tories_%282nd_nomination%29_ce02.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Blogging Tories (2nd nomination)">here</a>.</p>
<p>Background and Discussion: I periodically review AfDs and DRVs looking for articles with significant merit. If I find such an article that has had substantial participation from users who are not involved in the discussion I have at times provided a notification to all editors who have contributed to the article. This practice is motivated by concern that fair and complete process requires that those editors whose work may be destroyed by deletion are entitled to <i>notice and an opportunity to be heard</i>. Simply put they are entitled to have a say in the matter. They can't participate if they don't know about it. I can not participate often as this notice procedure is somewhat time consuming. I have been selecting well less than 1% of articles in AfD/DRV. Again, I try to select article with merit and multiple editors.</p>
<p>I have received somewhat inconsistent direction from admins on this matter. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CharlotteWebb&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101060266" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CharlotteWebb&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101060266" rel="nofollow">Here</a> I received advice from the closer of an AfD that it was permissible to contact article editors to participate in the DRV. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Edivorce&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101819261" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Edivorce&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101819261" rel="nofollow">Here</a> I received advice that notice is proper providing all sides are contacted (This was an DRV and although AVI felt contact was permitted he would not provide names of underlying editors in article, record of which had been deleted). It has become my practice to clearly indicate in the AfD/DRV when I notify edits. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Revolutionary_Anarchist_Bowling_League" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Revolutionary_Anarchist_Bowling_League" rel="nofollow">Here</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_123_Pleasant_Street_%282nd_nomination%29_f38f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/123 Pleasant Street (2nd nomination)">here</a> are two examples of DRVs in which I announced posting notices. The admins who closed these DRV must have been aware of the notices and they did not see any reason to even comment to me. Now for the same conduct <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> has indicated I will blocked if I continue to provided such notices.</p>
<p>I have been an editor of WP for 16 months and have made a little over a thousand editors. I know that is not much by admin standards put it is enough for me to care about. I have never been blocked. I know many, including admins, confuse what I am doing with "canvassing" or "aggressive cross posting" I have tailored these notices to conform with <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECANVASS_3bfe.html" title="WP:CANVASS">WP:CANVASS</a>. I am acting in good faith, out of legitimate concern for the work and rights of other editors.</p>
<p>Some of those who receive notice may be mildly inconvenienced. But the interests of editors who are able to participate because they receive notice greatly out weighs any trivial burden on those who don't care.</p>
<p>Finally I know that many of the users receiving these notices appreciate them. I have seen notified editors participate in discussions. I have seen them help form consensus to keep articles. Most importantly <i>I have seen editors improve articles</i>, as is encouraged in the AfD process.</p>
<p>Requested Action: I request that the admins reach and articulate a clear consensus concerning notifications to editors whose work is subject to deletion in AfD and DRV matters. The lack of this consensus subjects the would be providers of such notices to the limits imposed by the most restrictive admins or subjects the provider to blocking and loss of reputation.</p>
<p>Note: I will provide <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> with notice of this AN/I entry.</p>

<dd>My understanding is that it is not merely acceptable to notify the creator and major editors of an AfD, but that it's encouraged. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 18:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I don't dispute that Edivorce is working in good faith and with the best interests of Wikipedia in mind. I am, however, concerned that he has misunderstood our policies and practices on Wikipedia with respect to cross-posting. (Part of the confusion may stem from overgeneralizing the applicability of some specific advice he may have received.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To clarify, I believe that there is a broad consensus that sending out a templated notification to <i>every single editor</i> of an article when it is nominated for deletion is considered an inappropriate level of cross-posting. Further – as far as I can tell, at least – Edivorce has never received advice to the contrary. I initially approached him after I noticed his posts (two in the same day) on another editor's talk page that I happened to have watchlisted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The specific cases (cited above) where Edivorce <i>has</i> received advice are somewhat different situations. In order of the diffs above:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CharlotteWebb&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101060266" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CharlotteWebb&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101060266" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> Edivorce was advised by <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlotteWebb_d424.html" title="User:CharlotteWebb">CharlotteWebb</a> that when DRV sent an article back for a second AfD, it would be appropriate for him to notify the participants in the original AfD. (Note also that CharlotteWebb is not an admin. Not that non-admin's opinions should carry less weight, but it's worth correcting Edivorce's impression.)</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Edivorce&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101819224" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Edivorce&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101819224" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avraham</a> provided essentially the same advice—that is, that advising everyone who participated in the original AfD that the article had been renominated was acceptable. This is the same case as the first link.</li>
<li>In the third instance, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Revolutionary_Anarchist_Bowling_League_d9c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Revolutionary Anarchist Bowling League">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Revolutionary Anarchist Bowling League</a>, Edivorce cross-posted a message to all editors of the article at some point after it was nominated. A few other editors suggested on the AfD that this probably wasn't a good idea, but there wasn't actually any administrator intervention. Edivorce appears to be interpreting silence as consent.</li>
<li>The final link is to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_123_Pleasant_Street_%282nd_nomination%29_f38f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/123 Pleasant Street (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/123 Pleasant Street (2nd nomination)</a>, which is the renommed article from the first two links. Again, this isn't a parallel situation as notifications went to all editors of the original <i>AfD</i>, and not to all editors of the <i>article</i>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have little doubt that for nearly every AfD, there will be some editor who thinks that the article is "with merit" and has "multiple editors". If notifying every editor of every article nominated for deletion is deemed an acceptable practice, I fear that all of us will be overwhelmed by talk page spam.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I advised Edivorce that a reasonable and acceptable compromise would be to notify "a page's original author, and authors who have made substantial contributions", with the proviso that "If you're sending a notice to more than two or three people on any given AfD, then you're probably casting too broad a net for 'substantial'." Notifying the eight IP editors of an article as well as editors who've made a single spelling correction or removed a redlink is overkill. In general, I believe that editors with a strong interest in an article's welfare will use their watchlists, and that articles with more than two or three major contributors are likely to have no difficulty clearing through AfD without extra canvassing.</dd>

<dd>I think you have, or the page needs a rewrite, or somewhere in between. It specifically states on the WP:AFD page <i>"It is generally considered civil to notify the good-faith creator and any main contributors of the articles that you are nominating for deletion. Do not notify bot accounts or people who have made only insignificant 'minor' edits. To find the main contributors, look in the page history or talk page of the article and/or use TDS' Article Contribution Counter."</i> We fall into the middle if he was notifying people who added periods, but if the people being notified made contributions beyond "minor" edits then its actually the practice reccomended by WP:AFD, which does not put a cap on how many to notify. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 19:48, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not for edits not marked as minor, it specifically says <i>main contributors</i>. To me, that's a group of maybe 5 editors that, from looking at the history, clearly have the article watchlisted and have contributed significantly to it. If I've, for example, rewritten a paragraph that I stumbled across through random page or whatever, then I simply cannot mark that edit as minor, but I do not expect to be notified if the article is on AfD. If I care, it's in my watchlist. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#555">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><font color="#2C9191" size="3">✍</font></a> 20:01, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not believe you interpretation to be correct. The fact that you fall back on "if I care, it't in my watchlist" would actually remove the need to notify anyone, surely the articles creator has it watchlisted. Main contributors really depends on the articles edit history then. If I put an article up for deletion should I look through the 80 pages of edit history and measure the ammount people added or removed? I simply think the blanket approach allows for no bias. If I was to pick 5 editors who contributed, I can pick 5 editors who deleted tons of content and be done with it. Again, "if I care" surely fails in this case, cause if that is what was meant, then you would not be asked to notify anyone, cause someone "who cares" would see the AfD added. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 20:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note that that statement on WP:AFD is prefaced by, "It is generally considered civil..." Nowhere does it say it is required, nor does it even say it is recommended. In other words, it is saying that it won't be viewed as talk page spamming or canvassing (as it might in other instances) to notify the creator and the main contributors that you can identify from looking at the history.

<dd>Which is why I state your opinion seems to be different from that of the community, or at least writer of that passage that snuck by =) I do think giving notice to anon's, at least those who do not seem to consistently edit anonymously is overboard. I also think excessive noting may have happened, but due to the small number of contributors, it probably did not seem like it would hurt to inform everyone, when everyone is 30% of the total anyway, had it been 5 editors on each article that is. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:20, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure I understand your point; I said that that passage does not imply that notification is required or even suggested. I'm not <i>opposed</i> to notification (as long as it's done responsibly), but I don't think it's necessary.

<dd>I think "the main contributors" is stronger than "not bots or editors who have designated the edit "minor"". If TenOfTrades's comment <a href="../../../e/d/i/User_talk%7EEdivorce_c5c4.html#AfD_notification" title="User talk:Edivorce">"In the last few hours, you have sent out at least sixty copy-pasted (or templated) notifications about a couple of AfDs."</a> is correct, that does sound a bit more than just "the main contributors". I can't imagine an article than has 30 main contributors! I think "a page's original author, and authors who have made substantial contributions" is a good paraphrase of "main contributors". That may amount to more than 2-3 on large and/or important articles, but surely not 30. By the way, my compliments to Ten for civility. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 20:09, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I encourage readers of this thread here to read the discussion that I had with Edivorce on <a href="../../../e/d/i/User_talk%7EEdivorce_c5c4.html#AfD_notification" title="User talk:Edivorce">his</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html#notices_for_afds" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">my</a> talk pages, to provide context. In total for the two articles Edivorced posted 68 notices on February 14. (Some editors received two notices, as they had happened to edit both articles.) 24 notices were posted to the talk pages of IP addresses. Many, many notices went to logged-in editors who made single, very minor changes to the articles in question: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blogging_Tories&amp;diff=96017940&amp;oldid=96014635" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blogging_Tories&amp;diff=96017940&amp;oldid=96014635" rel="nofollow">changed linkback to a different choice of main article</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blogging_Tories&amp;diff=28028372&amp;oldid=25176299" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blogging_Tories&amp;diff=28028372&amp;oldid=25176299" rel="nofollow">narrowed a cat</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blogging_Tories&amp;diff=22715719&amp;oldid=22375546" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blogging_Tories&amp;diff=22715719&amp;oldid=22375546" rel="nofollow">unlinked a couple of redlinked names</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blogging_Tories&amp;diff=108198330&amp;oldid=107614202" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blogging_Tories&amp;diff=108198330&amp;oldid=107614202" rel="nofollow">Added the AfD notice(!)</a>.</dd>
<dd>To tell the truth, I didn't expect anyone to treat my suggested three recipients as a hard ceiling; I figured that there would be a little bit of fudging around that guideline number, and as long as Edivorce reined in a bit then I wouldn't kick up a fuss. I just know that <i>thirty</i> messages for an AfD is too many—how many major contributors could there possibly be to a five-paragraph article about a minor political blog? <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 20:34, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I took my guidance from Wp:CANVASS not WP:AfD. I have read this caveat just now. It places a civility floor on contact to creator and major contribs. Not a ceiling. It is disallows bots and "minors", which I have no problem with. BTW a whole lot of AfD are not civil by this standard. No affirmative notice at all is typical.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 20:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I guess the idea in the future is to avoid notifying anon's and possible very minor article contributors. An easy way to guage this now is that you can see how much content they added in an edit, dont think its a mod I have, but standard now. While I think the ceiling can go pretty high in some cases, which is why I oppose a cap of sorts, seems others do as well, I think some basic restrictive ideas can work here. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:20, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't understand the prohibition on annons. I have successfully corresponded with annons using talk pages. I have seen annons participate in AfDs. It is a Wiki-Axiom to treat annons, as far as possible like everyone else. Why not treat them like others here?<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 21:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The simplest answer is that a very large majority of IP addresses are shared and dynamic; leaving a message on an IP's talk page that at one time contributed to an article has a very, very low chance of actually being received by the editor you are attempting to write to. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#555">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><font color="#2C9191" size="3">✍</font></a> 23:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I guess I was making the point of simplicity, I am not enacting any rules against you. Just making suggestions, how about checking the anon's edit history to see if they have participated in multiple articles in a coherent way, will tell you if its a dynamic or static IP basically. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 00:19, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In lieu of a total block, Sir Nicholas requested the user to avoid editing the subject article for a period of time. As I have written elsewhere, that is a sensible solution to many 3RR disputes that I frankly think should be used more often. It has the positive effect of putting a halt to the edit war while allowing the contributor to channel his or her efforts into other articles, rather than losing them completely for 24 hours, and also avoids the side effect of disaffecting the blocked editor completely. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:29, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually the above user does not want to mention what scholars agree upon. He believes that his opinion which has no scholarly support should count as hypothesis. This clearly violates OR. The user has shown his fair of bad language and personal attacks. Note the above user wanted to delete reference to Encyclopedia Britannica whereas Britannica did not contradict any of the sources I mentioned. Another administrator named DAB has totally taken my side on this issue. The above user quotes from a very non-scholarly site [www.turkicworld.org] where Sumerians, Scythians and every ancient person is considered a Turk. Also I believe the above user a sock-puppet of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Barefact" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Barefact" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>. The reason is simple. We had a debate with the same user before on the topic. As soon as Rokus01 created his i.d, he refers to [www.turkicworld.prg] which is the site of barefact. I believe the admins should do a check on this. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 15:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Unfortunately this ideological users have a problem with Britannica 2007 and tens of other scholars who have clearly stated Scythian is Iranian. The user does not like the words of scholars so he tries to either dilute it or subvert it with phony words like <i>unscientific</i> , <i>flawed</i>..--<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 16:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is a matter of fact linguists classify Scythian as Iranian and too many sources have been brought in that article. That is why 14 scholars were quoted in the Scythian article. The user who is not a linguistic made very funny linguistic claims even claiming the scythian word anar (effeminate) is related to the word anus! This shows his seriousness with regards to comparative linguistics. The user had a problem with this statement since it did not fit his agenda and thus tried to water it down or remove it without providing absolutely no evidence. He does not have the necessary academic credentials to make judgements about Scythians. When I asked him to quote some serious scholars, he mentioned a site www.turkicworld.org which considers Sumerians as Turks and wanted to mention a book by unpublished nationalist tatar scholar claiming scythian is Turkish. And the user keeps repeating <i>mere synoptics pleasing his POV</i> whereas with Brtiannica, I have offered 14 other sources as well and the user has absolutely no right to remove it just to reference section. The user DAB also agrees with the scholarly viewpoint that Scythians were Iranian.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARokus01&amp;diff=104546206&amp;oldid=104546064" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARokus01&amp;diff=104546206&amp;oldid=104546064" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>. Note the first comment from this user is about www.turkicworld.org a laughable website which claims Sumerian, Parthians and many other groups even portions of Slavs were Turks. We have asked this user instead of deleting or manipulating quotes, bring forward another scholarly (a scholar who is well known and published in peer-review journals with matters regarding to Scythians), but he failed to do so. Instead he wants to remove Britannica links. Note his explicit removal of Britannica here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scythians&amp;diff=106553172&amp;oldid=106533246" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scythians&amp;diff=106553172&amp;oldid=106533246" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>, whereas in the above edits I just discussed, he inserted Britannica quotes. Thus this user when Britannica 2007 does not fit his agenda, removes it from wikipedia enteries and when it fits his agenda, inserts it. Note the level of hypocrasy we are dealing with. The user claims: <i>Since this article pretends Wikipedia:Verifiability (V) and NPOV truth, and considering the amount of primary and secondary sources already drawn upon, all references to Britannica should be removed asap</i>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Scythians#Deletion_of_tertiary_sources" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Scythians#Deletion_of_tertiary_sources" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>. And then removes Britannica from the link! At the same time he inserts Britannica links in to other wikipedia enteries!(see above). Unfortunately this is what happens when ideological users join wikipedia. The problem with this user is that he can not offer a single source from a reliable scholars published in peer reviewed journals claiming Scythians were something else. That is what me and user Dab asked for. But he faild to so and thus wants to remove Britannica 2007 and 14 other scholarly references and at the same time he inserts britannica in other links and then repeats his opinions as if they are facts. Again to be clear on the users varying viewpoint on wikipedia depending on what suits his POV just check his differing views on Britannica 2007 in word and action: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Scythians#Deletion_of_tertiary_sources" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Scythians#Deletion_of_tertiary_sources" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kurdish_people&amp;diff=108630057&amp;oldid=108582261" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kurdish_people&amp;diff=108630057&amp;oldid=108582261" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>]</dd>

<dd>The question is what we think AFD is about, and what the closing admin's role is. When I&#160;!vote in an AFD (as I did here), my role is to express an opinion and, sometimes, give an argument to try to make others change theirs. In this AFD, I made no argument. But with or without one, my expressed opinion should be respected as part of the consensus process. What is the closing admin's role? They are there, imo, not to decide who won the argument, but instead to determine what the consensus was. In this case, there were 4 deletes, 2 weak deletes, and 4 keeps. If it had been me that closed, it would have been "no consensus". (I also note that the article was closed one day after relisting.) Take it to deletion review? I don't care enough about it to bother, really. But I am concerned to be told that my opinion, and the opinions of three other editors--two of whom are admins--somehow does not count. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 04:11, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I have been persistently harassed by an anonymous user (I presume it is one and the same) using different IP addresses but all based on Sarajevo. Looking through just the most recent examples it is quite clear that they are all from the same same source (89.146...). Is it at all possible to block the entire source or must each IP address be blocked individiually? The IP addresses in question with examples of vandalism and/or threats are listed below:</p>
<ul>

<p>Thatcher131, I'm sorry, I don't completely understand your answer. Do you mean to say that the range of IPs is from 89.146.128.0... to 89.146.128.18...&#160;? Regards <a href="../../../o/s/l/User%7EOsli73_41ba.html" title="User:Osli73">Osli73</a> 16:20, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>89.146.128.0/18 identifies the range of addresses between 89.146.128.0 and 89.146.191.255, about 16000 addresses. Whois indicates that this entire range is managed by the same ISP and so may be available to the user in question. Range 89.146.128.0/19 would cover 8000 addresses between 89.146.128.0 and 89.146.159.255, which seems to be his practical range (he hasn't used the high end, maybe those servers serve a different geogrpahic region, for example). If an admin thought the comments were serious enough to warrant blocking, those would be the appropriate ranges for a short-term anon-only rangeblock. I myself do not have the time to determine whether this is harassment or a legit content argument, but I offer the range info if another admin wants to block. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:04, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's certainly harassment or worse. However, a range block would probably cause a lot of collateral damage. A better way to stop the 89.146.xxx.xxx editor is semi-protecting <a href="../../../s/r/e/Talk%7ESrebrenica_massacre_a3df.html" title="Talk:Srebrenica massacre">Talk:Srebrenica massacre</a>. However, seeing that this editor hasn't touched the page for half a week, I think it's better to wait and see whether s/he returns.</dd>

<dd>That appeared to be a pretty clear case to me; also, he/she appears to have had the same IP address for several months, so I blocked for a month. Not knowing much of the history beyond what I read on talk pages and by checking contribs, though, someone can review and adjust as necessary. I turned off the AO block for the same reason — appears to be a static IP address, and it has been unblocked for several months, so who knows how many sleeper accounts exist. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#555">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><font color="#2C9191" size="3">✍</font></a> 03:01, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Certainly they don't seem to be significant, and they look linked to the Axios linkages. However, I can't be sure.

I had trouble believing the person contacting the admin was in fact the person they claimed for a few reasons: They were not located at the University they are associated with. They were contacting the admin from a DSL line in a different part of California (derived from the IP). They contacted an admin who is not sympathetic to conspiracy theories, and has stated they believe people who do believe in them are "not all there" (not a direct quote).</p>
<p>The anon that contacted them left no evidence of their identity, or that this is their new belief.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tom_harrison&amp;diff=108692773&amp;oldid=108612993" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tom_harrison&amp;diff=108692773&amp;oldid=108612993" rel="nofollow">[70]</a> They did not update their UC Berkely page to reflect this,<a href="http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~pdscott/" class="external autonumber" title="http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~pdscott/" rel="nofollow">[71]</a> or update articles on another site they are known to write for.<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=SCO20061220&amp;articleId=4207" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=SCO20061220&amp;articleId=4207" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> The admin posted the message on the article talk page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:9/11_conspiracy_theories&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108697153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:9/11_conspiracy_theories&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108697153" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>and I told the admin I would prefer if they just cite the persons view in the past tense, instead, they did not deny saying it, just stated they changed their mind, which still makes the quote legit.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:9/11_conspiracy_theories&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=108699430" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:9/11_conspiracy_theories&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=108699430" rel="nofollow">[74]</a> The admin removed the passage anyway from an edit protected article.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=9/11_conspiracy_theories&amp;diff=108699716&amp;oldid=105945954" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=9/11_conspiracy_theories&amp;diff=108699716&amp;oldid=105945954" rel="nofollow">[75]</a> One they have edit warred on, which is why its edit protected.

<p>I am not sure who "they" is above: I neither support nor oppose the view of the essay, I just think that it makes sense to allow essays to fairly present the point of view from which it was originally written, and the counterargument in another place, just like <a href="../../../n/g/r/WP%7ENGR_2698.html" title="WP:NGR">WP:NGR</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWIG" class="extiw" title="w:WWIG">W:WWIG</a>. How to handle essays of this sort is a policy question which I think needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>I also think it would have been helpful for Worldtraveller and WillowW - two of the most active participants in the lively debate that sprang up on the talk page - to have been warned before they were both blocked.</p>
<p>Anyway, as Worldtraveller has now been unblocked, I have also removed an autoblock as requested by Worldtraveller on his talk page. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 12:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi there, I am a recently new Wiki Editor. I made a page about someone I belieive to be notable, with the hopes that others would come to work on it too. A lot of craziness happened, by my concern is over user Jeffrey_O._Gustafsone. Please look at his talk/discussion history in relation to me, Ebony Anpu, and Ebony's AfD page. It appears he is spreading propaganda. On one post he will write, no vote, then list many reasons why one should delete the page. This seems dishonest. Then he took out some observtions I made, calling them slander, and threatened me. Then he turned right around and insulted me, after tellnig me not to. I do not know what is going on, but it obvious by his postings that is is taking a serious stand on an issue then denying it. Also, he has just been totally rude to me. If he treats other new editors like this, I am saddened. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainbarrett_48a2.html" title="User:Captainbarrett">Captain Barrett</a> 02:00, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Navou, there is no need to have Captain Barrett dig out individual difs. Simply go to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ebony_Anpu_4b4c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ebony Anpu">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ebony Anpu</a>, the associated talk page, the article, and the previous AfD, and look for my contributions therein. He's essentially complaining about all of them. Feel free to review my actions - I have been exceptionally open about my conduct with this AfD and this particular user, asking for second opinions from other admins in not one, but two, separate AN/I threads, not including here as well.

<li>I see Jeffs point, it appears valid. I see CPT's point, it appears valid. At first glance, and assuming good faith edits on both parties; However, it appears that there was good deal of latitude in what occurred. Everyone is different, I might have re listed the debate with the previous discussion included. And I only refactor formatting errors or outright egregious personal attacks with caution. But this is only my behavior, everyone is different. I think perhaps the perception is different from the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">intent</a> intent in this case. Perhaps we chock this one up to good experience and move on? I would suggest caution in the future. I would also suggest Jeff recuse from this AFD, ultimately it is Jeffs call as far as recuse.

<li>My two cents is this. Because this thing has been so mucked up, there seems to be only one fair thing to do: Leave the page up, for say, two months. Give time for data to be reassembled, rephrased, etc. Then, when everone is cooler, submit it for a final AfD. I have not been able to work on the page since J protected it. I have had no fair chance to make it better and neither has anyone else. Both AfDs are totally tainted, for different reasons. To delete now only gives in to the vandals. Proving that they can force a page down through manipulation. That's all I can think of, but I am very new to all this and will accept whatever the experienced admins think is appropriate. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainbarrett_48a2.html" title="User:Captainbarrett">Captain Barrett</a> 00:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you very, very much. I am not adverse to this idea and since it has still not been explained to me exactly why I cannot post the picture, I can live with re-writing the article to attempt to better meet AfD standards for inclusion (I say better because I have already explained in multiple places why this article _already_ meets the standards). However the procedural damage is already done. No amount of work that I do now will change all the "Delete" votes that were put on the 2nd (and current) AfD due largely (my opinion) to the machinations of Jeffrey. It is too late to get objective opinions. I can try my best to fix it up, but it goes without saying that Jeffrey should recuse himself. It should be obvious to anyone fallowing all this that he has taken a deep and <i>personal</i> interest in this AfD, for reasons unknown. As a side note, Jeffrey is the only one here who has brought up conspiracy. I just provided a link to a former editor who was doing research in that area regarding Jeffrey.

<p>Uh, you did nothing wrong, Coredesat, because it was a valid AfD with overwhelming community consensus to delete based on actual honest to goodness policy (which is painfully clear to see). Despite days of being told the references were decidedly shoddy by <i>everyone</i>, the editor refused to modify them, and he only wanted unprotection to add repeatedly deleted/reverted images of questionable copyright. There was absolutely nothing he could have written to establish notability of an individual for which he refused to provide third party evidence. And the average person could see from a casual google search of less than 500 hits that it wasn't an issue of writabilty but blatant notability. The editor has been repeatedly told about our policies for inclusion, and instead of respecting our community norms, or listening to almost every single editor he has encountered including multiple admins, he actually suggests that instead of following basic established policy, we just ignore the AfD and just leave the page up for a month or two. There is a point where we assume good faith and help the noob and there is a point where we see them for trolling and soapboxing. This was never about contributing to our project but about spouting some cult weirdo soapboxing crap about an individual that may never have existed and yelling on the top of their lungs when we caught it. --Jeffrey O.

<dd>He's just come off a 31 hour block and immediately continues as before? He has a history of incivility, 3RR and blocks? Why has no-one suggested indefing?

<dd>I actually suggested indef during the last report on his behaviour, and I still support it he has never shown any signs of reforming.

<dd>I just checked his contribs and Fys was making abusive edit summaries even back <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060927151038&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Fys" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060927151038&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Fys" rel="nofollow">when he was an admin</a>. Which was six months ago.

<dd>Which abuse might that be? Prior to the ArbCom case that saw him de-admined the only thing I recall of any "disruption" on his part was a long running edit war with the then disruptive user Irishpunktom (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Irishpunktom_0394.html" title="Special:Contributions/Irishpunktom"><span title="Contributions: Irishpunktom">contribs</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Irishpunktom" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Irishpunktom" rel="nofollow"><span title="Page moves: Irishpunktom"><font color="#002BB8">page&#160;moves</font></span></a> • <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Irishpunktom_baf8.html" title="Special:Blockip/Irishpunktom"><span title="Block User:Irishpunktom">block&#160;user</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" rel="nofollow"><span title="Blocklog: Irishpunktom"><font color="#002BB8">block&#160;log</font></span></a> <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Irishpunktom_e1e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Irishpunktom">• rfcu</a></span>) on the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Tatchell_6e4b.html" title="Peter Tatchell">Peter Tatchell</a> article. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott"><span title="Leave me a message.">→</span></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey" title="Go to my userpage.">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 22:03, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe, maybe not. Whatever caused the problem, Fys' current behaviour is aggressive, rude, obnoxious and disruptive. He also appears to blame all his ills on other people. It is not impossible that the root cause is some off-wiki harassment, given the change of username and his sensitivity about this (which I didn't appreciate back in December). But his editing style, settled since his dispute with Irishpunktom, needs to change - and soon. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Out of sequence point but all those diffs you cite Dev are all from the time the Arb case was being decided and I was decidedly annoyed by the whole thing.</p>
<p>I did not call DWaterson a "drunken child", and the "patronising tone" to which he refers was not intended as such. I am sure he and I will agree soon, and that's what it meant, I'm sorry if he took it in any other way. But if what I've posted today is really personal attack material then it is at the very lower end, and I hope it is noted that I am often the target for personal attacks. New user nss.. put one of my articles up for deletion and systematically reverted my edits. Whatever. I will take this weekend off (blocked or not, although I hope not). But I do expect that people will play fair with me. <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Fys</a>. “<a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Ta</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fys_a016.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fys">fys</a> <a href="../../../f/y/s/User_talk%7EFys_d202.html" title="User talk:Fys">aym</a>”. 22:38, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I put plenty of people's articles up for deletion, please don't feel you were special. I'm not sure why you're still bringing it up, a week later either.

<dd>Fys, I don't care about your block log, other people can deal with that. But it seems very obvious your politeness took a nosedive around the Arbcom and never came back.

<dd>Your recent history doesn't speak very well of you. You have never really showed any signs of changing either. However, if you are now accepting that some of your behaviour comes across as very hostile (due to the weight of the critiscism directed towards you at times and the frequency with which your actions appear here) and are willing to change then I offer myself as a "mentor" for such change. I am willing to deal directly with any complaints about your behaviour in an impartial manner, while at the same time keeping track of your edits to point out if there is anything I see that I feel is a violation of any wikipedia policies and guidleines, notifying you of them (and you in turn, once notified make an effort to make up with it, be it apologising or anything else). I will also, assuming you accept this offer, vow not to block you for any of the behaviour I notice while being your mentor accept in case I consider extreme. In borderline case I will report here for the opinion of other admins. That way you can be assured I am not doing this to make your life hell.

<dd>Fys is a very valuable contributor and a bright chap, who knows precisely when he is and isn't being civil. I'm not sure he needs a mentor, as such, just to bite his tongue occasionally. It would be great if Fys could be more like that Dbiv guy. He was nice.
