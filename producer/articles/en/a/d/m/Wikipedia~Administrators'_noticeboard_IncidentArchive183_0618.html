<dd>Right, but we're currently discussing the validity of those cites, such as citing Uncyclopedia's "content-free" article as evidence of it being such, when it clearly says so on the Main Page; a link to an unhelpful Uncyclopedia page is not a good cite.

<p>So, does the 3RR apply to blind reverts via popups or rollback? I just got another revert via popup with no edit summary. I think it's stupid that the only one of the four of us reverting who has managed to use the talk page and use edit summaries would be blocked for 3RR for re-reverting. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Milto LOL pia</a> 03:17, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This seems to be at odds with your normal approach of asking us all to AGF with regard to editors like Ilena? Have you seen the attack page on ED? I'm not defending hipocrites actions, his blunt swearing is definitely a problem, he is too easily baited and i think he also admits this. Where i draw the line is your comment " <i>it would be pretty damn helpful to the Wiki to block and ignore a disruptive editor</i>" since he is a lot more produtive than other editors whom you give a long leash of good faith. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 19:26, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well it's funny you call him productive, since you're the first person I know that has used the words productive in the same sentence as his name. If we're dealing with attack blogs, it's worth mentioning that I have at least fifty attack blogs you there solely dedicated to attacking my person, and you don't see me getting angry about it (actually, I find how much of a limb these guys go out on most of the time quite funny). For a long time now Hipocrite's been testing the community's patience, much longer than Ilena, and my patience with him is simply worn threadbare. I think, given how I have been with Ilena and others in the past and currently, it would speak somewhat for how much of a problem this is, or at least how much of a problem I think it is.

<dd>I have had my fair share of disagreements with hipocrite but i defend that he is productive. If you really need diff's to back this up I'll start digging but i don't think it is necessary. Note, i'm not defending his behaviour, rather his productivity. Hopefully these issues will resolve themselves such that the antagonists here can avoid each other.

<dd>You seemed to conjecture that a single attack page justified his behaviour. If that were the case, I have fifty odd attack blogs that I'm sure would amount to one heck of a justified rampage&#160;:) Really though, off-wiki stuff stays off-wiki.

<li>I've always found Jeff and Hipocrite useful, thoughtful contributors who want the best for Wikipedia so I'm troubled by this thread.

<dd>That's sort of the least of the verbal abuse he generally offers. He seems much more interested in just stirring up unpleasantry than really contributing. To be fair, I stir up a fair bit myself, but it's generally because of the controversial nature of my edits or people's unwillingness to put aside melodramatic prejudice, not because I hang around Wikipedia calling people names. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Milto LOL pia</a> 15:42, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>(edit conflict) I've asked TBSDY to stop the vote-stacking. On the other hand, for Nick to continue reverting it wouldn't make very much sense either, because the users in question will get the message anyway, it can't be undone (they'll all get the "you have new messages" and will find the message in the history, no matter whether it's been deleted from the page).

<p>The reason this whole situation has come about is because the previous AFD, which was to keep and move to the Wikipedia namespace, was not honoured. I realise this was done in good faith, but do you know how completely annoying and upsetting it is to have a clear consensus, with many <i>many</i> editors wanting to keep the article, then have someone else come in and try to get the blasted article deleted again? Really, this is deletion through attrition. Surely that's not fair to those who supported keeping the article? - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 11:39, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may or may not be fair. But that is no excuse to canvass for votes, and then revert-war when told that such canvassing was not acceptable. The correct thing would have been to leave your keep vote on the voting page and let others discover the page for themselves. When you say "Actually, I care very little. After the whole GNAA debacle, I see how very easy it is to bypass AFD", it makes it difficult to AGF. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 11:53, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nope, I won't. Like I say, please take me to ArbCom. At least one other editor is upset with the fact that the deletion camp decided not to listen to them and is trying to make this deletion through attrition. This MFD should never have occured, as I quite appropriately and properly put it to AFD at least once, and since then nothing has changed.

I don't recall participating in any AfD - I saw the Mfd and expressed my opinions. You then took it on yourself to badger me, accuse me of 'bandying around' policy, and then spilled it onto my talk page when you didn't like my views.

<dd>Oh yes? And if I had not been monitoring the article, then I would not have been made aware that it was up for deletion <i>again</i>. Sound fair to you? Then I would also not have participated, and possibly it might have been deleted. I'll tell you what, let's hypothetically say that there is an article I don't like (let's say <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_views_of_women.html" title="Christian views of women">Christian views of women</a>). Why don't I try to get it to AFD every 6 months or so. Eventually, I may just get it deleted. Sound like a fair thing to you?

<dd>If you think a deletion nomination is inopportune, then you call for a 'speedy close' - if others agree with you, then that's generally what happens.

<dd>Incidently, as for badgering you, sorry if you took it that way. My question on your talk page was genuine one - after all, you take one position, but Wikipedia has many areas that are in opposition to this. I should also note that you wish to make a policy that was rejected an actual policy! Good lord! Is it any wonder I feel the way I do? (for those who don't believe me, please see the following "Sure, many people here, on this page, have concerns (some legitimate). Others have opposed it outright. Perhaps we can't generate a consensus here to tag this as policy. I don't actually care. However countless times MfD DRV etc. have in fact accepted the arguments and deleted stuff. So, that's very generally Wikipedia practice, and if it remains so we can maybe write up the policy at a future date when it is less contentious (or again, maybe not)." <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a>). Sheesh. I find the whole idea of pushing policy through via attrition (as this is what it seems to me that you are trying to do) to be a less than honourable thing to do. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 12:22, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Attrition? No. Wikipedian policy is formed by practice and consensus not be legislation. Just as making <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> a guideline wouldn't force anyone to feel bound by it in their contributions to deletion discussions, so tagging it as rejected, doesn't mean people can't take the view that it is good practice. We settle that in debates. The fact is that in many deletion debates (involving far more people than those arguing on the WP:DENY talk page) the community has bought the arguments rehearsed on that page. We have reached various deletion consensuses on that basis. We've also not deleted other stuff where the 'hey this is actually useful for fighting vandalism' case has been made and accepted. We will continue to have these debates, and we will continue to reach a mind on a case-by-case basis. Maybe the consenses will go one way, maybe over time you'll be able to convince people otherwise. That's really th onyl way of doing it. Unless we start saying "hey you can't vote that way, that is/isn't an accepted/rejected guideline.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 13:36, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, it is quite legitimate to point out to those participating in the debate that an AfD has occurred.

<dd>Beacause it is a discussion, not a vote. It is perfectly acceptable to point out that a good proposal has been made. Personally, I feel that once my proposal had been made, the best thing to do was to relist it and start the debate again. Explicitly reframe the debate to find out who supports the idea of a merge. Put a merge tag on the article, get people talking about that. Then carry out whatever consensus emerges. Incidentially, you do realise that the result of <b>merge</b> means that it is effectively <b>kept</b> until the merge is performed. In this case, if you keep quiet, it is entirely possible that nothing will get done. But I think I'll go and replace the MfD tag with a merge tag. Possibly the material is not even <i>wanted</i> over at the other pages, so an exact merge location still needs to be sorted out. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:08, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You must be joking. So what you are saying, is that we must sneak around behind people's backs and <i>pretend</i> that we should merge the page, but in all likelihood we won't. <i>Riiiiight</i>. Seems disingenious to me! Then, on top of this, the other articles might not even want the merged material, so they won't accept it. They revert out the material, and then we have now changed this from a <b>merge</b> to a <b>delete</b>.

<dd>I was suggesting you might have chosen that course of action. I'm impressed you didn't, but are still fighting your corner. I've lost count of the number of times, after a <b>merge</b> result, people drifted away from an XfD and lost interest. Let's just have the merge discussion and see what happens.

<p>This seems to be more about fixing all policies in general rather than just deletion. If there can be this much ambiguity into what a "consensus" is by people who are apparently "trusted" by the community(it's funny how that is always seen as a one way street), perhaps its time to better define what consensus truly "is" and what the roles of administrators and participants are. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_H_c9c6.html" title="User:Just H">Just H</a> 17:59, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I'd like the information back. This is ridiculous. I'd like to continue working on it to make it a much better article. Moreover, you salted this <i>unilaterally</i>. Do you come along after the fact and salt <i>every</i> AfD'ed article? If not, then why <i>this</i> one? Can you point me to the policy that gives you the authority to do what you have done? If not, admit the mistake, undelete it, and let's all move on to actually building an encyclopedia instead of this ridiculous stuff. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 05:19, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I feel this issue is not as cut and dry as either side would make it. Surely a version of an article userified by an admin so a user could improve it is a legitimate practice - many sysops do this as a compromise with CSDs. However, there are of course <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">concerns that we are not a free webost</a>. Some leniency can be given if the user is truly improving an article in such a way, however, I see no great reason for it not to be deleted. However, salting is completely unneccesary and should be undone.

<dd>I do not believe the article will ever be notable or reliably sourced, and I do not believe it should be sitting around here on Wikipedia sponging up our PigeonRank. But as I told you before, CyberAnth, I have a copy of it on my hard drive, and if you request it, I will provide it to you in my userspace for whatever brief window of time it takes for you to copy it onto your hard drive. Then you can play with it all you like and if you ever think it's notable, make a request to an admin for the new version of the article to be created and listed at AFD to see if it survives. Let me know here if you want my copy, or on my talk page if I don't respond here promptly. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 07:55, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An option that is sometimes useful is to copy what you wish to have a copy of onto a subpage in user space; then to <b>blank the page</b> so it is available via history when you want it, but is not subject to critisism such as "sponging up our PigeonRank". Copy then edit so the copy is in history is a general way of saving a copy without it being live. Sometimes useful in article space too. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 15:54, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>After I reverted some of his edits to <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis.html" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>, HalfOfElement29 accused me of incivility in <a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html#User:Akhilleus_gutting_the_article_Atlantis" title="User talk:Dbachmann">a rather bizarre thread</a> on <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a>'s talk page (see also <a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalfOfElement29_a391.html" title="User talk:HalfOfElement29">User talk:HalfOfElement29</a>). Despite several requests HOE29 hasn't explained why he thinks I've been uncivil, and has accused me of being part of "a deliberate attack campaign" against him.</p>
<p>At the risk of justifying HOE29's feelings of persecution, I looked at his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=HalfOfElement29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=HalfOfElement29" rel="nofollow">user contribs</a>.

In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:HalfOfElement29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=56245442" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:HalfOfElement29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=56245442" rel="nofollow">next edit</a>, he blanks his user page, with the summary "protection from the cultists". These edits occur on 31 May 2006; the account then remains inactive until 2 December 2006, after which it's in regular use. Anyone who puts up a list of allegedly-misbehaving editors on their third edit has probably edited under another account. In this case, I think it's the indefinitely blocked user GoodCop.</p>

The similarity of these two lists is pretty conclusive, in my opinion, but it's also worth noting that several of GoodCop's edits exhibit what could be labeled paranoia--<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FSaxifrage&amp;diff=84350752&amp;oldid=84343754" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FSaxifrage&amp;diff=84350752&amp;oldid=84343754" rel="nofollow">this oppose vote</a> on Saxifrage's RFA, for example (and be sure to look at the discussion that kicks off), and two posts to WP:ANI (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86717992" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86717992" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=87102194&amp;oldid=87100369" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=87102194&amp;oldid=87100369" rel="nofollow">here</a>). The misguided accusations of incivility in those posts seem similar to HOE29's present accusations of incivility (though at least in his ANI posts GoodCop was specific about what he thought the offenders had done wrong). In addition, GoodCop and HOE29 edit similar articles--they have a common interest in genetics and race, editing <a href="../../../h/a/p/Haplogroup.html" title="Haplogroup">Haplogroup</a> and related articles, and both have edited <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a>.</p>

<li>I concur that HalfOfElement29 is a sock of GoodCop. Similar styles, similar interest in fringe archeology topics and the article <a href="../../../h/a/p/Haplogroup.html" title="Haplogroup">haplogroup</a>. BTW, element 29 is copper.

However, I'm not entirely thrilled with the manner in which he was indef-blocked in the first place. The edit cited in his block log <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=87102194&amp;oldid=87100369" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=87102194&amp;oldid=87100369" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> is acting out by someone who was blocked a day earlier for personal attacks, but not as bad as some others have made.

The first comment to Element's talk page was pretty hostile too, "<i>I don't know who you think you are, but you obviously don't have the knowledge necessary to be making edits to this sort of page on Wikipedia.</i>" Perhaps Element would like to revise his answer above, accept some responsibilty for incivility, and consider changing his approach to other editors in return for a one-time-only <i>get out of jail free card.</i> <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:24, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I know the person who editted as GoodCop. He was the person that introduced me to editting wikipedia. I am not him, however.</p>
<p>You who are reading this board should know that the reason that Akhilleus is making this attack is because he deleted some very informative additions that I made to the article Atlantis, under false pretenses. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantis&amp;diff=100129799&amp;oldid=100129262" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantis&amp;diff=100129799&amp;oldid=100129262" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantis&amp;diff=100380322&amp;oldid=100379406" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantis&amp;diff=100380322&amp;oldid=100379406" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantis&amp;diff=100391131&amp;oldid=100386245" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantis&amp;diff=100391131&amp;oldid=100386245" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> Later, I notified <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> that Akhilleus was removing large amounts of information from the article Atlantis, often under false pretenses. Unfortunately I did not know at the time that Dbachmann and Akhilleus were associates, though Dbachmann, unlike Akhilleus, has not yet made any clear and significant policy violations. Akhilleus was evidently inflamed by the fact that I had exposed his actions (especially his use of false pretenses when editting), albeit to a person that would not stop them. He then initiated this revenge attack campaign against me. I saw through his deceptions, and did so in a fully civil and non-personal manner (at <a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">User talk:Dbachmann</a> and then later at <a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalfOfElement29_a391.html" title="User talk:HalfOfElement29">User talk:HalfOfElement29</a>), which made him even madder, such that he escalated his attack by searching through my edit history for 'dirt' that he could get on me. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dbachmann&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=102375324" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dbachmann&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=102375324" rel="nofollow">[57]</a> I pointed out his attack campaign on <a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">User talk:Dbachmann</a>, and continued to point out his persistent deceptions, which made him escalate his attacks further (i.e. making this WP:ANI post, an underhanded attempt to get me banned indefinitely because I had exposed his deceptive tactics). Said attack campaign is an <i>extreme</i> violation of Wikipedia:Civility, not to mention WP:NPA, and is worthy of whatever administrative measures are used in response to such offenses. Well, now you know what's going on.</p>
<p>As long as Akhilleus has drawn attention to this matter, I ask that all of you look at his edits to the article <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis.html" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>, and especially those in which he deletes the content that I added. Since Akhilleus is evidently not confident that the community will support his edits, I also do not think that it will. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalfOfElement29_bbac.html" title="User:HalfOfElement29">HalfOfElement29</a> 03:16, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This "consensus" seems to consist of nothing but Elmer Clark's diktat. He has decided that one version of events will be published on WP, and all reference to any other view, even merely as an external link, will be suppressed. It seems to me that he is the one on the soapbox here. The fact that he would suspect me of being a sock puppet for another user, and would articulate such a suspicion without providing <i>any</i> basis for it, speaks volumes. I continue to maintain that the view expressed at the referenced web site is interesting and relevant, and for all either I or Elmer Clark know it may be true. AFAIK neither of us has any particular expertise in the matter, but he has chosen to champion one view to the utter exclusion of all others, and doesn't see the need to provide any basis for this choice. I will not submit blindly to his orders. He doesn't own WP or the page in question, and my right to edit it in good faith is the same as his. So unless and until I am convinced that the links don't belong on the page, I will continue to keep them there. <a href="../../../z/s/e/User%7EZsero_14cb.html" title="User:Zsero">Zsero</a> 16:40, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a gross misrepresentation. The matter hasn't even been discussed, let alone decided on. The debate on the talk page was about Webville's long, rambling, and nearly incomprehensible additions about the Yad Vashem letter. Most of the (alleged) facts he wanted brought out were already in the article, and the text he kept posting added almost nothing of substance; it consisted mainly of argument and opinion rather than factual claims, and in any case devoted far too much space to a relatively minor episode. I had no particular dog in that fight, so I stayed out of it and let Elmer Clark argue with him. But somewhere in there, the external link to his site, which he did <i>not</i> add, disappeared, without any discussion whatsoever. I recently noticed that it was gone, and from way too much of Webville's position we had gone to no mention of it at all. So I added it back in, together with another link to the Yale Daily News that had also disappeared.</dd>
<dd>I repeat, there was no discussion of suppressing all mention of an alternative point of view. The article as it stands now reads like a hagiography to St Hiram, with plenty of unsourced facts, and Elmer Clark seems to think that that's how it ought to be, because there's supposedly some sort of "historical consensus" (among whom?) that that's how it was. Well, I disagree. Isurvived.org presents a different version of the facts, one that as far as I know has not been addressed, let alone refuted. I'd be justified in adding a short summary of that version to the article itself, since the site is not really that much less reliable than the sources for the version that's in the article. But rather than do that, I merely posted an external link, which the reader can follow and decide for herself how much credence to give it.</dd>
<dd>Elmer Clark wants the reader not to even know that another view exists, but he has not advanced <i>any</i> arguments why that should be so. His argument against Isurvived.com is entirely ad hominem. And that's not acceptable on WP.</dd>
<dd>When you add in his entirely unjustified leap to the conclusion that I am the same person as Webville, and the fact that he jumped straight from a post on my talk page to bringing the matter here, a picture begins to emerge that should shed some light on the dispute.</dd>

<dd>Ok, I think I understand your argument better now, and I suppose I was a little "trigger-happy" here. The debacle with User:Webville has left me rather suspicious of the "anti-Bingham" camp and I think it may have biased my actions somewhat. I believe your point is reasonable, and I apologize for not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> to the extent I should have. However, I still feel the link should not be present in the article, and I think I'll open up a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">request for comment</a> later tonight or tomorrow. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 03:59, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS but what he did is only "blanking" in a special sense.

<dd>Being a Bangladeshi, I'm generally not too sympathetic towards Pakistan and people with strong emotional/nationalistic ties to that country. However even I can see this editor had a genuine point which isn't irrational, that being that the histories of Pakistan shouldn't be categorized under "History of India" simply because the British called the land mass that is now Pakistan "India". I wouldn't have enjoyed seeing anyone take bits and pieces of ancient Bangladeshi history and assign it to India either. Whether other editors, including this administrator, agrees or disagrees with that point, the alleged violator's view isn't devoid of merit, and therefore his emphasis on that argument cannot be labeled 'disruption'. His tone has been less than optimal in his responses to fellow editors, but nothing that exceeds the limits of civil discourse. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinaretDk_1e87.html" title="User:MinaretDk">MinaretDk</a> 19:36, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>His POV and involvement in some content disputes are not the reason why he's blocked - everyone, including me have their strong/weak POVs and nobody is blocked for that. It is also not for me to judge if his POVs are "devoid of merit" or not. It is his personal conduct, which is the reason for the block. Our respective nationalities, religions, etc. are also not the topic of this debate (nor should they ever be). <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>Rama's arrow (3:16)</b></font></a> 19:46, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And yet your list of content justifying your 1 week block includes his arguments grounded in content disagreement and not much else. Take his "160 million people denied their history" statement. You listed that here. That statement is his POV on an issue. There is no violation of civility or personal attack in that statement, only his POV, which I'd say is a pretty well-reasoned one. Why is it here? You listed WP:NPA as a policy relevant here, yet I've seen no statement from him saying in effect "you are Indian and so your point is invalid", which is the line of argument WP:NPA was referring to. He was alleging that pro-Indian groups have been trolling on some page, and we all know such organized groups, aside from his Indians, pushing a POV happens all the time. Pointing that out can't be an offense. There's a difference between making the allegation that a line of behavior is driven by national identity, and presuming that because one is of a nationality that their contributions should be ignored. Should nationalism ever be brought into a discussion? Some Pakistani editors push pro-pakistani POV, Indians push pro-Indians, Bangladeshis push pro Bangladeshi and so on, sometimes without regard for accuracy or factuality. When bias is evident, should we pretend not to see it? I think WP:NPA is being misunderstood in this regard. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinaretDk_1e87.html" title="User:MinaretDk">MinaretDk</a> 20:37, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It may be true that you were commenting in context of your activities on PakHub.info, but the problem is that your comments regarding whatever is going on on PakHub are strikingly similar to your statements regarding Indians ripping off Pakistani history here. You have made these kind of comments on multiple occasions at different talkpages. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>Rama's arrow (3:16)</b></font></a> 22:41, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>To add, this correlation opens the question if you realize that Wikipedia is purely an encyclopedia and that you cannot carry your agenda/activity going on at PakHub into Wikipedia.

<dd>Its pretty clear now that Arrow is addressing his disagreement over content/view with a block. Too many of the diffs cited are not issues of civility or rule breaking, but opinion on the topic. All Wikipedians bring in their experiences from outside while editing, be it from professional lives, personal interests, etc. None of this warrants a block, much less one as long as a week. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinaretDk_1e87.html" title="User:MinaretDk">MinaretDk</a> 01:52, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having taken a brief look at Unre4L's contributions, I think a block may serve as a cooling off period. He seems to feel quite strongly about the issues, and perhaps that has gone into his comments. Of course, I don't have a good idea about the disputed points, but perhaps an RFC can be started if the dispute is a long-running one.

<dd>I don't know if this is common practice, but I believe it should be. I think it could be very useful in our fight against <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam</a> to clear article histories of spam edits every now and then. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">Bravado</a></sup> 23:25, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is very difficult on articles with very long histories, but not impossible.

<dd>It depends on how many edits have been made to the article, how many of those have been spam, and how they are divided through the history. In the case of Cat:Board games, 56 of about 110 edits were spam or reverts of spam, but they were easily grouped. I think there were only three or four normal contributions in the last 50 edits. And it's easy to select a large number of edits at once using ctrl+shift+click. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">Bravado</a></sup> 23:34, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there a compelling-enough reason that external links should be allowed in edit summaries? I can see why someone might place one there sometimes, but, the potential for heavy spamming through this loophole is, I believe, a serious threat that could require a lot of administrator time that could be better spent on other things. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 01:15, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This bot is malfunctioning. It just reverted an edit I did, when I reverted an article back to a version with the speedy tag, and which happened to contain a blacklisted external link. Dumb that it didn't pick up the link's initial insertion, then to compound the error by reverting my edit? Not a good thing.

The attmept to revive already discarded accusations against me, in itself, is not what prompted me to post here (particularly as most of the users who posted there agreed with me, although I believe repeatedly making such accusations and trying to turn RFI against one user into RFC against another should be criticized), but later Irpen made several remarks that I believe would be of interest to WP:ANI readers. First, he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_investigation&amp;diff=102535979&amp;oldid=102534590" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_investigation&amp;diff=102535979&amp;oldid=102534590" rel="nofollow">stated</a> that such reports as mine against Dr. Dan should be reported on WP:ANI ('ANI is attended by enough editors to make whimsical verdicts less likely'). Therefore I'd like to know if you agree with him - do you think that I should have posted this report here instead on WP:RFI? And what do you think should be the appopriate course of action to take when dealing with user such as Dr. Dan? Second, and more worryingly, he described WP:RFI as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_investigation&amp;diff=102535979&amp;oldid=102534590" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_investigation&amp;diff=102535979&amp;oldid=102534590" rel="nofollow">'kangaroo court'</a> and argued that WP:RFI is as pointless as <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> supposedly was and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_investigation&amp;diff=102297789&amp;oldid=102296853" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_investigation&amp;diff=102297789&amp;oldid=102296853" rel="nofollow">promised to nominate WP:RFI for deletion shortly</a>. As a consequence of his reasoning would be the closure of WP:RFI and increasing of the workload of WP:ANI (as well as mediators and ArbComers), I believe this issue should is of interest to users not interested in the relativly minor 'Piotrus-Irpen-Dr. Dan' case. My personal take on this is that WP:RFI only problem is <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive72_c1b5.html#WP:RFI_backlog" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive72">a slight backlog</a>, and a board where WP:CIV and related policies violations can be reported and quickly dealt with is quite useful, and I believe it is Irpen's behaviour that is disrupting this forum (by overbloating the relativly simple RFI case by trying to turn it into an RFC against another user). But perhaps I am in error here? Your comments - on Dr. Dan behaviour and Irpen arguments against me and WP:RFI - would be appreciated.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 20:12, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Right. I archived it, since the chances of being able to pick anything substantive out of the mess were negligible compared with the likelihood of yet more lunacy. If Irpen and Piotrus start the sniping again, so help me I will block the both of them under the All New "drag them apart and don't care who started it" Policy.

<li>Well, as Dr. Dan has just <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_investigation_Archives_2007_01_9e49.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for investigation/Archives/2007/01">admitted to having violated WP:CIV and promised to behave better</a>, it seems the block had desired effect and the situation may improve, so that angle has ended. However I'd caution you to be more careful with block threats; I don't think either me or Irpen did anything which would desrve block, and trying to end the discussion by saying 'shut up or I'll block you both' is not very constructive.

<dd>It is hard to follow all the places where Piotrus is listing his endless complaints, so I missed this one to reply on time. Anyway, the issue is now moot. JzG deleted that strange RFI request and chastised Piotrus for the very thing I was talking about all along: "Piotrus' habit to attempt winning all sorts of editing disputes with the content opponents through running to various boards to achieve their blocks." If someone is so bored as to study the matter, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_investigation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=102751895" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_investigation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=102751895" rel="nofollow">here</a> is the historic link to the WP:RFI page with all the discussion and diffs. And there is more at JzG's talk.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I am concerned, the issue is closed with the deletion of the bizarre thread from WP:RFI and I am willing to put it to rest unless Piotrus does not turn to another board trying to seek the blocks of his content opponents.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And, yes, WP:RFI should be deleted for the very reason WP:PAIN was deleted. We do not need Wikipedia:Request to block that is in every respect but the name. WP:AIV together with WP:ANI is enough with the WP:RfArb for the especially complex cases that need a thorough study. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 00:44, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I said above, with Dr. Dan's being shown that continued violations of WP:CIV will lead to blocking, him recognizing his mistakes and promising to behave better, the Dr. Dan RFI report is, indeed, closed. I however resent Irpen's accusations that I try to get my opponent's blocked in content disputes. In Dr. Dan case it's pretty apparent as I don't recall we had a content dispute - I encourage his copyediting of content, but I discourage his flaming on talk. I am, however, still offended by Irpen's accusation "Piotrus [has a] habit to attempt winning all sorts of editing disputes with the content opponents through running to various boards to achieve their blocks". To put it simply: as an admin I should not (obviously) block people I find disruptive in articles I edit. That, however, does not mean that I have no right to ask others to review actions of such users. Therefore I believe I have full right to ask others to look at their actions by posting the description of the case on relevant page (which may vary depending on the case and time). Sometimes I may use <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>, in some cases where I believe the user has obviously violated one of our policies whose violations may result in a block, I ask admins on a public forum to consider the case. This is however a last resort, as I try to pursue discussions and reach a compromise on relevant talk pages and usually suceed, however every few months I stumble upon an exceptionaly stubborn user who refuses to stop behaviour I find disruptive; I see no reason why I as an admin should be unable to do what any other user can do (ask admins to investigate the issue). Summarizing, I see nothing wrong with my actions, and I again ask Irpen to apologize for his bad faithed accusations against me.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 01:02, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not going to continue this endless bickering. I provided diffs that prove that Piotrus turns to seeking blocks of his opponents and they are avalable in the RFI history. Facts speak louder than words no matter how many times one repeats the same denial.</dd>

<dd>I am to withdraw from this thread and do some article writing for a change, which I recommend to Piotrus as well.

<dd>I think we are going to see more and more new accounts like this, and it's not a bad thing--it's just a stage in the evolution of the project. Several years ago, a newcomer found 1) there were lots of articles still needing to be written, and 2) there was much less vandalism overall. Now a newcomer arrives and wonders what to do to help out the project, and finds that all the sexy articles are written, and improvements to existing articles require sources and citations and often involve collisions with entrenched editors ... but look at all the vandalism to fix, trolls to warn, newcomers to welcome, and look at all the cool tools we now have to do it! I think this accounts for a lot of the change we have been seeing in new account behavior. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 16:22, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, I don't think so. There's a talk comment on Ryoung's talk from Xoloz back in November of last year. That would have been before anyone knew about the wiki spanning, I believe. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 15:09, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dunno. From his contribution list, it looks like he went to the current sig more than a year ago. Could just be an error on his part, I guess, though it seems unlikely that it'd go undetected for so long. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 17:25, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see you have also restored the warning multiple times.

The user can remove what he likes from his page.
