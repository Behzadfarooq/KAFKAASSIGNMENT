<dd>It adds a link to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> so that offenders know that there is a record and report of their activity. Less-persistant vandals (such as ten year olds adding the phrase "Joe Smith smells like 3 day old diapers" to the NATO article, may stop at the suggestion that admins are watching them and aware of their activity. Also, Many other templates are in the form of "Stop... or I'll say stop again." By using this template, non-admins can state that the offending user has been warned several times and now reported as a final resort. As far as spelling error... Where? I can be wordy myself so I understand what you're saying.&#160;:) Thanks for your input <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianZ_175b.html" title="User:BrianZ"><font color="teal">BrianZ</font></a><font color="gray"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrianZ_5d3d.html" title="User talk:BrianZ"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:14, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</font></dd>

<p>Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I've never been a big fan of linking vandals to AIV. Most probably don't know it exists, and telling them, "You've been reported <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">here!</a>" might be a form of <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>. I think getting in the practice of linking vandals here would increase the number of times vandals try to remove their own entry or blank the entire page or who knows what. Anybody else agree, or am I just being too cautious? (<b>P.S.</b>- On these same lines, though, I wouldn't be opposed to saying, <b>You have been reported to an administrator, who will review your edits shortly.</b> without the link.) <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_debe.html" title="User:EWS23"><font color="green"><b>EWS23</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../e/w/s/User_talk%7EEWS23_56e9.html" title="User talk:EWS23">Leave me a message!</a>) 19:42, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've made changes like you requested, as after hearing your POV I agree with you 100% EWS23. Please see changed template above. The warning itself still let's the offender know that they have been reported to administration and blocking is most likely inevitable yet it's not in a threatening tone. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianZ_175b.html" title="User:BrianZ"><font color="teal">Brian</font><font color="gray">Z</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrianZ_5d3d.html" title="User talk:BrianZ"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:58, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This template seems sorta usless to me...This thing seems like an inbetween for test4 and test5, which is pretty pointless to me. <a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude">KojiDude</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude">talk</a>) 20:16, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've never thought that test4 and test5 were something a regular editor without admin permissions should use. They basically say, "Stop, or you might get blocked if an admin notices your vandalism." (Unless I'm wrong and they are added to a category that admins regularly check). This template tells the vandal that administration has been notified of their behavior directly. If I'm wrong and test4 and test5 do add a user to a list patrolled by admins than I agree, this template wouldn't be needed.

<dd>A vote isn't really appropriate. If you want consensus, you have to convince others that the template is good, or be convinced that it isn't, not take down numbers. Do you think that the current templates, specifically the ones with the stop hand that say it is your "last warning" and you <i>will</i> be blocked for vandalism, are ineffective? I don't think that a vandal should at all be notified of this page, or given any sort of peek at how Wikipedia works to stop vandalism. If this vandalism will encourage vandals to come to this page and remove vandalism warnings, of it will be a sort of <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>, that leads them to realize they could mess up Wikipedia even more than just adding obscene words, that escalates the problem from what might just a be a kid who will stop given {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}} and someone who realizes they could have even more "fun" by messing up administrative noticeboards, etc. All the vandal needs to know is that he will be blocked if he continues. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 07:09, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you Centrx, It's the reason I changed the template. It no longer points users to WP:AIV because it has already been said that leading vandals here is inapproriate. I feel that the template is neccessary for non-admins, because we can't be sure that they'll be blocked when we place a warning on their talk page. I've been away from Wikipedia for the weekend and thought about this alot and now have a fresh look at this discussion, I'm even more convinced the template should be used and since improvements have been made based on everyone's concerns, I would consider this voting/consensus a success. I do feel I did the right thing, and I will continue to ask for peer advice before adding templates to Wiki community pages. Solution: I'll add the template to my userspace and use it myself and if others would like to use it, they can find out where it is. I will not add it to the Template Messages page though. Maybe someone, who is more qualified then myself, will in the future. Thanks for all your valued input, each one of you should receive a wikithanks and I would if I had more time.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianZ_175b.html" title="User:BrianZ"><font color="teal">Brian</font><font color="gray">Z</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrianZ_5d3d.html" title="User talk:BrianZ"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:35, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Warning process</span></h2>
<p>This is at least partly beyond the scope of this page; so may maybe this is not the right forum. If that’s the case, where should I go? I can’t figure out the warning process. Specific issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I discover that someone has vandalized three pages at once, is it legitimate to issue {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest2_cdb7.html" title="Template:Test2">test2</a>}}, and {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest3_288f.html" title="Template:Test3">test3</a>}} at the same time? Or does there have to be separate vandalism after each warning to justify the next?</li>
<li>The instruction says, “Do not list here if … The vandal has not received the full range of test warnings recently (i.e., within the previous week).” Does that statement imply that if someone vandalizes regularly twice a week, he should never be reported?</li>
<li>I can’t find anywhere that it explains the standard for issuing {{<a href="../../../b/l/a/Template%7EBlatantvandal_5997.html" title="Template:Blatantvandal">blatantvandal</a>}}? Do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=69638295" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=69638295" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marie_Curie&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=69641193" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marie_Curie&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=69641193" rel="nofollow">this</a> qualify? --<a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a> 07:32, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Typically, one doesn't issue multiple test templates at the same time. They're issued seperately because it gives the user time to read it. If they don't correct their behaviour, you issue the next one. etc. As for the blatentvandal template, the talk page is the closest thing to a standard, and says: "<i>This is intended for use where vandalism is extreme or obscene and not for newby tests and general silliness.</i>". For <i>incredibly</i> extreme cases, {{test4im}} can also be issued. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> |</dd>
<dd>If your repeat user is stopping just short of a test4, then coming back a week later to continue, I'd issue a bv or, if it's repeatedly repeated, test4im. If <i>all</i> of their edits seem to be vandalism and they're repeatedly leaving at test4s, I would at least try to report it here. IP addresses are a different issue, though, because multiple people may share the same one. It really depends on the specifics of the situation. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 08:03, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is an annon account, but given the edit histories it actually appears to be a single student within the school. <i>Almost</i> every edit in recent times has consisted of two or three edits to the same article, generally to insert sophmoric scatalogical comments. Several admins have applied blocks, including myself, but a new graphitti run starts as soon as it wears off.</p>
<p>Is this an example of an account that could safely be blocked long-term (ie, until school ends in June) <i>for annon users only</i>? If a user logs into the account, will they be directed somewhere where they will <b>clearly</b> see what has happened, and what to do about it? I'd hate to end up blocking an innocent user who can't even figure out what's going on.</p>

<dd>Hmmm. This is a tough one. Historically, we really don't like applying blocks of more than hours to IP addresses for fear of collateral damage (the first experience of a new Wikipedia users should not be to click edit and get a "you can't edit" message, after all). So I'd be fearful of imposing a block of any appreciable length on an IP.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, that isn't to say I haven't done so in the past. If the IP in question is clearly only one editor (and I don't mean "mostly" or "mainly", I mean "only") then a block of length is not inappropriate, especially if accompanied by a request to contact Wikimedia or the blocking admin directly for confirmation. If the IP is regularly, but not exclusively, used for wide-ranging vandalism, then an anon-only block of median length can be justified, but is likely to be overturned should any legit user complain. If the IP is producing legal or death threats, or targeting a single user with hate speech or personal attacks, then I would block but watchlist the talk page in case of an appeal - and request that the IT administrator at the IP contact me or the Foundation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose it comes down to individual judgment in the end. Suffice to say it's a subject were we <b>do</b> block anon shared IP addresses for long terms, but really wish we didn't. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 22:18, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've seen a lot of people leaving a single {{<a href="../../../b/v/_/Template%7EBv_74e1.html" title="Template:Bv">bv</a>}} on a talk page and treating it as the final warning. I can see that this would be a correct response in some situations, but giving only one warning for all instances seems a bit harsh. Personally, I'll start with {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest1_2f2b.html" title="Template:Test1">test1</a>}} for most cases, or {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest2_cdb7.html" title="Template:Test2">test2</a>}} for obvious vandalism, and continue to rewarn as necessary.

<dd>To report, it is needed a test4 or a bv tag. I believe I have used the blatant tag only two or three times, most times preferring to use the test ones.

<dd>{{<a href="../../../b/v/_/Template%7EBv_74e1.html" title="Template:Bv">bv</a>}} certainly has its uses, I've used it in place of a block that would have been warranted as disruption withough warning, then watched the contribs. About half those times the next edit ends up being vandalism/personal attack/etc, resulting in a block anyway. It is certainly not for use in all situations though. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 03:17, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of all our misused tags, BV is probably the most misused, albeit for the noblest of reasons: it seems most often used by new users just discovering vandalhunting and thus fired up about the subject, or by new and established users when an article on their watchlist has been hit (especially if they created or greatly expanded that article). I've always been reluctant to use it as the vast, <i>vast</i> majority of vandalism is actually people testing, even if they test by adding "OMG! IVE HACKKD WICKEDPEDIO! JIM IS GAY!".</dd>
<dd>Honestly, we should be more easy going about testing - the wiki idea is a startling and strange one to most new users and the very idea of opening a page, changing it and saving it just sounds mentalist to most of them. BV really only applies to vandals who are plainly editing with knowledge of Wikipedia already (eg sockmeat) or have no hope of redemption - and the latter category should be judged very conservatively because the consequences of being wrong are profound.</dd>
<dd>Nevertheless, when correctly used, BV is <b>very</b> effective - either the vandal stops or is blocked. Easy. But, right or wrong, we don't have a zero-tolerance policy to simple vandalism because it would hoover up too many non-vandals who will be the next generation of editors. In that, xaosflux is right to be cautious of the use of it and Isopropyl and ReyBrujo are both right to remind us that we damage a very useful tool by over-using it. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 22:04, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I tend to use BV frequently for a vandal who has vandalized a number of articles, but who was not caught or warned while they were still likely online. Example, I'll be checking my watchlist with VP and find some vandalism that occurred hours prior. Before clicking on Rollback, I'll check their contribs and see that they edited a number of articles and are still on "top" of each. I'll revert all of them and then leave them a BV. I also like to use it for "sneaky vandals", who purposely change facts in articles (more than twice), especially numbers, which are often not noticed by other people. Finally, I will occasionally use a BV, in cases of strong sexual vandalism or some "Colbert" vandalism, but usually if they have already received at least one test prior to that. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 01:55, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not an admin but I keep a lookout for vandalism, and I use BV first either for vandalism-only accts that have had a bunch of vandalism edits within a short period of time without being warned, and for <i>aggressive</i> blanking/vandalism. Just because it's obvious vandalism doesn't mean I BV, but things like blanking with 'Die, Wikipedia f***tards, I'M CUMMING TO YOUR HOUSE' etc get a BV from me. I used to use BV more when I started, mostly because I didn't <i>know</i> any of the other tags, lol. Also because of the rule about not blocking without a BV warning. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 10:20, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also not an admin, my personal philosophy (I try to stick by - sometimes when doing mass rv I jump too soon) is that BV should be used for - well, blatant vandalism. Something that is long and thought out. Simply adding 'Woooo, I can edit here?!' should get a test. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elton_John&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78286951" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elton_John&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78286951" rel="nofollow">This</a> got a BV - it would have taken the person who did it time and effort to change that much that carefully, and could not have been done with good faith. It's a very useful tag, and in the example above allowed that user to be blocked with rapidity when they continued. --<a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_807a.html" title="User:Mnemeson">Mnem</a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_Esperanza_c3bd.html" title="User:Mnemeson/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User_talk%7EMnemeson_24d9.html" title="User talk:Mnemeson">son</a> 10:27, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. When a vandalism was done in 3.2 seconds, shoot a test. But when it's been carefully put out, and really thinked... and REALLY intentional in bad faith, BV. I personally give a pretty decent number of BV's because for me... blatant vandal is for recurrent vandals and obvious vandalism (like : Terry Dick has, obviously, a big dick). Tests tags are really for TESTS.

<dd>Yup, the incident I mentioned was a bit different. The user made a nonsense edit. The edit was reverted &amp; he was warned. He promptly deleted the warning, so I reverted the deletion &amp; sent him a new warning to not remove talk page warnings. He did some quick reading about <b>archiving</b> and selectively archived all warnings and other critical comments -- but neglected to add a link to the archive page, effectively hiding it. I advised him that this was contrary to the spirit of the rules, and he demonstrated a masterful command of wikilawyering, demanding that I point out specifically where in the rules it said he had to maintain a permanent link. At that point, I decided I had better things to do with my life, so I dropped it in frustration. -- <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Douglas_5faf.html" title="User:Jim Douglas">Jim Douglas</a> <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Douglas_038e.html" title="User talk:Jim Douglas"><sup><font color="green">(talk)</font></sup></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jim_Douglas_9618.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jim Douglas"><sub><font color="gray">(contribs)</font></sub></a> 19:57, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Edit conflict from 2 edits ago) Warnings less than a day old are generally still actionable/relevant, meaning that admins will take them into account when reviewing whether and for how long to block. Also, the warning that Vercalos mentions is also part of a discussion barely a couple hours old. Selectively archiving warnings should be disallowed. All or none to avoid misrepresenting the history. And of course it must be prominently, umambiguously linked from the main talk page to be considered an archive. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransUtopian_743a.html" title="User:TransUtopian">TransUtopian</a> 19:58, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In some cases, a {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}} is warranted; it depends on the type of vandalism. If in your judgment, it wasn't severe enough, then there's no problem. Also, not blocking a vandal after he/she stopped vandalizing is perfectly ok; the purpose of warnings isn't to <a href="../../../c/o/v/Cover_your_ass.html" title="Cover your ass">cover your ass</a> when blocking, but rather to make the vandal stop.

<dd>What Tito said. And please do remove the reports you find don't warrant blocking. You can say something along "list agin if vandalism resumes" (or whatever is appropriate) in the edit summary so the reporting user won't be afraid to relist the same IP later. If you are really in doubt about whether to block or not, just leave that report listed and let someone else handle it. At least that's what I do ;-).

<li>Nothing is wrong with being slow, but it is awful being sloppy or not consequent in blocking.</li>
<li>I recomended today a user IP for being blocked, which had a last warning message from January. I am in principle fine with the policy that users are not blocked after they have not edited for a while, but this should be pretty clear to them, too.

Many anons aren't vandals, someone reading might see a typo (say) and fix it, have to go through account creation etc. and they quite likely won't bother. Remember the project is about building an encyclopaedia not eliminating vandalism. (The latter of course helps the former but it shouldn't be at the cost of the former.)

A little while later the entry is cleared without a block or any intelligible explanation from the WP:AIV list (<i>"list not MT"</i> or <i>"List MT"</i>, while important for admins, don't tell the rest of us anything useful). Vandalism reports that don't end in blocks waste admins' time and and can discourage the reporting editors. Even when the right decision is to decline to block, 5 to 10 words of feedback may help reduce inappropriate reports in the future and cut time wasted by admins.</p>
<p>Those cases where an admin does not follow the published blocking criteria and declines to block raises the questions, <i>"Just how many 'last warnings' can you rack up before someone actually blocks you?"</i> and <i>" Can you beat your classmate's record for this sort of thing?"</i> Reduced Wikipedia credibility just encourages more of this stuff.</p>
<p>I know I can always make a "federal case" out of protesting individual WP:AIV decisions, but that wastes time and ruffles feathers. To me, the whole WP:AIV process is about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upholding Wikipedia's reliability as a source of information for its readers. Someone with thyroid cancer does not need the section on surgery replaced with "Joey has a little wiener".</li>
<li>Reducing volunteers' time wasted on cleaning grafitti and protecting theirs and others' work.</li>
<li>Maintaining a civil environment in which volunteer editors work motivated primarily by the reward of helping produce something enormously useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here are some small suggestions and observations from a rank-and-file Wikipedian:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider using informative edit summaries to let others (including the reporting editor) know why you're not blocking someone. The feedback will be useful. (Besides, we're all supposed to use informative summaries anyway, aren't we?)</li>
<li>Follow the published check-off criteria on the WP:AIV page. If they're too strict, then change them. In the meantime, not following the published criteria discourages editors from reporting and correcting vandalism. Furthermore, reports that don't end in blocks will have wasted your time as well dealing with them.</li>
<li>If you choose for some reason not to block a vandal who does meets the criteria, go ahead and at least warn them so that they do get some sort of warning (and it's on the record for other admins that, once again, they've damaged an article).</li>
<li>I can understand why AOL IP addresses might be problematic, but other shared IP addresses (for instance, schools) -- so what if they lose editing privilege for a few days, weeks or months? Not blocking them just prolongs the problem and makes more work for the cleaner-uppers. Blocking them might even draw some useful adult attention to the problem. Besides -- you're not blocking kids from reading Wikipedia -- just altering it.</li>
</ul>
<p>For every admin, there are 10 to 20 other busy, repeat editors beavering away on Wikipedia so we very much appreciate any help you can give us on this. Thanks, --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 17:10, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have seen shared ips (and individual ips, for that matter) blocked for one month after a lot of vandalism.

<dd>New warnings are only seen by the user when they finally load another Wiki page (and even then, only if they take the hint of the big orange "NEW TALK" banner). Because of this, I know that users will occasionally be allowed a brief "grace period" after their "final warning". If there's only one more incident of vandalism and then no vandalism up to the moment that an admin finally reads about it in WP:AIV, it's possible that the final warning actually worked and there's no need to block the user, at least, not this time.</dd>

<dd>If this is the case, I suggest spelling out these informal policies for editors on the <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> page so they better understand what will and won't happen. As for grace periods, I can see your point about vandals at the {{test0}}, {{test1}}, and {{test2}} levels but do we really owe them much grace beyond that? I'd rather save any grace we have for the folks that clean up after them.</dd>

<dd>As for punitive vs. preventive, I think those two concepts are closely intertwined.

<dd>I've only had my mop for a week, but my biggest surprise was that vandals often <i>do</i> stop after a test4.

<dd>Indeed. I have few AIV reports because I take my time to warn the user from test1 to test4, sometimes repeating test2 or test3 if I consider there could have been a mid-air collision between his vandalism and my warning. Since Firefox remembers what I have written in my edit summary box, I can say I have 38 test1, 10 test2, 6 test3, 6 test4 and 3 blatant. Spammers are the ones that don't learn. Once they notice they have been caught, they will spam as fast as possible until blocked, contrary to vandals who do this to get some fun. However, abusing the serious tag is not good. Just yesterday I suggested James086 in his peer review to not use the blatant tag in every revert he did. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 03:05, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is an interesting observation, but do we owe a higher responsibility vandals or to Wikipedia's readers? We also have to consider all the volunteer-editors busy cleaning up in the meantime as we try to help vandals see the error of their ways. I think the priorities should be on:
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, Wikipedia's reliability and readability for readers outside the community</li>
<li>Conserving volunteers' time for more useful and rewarding tasks than erasing graffiti.</li>

<dd>I personally always try to leave a message why I am refusing a block. The most common reason is that the vandal has stopped. Many (if not most) vandal IPs are shared or dynamic, and there is usually no point in giving someone who has already stopped an hour ago a 24hour block.--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konst.able</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/n/User_talk%7EKonstable_e0b7.html" title="User talk:Konstable">Talk</a></sup> 23:10, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Obviously personalities and block lengths vary between admins. It's very difficult for us to leave a descriptive edit summary, particularly with vandalism in progress. A lot of times, we do leave borderline reports on for further investingation. I turn down very few AIV reports and will block educational IPs with the same long time frames as regular IPs, often until the next academic year. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>Alphachimp</b></a> 01:59, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Gee, that seems way too long. I would figure that blocking an educational IP shuts down the ability of any student at that school to contribute to Wikipedia. This seems like using a sledgehammer to kill an ant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thus, I would think that the preventive nature of a block should shut down the IP long enough to stop the vandal from doing further vandalism (I figure 2-4 hours which will be enough to block until the end of the school day). If the vandal comes back the next day, then maybe block for 24 hours and if that doesn't work, then block for a week. Blocking until the end of the school year means that students can only read but not edit until the following year. To be willing to do this, you have to believe that students are far more likely to be vandals than valuable contributors. I don't think this attitude is in keeping with Wikipedia's philosophy towards anonymous editing.</dd>

<dd>While I'm not particularly sure on the issue of how long to block school IPs, I'd just like to add my own observations. I've seen several school IPs (90-95% of high schools / elementary schools and equivalents) whose contribs consisted purely of vandalism. Occasionally it's pretty intensive too. You even get conversations and insults between students going. Warning a school-based vandal almost <i>never</i> works, and the chance that the school will do anything about it seems to be close to nil. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">talk</a>)</small> 21:12, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Richard, I really do understand your point, and I considered it quite a bit when I was first blocking schools. You have to realize, though, that many of these grade schools (we are talking mostly about children age 6-12) have little-&gt;no good contributions. They come back to vandalize every day, during the middle of the day (EST), when many sysops are at work. AIV is constantly backlogged, and the vandalism never shows any signs of stopping. Much of it slips through the cracks to be discovered later on during the day, or, worse, through a PR nightmare. Blocking these IPs for long time frames shields us from damage and makes an extremely clear point that their vandalism will not be tolerated. Editors who have already established themselves within the community (e.g. they have a username they made at home) are not affected, as these blocks only influence anonymous users. Further, I see these blocks as promoting education. Children can view Wikipedia, but they are freed from a potential distraction from their classwork. Alphachimp 21:28, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I have also seen this kind of behavior and I agree that the school will probably not do anything about it. On the other hand, I have seen good work done by high school students who work as anonymous IPs and even one who has been nailed by collateral damage from autoblocks (<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHildanknight_74fc.html" title="User:Hildanknight">User:Hildanknight</a>). One important thing is to put a welcome message on the anon's talk page which both welcomes and warns against future vandalism. I would hope that the welcome might encourage some users to create accounts and thus be able to contribute without being affected by the block on the IP address. I would still argue for a series of blocks that gradually increase in length rather than going immediately for a "until the end of the school year" block.</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree. If I wanted to vandalize, I could probably get away with it for a while by gaming the system (i.e. going right up to the 4th warning and then backing off for a few days to a week and then coming back a week later for up to 4 warnings again. Fortunately, most of the students get their ha-has by vandalizing and don't actually learn enough about Wikipedia to know how to game the system in this way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, if time has elapsed, it's not always obvious if the vandalizer is the same person or a new one using the same IP. So, we're stuck giving him/her the benefit of the doubt and going through the 4 warnings again.</dd>

<dd>I think the issue is with the admins on the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism_ffcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism">Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism</a> page. Either they are outnumbered and overworked, or some of them are just being careless, such as the times they empty the list with "blocked" in the edit summary, and the user's don't get blocked. This is extremely frustrating when you have reported a user who's entire talk page is nothing but warnings, who has been vandalising for months, and <i>still hasn't been blocked</i>. It would save everyone a lot of time if each case were looked at carefully before being discarded. Most of the time one can tell if an ip address has been responsible for a string of vandalisms, as these are usually related somehow.<a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfacets_25b2.html" title="User:Sfacets">Sfacets</a> 23:41, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A computer database guy would say that there's no way to do a proper "two-phase commit" on these pages.

<dd>Oh, I can agree to that. I personally think 4 warnings is way too many. I would go for two warnings: three strikes and you're out for a short block. Each subsequent vandalism within a short period of time (24 hours) and the number of warning is dropped by one. That is, after a block, one warning is all you get. After a second block, you get no warnings, just an immediate block.</dd>
<dd>I wouldn't go for a whole 'nother round of four warnings each time around. That's just wasting everybody's time.</dd>

<p>I think Richard has misread the statement he quoted from the arbitration case. (Note that I've corrected the capitalization of the link he provided - I don't know if it's OK to edit others' comments that way.)</p>
<p>In 12.1.9 of the arbitration case, it is stated:</p>
<p>Users, including administrators, may choose whether to disclose their real-world identities on Wikipedia or to edit anonymously.</p>
<p>On Wikipedia, editing "anonymously" has two meanings. The first meaning is "editing without being logged into an account". The second meaning is "editing without disclosing personal information". The usage of the word "anonymously" in 12.1.9 refers to the second meaning, and it is reasonable to expect that the usage in 12.1.10 also refers to the second meaning. However, Richard thought that the usage in 12.1.10 referred to the first meaning.</p>

<dd>I don't understand -- I've seen blocks applied against schools before. Why accept vandalism from schools? I understand this may becoming from shared computers, but do we have an obligation to allow edits from these computers? Peruse the contributions from those accounts and see just how much they've really added to Wikipedia -- and how much they've taken away. Consided how much time has been wasted by volunteers (and former volunteers) cleaning this stuff up. Consider the effect on Wikipedia's readers of vandalism and blanking that doesn't get caught right away. Why put up with this stuff?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Should we stop warning these accounts with "You will be blocked" -- by this schools-are-sacred logic, we're threatening an outcome that's not supposed to happen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>How often do school administrators complain about IP blocks? The Foundation gets all sorts of complaints and threats every day in the mail but I'll bet school administrator complaints don't constitute a busy category. In fact, to the extent any are aware their schools IP addresses are getting blocked, they're probably glad of it.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Finally, when prolific editors quit, ongoing, ineffectively policed vandalism is among the reasons they cite.</dd>

Admins tried blocking this address for chronic vandalism in March 2006 but backed down after complaints by the school. The school even put its own "You better watch out -- we will track down vandals internally" on the talk page -- but the vandalism continued. A great collect of "last warnings" since then. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 14:08, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are actually a few that do. And actually, one of the school accounts in the UK was shut down due to an admin who is also an admin at the school. I forget which one. I don't see what you are proposing happening.

<dd>No way. Sometimes multiple people use the same computer. Even my own brother (who, granted, doesn't live with me) once confessed to vandalizing Wikipedia as a "test" to see what the response would be. I would hate for my IP to be indef blocked for that. Some people's IPs change every time they connect to the Internet, and we wouldn't want them to inherit a blocked IP. Also, for technical reasons this would either prevent account creation or be ineffective because vandals could create accounts to get around the block. --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_66a1.html" title="User:Ginkgo100">Ginkgo100</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/i/n/User_talk%7EGinkgo100_02a2.html" title="User talk:Ginkgo100"><i>talk</i></a> · <a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_Esperanza_6689.html" title="User:Ginkgo100/Esperanza"><font color="green"><i>e@</i></font></a></sup> 19:54, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's the point, one would be forced to craete an account if one wanted to continue vandalizing, thus making that much more wore for the vandal. This would, I think, cut down on the bulk of the nuisance edits. The idea is to get people to create accounts, get them inculcated into the wiki way, and grow them into productive members of the community. I love Wikipedia but I do feel that anon. IP editing will be its downfall. This is why one can't cite Wikipedia articles as a source for papers in many schools. As far as other people using the same computer, they can sign up for an account as well. None of this prevents anyone from reading the encyclopedia, just from vandalizing it.

<p><i>(copied from section above)</i></p>
<p>I'll speak to this issue. Right now, it's fairly difficult to simultaneously maintain (keep synchronized) the actiual blocks, the messages on the users's talk pages, and the contents of <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. A computer database guy would say that there's no way to do a proper "two-phase commit" on these pages. So you find that often, multiple admins are working on the same stuff, leading to the admins finding someone they're about to block being already blocked, etc. We really need to improve the way we manage this stuff so that we can avoid exactly these sorts of errors attributable to "updating the databases".</p>

<dd>A simple protocol would reduce an awful lot of duplication of effort. <i>Before</i> handling a case, simply mark it as "in-progress". The edit conflict system would thus ensure that no two admins were simultaneously working on the same case.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There would be slightly more work involved, but I suspect that the reduction in wasted effort due to two admins trying to handle the same complaint would more than counterbalance this.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clarification/expansion of instructions re "username" issues</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes I see an editor attempt to report a <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">username</a> violation on AN or ANI or elsewhere. I'm not referring to borderline username restrictions that would lead to "please change your name," but obviously unacceptable usernames (obscene, racist, "Wheels," etc.) that are due to be indef blocked on sight. The typical response on AN or ANI is that this sort of thing should be brought here to AIV, but there is nothing on the AIV instructions suggesting that this type of report would be welcome here. I'm not raising this because of some theoretical need for the instructions to be perfect, but because I think editors trying to report a problem may become discouraged if they are told to post a report here and then they find that doing so is inconsistent with the instructions atop the page (since there aren't going to be four warnings, etc.).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Avoiding duplicate reports</span></h2>
<p>I realize the admins tending this are overwhelmed. But a few times I reported someone because the blocking admin did not leave a "vandal now blocked" message on the vandal's userpage. I now know to check the block log first, but sometimes I forget. I suppose the best method would be to have a process that combines blocking with a template being automatically placed on the user's talk page. But unless and until that can be done, I suggest we:<br />
1. Add "check to see if user is already blocked - here's how you do that" to the "what to do before reporting here" instructions.<br />
2. Remember to, if at all possible, leave the "blocked" notice on the talk page when the block is set.<br />

<li><b>Oppose</b> No way. A "first strike policy" deprives sysops of the ability to make rational decisions about the potential impact of their blocks. Preventing account creation holds back thousands of good edits. We don't block AOL, because, amongst the vandalism, there are good contributions. The majority of our long-term shared IP blocks do not block logged in users, and many allow account registration. In short, such a policy is both ridiculous and onerous. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>Alphachimp</b></a> 16:34, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Since this has sadly turned into a poll, <b>oppose in the strongest possible terms</b>. Basically, this suggestion will mean permanent blocking of several well-known dynamic ISP IP pools, which reduces to us saying, "Your ISP sucks, so we are not going to let you contribute and help us, because we hate your ISP. If you want to help us, switch to someone else." Who the hell are we to demand someone switch IPs? Some users are just not able, whether for economic or geographic reasons, to switch service providers, and taking this attitude is shooting ourselves in our collective foot by not allowing them to help. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 04:59, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very Strong Oppose</b> Horrible idea. I never have figured out why users sometimes think we can have hard and fast rules. We can't. We just have too many admins (1000) to police and we have no one to police them. :) It just doesn't work. And besides, 1 strike? Come on. I don't like vandalism either (I am a semi-regular vandalism fighter) but I like strict rules even moreso. As for "fixing the AOL problem", various measures have helped that situation considerably. This just simply isn't needed. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 12:31, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Voting is evil etc. etc. This should be discussed if anything, but I doubt it's worth the effort. Admins have an amount of discretion anyway so if it was an issue and admin could block something fairly quickly anyway. We have certain "norms" regarding placing of warnings etc. but they are in no way binding, someone can vandalise once and be blocked instantly others may vandalise more with all the appropriate warnings and an admin may still choose not to block them. Admins are not automatons, they are expected to look at a situation and use discretion, not just say "rules is rules". This "policy" would achieve nothing, if there was an appetite to more generally block with less warnings admins can do so now within the bounds of the blocking policy (though they may find themselves under closer community scrutiny). Proposing policy is not a way to get admins to do your bidding, even if you could get 500 people to support this policy you couldn't enforce that admins have to... --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 07:25, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">16 recent vandals at the test4 level -- an analysis of their edits</span></h2>
<p>Over the last week or two, as I've come across vandals at the test4 level, I've gone back and looked at every one of their edits over a period of weeks or months. That's about 400 to 500 "Jack is a dork/Tony is gay/my school sux" edits I've read. I've made notes on their talk pages as to the percentage of those accounts' edits that were vandalistic. In almost every case it was &gt;75% and usually 90 to 100%. The remaining "useful" edits were usually very minor -- changing "teh" to "the" for instance. The links below will take you to my comments on each one:</p>

<p>The majority of this unscientific sample had been blocked before with little impact shown on their behavior. Most accounts are registered to schools. Most blocks that have been administrered have been very short and the IP addresses have been back at it within hours or days. Some have had multiple "last warnings" not yet followed by any block.</p>
<p>I did not compile any numbers, but my impression is that the average vandal makes about 25 vandalistic edits between blocks -- that's a lot of cleaning up our volunteer editors are having to mess with as we go through the 0-1-2-3-4 sequence of warnings. While it's been said here that the sequence is not rigidly required, my experience is that it's very hard to get admins at WP:AIV to block someone who's not cycled through the sequence. In fact, even when a vandal meets all the requirements listed on the WP:AIV page, in my experience, admins normally only block about 2/3 of the vandals I submit.</p>
<p>Because the first few blocks are relatively short, I'm guessing it takes aabout 100 to 150 vandalistic edits on average before the user gets a long enough block to really cut down his flow of vandalism. Once again, that's a lot of cleaning up that's going on the meantime.</p>
<p>Wikipedia's mission is to provide a free, comprehensive, reliable encyclopedia to millions of readers. The primary resource constraint it faces is volunteer editor time available to keep up with all the edits, making sure they're reasonably reliable. Volunteers' time is to Wikipedia what cash is to a business. I think we squander too much of it in our efforts to get chronic vandals to see the light. The 16 above certainly are never going to stop of their own volition from what I can tell.</p>
<p>I believe we owe a higher duty to our readers and our volunteers than we do to the folks at these accounts, even the once-in-a-blue-moon good faith editor. That occasional good faith editor can always establish an account or go edit Wikipedia anonymously from a public computer at some library.</p>
<p>One other comment -- I came across only one heavy duty AOL vandal during this time; I did not bother to warn him. I believe AOL vandals' share of mischief has dropped since I first became active earlier this year. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<dd>Vandalism is cleaned up very easily, since good faith editors outnumber vandals by more than 100-to-1. You mock good faith efforts to change "teh" into "the"- the truth is, those errors are harder to fix than just doing a history revert, or doing a rollback. Plus, bots working behind the scene handle a lot of vandalism too. The primary resource constraint of Wikipedia is not editor time to fix vandalism (vandalism currently stays on the page for an average of a few minutes as is) but rather the depth of the editor pool. If you look beyond the Western-centric computer science and pop culture articles you will find that we still need editors who have expertise in math, hard sciences, humanities, arts and editors who live in third-world countries. Thus the reason that we are "nice" to anons is that we know that a lot of people start out with stupid test edits, and eventually become valued contributors- and we need more contributors.

<dd>"Bots working behinds the scenes" are invaluable, but they miss a lot. And some introduce real problems when you get two different vandals back to back. They revert the second vandal's edits back to the first vandal's, then human editors start adding material to the article. This can happen with human reversions of vandalism, but it's much less common; humans usually revert back to a good copy. To revert that stuff -- if you actually catch it (so much slips by) -- you have to painstakingly go and separate out the good edits, revert to a good version, then reinsert the good edits. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<dd>Also, what kind of methodology do you use? Admins block something like 150 anons a day, and you seem to be taking the worst 16 vandals over the last few months. Of course this will be pretty bad, since you're taking the extreme worst cases! These are by no stretch of the imagination the typical anon vandal, and my personal experience is that a lot of typical vandals stop their malicious behaviour after test3 or test4.

When I first started monitoring that article there was damage which appeared to have been left uncorrected for months. What do you suppose happens to those articles which are not being watched by any good editors who are experienced with reversion? <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 09:27, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, this is true and I did not count those edits as vandalism. So if an IP account is producing 3 good edits for 25 bad edits, I've noted it in the talk page summaries I produced. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 15:09, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know about that. Changing teh into the involves spotting it, editing the page, and saving the page. Not a lot of work. Reverting an edit requires you to spot it, check the last unvandalised edit, revert to it, and post a message on the vandals talk page. Preferrably you should check other contributions by the same user (in case of vandalism), and if they've had a last warning since their last block you can post them over here as well. I really think the vandalism revertion takes quite a bit more work than fixing a little typo. --<a href="../../../l/i/j/User%7ELijnema_e954.html" title="User:Lijnema">Lijnema</a> 15:22, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, there are those shared IPs. Like with schools, where you can have a user talk page filled with warnings, last warnings, block messages, but where you <i>still</i> need a full warning cycle until you can get them blocked again. To me it just doesn't make sense, when someone's had a last warning, then that should "stick". If someone makes a few vandal edits, goes away for a month, the last warning doesn't count anymore, and they are free to vandalise some more, needing a new "last warning" before getting a block. Personally, I get a little annoyed at things like that. --<a href="../../../l/i/j/User%7ELijnema_e954.html" title="User:Lijnema">Lijnema</a> 18:17, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some of the above comments are missing the point about shared IPs. It may be the case that 90% of the edits from that IP are vandalism and many of the remaining edits are minor edits. However, you must consider the fact that we are not talking about one person here. There are some people who are trying to contribute if even in a small way and some people who are vandalizing. The question is... which is more important: blocking the vandalism or encouraging the contributors? Having spent some time fighting vandals myself, I understand how frustrating it is. Nonetheless, much good work is done by anon IPs. Short blocks encourage anon IP contributors to open an account. Long blocks will tend to discourage them altogether.<br />

<dl>
<dd>I don't believe you can distill it quite so far. It's not simply a case of either blocking the vandals vs. encouraging the contributors... vandalsim begets vandalism, and you also lose proven contributors after personal attacks and the sheer overwhelming number of vandals they revert. If it's distilled an either/or question, then the reciprocal becomes: Which is more important, allowing vandals or losing contributors? <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECMacMillan_ef05.html" title="User:CMacMillan">CMacMillan</a> 18:54, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Fighting vandalism takes a little bit more than just making a rollback.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>One must give a warning or even a block on the talk page of the vandal.</li>
<li>One must check the other contributions of the vandal and, if necessary, pick up the pieces and undo the damage</li>
<li>One must remove the vandal from the list of <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>.</li>
<li>If one blocks a vandal using a shared IP, one can expect an email from other users of that shared IP. Then one has to explain what has happened and why the action was taken.</li>
<li>One’s personal user page is always at danger getting vandalised.</li>
</ul>
<p>And still I, as most admins, am very reluctant to give long blocks (more than 24 hours) to shared IPs, such as schools, to avoid collateral damage. The whole process can be time consuming, one or more hours a day. And we all know how precious time is. Therefore I’m inclined to support a system where a repeat vandal, after previous final warnings in the past, even weeks ago, gets a block right away with ever increasing periods of time, without having to go through the whole process of warnings again (unless we’re dealing with a shared IP). Repeating final warnings over and over again makes a joke of the whole system. As the proverb says : “Surgeons cut, that they may cure”.<a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> 19:07, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While I can see your point about wanting to reduce vandalism, I am not sure that blocking anons or shared IPs is the best way to do it. I don't have any hard figures (and they'd probably be extremely difficult to get), but before proactive steps were taken against shared IPs, I'd want to see some hard and solid documentation on the proportion of good IP edits to vandal IP edits. The selection above is certainly interesting, but I think we can all agree it's not a representative sample.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For a first step, I wonder if anyone would be able to get such facts and figures together? <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 22:12, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As for "representative", as I said, it was the test3 or higher vandals that hit the rather broad, eclectic watchlist (history, geography, technology, science, health) of 170 articles I maintain. So, it's not "scientific" but probably not far off the mark (except for the arts, pop culture and politics). --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<dd>My parting comments:
<ul>
<li>I would not have invested all the time in the analysis above had I known how negatively it would be received.</li>
<li>I did not cherry-pick data -- these were the accounts with test3 or higher warnings that vandalized the articles on my large (170 articles), eclectic watchlist over several weeks. Once I started analyzing all of a vandal’s edits, I was looking at pages all over Wikipedia, not just my watchlist.</li>
<li>I hope readers will go back and actually look at the summaries I prepared on these talk pages.</li>
<li>I've tried to back my comments with hard data. I encourage others with differing views to do the same -- it can only shed more light and produce less heat on this surprisingly contentious issue.</li>
<li>I'm not out nuke all vandals. My data was about the high volume vandalistic accounts I encountered.</li>
<li>This is about chronic vandalism accounts of any sort — not anonymous vs named user editing.</li>
<li>There is some slight inaccuracy (&lt;5%) to what I've done -- for example, if someone changes a date from 1847 to 1849 in an article on a topic I don't know much about, is that vandalism? I just went off whether it was reverted. Also, some times, I'd get interrupted and lose my mental count -- so maybe I noted 23 or 25 vandalism edits instead of the actual 24.</li>
<li>I think some of the respondents underestimate the sheer frustration many less experienced rank-and-file editors such as myself (3k edits/6 months) feel — both with the problem and with the reluctance of the more established members of the Wikipedia community to take necessary steps to curb it.</li>
<li>My hunch is that there's a strong <a href="../../../p/a/r/Pareto_distribution.html" title="Pareto distribution">Pareto relationship</a>. Blocking a few chronic vandalism accounts for a very long time may subsantially reduce all vandalism -- as well as admin load (at WP:AIV) and editor load (clean-up).</li>
<li>Take a look at the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Wikipedia%7EExpert_retention_3051.html" title="Wikipedia:Expert retention">expert retention</a> article and its <a href="../../../e/x/p/Wikipedia_talk%7EExpert_retention_5d83.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Expert retention">talk page</a> as well as the list of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_who_are_not_currently_active_0765.html" title="Category:Wikipedians who are not currently active">Wikipedians who are not currently active</a>.</li>
<li>There's often more concern about maybe converting vandals into productive editors than keeping the productive editors it already has. Many of these vandals will only "convert" by aging into maturity, not by anything Wikipedia does. In the meantime, their actions have to be addressed.</li>
<li>Finally and most importantly, if Wikipedia's top priority is to make freely available useful, encyclopedic information to millions of English speakers around the world, then by extension, the community's first responsibility is to its readers, not its editors. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">"Wikipedia is not a blog, webspace provider, or social networking site"</a>. —<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">In praise of anons (slightly)</span></h3>
<p>I appreciate the enthusiasm for vandalhunting and protecting the integrity of Wikipedia that people above are espousing... <i>but</i> we must remember this is a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a>.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle of a wiki is that anyone can edit it. Easily. With a single click.</p>
<p>We encourage people to register an account and get involved <i>not</i> to set them apart from anons but to lock them in. We live or die by people volunteering to edit. If people don't, kiss the place goodbye.</p>
<p>Now, I never made a single edit before I got an account. But I think people will find that most people here <i>did</i> edit anonymously for a while. And they made their newbie mistakes (strictly speaking 'tests', but often misconstrued as 'vandalism').</p>
<p>So how many future good users would be swept away by any pogrom against anons? Most, I'd think. The test edits are done because people simply cannot believe that someone would put up a website and let just about anyone edit anything on it <i>and have the results immediately available</i>. I mean - where else can you do this to the work of others without being a scriptkiddie?</p>
<p>I'm perfectly happy to block a non-dynamic IP for a long period, treating it as a "naked" user account. But the slightest sign that the IP is shared or is dynamic, then no, I won't and most others won't. The collateral damage - the possibility of sending away the next Celestianpower or Sango123 or JzG - is just too high and too painful to contemplate.</p>
<p>Wikipedia editors tend to suffer from a "close the door behind me" mentality. Editors who started editing after they did are not as good editors as they are. Admins who were promoted after they were are not as good admins as they are. I have no judgment on whether this is true or not (well, yes I do, it's bollocks of the first order, but let's pretend I don't) and can understand the human reactions causing it.</p>
<p>We gain far more and better editors by welcoming anons and trapping them into becoming permanent account editors than we lose by frightening off people who see vandalism. The wish to close the door in some way upon any person because they happen to use the same computer as a vandal is understandable. It's also very flawed thinking. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 20:25, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand and agree with your viewpoint. But all that being said, we are not in an optimal situation for what you're talking about. Let me lay out some off-the-cuff example changes that would allow us to meet in the middle here:
<dl>
<dd>-<b>Easier vandalfighting documentation.</b> As I've said elsewhere, WP namespace is a nightmare. Too hard to find anything. There's a half-dozen different pages for each type of policy or issue. We need an "occasional editor friendly" set of documentation that gives people very clear guidelines for dealing with IP vandals, and <i>what to expect in return.</i> For example, "If you see blatant vandalism (addition of vulgar words), use X template on the person's userpage. Use X, Y, Z procedures/tools to rollback the changes. If the vandalism continues report the vandal at X page." And, we need to make sure that policy lines up on all relevant pages, so one page doesn't say "Warn 4 times," and another says "Warn once and report."</dd>
<dd>-<b>Easier integration procedures.</b> We need to have a set of very clear templates that allow occasional editors to approach IPs who are not necessarily blatant vandals, and say "Here's why you need to register, (protect yourself against blocking), and here's how to do it. Welcoming committee doesn't seem to be right approach here, but perhaps this could be a sub-project or something.</dd>
<dd>-<b>Agreeance between policy and admin knowledge.</b> Right now, some admins say follow the book to the letter, while others are saying that X, Y, Z situation (blatant vandals, for example) means we only have to warn once. If/when policy is simplified, admins need to be aware that the policies are what they are, and if you don't follow them then you put yourself at risk for recall/deopping, whatever. The point is, we need policies the <i>community as a whole</i> agrees upon. Right now it's clear that there are camps who believe the policies are too stringent on vandals, and camps who believe policies are not stringent enough. We need to meet in the middle.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Right now, I've seen three different discussions about similar subjects. RfA, Village Pump, and somewhere else that escapes me :D We need to put together a single discussion page on proposed policies dealing with vandals and hammer all this out. I don't know about everyone else, but I'm tired of all the ambiguity. And to those who say their is none? You're naive :) As I mentioned above, I personally have seen a number of admins arguing over the best way to deal with vandals. So clearly there is no community consensus. We may never have 100% agreement about what to do, but we need to at least get to a point where everyone is mutually unhappy ;) --<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolf530_e94b.html" title="User:Wolf530">Wolf530</a> (<a href="../../../w/o/l/User_talk%7EWolf530_e47e.html" title="User talk:Wolf530">talk</a>) 21:08, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry (no, really, it was just too good a line to miss... :) Still, the idea of honing a solution until everyone is unhappy with it is <i>entirely</i> within Wikipedia's noraml way of doing things ;o) And admins discussing an issue, even falling out over it, is not a reason to panic. Even admins are human beings with differing opinions just like everyone else. We just have a couple of extra buttons that the community elected us to have and a secret desire to assimilate the entire human race and upgrade all lower forms of life to Human2.0 in the shortest amount of time. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 21:38, 7 November 2006 (UTC) <small>Cabal members, remind me: am I allowed to mention in public point #3 of the charter?</small></dd>

<dd>As for the integration procedures: that is <i>exactly</i> the purpose of the Welcoming Committee. However, there is no reason why someone would be blocked if they're editing anonymously, unless they start doing something, so that doesn't really solve any issues.</dd>
<dd>However, most importantly, the community has decided time and time again to give administrators the leeway to decide <i>according to their judgment</i>.

<dd>Just a point that this discussion was <b>not</b> specifically about <b>anon</b> vandals. There are plenty of named vandals who get the whole gamut of <i>warn, warn, warn, now-I-mean-it-warn, Okay-now-warn, What-about-now?-warn, nothing</i>. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECMacMillan_ef05.html" title="User:CMacMillan">CMacMillan</a> 22:13, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>True -- it just so happens that my data is based on 16 test3 or test4 level accounts that vandalized pages on my watchlist and they happened to all be anon accounts. There are named accounts out there that vandalize -- they just didn't cross my path those weeks. They've crossed it plenty of other weeks.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There's also the special case of spam. I did not include all the spam accounts, <i>many of them named</i> (to avoid tell-tale red links), that I deal with as part of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_bdee.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam">WikiProject Spam</a>. One reason is because my edit list is skewed towards spam-fighting and I thought that work inappropriate to use in the material I presented yesterday. I actively work to reduce spam and I think for a group of amateur volunteers, the folks at the Wikiproject actually do a surprisingly good job of frustrating professional level search engine optimization people.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Some of those spammers get to spam3 or spam4. Many are named accounts. I have found admins to be generally supportive and responsive in blocking, often indefinitely, such accounts when needed. This even includes situations where there are multiple accounts producing the same spam but each with only one or two warnings -- admins will <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">IAR</a>, see that they've really gotten &gt;4 warnings collectively and impose a block.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As a general rule (with some exceptions) spammers actually do less damage, I think, than normal vandals. They typically add something parasitic at the margins, often as a link. Not good, but not as bad as removing or altering the core text of an article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I just happen to work on spam because with many years experience in technology, technology marketing and management, I think I understand how these people think and I can make a useful difference. (I don't think the way they do, but I've so often met the type in my career that I know the way they think). --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h2>
<p>I just recently reported an incident of vandalism which had been the first edit from a given IP address since it received a final warning given out five days ago. The reason given for removing the address from the list was no warning in the past five days. Could someone please explain how the policy applies here. I thought that, considering that this was the first edit from that address since it received the final warning, that the final warning would still be in effect. Where was I wrong? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 23:45, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>IP addresses are often assigned to different users. It's entirely possible that that user wasn't the user which received the original warning. Giving another final warning before reporting is good practice, typically, just to give them a chance to stop and contribute to the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Lord Deskana</a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">(swiftmend!)</a></small> 23:47, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While that is true, there are also many IP addresses which are static. So if all the edits over several days are vandalism, I think we should block the address for a long time. Even if an address is shared, there may be only one person among those using it who is editing and he may be a vandal. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 08:45, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I personally think that one should never block IP addresses indefinitely, and so I will tend to give harsh blocks to repeat offenders (6+ months for some bad vandals).

I use the IP now but in several hours, someone else is. So the reason we just can't block it indefinitely is because others will need to use it and possibly use it productively. As you'll see, the IP in question has many blocks on it, the most recent being a month long.

<dd>It is also now possible to undo edits other than the last one, provided that no intermediate changes conflict with the edit to be undone. The interface used is more akin to "manual revert" than rollback: on diff pages, an "undo" link should appear next to the "edit" link on the right-hand revision. When this link is clicked, the software will attempt to undo the change while preserving any changes since then, and will add the result to the edit box to be reviewed or saved. (Andrew Garrett, r17935–r17938, bug 6925)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is a new button labelled "(undo)" which appears on the right under the edit summary when you look at the diff in a vandal's contributions. This allows you to remove a change without disturbing subsequent changes to the same page. I just found out about it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vandalism from School IPs</span></h2>
<p>I'm not an admin and there's a lot of techy and process stuff about Wikipedia I don't know. One thing I do know is that I spend a lot of time patching up vandalism and of late seem to have "specialised" in Anon IP vandals.</p>
<p>Much of the time, these turn out to be schools or colleges and admins are reluctant to give lengthy blocks. This is completely understandable, but when there's a persistent problem, what is to be lost from blocking anon activity only from that IP? It means the vandal has to go through the bother of registering, reregistering and reregistering again each time he gets blocked, while useful edits can still be made from "proper" accounts.</p>
<p>Given my opening comments, it's likely that I've missed a good reason not to, but can't admins seeing a school with masses of vandal history and blocks impose lengthy or indefinite anon only blocks, to save people like me from a lot of repeat work? --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 17:01, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Two questions</span></h2>
<p>One of them is extremely nitpicky. In the directions, it says not to list them if "They have not vandalized very recently (past 24 hours), nor since the last warning ({{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest3_288f.html" title="Template:Test3">test3</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}})." The use of 'nor' to me implies that you would list them unless they met both those criteria. If you shouldn't list them if either one is true, it seems like you should use 'or' instead. Or it would be clearer to make them separate bullet points, though of course that would make it longer and less likely that people would read it. Picky, I know.</p>
<p>In other news, I've been removing vandals from the list if I notice that someone has blocked them but they're still up there. As a non-admin, should I not be doing that?

<dd>"Neither A nor B" and "not A nor B" both mean the same as "not (A or B)" which is the same as "(not A) and (not B)" as I use them in ordinary speech. In formal language, one would just say "A nor B". See <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_NOR_b91e.html" title="Logical NOR">Logical NOR</a>.</dd>
<dd>Certainly, I would not knowingly list an already blocked user. However, if I saw that someone else had listed one, I would not remove him from the list because the removal might be misunderstood as an act of vandalism (trying to cover up another act of vandalism). The extra effort required for the administrator to decide that my removal of it was justified would more than cancell out any benefit. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 11:15, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How about including a link to the Block Log in the edit summary? Then it's very easy to check they're really blocked. The other option would be for someone to code a bot to do the job - should be easy enough, check the page every 10 minutes or so and remove anyone that's been blocked for more than a minute (should give admins a chance to get back and remove it so they can explain it in the edit summary if they need to). I have no experience writing bots for Wikipedia, but I might give it a go - could be fun and it's a good excuse to refresh my knowledge of perl... --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 12:38, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>About the 'nor' thing, I see that you're right, JRSpriggs, but hopefully the way it is now is OK too? Also, about removing people being seen as vandalism, how likely of a possibility do you see that as being? Seems unlikely to me, especially if I'm the one that listed them in the first place (the usual case) and if I follow the edit summary format suggested by Agathoclea. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelldot_cc92.html" title="User:Delldot">delldot</a> | <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelldot_82a5.html" title="User talk:Delldot">talk</a></small> 15:23, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
